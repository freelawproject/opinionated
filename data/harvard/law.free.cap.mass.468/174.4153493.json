Because, under applicable immigration law, the conviction of a noncitizen of possession with intent to distribute cocaine makes deportation or removal from the United States automatic or \u201cpresumptively mandatory,\u201d see <em>Padilla </em>v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 368-369 (2010) (Padilla), citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i) (2006), we conclude that counsel\u2019s advice was constitutionally deficient and that the defendant suffered prejudice as a result. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Superior Court judge allowing the defendant to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\"><em>Background. </em>The defendant pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute a class B substance (cocaine), G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A <em>(a), </em>and received a sentence of probation. After a subsequent arrest for driving without a license, the defendant was taken into custody by immigration authorities; he then filed a motion for a new trial in the Superior Court seeking to withdraw his guilty plea. A Superior Court judge, who also had been the plea judge, conducted an evidentiary hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion, at which the defendant and his plea counsel both testified. The judge thereafter made detailed findings and issued a comprehensive memorandum of decision and order allowing the motion. He determined that, under applicable immigration law, it is clear that the conviction of a noncitizen of possession with intent to distribute cocaine makes deportation or removal from the United States automatic or \u201cpresumptively mandatory,\u201d see <em>Padilla, supra, </em>and therefore that counsel\u2019s advice was incomplete. The judge concluded that the defendant suffered prejudice as a result of counsel\u2019s constitutionally deficient advice, and allowed the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. The Commonwealth appealed, and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">We summarize the judge\u2019s findings, which he noted as being based on testimony he had determined to be credible, supplementing those findings with certain details from the record where they are consistent with the judge\u2019s findings and determinations of credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>The defendant was born in the Dominican Republic in 1983. He moved to the United States with his family when he was eleven years old and thereafter lived in Boston. All of the defendant\u2019s family members reside in the United States, including a daughter and, as of the date of the hearing, his pregnant wife. Although he is not a United States citizen, the defendant is now a lawful permanent resident of the United States. The defendant attended Boston public schools and graduated from Boston English High School with the aid of an individualized special needs education plan. After graduation, the defendant maintained steady employment with a parcel shipping company, where, at the time of his arrest, he had been employed for eight years loading boxes onto trucks. The arrest in this case was the first time that the defendant had been arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">In December, 2008, acting on a tip, Boston police officers approached a blue van and questioned two of its occupants; the defendant was the driver of the van. The passenger had an outstanding warrant and was arrested. The defendant agreed to accompany the officers to the police station, where police searched him, reaching into his groin area and recovering a small bag containing white powder. The defendant was then placed under arrest and ultimately indicted for trafficking in cocaine, twenty-eight grams or more, an offense that at that time carried a five-year mandatory minimum sentence of incarceration in State prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Defense counsel was aware that the defendant was not a United States citizen, and spoke with the defendant several times about deportation as a possible consequence of a conviction; counsel told the defendant that any guilty plea would make him \u201celigible for deportation,\u201d and that if the defendant agreed to the guilty plea he \u201cface[d] being deported and being denied reentry into the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defense counsel was unavailable on the day of the plea hearing, June 1, 2010, and the defendant appeared in court with an attorney who worked in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>defense counsel\u2019s office; substitute counsel did not discuss with the defendant the immigration consequences of his plea.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant pleaded guilty to the lesser included offense of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and was sentenced to two and one-half years\u2019 probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">In 2011, while on probation, the defendant was arrested for driving with a suspended license. Following his arrest, the defendant was taken into the custody of Federal immigration authorities, placed in removal proceedings, and ordered to be removed from the United States. He was awaiting removal in February, 2012, when he filed the motion for a new trial seeking to withdraw his guilty plea.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The memorandum in support of that motion states that the defendant \u201chas been living in the United States since he was a child and all his family and friends live here. Remaining in the United States is more important to him than any jail sentence he could have received under [the] charges.\u201d In his affidavit in support of the motion, the defendant avers, among other things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-6\">\u201cNeither [my defense counsel] nor substitute counsel told me that I would be subject to mandatory deportation if I entered a guilty plea to possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance, no matter what sentence I received. . . . If I had known that deportation would be mandatory, even when all I got was probation, I would have exercised my right to have the [previously filed] motion [to suppress] heard and then go to trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>Following an evidentiary hearing, the judge determined that, under <em>Padilla, supra </em>at 369, counsel\u2019s advice was incomplete and was constitutionally deficient in light of prevailing professional norms. In addition, the judge determined that the defendant had met his burden to establish that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>460 Mass. 30, 47 (2011) <em>(Clarke), </em>quoting <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59 (1985). The judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion and vacated the defendant\u2019s plea of guilty to the offense of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. The judge also reinstated that portion of the indictment charging the defendant with trafficking in cocaine, which had been dismissed with the Commonwealth\u2019s agreement under the terms of the plea arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Standard of review. </em>A motion to withdraw a guilty plea is treated as a motion for a new trial pursuant to Mass. R. Crim. R 30 (b), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Furr, </em>454 Mass. 101, 106 (2009). \u201cUnder Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (b), a judge may grant a motion for a new trial any time it appears that justice may not have been done. A motion for a new trial is thus committed to the sound discretion of the judge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>467 Mass. 336, 344 (2014). We review the allowance of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea to determine whether the judge committed an abuse of that discretion or a significant error of law. <em>Id. </em>We accept the judge\u2019s findings of fact if supported by the evidence, because the judge who heard the witnesses testify is the \u201cfinal arbiter on matters of credibility.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Schand, </em>420 Mass. 783, 787 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">2. <em>Adequacy of advice. </em>In determining whether counsel has provided constitutionally ineffective assistance, \u201c[w]e must determine \u2018whether there has been serious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel \u2014 behavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer \u2014 and, if that is found, then, typically, whether it has likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Clarke, supra </em>at 45, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). Satisfying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>this standard necessarily satisfies the standard established by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984). See <em>Clarke, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The Commonwealth argues that <em>Padilla, supra </em>at 368, 374, supports its claim that the defendant received correct advice when he was told that he was \u201celigible for deportation,\u201d and that if he pleaded guilty he would \u201cface being deported and being denied reentry into the United States,\u201d noting that \u201celigible for deportation\u201d was the language employed by the United States Supreme Court to describe the information that must be provided. The Court in <em>Padilla </em>used various terms to describe a defense attorney\u2019s obligation to give correct advice where the consequence of a guilty plea might make a defendant subject to adverse immigration consequences, but did not formulate the precise language that would satisfy that obligation, and understood that the content of the advice would depend on the circumstances. We conclude that advising a defendant faced with circumstances similar to those in this case that he is \u201celigible for deportation\u201d does not adequately inform such a defendant that, if he were to plead guilty (e.g., as here, to a charge of possession with intent to distribute cocaine), then, upon apprehension, his removal from the United States would be presumptively mandatory under Federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The decision in <em>Padilla, supra </em>at 360, begins its discussion of the issue with this statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">\u201cWe granted certiorari ... to decide whether, as a matter of federal law, Padilla\u2019s counsel had an obligation to advise him that the offense to which he was pleading guilty would result in his removal from this country. We agree with Padilla that constitutionally competent counsel would have advised him that his conviction for drug distribution made him subject to automatic deportation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">Padilla, a lawful permanent resident of the United States for more than forty years, had pleaded guilty to transporting a large amount of marijuana in his tractor trailer, \u201ccharges that made his deportation virtually mandatory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 359. According to Padilla\u2019s assertions, assumed to be true for purposes of his post-conviction appeal, his trial counsel had \u201cnot only failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>advise him of this consequence prior to his entering the plea, but also told him that he \u2018did not have to worry about immigration status since he had been in the country so long.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The Court\u2019s decision described the dramatic changes that had taken place in \u201c[t]he landscape of [F]ederal immigration law . . . over the last 90 years.\u201d <em>Padilla, supra </em>at 360. Earlier versions of applicable Federal law \u201cincluded a critically important procedural protection to minimize the risk of unjust deportation. . . . Thus, from 1917 forward, there was no such creature as an automatically deportable offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 361-362. After the 1996 effective date of amendments to the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, however, \u201cif a noncitizen has committed a removable offense . . . , his removal is practically inevitable,\u201d subject to limited exceptions. <em>Id. </em>at 363-364. In light of this historical backdrop, the Court concluded that the \u201cweight of prevailing professional norms supported] the view that counsel must advise her client regarding the risk of deportation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367. See <em>Clarke, supra </em>at 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">In Padilla\u2019s case, \u201cthe terms of the relevant immigration statute are succinct, clear, and explicit in defining the removal consequence of Padilla\u2019s conviction.\u201d <em>Padilla, supra </em>at 368, citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)(i). The statute \u201cspecifically commands removal for all controlled substances convictions except for the most trivial of marijuana possession offenses.\u201d <em>Padilla, supra. </em>Although recognizing that there undoubtedly will be situations in which the deportation consequences of a particular plea are unclear or uncertain, and counsel\u2019s duty more limited, the Court stated that \u201cwhen the deportation consequence is truly clear, as it was in this case, the duty to give correct advice is equally clear.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 369. In our decisions concerning counsel\u2019s duty to advise of immigration consequences since <em>Padilla </em>was issued, we have reiterated its holding. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sylvain, </em>466 Mass. 422, 436, 438 (2013); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marinho, </em>464 Mass. 115, 125-126 &amp; nn.12-13 (2013); <em>Clarke, supra </em>at 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Applying the standard articulated in those decisions to the circumstances here, we conclude that the terms of the relevant immigration statutes are succinct, clear, and explicit about the removal consequences for a noncitizen defendant convicted of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>possession with intent to distribute cocaine. Pursuant to Federal statute, an alien \u201cshall, upon the order of the Attorney General [of the United States], be removed\u201d if he or she is convicted of an aggravated felony, see 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (2006), and the defendant\u2019s conviction of \u201cpossession with intent to distribute a class B controlled substance, G. L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A, . . . [is an] aggravated felon[y].\u201d <em>Clarke, supra </em>at 32 n.2. Under applicable Federal law, the defendant would have virtually no avenue for relief from deportation once convicted of that crime. See <em>Moncrieffe </em>v. <em>Holder, </em>133 S. Ct. 1678, 1682 (2013) (Federal statute \u201cprohibits the Attorney General [of the United States] from granting discretionary relief from removal to an aggravated felon, no matter how compelling his case\u201d). Counsel therefore was obligated to provide to his client, in language that the client could comprehend, the information that presumptively mandatory deportation would have been the legal consequence of pleading guilty. Stated differently, counsel needed to convey that, if Federal authorities apprehended the defendant, deportation would be practically inevitable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Telling the defendant that he was \u201celigible for deportation\u201d and that he would \u201cface deportation\u201d was not adequate advice because it did not convey what is clearly stated in Federal law. Advice that one is \u201celigible\u201d for deportation conveys that the law requires additional conditions to be met before an individual could be removed and allows for the exercise of discretion in determining whether those conditions are met.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Such advice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>does not convey what was the case here: that all of the conditions necessary for removal would be met by the defendant\u2019s guilty plea, and that, under Federal law, there would be virtually no avenue for discretionary relief once the defendant pleaded guilty and that fact came to the attention of Federal authorities.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Because counsel failed to \u201cprovide the defendant with accurate advice concerning the deportation consequences of pleading guilty,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sylvain, supra </em>at 438, given that the information did not convey that deportation would be the legal consequence of a conviction, counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, thus satisfying both the Federal and State performance prong. See <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, 466 </em>U.S. 668, 687 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, 366 </em>Mass. 89, 96 (1974). See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bonilla, </em>637 F.3d 980, 984 (9th Cir. 2011) (defendant convicted of aggravated felony \u201centitled to know more than that it is possible that a guilty plea could lead to removal; he is entitled to know that it is a virtual certainty\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sandoval, </em>171 Wash. 2d 163, 167, 173-174 (2011) (advice to defendant convicted of aggravated felony that he \u201cwould not be deported immediately,\u201d and would have time to retain immigration counsel, deficient because it suggested deportation was \u201cremote possibility\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">3. <em>Prejudice to the defendant. </em>We next consider whether counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defendant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In <em>Clarke, </em>we stated that where a defendant claims that counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>ineffective assistance induced him to plead guilty, the defendant must demonstrate \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 46-47, quoting <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59 (1985). A defendant must provide an affidavit to that effect, and in addition, \u201che must \u2018convince the court that a decision to reject the plea bargain would have been rational under the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Clarke, supra </em>at 47, quoting <em>Padilla, supra </em>at 372. A showing that a decision to reject the plea bargain would have been rational in the defendant\u2019s circumstances may be accomplished in one of three ways. The burden is on the defendant to show</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\u201cthat (1) he had an \u2018available, substantial ground of defence,\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, supra </em>at 96, that would have been pursued if he had been correctly advised of the dire immigration consequences attendant to accepting the plea bargain; (2) there is a reasonable probability that a different plea bargain (absent such consequences) could have been negotiated at the time; or (3) the presence of \u2018special circumstances\u2019 that support the conclusion that he placed, or would have placed, particular emphasis on immigration consequences in deciding whether to plead guilty. <em>Hill </em>[v. <em>Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. at 60].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\"><em>Clarke, supra </em>at 46-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Based on the judge\u2019s findings, the defendant proffered two independently sufficient grounds that established prejudice. First, the judge\u2019s findings establish that, by waiving consideration of his motion to suppress, the defendant waived \u201ca substantial ground of defence.\u201d In this connection, the judge found that conviction after trial was not a \u201cnear certainty\u201d because the defendant\u2019s motion \u201chad significant support in the evidence and law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Second, the judge\u2019s findings establish the presence of \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d showing that the defendant \u201cplaced, or would have placed, particular emphasis on immigration consequences in deciding whether to plead guilty.\u201d The judge found that the defendant was \u201cvery concerned\u201d not only about the risk of a five-year mandatory sentence of incarceration, but also about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>the risk of deportation, and that the defendant \u201chad a lot to lose if he were to be deported\u201d because he had been in the country since he was eleven years old, his family was in Boston, and he had maintained steady employment in the Boston area. We reject the Commonwealth\u2019s argument, made to the motion judge, that the defendant was not prejudiced notwithstanding these circumstance's because he \u201cgot a very good deal\u201d: he received straight probation when he was facing a mandatory minimum sentence of five years of incarceration. If an assessment of the apparent benefits of a plea offer is made, it must be conducted in light of the recognition that a noncitizen defendant confronts a very different calculus than that confronting a United States citizen. For a noncitizen defendant, preserving his \u201cright to remain in the United States may be more important to [him] than any jail sentence.\u201d <em>Padilla, supra </em>at 368. Thus, a determination whether it would be rational for a defendant to reject a plea offer \u201cmust take into account the particular circumstances informing the defendant\u2019s desire to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Picca, </em>97 A.D.3d 170, 183-184 (N.Y. 2012). See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Orocio, </em>645 F.3d 630, 645 (3d Cir. 2011), abrogated on other grounds by <em>Chaidez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>133 S. Ct. 1103 (2013) (rational for noncitizen defendant to go to trial to retain chance of avoiding automatic deportation, even where trial involved serious risk of lengthy incarceration and deportation); <em>Denisyuk </em>v. <em>State, </em>422 Md. 462, 488 (2011) (same); <em>State </em>v. <em>Sandoval, </em>171 Wash. 2d at 175-176 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Because the record provides a sufficient basis to support the judge\u2019s determination that the defendant met his burden to establish \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial,\u201d <em>Clarke, supra </em>at 47, quoting <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. at 59, there was no abuse of discretion in the allowance of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial seeking to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">\n<em>Order allowing motion for new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-7\">We acknowledge the amicus brief submitted by the Immigration Impact Unit of the Committee for Public Counsel Services in support of the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b190-7\">The judge heard testimony that defense counsel provided the defendant with the name and telephone number of an immigration lawyer. The judge was unable to determine from the testimony whether the defendant actually spoke with the immigration lawyer and received specific advice on the question of deportation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b191-7\">During the plea colloquy, the judge gave the defendant the immigration consequences warning required by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D. The defendant also signed a printed waiver of rights form containing this information. In his decision allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea, the judge observed correctly that such warnings are \u201cnot an adequate substitute for defense counsel\u2019s professional obligation to advise her client of the likelihood of specific and dire immigration consequences that might result from such a plea.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>460 Mass. 30, 48 n.20 (2011), citing <em>Padilla </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>559 U.S. 356, 374 n.15 (2010) <em>(Padilla).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b191-8\">An order for the defendant\u2019s removal from the United States entered on March 1, 2012. In his brief, the defendant asserts that, after the allowance of his motion to withdraw his guilty plea, he filed a motion for relief with the board of immigration appeals. Subsequently, the removal order was vacated and he was released from the custody of the United States Department of Homeland Security.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b195-6\">We do not dictate the precise language that must be employed, as each case will present different circumstances; for example, information given to an educated client who speaks English as his first language may take a different form when the client has a limited ability to comprehend or understand English. And, although the discretionary avenues to avoiding deportation are extremely limited, there may still be individuals who could avail themselves of those avenues. For example, a noncitizen who is convicted of an aggravated felony and shows a likelihood of torture upon deportation may be granted \u201cwithholding of removal, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A), and deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), Art. 3, Dec. 10, 1984, S.

There is a significant difference, for example, in a lawyer\u2019s advice to a client that the client faces five years of incarceration on a charge, as compared to advice that the conviction will result in a five-year mandatory minimum prison sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b196-14\">Although the Commonwealth states in its brief that it \u201cis not challenging the judge\u2019s ruling on prejudice,\u201d a concession does not preclude our independent examination of the issue.

I disagree with the court that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>behavior of the defendant\u2019s attorney with regard to his obligation to apprise his client of the potential immigration consequences of pleading guilty to a reduced charge of possession with intent to distribute cocaine fell \u201cmeasurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). If anything, under the circumstances, the attorney\u2019s attention to this matter exemplified an earnest and reasonable attempt at alerting a client intent on avoiding a jail sentence (on the five-year mandatory minimum trafficking charge) that there likely would be deportation consequences of which the defendant needed to be aware before committing to the plea bargain offered by the Commonwealth. The testimony of plea counsel, Attorney Peter T. Mara\u00f1o, at the motion hearing, which the judge found to be \u201ctruthful and accurate on all the material points,\u201d bears this out.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Shortly before Attorney Mara\u00f1o began representing the defendant, the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Padilla </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>559 U.S. 356 (2010), in which it \u201cunderscore[d] how critical it is for counsel to inform [his] noncitizen client that he faces the risk of deportation\u201d and, consequently, held that the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires that \u201ccounsel must inform [his] client whether his plea carries [such] a risk.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 373-374. Because Mara\u00f1o was aware that his client was not a citizen, he familiarized himself with the <em>Padilla </em>decision and during the course of the representation also consulted with an immigration attorney. Mara\u00f1o then \u201cspoke with the defendant several times about deportation as a possible consequence of a conviction,\u201d and told him that \u201cany guilty plea would make him \u2018eligible for deportation\u2019 \u201d and that \u201che would be subject to the ramifications of deportation.\u201d Mara\u00f1o also told the defendant that he was not an immigration lawyer, and was not fully familiar with immigration law. Consequently, he advised the defendant to seek the advice of such a lawyer so that he could better evaluate the risk of deportation. He provided the defendant with the name and telephone number of the immigration lawyer with whom he had also consulted on that subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">When the date for a hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence approached, Mara\u00f1o learned that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Commonwealth would accept a plea to a reduced charge of possession with intent to distribute, thus eliminating the risk of a five-year mandatory minimum sentence on conviction. Mara\u00f1o and the assistant district attorney understood that the plea offer would not be available after the hearing on the motion to suppress. Mara\u00f1o explained this to the defendant, and testified that he advised him, \u201c[I]f you accept a plea, you face being deported from the country, denied admittance or naturalization, denied reentry, denied citizenship or naturalization.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mara\u00f1o then requested at least one continuance of the hearing on his motion to suppress so that the defendant could fully consider the guilty plea offer and Mara\u00f1o\u2019s advice regarding the deportation consequences of pleading guilty, and could seek further advice from the immigration lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Before the next scheduled date for the motion to suppress, the defendant advised Mara\u00f1o that he wanted to accept the guilty plea offer. Mara\u00f1o testified that the defendant understood that he would be \u201celigible for deportation,\u201d but \u201chis foremost concern was not going to prison.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">At his guilty plea hearing, the judge further informed the defendant of the possibility of immigration consequences resulting from his guilty plea, as required by G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 29D. After signing a waiver of rights form, the defendant pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a term of probation. Deportation proceedings were not commenced. The following year, the defendant was arrested on a new offense, the office of the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement was notified, and deportation proceedings were initiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">I do not understand the ruling of <em>Padilla </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>or the subsequent rulings of this court on the subject to prescribe a certain form of words that an attorney must use in order to fall within the range of \u201creasonable professional assistance\u201d required of counsel by the Sixth Amendment. <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>466 U.S. 668, 688-689 (1984). There was no inaccuracy or soft pedaling of advice here. Compare <em>State </em>v. <em>Sandoval, </em>171 Wash. 2d 163, 173 (2011) (\u201crequired advice about immigration consequences would be a useless formality if, in the next breath, counsel could give the noncitizen defendant the impression that he or she should disregard what counsel had just said about the risk of immigration consequences\u201d). To require more of criminal defense attorneys in the circumstances faced by Mara\u00f1o approaches very close to requiring them to be immigration attorneys. That is not the standard. If the court wishes to mandate specific safe harbor words such as \u201cpractically inevitable\u201d or \u201cpresumptively mandatory,\u201d it is free to do so, but it should not reflect that requirement back on those who have given reasonable advice, sufficient to alert their clients to the real prospect of immigration consequences as they balanced those future possible consequences against their present liberty.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">I would add that deportation has not been demonstrated to be inevitable in the aftermath of every plea of guilty that creates either \u201celigibility\u201d or even a \u201cpresumption\u201d of deportation. That deportation was ultimately sought after the defendant\u2019s subsequent arrest is hardly dispositive, and leaves unanswered whether such action ever would have been brought had he not been ensnared in another crime. As the court admits by its own choice of words, deportation is not \u201cmandatory\u201d or \u201cinevitable.\u201d Indeed, the deportation proceeding is contingent on there being an \u201corder\u201d of removal from the Attorney General of the United States, and there still remain discretionary avenues to avoid deportation, albeit limited ones.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Because I view the efforts of Attorney Mara\u00f1o with regard to apprising his client of the immigration consequences he faced by pleading guilty to be professionally reasonable, I would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>conclude that he was not ineffective, and would reverse the grant of a new trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b200-8\">During the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial, the judge asked Attorney Mara\u00f1o what his best memory was of the \u201cwords [he] used in advising [the defendant] on immigration matters.\u201d In response to the question, Attorney Mara\u00f1o testified: \u201cMy best memory is that if you accept a plea, you face being deported from the country, denied admittance or naturalization, denied reentry, denied citizenship or naturalization, and . . . that you should seek an immigration attorney\u2019s advice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b201-7\">If there are limited exceptions to the \u201cpractically inevitable\u201d result of deportation, do such exceptions need to be explored by defense counsel with the defendant as well to ensure adequate and accurate advice? And will a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel lie if a defendant proceeds to trial (and is convicted and sentenced) based on advice that fails to include a complete and accurate explanation of all possible exemptions that might be available?</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b202-5\">There are precious few appellate cases focused on the particular phrasing of immigration advice sufficient to pass constitutional muster. In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Orocio, </em>645 F.3d 630, 641-643 (3d Cir. 2011), abrogated on other grounds by <em>Chaidez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>133 S. Ct. 1103 (2013), the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit concluded that counsel was ineffective for failing to give any advice to his client regarding the adverse immigration consequences of pleading guilty to a controlled substance offense that it found would \u201cresult in near-mandatory removal.\u201d Similarly, in <em>Denisyuk </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>422 Md. 462, 482 (2010), the Maryland Supreme Court concluded that counsel was ineffective for providing no advice regarding the immigration consequences of a guilty plea to assault charges.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
