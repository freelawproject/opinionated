I do not construe the tripartite agreement of May 3, 1909, as an'assignment by the appellant to the trustees of this'interest. Although, for the considerations appearing in the agreement, and so long as they perform its obligations, the trustees are to be subrogated to appellant\u2019s interest in the income, there are no words of transfer of the estate itself, and, should the trustees at any time fail in their obligations, no reconveyance to appellant would be necessary to enable her to claim under the terms of the will. Furthermore, if the words of the agreement were construed as sufficient in themselves to work an assignment of appellant\u2019s beneficial interest, the instrument would be void on its face and unenforceable. Real Property Law (Consol. Laws, c. 50) \u00a7 105; Laws 1903, c. 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-12\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> To set it aside or avoid its provisions, appellant would not need the aid of a court of equity; for the paper is a nullity, and must be so regarded, whether offered to a court of equity or to a court of law. I find no authority for the proposition that the surrogate has no jurisdiction to consider the instrument for the purpose of determining whether or not on its face it is void. To do this, no function of a court of equity need be invoked. The distinction between an instrument \u201capparently valid\u201d (Matter of Randall, 152 N. Y. 508, 520, 46 N. E. 945), and one apparently invalid, needs no elaboration. It is urged, however, that the exceptions sought to be filed by the appellant to the account of the trustees are on their face frivolous. Were this true, it might be so determined by this court, and it would be unnecessary to s$nd the matter back to the surrogate; but a careful examination of the exceptions and the account suffices to show that, whatever may be the-\"r merit in fact, they are not on their face frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-13\">The decree should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the proceedings remitted to tbe Surrogate\u2019s Court, with directions to proceed upon the appellant\u2019s objections. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
