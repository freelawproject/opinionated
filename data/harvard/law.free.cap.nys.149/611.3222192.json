J.</author>\n<p id=\"Acn\">The plaintiff has recovered a verdict for the negligence of the defendant in the erection and the maintenance, of its sign with the legend \u201cRailroad Crossing Look Out for the Cars\u201d at a road crossing of defendant\u2019s railway tracks. He complains that when he was about to drive his vehicle over the tracks his horse took fright at the rattling or creaking of the sign, ran away, and threw the plaintiff out and into a hole distant about 8 feet from the road. The plaintiff offered proof that the pole of the sign was slightly loose in the earth, that the braces were loose, the nails had worked loose, and the boards of the sign were \u201cshaky,\u201d so that the play of the wind caused them to rattle or to creak. He also offered proof that on divers other occasions other horses had been more or less thus frightened, and that about a year before the witness Banks had told the section boss that he had better attend to the sign, as it might frighten some <em>one\u2019s </em>horse. The casualty occurred about 11 o\u2019clock of a \u201cblustery\u201d December night, when, according to the plaintiff and his witnesses, the wind was very high, and blew \u201cterribly at spells.\u201d Both the plaintiff and his sister, who was his companion, testify that they did not hear any noise as they approached the crossing, but only as they attempted'to cross it, when, according to the plaintiff, there came \u201ca sudden gust of wind which rattled the signpost.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-11\">[U] The obligation of the defendant was that of ordinary care and caution. O\u2019Sullivan v. Knox, 81 App. Div. 438, 80 N. Y. Supp. 848, modified as to form-of order only, and affirmed 178 N. Y. 565, 70 N. E. 1104. ' If the result of this creaking or rattling was not within the ken of reasonable prudence and foresight, then proximate cause was not established. Rowley v. Newburgh Light, Heat &amp; Power Co., 151 App. Div. 65-71, 135 N. Y. Supp. <em>944; </em>Beetz v. City of Brooklyn, 10 App. Div. 382, 41 N. Y. Supp. 1009. I think that the defendant under its said obligation should not reasonably have apprehended what Spring, J., in O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s Case, supra, aptly terms the- \u201ccorresponding occurrences,\u201d and that therefore the verdict was not justified by the evidence. O\u2019Sullivan v. Knox, supra. See, too, McKenzie v. Waddell Goal Co., 89 App. Div. 415, 85 N. Y. Supp. 819, citing Lilly v. N. Y. c: &amp; H. R. R. R. Co., 107 N. Y. 566, 14 N. E. 503; Saverio-Cella v. Brooklyn Union El. R. R. Co., 55 App. Div. 98, 66 N. Y. Supp. 1021.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-15\">I advise a reversal of the judgment and the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-16\">Judgment and order reversed, and new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
