The defenses are that such covenants have become inoperative, unenforceable, and obsolete by reason of the radical changes of the locality and neighborhood and of the conditions thereof, and waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-18\">The record indicates that this invocation of the doctrine of Trustees of Columbia College v. Thacher, 87 N. Y. 311, 41 Am. Rep. 365, will be the principal defense. Such an issue cannot well be tried by affidavits, and should not be unless cogent circumstances almost compel such course. The general rule in this court is not to disturb this kind of an order. Smith &amp; Sons Carpet Co. v. Ball, 137 App. Div. 101, 122 N. Y. Supp. 187; Heim v. N. Y. Stock Exchange, 138 App. Div. 96, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>122 N. Y. Supp. 872. On the other hand, the plaintiff, having thus halted the defendants, should not be allowed to rest; and if he is not ready for trial at the first possible moment, the defendants should be heard for a vacation of this order, which is now affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
