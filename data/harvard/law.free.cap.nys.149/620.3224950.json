Burch, at the Hudson Trust Company, in the city of. New York, the sum of $2,500 four months after said date, further proceeds to allege:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-10\">\u201cThat the defendants George B. Burch and Sarah M. Burch thereafter, and before maturity of said note, for value, indorsed the one-half interest therein to and delivered the same to this plaintiff, who is now the owner and holder thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-11\">By section 62 of the Negotiable Instruments Naw it is required that an indorsement must be of the entire instrument, and that an indorsement which purports to transfer to the indorsee a part only of the amount payable is declared not to operate as a negotiation of the instrument. By section 60 of the same law \u201cnegotiation\u201d is defined as the transfer from one person to another of an instrument in such manner as to constitute the transferee the holder thereof. Where an instrument is payable to order, it is negotiated by the indorsement of the holder completed by delivery. By section 2 of the same law the holder is defined as the payee or indorsee of a bill or note who is in possession of it, or the bearer thereof. In King v. King, 37 Mise. Rep. 63, 74 N. Y. Supp. 751, affirmed 73 App. Div. 547, 77 N. Y. Supp; 40, appeal dismissed 172 N. Y. 604, 64 N. E. 1122, it was held that in an action at law upon a promissory note the obligation of the defendant is single, and cannot be divided into parts, and that only one action can be maintained for the debt in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-12\">The present action being one at law, and containing no averments or prayer for relief appropriate in an action in equity, it follows that the complaint set forth no cause of action, and that the order appealed from should therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the demurrers of the defendants sustained, with $10 costs, with leave to the plaintiff to serve an amended complaint within 20 days upon payment of said costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
