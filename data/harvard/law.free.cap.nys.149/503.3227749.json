The cause of action alleges that the plaintiff\u2019s assignor, one Galloway, was induced by the fraudulent representations of the defendant to become an indorser upon a promissory note signed by the defendant, that the defendant failed to pay the note, and that the plaintiff\u2019s assignor was compelled to pay the same. The answer alleges a cause of action in contract on behalf of the defendant against plaintiff\u2019s assignor.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-24\"><bracketnum>[1,2]</bracketnum> The court below, by refusing to sustain the demurrer'to the counterclaim, has held that it was sufficient. It is clear from a reading of the complaint that the cause of action is not upon the note, but for damages caused by the false and fraudulent statements alleged to have been made by the defendant to plaintiff\u2019s assignor to induce him to become an indorser thereof. Such a cause of action is assignable. Keeler v. Dunham, 114 App. Div. 94, 99. N. Y. Supp. 669. And it does not follow that, because it was assigned by Galloway to the plaintiff, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>thereby became, or was intended to become, ex contractu. The defendant\u2019s separate defense and counterclaim is one for breach of contract against plaintiff\u2019s assignor, and is not one permitted by section 501 of the Code of Civil Procedure, as it is not \u201ca cause of action arising out of the contract or transaction, set forth in the complaint as the foundation of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, or connected with the subject of the action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-3\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and demurrer sustained, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
