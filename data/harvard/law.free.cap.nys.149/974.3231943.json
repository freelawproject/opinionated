Collins did not appeal, but this defendant and Mooyer and Marston did, and gave security. On July 27,1914, Mooyer and Marston effected'a compromise with plaintiff, paying her about one-fifth of the face of the judgment, and taking from her a general release under seal, which contained the following clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1012-20\">\u201cNothing in this release shall be so construed as to.release any right or claim or judgment that I may have against the defendant 0. Adelbert Becker or against the defendant Thomas Oollins, either by reason of the judgment aforesaid or by any other reason whatsoever; and it is expressly understood that I reserve to myself all my right in and to the said judgment and thd claim upon which the said judgment was obtained against the said O. Adel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>bert Becker and Thomas Collins, and that it is not my intention to release them in any manner whatsoever.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1013-3\">Plaintiff at the same time executed a satisfaction piece of the judgment as to said Mooyer and Marston, and signed a consent to discontinue the action as to them. Both of these documents contained a reservation similar in language and effect to that contained in the general release quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-4\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The defendant Becker now moves that the judgment be canceled as to him upon the ground that defendants, if liable at all to plaintiff, were liable as joint tort-feasors, and that the release of one joint tortfeasor by an instrument under seal operates as a release of all. That this is the general rule is unquestioned, but the rigor of the rule is relaxed when, as in the present case, the creditor expressly reserves the right to pursue the joint tort-feasors who have not been in terms released. The rule applicable in such a case is stated by the Court of Appeals to be that where the release contains no reservation it operates to discharge all the joint tort-feasors; but where the instrument expressly reserves the right to pursue the others, it is not technically a release, but a covenant not to sue, and they are not discharged. Gilbert v. Finch, 173 N. Y. 455, 66 N. E. 133, 61 L. R. A. 807, 93 Am. St. Rep. 623; Walsh v. N. Y. Cen. &amp; Hudson River R. R. Co., 204 N. Y. 58, 97 N. E. 408, 37 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1137.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">. <bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The appellant, conceding the rule as above stated, insists that it is inapplicable to the present case, because here the release was executed after judgment, and therefore cannot be construed as a covenant not to <em>sue, </em>which is the word used in the cases cited. This is too narrow an application of the rule. To so apply it would be to sacrifice its reason to its language. What the rule means is that a release with such a reservation will be construed as a covenant not to further pursue the party who has been released. Furthermore, upon the rendition of the judgment, the defendants\u2019 obligation to plaintiff was transformed technically into a contract liability. The foundation of the claim may have been a tort, but the judgment created a joint debt, to which sections 230 to 233 of the Debtor and Creditor Law apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">The order appealed from must be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
