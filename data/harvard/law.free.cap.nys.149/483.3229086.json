The complaint alleges that the plaintiff was injured by the careless operation of an automobile owned by the defendant, and that the same at the time of the accident was operated by a chauffeur who is named.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-23\">Respondent\u2019s citation of McCann v. Davison, 145 App. Div. 522, 130 N. Y. Supp. 473, is not in point. That case holds merely that <em>proof </em>of ownership gives rise to a presumption of control. The case at bar is concerned with pleadings. It is not denied that defendant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>sought to be held liable, not because of his ownership of the automobile, but because at the time of the accident he was in operation or control thereof, either in person or by his servant. This, however, is not alleged. On the contrary, plaintiff seems to have studiously avoided the allegation that the chauffeur in operation thereof at the time of the accident was the servant of the defendant. In view of the pleader\u2019s failure to insert the necessary allegation, and, indeed, of the plain intimation that he purposely avoided the making thereof, the complaint fails to state a good cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted, with $10 costs, and complaint dismissed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
