That section provides, among other things, that a restaurant keeper who uses or serves any oleaginous substance as a substitute for butter shall put plainly upon the bill of fare, if there is one the words, \u201cOleomargarine used here,\u201d and have put up conspicuously, in different parts of each room where such meals are served, signs, in places where they can be easily seen and read, - \u201cOleomargarine used here,\u201d in letters at least two inches in length and so printed as to be easily read by guests or boarders.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-18\">The defendant herein kept a restaurant and served meals, and upon the bill of fare were the printed words referred to in the statute; but the proof was uncontradicted that no signs, as required by that section, were posted anywhere in said restaurant. Apparently out of sympathy, the court below gave judgment in favor of the defendant. Judgments of this character cannot be upheld. That the enforcement of the law may sometimes, or even often, work hardship, is no reason why the courts should condone its plain violation. We must enforce the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>as enacted by the Legislature. The purpose of the law under discussion is obvious, and its provisions should be fully complied with; otherwise a penalty attaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-3\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
