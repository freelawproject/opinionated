The plaintiff was engaged in doing interior painting in one of the defendant\u2019s shops. In doing this work a platform had been erected, and ladders were used to reach' the platform. Stepladders had been used, but these were taken away by other painters to be used in another part of the plant. One of plaintiff\u2019s fellow workmen asked the defendant\u2019s foreman for a ladder, and one was produced from another part of the defendant\u2019s plant. When placed for the purpose of permitting the plaintiff to ascend to the platform, it slipped upon the smooth hardwood floor and fell, causing the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. The ladder had been equipped with spurs at the foot to prevent slipping, but the evidence was such as to justify the jury in finding that these spurs had worn down so that they were not sufficient for the purpose for which they were designed, and this, under the statute, is a defect in the defendant\u2019s plant for which it is answerable.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-14\">No errors are pointed out in the record, and, the jury having found in favor of the plaintiff, there is nothing remaining except for this court to affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-15\">The judgment and order appealed from should be affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
