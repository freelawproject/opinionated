Under those circumstances, the judgment must be reversed, because the learned judge below permitted the plaintiff, over his counsel\u2019s objection, to be cross-examined as follows: \u201cWere you ever arrested for the crime of smuggling?\u201d \u2014 and this was repeated in various forms in five or six questions, with answers which, while to my mind they indicate plaintiff\u2019s entire innocence of the charge, were very likely to have seriously prejudiced plaintiff in the eyes of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-15\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
