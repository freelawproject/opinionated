The second, third, and fourth paragraphs of the complaint set up allegations of a sale of goods, wares, and merchandise to the defendant between the 6th day of January and the 24th day of July, 1913, at \u201cthe agreed price and reasonable value\u201d of $331.29, and, except the sum of $150, that no part of the same had been paid. The answer is a denial of this allegation \u201cupon information and belief.\u201d This answer was held to be bad by the court below, because it was claimed the facts set forth in the complaint are presumptively within the knowledge of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-17\">No such presumption can properly be said to exist. Goods may have been sold and delivered to persons duly authorized to purchase the same by the defendant, of which he may not have had the slightest knowledge or information; hence the defendant\u2019s denial of the purchase upon information and belief was perfectly legal. The same may also be said as to the allegation of the \u201creasonable\u201d value of the goods. The complaint was drawn so that the plaintiff could give proof of the reasonable value of the goods, and the defendant might truthfully deny upon information and belief that the amount charged in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>the complaint was the reasonable value thereof. The answer was good, and the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
