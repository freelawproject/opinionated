This court has repeatedly laid down the rule that cases in the Municipal Court should either be held subject to actual engagement of counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>in another court, or adjourned, where proof of such engagement is submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\">The stenographer\u2019s minutes, taken upon the inquest in the case at bar, show that an affidavit of the actual engagement of defendants\u2019 attorney in the City Court was handed up to the trial justice, and an adjournment asked, and the affidavits submitted upon defendants\u2019 motion to open their default, also show that defendants\u2019 attorney was practically forced into the trial of the action in the City Court, by the peremptory ruling, of the justice in that court, that the case, in which defendants\u2019 attorney was the attorney for one of the parties, must proceed at once. The situation in which the defendants\u2019 attorney found himself was that he was compelled by the ruling of the trial justice to go to trial in both actions. He proceeded to trial in the City Court and endeavored to have the case in the Municipal Court held until the trial in the City Court was concluded. He could do no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">Order reversed, judgment vacated, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellants to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
