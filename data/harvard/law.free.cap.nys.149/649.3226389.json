The answer, by not denying, admits every allegation of the complaint except the amount due, and sets up an affirmative defense and a counterclaim, alleging an abrogation of the original agreement and the making of a new contract, which is in writing, and set forth in defendant\u2019s bill of particulars, and alleges that defendant kept all the provisions of said agreement, but that plaintiff breached the same, and demands $1,000 on his counterclaim. The subsequent agreement is also set out in the plaintiff\u2019s reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-13\">Plaintiff, under the pleadings, having to prove nothing but the amount due and unpaid, obtained an order for the examination of the defendant as to his alleged separate defense and counterclaim. The defendant moved to vacate such order, which motion being denied, this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-14\">No reason is shown to bring this case within the exception to the rule, many times laid down in this department that, except in extraordinary cases, the right to examine should be limited to eliciting testimony in support of the examining party\u2019s case.
