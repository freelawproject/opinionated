J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aez\">In 1909 Milton W. Hazelton was the owner of certain premises in the city of Oneonta. In that year he gave to one Lloyd Spencer a lease of a part of said premises for five years. In that lease it was provided that, if the said Hazelton had a bqna fide offer for said premises, the said Spencer had the option to take them at the said offer; otherwise, his lease should be deemed terminated. Upon the 30th of November, 1911, one Keenan, for the said Hazel-ton, claiming to be authorized thereto, made a contract with one Joseph Glennon to sell to him the said premises. Thereafter, and' upon the 7th day of December of that year, the said Hazelton entered into a lease of the said premises with the said Lloyd Spencer for the term of 15 years. Later, in 1912, the said Hazelton sold the prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>erty to other persons. Joseph Glennon brought an action to declare this deed void, and to compel a transfer to him, making the said Hazelton a party thereto, and also the grantees named in Hazelton\u2019s deed to them. In that action it was declared that the deed was void ; and it was also decided that this 15-year lease, executed December 7, 1911, was void. Spencer, however, was not a party to that action. There exists upon said premises three mortgages,. two of which at least, if not the other, are prior in point of time to the lease to Lloyd Spencer. Glennon has procured said mortgages to be purchased and assigned to his son, Allan Glennon, who is the plaintiff in this action to foreclose the same. This motion was made by the defendant Amelia Spencer, who is the sole legatee and devisee and also the executrix of the will of Lloyd Spencer, to compel the said plaintiff to assign the said mortgages, upon the payment of the amount due. After the hearing of the argument the plaintiff offered a stipulation that the property might be sold, subject to such interest, if any, as the defendant Spencer might have in the 5-year lease. Apparently by reason of the giving of this stipulation the Special Term has denied the defendant\u2019s motion for the assignment, and it is from this order that the defendant here is appealing.</p>\n<p id=\"A3R\"><bracketnum>[1,2]</bracketnum> If the 15-year lease be not valid, defendant Spencer can claim under the 5-year lease. Lloyd Spencer, when told of the opportunity for sale, offered to buy, as he might do under the terms of his 5-year lease; but Hazelton withdrew it, and it was settled by the giving of the'15-year lease instead. Hazelton claimed .that Keenan was not authorized to sell the premises to Glennon. While this fact has been determined adversely to Hazelton in the action by Glen-non, defendant Spencer is not affected by the decree, because not, a party to the action. If Keenan were unauthorized to sell, then the 15-year lease is valid, and upon this defendant Spencer now insists. This question should not be tried on affidavits. Defendant Spencer may with propriety insist that her rights under that lease should not be forfeited, except after a trial in court. The stipulation, therefore, that the sale in the foreclosure action should be subject to such rights as defendant Spencer might have under the'5-year lease, was not sufficient answer to defendant Spencer\u2019s demand of an assignment of the mortgages upon payment of the amount due. That a lessee may ordinarily demand the assignment of a prior mortgage would seem to be supported by sound equity and is within authority. Averill v. Taylor, 8 N. Y. 44; Twombly v. Cassidy, 82 N. Y. 155; Bayles v. Husted, 40 Hun, 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">Defendant Joseph Glennon has asked, if an assignment be directed, that he, as owner of the equity, may have leave to pay the mortgages. This he may do at any time after due date without any direction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The order should therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and an assignment of the mortgages be directed upon payment to plaintiff of the amount due thereupon, and costs of the action to the time the offer to purchase the premises was first made.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
