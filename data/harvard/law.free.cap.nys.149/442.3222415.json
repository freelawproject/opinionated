The defendant obtained an- order for. the general examination of plaintiff before trial; that is, it was sought to obtain the plaintiff\u2019s evidence necessary to sustain her cause of action and to cross-examine her thereon out of court and before trial. There is no- suggestion that such testimony is needed by defendant to support any affirmative claim or defense. Such examinations in negligence cases have consistently been refused by this court in this department. Wood v. Charles W. Hoffman Co., 121 App. Div. 636, 106 N. Y. Supp. 308; Smyth v. Lichtenstein, 137 App. <em>Div. 310, 122 </em>N. Y. Supp. 73. Except in extraordinary cases, we have limited the right to examine to eliciting testimony in support of the examining party\u2019s case. Caldwell v. Glazier, 128 App. Div. 315, 112 N. Y. Supp. 655; Reusens v. Arkenburgh, 136 App. Div. 653, 121 N. Y. Supp. 353; McClarty v. Giroux, 142 App. Div. 750, 127 N. Y. Supp. 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
