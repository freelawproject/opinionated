Respondent concedes that it was \u25a0 not. so presented, but claims: (1) That the defense arising out of this delay was waived by defendant\u2019s rejection of the claim on its merits; and (2) that the provision is virtually one to limit or discharge the carrier\u2019s liability for his negligence, and therefore void under the decisions in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> I do not think that it can now be successfully disputed that, as the case involves an interstate shipment, the law as interpreted by the federal courts must be accepted as applicable. United Lead Co. v. L. V. R. R. Co., 156 App. Div. 525, 527, 528, 141 N. Y. Supp. 310; Loomis v. L. V. R. Co., 208 N. Y. 312, 332, 101 N. E. 907.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> As to respondent\u2019s second contention \u2014 -i. e., that the stipulation is one to exempt the carrier from liability for his negligence \u2014 it has been held by the Supreme Court of the United States that the limitation is valid. Express Co. v. Caldwell, 21 Wall. 264, 22 L. Ed. 556, expressly approved on this point in Queen of the Pacific, 180 U. S. 49, 21 Sup. Ct. 278, 45 L. Ed. 419. See, also, M., K. &amp; T. Ry. Co. v. Harriman, 227 U. S. 657, 672, 673, 33 Sup. Ct. 397, 57 L. Ed. 690.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> As to the waiver, although in our own state a delay of three months for deliberation upon a claim presented after the time limit, and its rejection on the merits without reference to the limitation, has been held to constitute a waiver (see Isham v. Erie R. R. Co., 112 App. Div. 612, 98 N. Y. Supp. 609), the insistence on other defenses has been held in the federal courts not to constitute a waiver. L. V. R. Co. v. Providence, etc., Co., 172 Fed. 364, 97 C. C. A. 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">Moreover, it is exceedingly doubtful to my mind whether, under the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act, and in view of the fact that the form of the bill of lading under which this shipment was made was approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission, the carrier has power to waive its provisions. Interstate Commerce Opinion No. 4844, February 9, 1914.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">Judgment reversed, with costs, and complaint dismissed on the merits. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
