This proceeding by suit in equity, and the decree appealed from, cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 signature, obtained by misrepresentation, as found by the \u2022trial court, was nevertheless affixed to a promissory note, which the complaint admits had before suit been discounted for value before maturity. Mr. W. H. Munnich twice signed, without reading over the contract or note. Plaintiffs wholly trusted to what was said to be the tenor of the paper, so that the plaintiffs allege that they, \u201cwithout further examination of said contract and note, signed the same.\u201d A perusal would have shown that the second signature was to a separable promissory note. The printing, \u201cthe installment note below is to be detached by Thos. Howard Co.,\u201d though smaller than some of the display printing, nevertheless was quite legible, being in what printers call heavy faced \u201c8 point\u201d type.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">In New York it is settled that one who signs such negotiable paper without reading it, when he can read and has opportunity to do so, though he supposes it is something entirely different, such as an order for goods, cannot set up his own omission against one who has become a bona fide holder. Chapman v. Rose, 56 N. Y. 137, 15 Am. Rep. 401; National Exchange Bank v. Veneman, 43 Hun, 241, 244; 1 Daniel on Neg. Inst. (4th Ed.) \u00a7 850.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">It is an illustration of the policy to protect negotiable instruments, under the rule that, where one of two innocent persons must suffer, the loss must fall on him who reposed the confidence. See Page v. Krekey, 137 N. Y. 307, 313, 33 N. E. 311, 21 E. R. A. 409, 33 Am. St. Rep. 721. Hence this complaint did not state a cause of action of equitable cognizance.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">It therefore follows that the judgment should be reversed, and the complaint dismissed, but, in the peculiar circumstances, without costs, except the appellants\u2019 taxable disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
