Mr. Archer\u2019s sale of the entire tract which he had thus restricted ended his interest in these covenants. In re Birmingham &amp; District Land Co. [1893] 1 Chan. 342; McDougail v. Schneider, 134 App. Div. 208, 118 N. Y. Supp. 861; White v. Moore, 161 App. Div. 400, 146 N. Y. Supp. 593; Thompson v. Diller, 161 App. Div. 98, 146 N. Y. Supp. 438. Therefore Mr. Archer\u2019s attempt to modify these covenants after he had disposed of the lots and become a stranger to the title was nugatory as to the other lot owners, who had purchased on the faith of these restrictions. Such a release would in effect destroy the value of the lots sold, by authorizing a use of a part of the estate for a purpose inconsistent with .the restriction by which Mr. Archer had professed to bind the whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-14\">The judgment is therefore affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
