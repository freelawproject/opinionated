Its enactment clearly rests upon grounds of public policy. It has always been within the legislative prerogative to enact statutes for the moral and physical well-being of our citizens, and we think the Legislature did not exceed its authority in prescribing the intermission of rest provided by this statute for the health and physical welfare of such of our citizens as come within its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>provisions. So\" much has been written upon the police power of the Legislature to enact laws for the physical and moral welfare of our citizens that we do not deem it necessary or profitable to add to the volume of instructive discussion found in the reported cases. The cases of Lindenmuller v. People, 33 Barb. 548, opinion by Allen, J., and People v. Havnor, 149 N. Y. 195, 43 N. E. 541, 31 L. R. A. 689, 52 Am. St. Rep. <em>707, </em>among others, cover the subject, and we think have clear application to the cases at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">We are of the opinion, however, that the judgment of conviction based upon the employment of Willi\u00e1m L. Buchs should not be sustained. Subdivision 2 of section 8a of the statute referred to expressly exempts from the operation of the law superintendents or foremen in charge. We are of the opinion that Buchs was at the time of the alleged violation of the statute clearly a foreman in charge of the work and within the exception mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">It follows that the judgments of conviction as to Max Pfau, Fred Hohensee, and Jacob Shank should be affirmed, and that the judgment of conviction based upon the employment of William L. Buchs should be reversed; but, it appearing upon the undisputed evidence that the offense charged was not in this instance made out, no new trial should be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
