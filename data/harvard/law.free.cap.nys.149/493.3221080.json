Gutgsell appeared in an action in which said judgment was obtained as attorney for said Waldau, whose address does not appear on the original summons; that deponent has caused diligent search to be made for the address of said Waldau, so as to serve him with the summons and complaint herein, and has also communicated with Gutgsell and asked for the address of his client and that he appear in said action, and informed him that this was an action to foreclose a mortgage and that no personal judgment was asked for against his client; that Gutgsell informed deponent that he had no authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>to appear for Ms client, nor could he give deponent his address \u2014 the Special Term made an ex parte order requiring the appellant to disclose Waldau\u2019s address, and subsequently denied a motion to vacate said order.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-3\">The power of a court to compel an attorney to disclose the address of his client is confined to the proceeding or case in which the attorney appears for his client. The relation of attorney and client ceased upon the rendition of the judgment in the Municipal Court. The cases agree that the attorney in an action gone to judgment cannot be compelled to disclose his former client\u2019s residence in order that he may be pursued in subsequent litigations. Matter of Malcom, 129 App. Div. 226, 113 N. Y. Supp. <em>666; </em>Matter of Trainor, 146 App. Div. 117, 130 N. Y. Supp. 682.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The order should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and' the motion to vacate granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
