The referee, in his opinion, overruled the contestant\u2019s objections to these payments, but there was no mention of them in his report, or in the decree of the Surrogate\u2019s Court confirming the same, and the trustee was charged with the gross amount of sales. This was evidently an inadvertence.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-14\">The decree therefore should be modified by crediting the trustee with the sum of $200; and, as thus modified, affirmed, with costs to the respondent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
