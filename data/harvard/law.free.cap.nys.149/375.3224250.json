Y. Supp. 755; 152 App. Div. 181, 137 N. Y. Supp. 27), the record on examination shows that the decree in favor of the two lienors, Cross, Austin &amp; Ireland Lumber Company and Robert T. McMurray &amp; Bro., is well supported and justified by the evidence. Although each lienor has taken a cross-appeal, we are satisfied of the correctness of the several deductions made at the Special Term.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-17\">The allowance, however, to the George Weiderman Electric Company, should be modified. After the written refusal of Mr. Offerman to bear any of the expense for electric wiring, the lessee, for his own purposes, contracted for 99 brackets or outlets under the new steel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>balcony. There was no authority or consent by the owners for this outlay. Nor may the charge be sustained as implied in the construction of the balcony, itself, of which it forms no part. The item of $875 must therefore be stricken out, reducing this lienor\u2019s recovery to $1,123.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">We find no ground to require the allowance of interest or to interfere with the discretion exercised in granting costs to the lienors.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The judgment appealed from is therefore modified, by reducing the recovery of the George Weiderman Electric Company to $1,123.16, as of the date of the Special Term decree, and otherwise the amounts found are confirmed. As so modified, the judgment is affirmed, without costs of this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
