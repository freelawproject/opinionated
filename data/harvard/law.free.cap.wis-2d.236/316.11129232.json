PATRICK CROOKS, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">\u00b61. This case comes before the court on certification from District I of the court of appeals. Petitioners, Susan and Gary Czapin-ski, seek review of a circuit court decision that dismissed their medical malpractice claim on the grounds that they failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Petitioners had sought damages for the loss of their mother's society and companionship following her death during a routine hip replacement surgery. The circuit court held that under Wis. Stat. \u00a7 893.55(4)(f) (1995-96),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> adult children lack standing to recover for the wrongful death of a parent caused by medical malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">\u00b6 2. We affirm. First, we hold that the language of Wis. Stat. \u00a7 893.55(4)(f) makes applicable to medical malpractice death cases only the limit on damages, and does not incorporate the wrongful death classification of claimants entitled to bring such an action. The clas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>sification of claimants entitled to bring a wrongful death suit for medical malpractice is limited to those enumerated in Wis. Stat. \u00a7 655.007. Legislative history shows that adult children were not intended to be included within this classification. Second, we hold that \u00a7 893.55(4)(f) does not violate the equal protection clause of the Wisconsin Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-1\">\u00b6 3. On October 19, 1995, seventy-eight-year-old Helen Czapinski was admitted to St. Francis Hospital to undergo routine hip replacement surgery. During the surgery, doctors had trouble intubating her,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and by late evening, after the surgery, she was having difficulty breathing. Her respiratory distress intensified throughout the night and measures were taken by hospital staff in an attempt to resolve the problem. The respiratory difficulty continued and an emergency tracheostomy was eventually performed; this too failed in solving the respiratory crisis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Helen Czapinski went into cardiac arrest and was pronounced dead at 8:29 a.m. on October 20,1995. A post mortem examination showed that her esophagus had been lacerated, apparently allowing air to escape into her neck, a potential cause of the respiratory obstruction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>\u00b6 4. At the time of her death, Helen Czapinski was not survived by a spouse. As a result, her two adult children, Susan and Gary Czapinski, filed a medical malpractice claim under Wis. Stat. ch. 655 on November 12, 1997. They alleged that St. Francis Hospital, Inc., \"acting through its employees, agents and others for whom it is responsible in <em>respondeat </em>superior,\" negligently caused their mother \"to sustain injuries, severe pain and suffering, and ultimately to die.\" (R. at 1:5.) The Czapinskis sought damages for loss of their mother's society and companionship.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">\u00b6 5. The defendant, St. Francis Hospital, along with American Continental Insurance Company, and Wisconsin Patients Compensation Fund (hereinafter, St. Francis) filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Wis. Stat. \u00a7 802.06(3). St. Francis claimed that the Czapinskis failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because Wis. Stat. ch. 655 precludes adult children from recovering for wrongful death resulting from medical malpractice.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\u00b6 6. The Czapinskis responded to this motion by claiming that Wis. Stat. \u00a7 893.55(4)(f) supersedes Wis. Stat. \u00a7 655.007 in terms of who may bring a cause of action in medical malpractice death cases, and it makes the classification of claimants entitled to bring wrongful death actions under Wis. Stat. \u00a7 895.04(4)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> applicable to claims for loss of society and companionship in medical malpractice actions. The Czapinskis argued that this classification would include adult children's claims for such loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">\u00b6 7. The circuit court, the Honorable Louis J. Ceci presiding, granted St. Francis' motion and dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>missed the complaint with prejudice. The circuit court held that adult children lack standing to recover for loss of society and companionship in the wrongful death of a parent caused by medical malpractice, because Wis. Stat. \u00a7 893.55(4) makes applicable to medical malpractice death cases only the limit on damages and does not incorporate the wrongful death classification of claimants entitled to bring such an action. The circuit court held that the classification of claimants entitled to bring claims for loss of society and companionship in wrongful death actions for medical malpractice are limited to those enumerated in Wis. Stat. \u00a7 655.007.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">\u00b6 8. The Czapinskis appeal on two grounds.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> First, they claim that as of May 25, 1995, Wis. Stat. \u00a7 893.55(4)(f) incorporated adult children in the classification of claimants that may bring claims for loss of society and companionship in wrongful death actions in medical malpractice cases. In support of their claim, they point to the terminology of \u00a7 893.55(4)(f), which provides in part, \"damages recoverable against health care providers and an employee of a health care provider. . .for wrongful death are subject to the limit under s. 895.04(4).\" Wisconsin Stat. \u00a7 895.04(4), in turn, provides that in wrongful death actions, \"[additional damages not to exceed $150,000 for loss of society and companionship may be awarded to the spouse, children or parents of the deceased.\"<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\u00b6 9. Second, the Czapinskis argue that if Wis. Stat. \u00a7 893.55(4)(f) is construed to incorporate only the wrongful death limitation on damages, and not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>classification of wrongful death claimants entitled to bring such actions, then the statute should be struck down as unconstitutional for violating the equal protection provision in art. I, \u00a7 1 of the Wisconsin Constitution.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under the current statute, physicians whose negligence causes death while acting in a medical capacity are treated differently than physicians whose negligence causes death while acting in a non-medical capacity. Furthermore, adult children would not have the same protections under the law as minor children. The Czapinskis claim that this inequitable treatment of both tortfeasors and tort victims violates equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">\u00b6 10. St. Francis seeks an affirmation of the circuit court decision, which would prevent adult children from recovering for loss of society and companionship in medical malpractice cases. They argue that because Wis. Stat. \u00a7 893.55(4)(f) only incorporates the amount of damages a claimant may recover in medical malpractice suits, the classification of claimants entitled to bring such a claim under medical malpractice is limited to those enumerated in Wis. Stat. \u00a7 655.007. St. Francis argues that the Czapinskis could not meet the heavy burden to show that Wis. Stat. \u00a7 893.55(4)(f) is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">\u00b6 11. The court of appeals certified the appeal to this court for its determination. We are presented with two issues for review. First, does Wis. Stat. \u00a7 893.55(4)(f) expand the classification of claimants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>entitled to collect damages for loss of society and companionship in medical malpractice claims to include adult children who have lost a parent as a result of medical malpractice?<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Second, if \u00a7 893.55(4)(f) is construed not to incorporate adult children who have lost a parent in the classification of claimants that can collect damages resulting from loss of society and companionship in medical malpractice cases, does this statute then violate the equal protection provision of the Wisconsin Constitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">\u00ed \u2014 I HH.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-2\">\u00b6 12. We first address whether Wis. Stat. \u00a7 893.55(4)(f) includes adult children in the class of claimants that can recover for loss of society and companionship in a medical malpractice suit. The interpretation of a statute is a question of law that is reviewed <em>de novo. Burks v. St. Joseph's Hosp., </em>227 Wis. 2d 811, 824, 596 N.W.2d 391 (1999). Likewise, the constitutionality of a statute is also a question of law that is reviewed <em>de novo. Riccitelli v. Broekhuizen, </em>227 Wis. 2d 100, 119, 595 N.W.2d 392 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\">\u00b6 13. We conclude that Wis. Stat. \u00a7 893.55(4)(f) does not expand the classification of claimants entitled to recover for loss of society and companionship in the wrongful death of a parent caused by medical malpractice to include adult children. Statutory language along with legislative history and precedent lead us to hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>that the intent of the legislature was to make applicable to medical malpractice death cases only the Wis. Stat. \u00a7 895.04(4) limit on damages,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and not to incorporate the wrongful death classification of claimants entitled to bring such an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">\u00b6 14. We begin by outlining the statutory provisions at issue in this case. Wisconsin Stat. ch. 655 provides medical patients a recourse for health care liability and establishes the Patients Compensation Fund. Chapter 655 was created in 1975 as a response to what the legislature perceived as a \"social and economic crisis.\" <em>State ex rel. Strykowski v. Wilkie, </em>81 Wis. 2d 491, 509, 261 N.W.2d 434 (1978). It \"established an exclusive procedure for the prosecution of malpractice claims against a health care provider. ...\" <em>Strykowski, </em>81 Wis. 2d at 499. The legislative rationale behind creating Chapter 655 was stated in <em>Strykowski, </em>81 Wis. 2d at 508, in which the court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-5\">The legislature cited a sudden increase in the number of malpractice suits, in the size of awards, and in malpractice insurance premiums, and identified several impending dangers: increased health care costs, the prescription of elaborate \"defensive\" medical procedures, the unavailability of certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>hazardous services and the possibility that physicians would curtail their practices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">However, soon after the enactment of Chapter 655, the legislature passed Wis. Stat. \u00a7 893.55, in part, to limit the damages a claimant could recover under medical malpractice claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">\u00b6 15. Before the enactment of Wis. Stat. \u00a7 893.55(4)(f) in 1995, Wis. Stat. \u00a7 893.55(4)(b) and (d) provided that the limit on total noneconomic damages would be $1 million for actions filed or after June 14, 1986 and before January 1, 1991. During this same time period, damages for loss of society and companionship in all other wrongful death cases were limited under Wis. Stat. \u00a7 895.04(4) to $50,000. <em>Rineck v. Johnson, </em>155 Wis. 2d 659, 665-66, 456 N.W.2d 336 (1990), <em>rev'd on other grounds, Chang v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>182 Wis. 2d 549, 514 N.W.2d 399 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">\u00b6 16. In 1990, this court held that the larger $1 million limitation under Wis. Stat. ch. 655 superseded the smaller limitation in the general wrongful death statute. <em>Rineck, </em>155 Wis. 2d at 661. Furthermore, this court also held in <em>Jelinek v. St. Paul Fire and Casualty Insurance Co., </em>182 Wis. 2d 1, 9, 512.N.W.2d 764 (1994), that after January 1, 1991, recovery for loss of society and companionship in medical malpractice cases was unlimited. Possibly as a response to our decisions in these cases, the legislature passed 1995 Wisconsin Act 10, which among other things, created Wis. Stat. \u00a7 893.55(4)(f).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Prior to the enactment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>\u00a7 893.55(4)(f), the classification of Claimants entitled to bring a claim for loss of society and companionship as a result of medical malpractice was limited to those enumerated in Wis. Stat. \u00a7 655.007. <em>Ziulkowski v. Nierengarten, </em>210 Wis. 2d 98, 103, 565 N.W.2d 164 (1997). Section 893.55(4)(f) mad\u00e9 applicable to medical malpractice cases the limit on damages for loss of society and companionship that :was established in Wis. Stat. \u00a7 895.04(4),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the wrongful death statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\u00b6 17. The statutory construction of Wis. Stat. \u00a7 893.55(4)(f) supports our interpretation of only incorporating the damage limitations of Wis. Stat. \u00a7 895.04(4), and not the class \u00f3f claimants entitled to bring such an action under- that same section. A court will not ordinarily engage in statutory construction unless a statute is ambiguous. <em>Harris v. Kelley, </em>70 Wis. 2d 242, 249, 243 N.W.2d 628 (1975). \"[W]hen a statute is plain and unambiguous, interpretation is unnecessary and intentions cannot be imputed to the legislature except those to be gathered from the terms of the statute itself.\" <em>Id. </em>A statute is ambiguous if \"reasonable minds could differ\" over the meaning of the statute. <em>Harnischfeger Corp. v. LIRC, </em>196 Wis. 2d 650, 662, 539 N.W.2d 98 (1995). If a statute's language is ambiguous, a court may discern legislative intent by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>examining the \"history, scope, context, subject matter, and object of the statute.\" <em>State v. Kirch, </em>222 Wis. 2d 598, 602, 587 N.W.2d 919 (Ct. App. 1998) (citing <em>Lake City Corp. v. City of Mequon, </em>207 Wis. 2d 155, 164, 558 N.W.2d 100, 103 (1997)). Section 893.55(4)(f) is ambiguous as to what limitation from the wrongful death statute, \u00a7 895.04(4), it incorporates into medical malpractice suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">\u00b6 18. In <em>Rineck, </em>155 Wis. 2d at 661, we recognized that Wis. Stat. ch. 655 controls all claims for death or injury resulting from medical malpractice. We have also held that Chapter 655 incorporates by specific reference an exclusive list of those extrinsic statutory provisions that the legislature intended to apply in medical malpractice actions, and extrinsic, statutes must be specifically incorporated into Chapter 655 to be applied to medical malpractice actions. <em>Id. </em>at 666-67. Wisconsin Stat. \u00a7 895.04(2) is the statute that l\u00e1ys out the class of claimants that may recover in wrongful death actions.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Had the legislature wanted to incorporate \u00a7 895.04(2) into Chapter 655 and medical malpractice actions, it would have been referred to, or included in Wis. Stat. \u00a7 893.55(4)(f), which applied wrongful death limitations to medical malpractice suits. Instead, the only wrongful death limit expressly applied to medical malpractice suits is the limitation on noneconomic damage awards for loss of society and companionship under Wis. Stat. \u00a7 895.04(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">\u00b6 19. This statutory, construction is also supported by specific language in Wis. Stat. \u00a7 893.55(4)(f). First, the legislature chose to use the term \"limit\" to expand medical malpractice cases to incorporate only the wrongful death recovery limitation for loss of soci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>ety and companionship. The word \"limit\" in its singular form suggests that the legislature did not want the entire second sentence of Wis. Stat. \u00a7 895.04(4) to be incorporated into \u00a7 893.55(4)(f). Had the legislature wanted also to incorporate the class of claimants entitled to recover for loss of society and companionship in wrongful death suits to medical malpractice suits, they could have easily done so by changing Wis. Stat. \u00a7 655.007, or by expressly stating this intention in \u00a7 893.55(4)(f), when the wrongful death limit on noneconomic damage awards was also incorporated.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">\u00b6 20. Further, the final sentence in Wis. Stat. \u00a7 893.55(4)(f) clarifies that the legislature intended to equate \"limit\" with monetary damages, not a class of claimants. The sentence states that \"if damages in excess of the limit under s. 895.04(4) are found, the court shall make any reduction required under s. 895.045 and shall award the lesser of the reduced amount or the limit under s. 895.04(4).\" \u00a7 893.55(4)(f). The repeated references to \u00a7 895.04(4) connect \"limit\" to damages, but there is \u00f1o reference that connects \"limit\" to a class of claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">\u00b6 21. Second, Wis. Stat. \u00a7 893.55(4)(f) uses the language, <em>\"damages </em>recoverable. . .are subject to the limit under s. 895.04(4).\" (Emphasis added.) This shows that the legislature intended to extend to medical malpractice suits the wrongful death limit on damages, not the class of claimants entitled to bring such a suit. Again, had the legislature been attempting to incorporate the wrongful death class of claimants to medical malpractice claims, they could have used terminology such as, \"damages recoverable and <em>class of claimants entitled to bring a s.uit. </em>. .are subject to the limits under s. 895.04(4).\" This type of statutory language would have decidedly incorporated the wrongful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>death class of claimants that could recover damages for loss of society and companionship into medical malpractice cases. But, the legislature did not use such terminology.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">\u00b6 22. \"When interpreting a statute, our primary objective is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature.. .and the legislature is presumed to act with knowledge of the existing case law.\" <em>Ziulkowski, </em>210 Wis. 2d at 104 (citations omitted). Therefore, a statute's construction will stand unless the legislature explicitly changes the law. <em>State ex rel. Campbell v. Township of Delavan, </em>210 Wis. 2d 239, 256, 565 N.W.2d 209 (Ct. App. 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">\u00b6 23. Numerous Wisconsin courts, including this one, have held that adult children lack standing to recover for loss of society and companionship in medical malpractice cases. <em>Ziulkowski, </em>210 Wis. 2d at 100; <em>In re Wells v. Mt. Sinai Med. Ctr., </em>183 Wis. 2d 667, 677, 515 N.W.2d 705 (1994); <em>Dziadosz v. Zirneski, </em>177 Wis. 2d 59, 61, 501 N.W.2d 828 (Ct. App. 1993). Petitioners argue that these cases predate the enactment of Wis. Stat. \u00a7 893.55(4)(f), and therefore have no bearing on the statute, which supersedes the interpretations found in the case law. However, because \u00a7 893.55(4)(f) did not explicitly modify the interpretations found in previous case law, adult children still cannot recover for loss of society and companionship in medical malpractice cases; Furthermore, in 1999, the court of appeals reaffirmed that adult children lack standing to recover for the loss of society and companionship of a parent in medical malpractice cases. <em>Conant v. Physicians Plus Med. Group, Inc., </em>229 Wis. 2d 271, 277, 600 N.W.2d 21 (Ct. App. 1999). The interpretation of who may recover for loss of society and companionship in medical malpractice cases arose after the enactment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Wis. Stat. \u00a7 893.55(4)(f). We agree with that interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">\u00b6 24. Our construction of Wis. Stat. \u00a7 893.55(4) is also supported by legislative history, which is properly subject to judicial notice. <em>Strykowski, </em>81 Wis. 2d at 504-05 (citing <em>Nekoosa-Edwards Paper Co. v. Public Serv. Comm., </em>8 Wis. 2d 582, 590, 591, 99 N.W.2d 821 (1959)). 1995 Wis. Act 10, the act creating Wis. Stat. \u00a7 893.55(4)(f), established the maximum amount a claimant may recover for noneconomic damages in a medical malpractice case. Furthermore, the introduction to the act stated that the statutory changes and enactments made by 1995 Wis. Act 10 related to \"limiting medical malpractice noneconomic damage awards. . . .\" Introduction to 1995 Wis. Act 10. There was no evidence in the drafting record that points to a legislative intent to broaden the classification of claimants entitled to recover for the loss of society and companionship in medical malpractice cases. This classification has been governed solely by Wis. Stat. \u00a7 655.007. Because the legislature did not make any changes to \u00a7 655.007,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and because the legislature is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>presumed to know that Wisconsin courts have established that adult children cannot recover for loss of society and companionship in medical malpractice cases, <em>see Ziulkowski, </em>210 Wis. 2d at 104, we find that the legislative intent in creating Wis. Stat. \u00a7 893.55(4)(f) was to limit noneconomic damage awards in medical malpractice suits. There is no evidence of any legislative intent to broaden the classification of claimants entitled to recover in such suits to include adult children.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">\u00b6 25. Petitioners argue that the real purpose in enacting Wis. Stat. \u00a7 893.55(4)(f) was to make the treatment of medical malpractice claims and other tort actions uniform. They support this proposition by citing several prepared statements from members of the medical and insurance communities who testified in favor of amending Wis. Stat. ch. 655 to create a system that would treat medical malpractice death cases the same as actions under the wrongful death act. The Petitioners, however, fail to discuss the context in which such testimony was presented. When examining a particular phrase in a statute, a court must look at the phrase in light of the entire statute. <em>Elliott v. Employers Mut. Cas. Co., </em>176 Wis. 2d 410, 414, 500 N.W.2d 397 (Ct. App. 1993). Likewise, it only follows that a particular statement in prepared testimony should be examined in light of the entire prepared statement. When the prepared statements cited by the Petitioners are viewed in their entirety, it is clear that support for the bill from the medical and insurance communities arose because the language of the bill was going to clearly reduce the maximum award of noneconomic damages allowed in medical malpractice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>cases. Those members of the medical and insurance communities that were cited by Petitioners deemed the reduction of noneconomic awards in medical malpractice cases necessary in order to reduce malpractice premiums and to improve access to health care services across the state. To interpret Wis. Stat. \u00a7 893.55(4)(f) as broadening the class of claimants entitled to bring claims for damages in medical malpractice cases would only increase the burden on the medical and insurance communities, an outcome that they likely would not support.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">HH HH I \u2014 \u00cd</p>\n<p id=\"b409-1\">\u00b6 26. The second issue raised by Petitioners is based on the Equal Protection Clause of the Wisconsin Constitution. They argue that if this court would find Wis. Stat. \u00a7 893.55(4)(f) not to include adult children in the classification of claimants that could recover for loss of society and companionship in medical malpractice death cases, then the statute would be in violation of art. I, \u00a7 1 of the Wisconsin Constitution \u2014 the equal protection provision. We conclude that this claim has no merit. Although \u00a7 893.55(4)(f) creates separate classifications for both tortfeasors and tort victims, these classifications do not violate equal protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-2\">\u00b6 27. This court starts with the presumption that a statute is constitutional and will continue to preserve a statute's constitutionality if there is a reasonable basis for the exercise of legislative power. <em>Miller v. Kretz, </em>191 Wis. 2d 573, 578, 531 N.W.2d 93 (Ct. App. 1995). This court will \"uphold a statute under an equal protection analysis '[i]f a rational basis exists to support the classification, unless the statute impinges on a fundamental right or creates a classification based on a suspect criterion.'\" <em>Id. </em>at 579. The Petitioners must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>prove that the statute is unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\u00b6 28. We have previously held that Wis. Stat. ch. 655 does not deny any fundamental right. <em>Strykowski, </em>81 Wis. 2d at 507. We presently find no reason to overturn this determination. Similarly, a suspect class is one that involves \"immutable personal characteristics or historical patterns of discrimination and political powerlessness.\"<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The different classes of tortfeasors and tort victims that would be created under our interpretation of \u00a7 893.55(4)(f) consist of medical personnel who would be immune from the higher damage awards recoverable under other tort actions, creating a non-favored class of non-medical personnel, and a non-favored class of adult children that could not recover for loss of society and companionship when a parent dies as a result of medical malpractice. We find that these non-favored classes do not have immutable personal characteristics and have not experienced a historical pattern of discrimination and political powerlessness. Therefore, \u00a7 893.55(4)(f) does not create a classification that would be based on suspect criterion. Because \u00a7 893.55(4)(f) is not based on a fundamental right and does not involve a suspect class, we use the rational basis standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">\u00b6 29. In applying the rational basis standard to equal protection challenges, this court is not concerned with the wisdom or correctness of the legislative determination. <em>Strykowski, </em>81 Wis. 2d at 508. Rather, we determine only whether there was a reasonable basis upon which the legislature enacted Wis. Stat. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>\u00a7 893.55(4)(f). <em>See id. </em>A statute that is based on classifications must meet five criteria for reasonableness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-4\">(1) All classifications must be based upon substantial distinctions which make one class really different from another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-5\">(2) The classification adopted must be germane to the purpose of the law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-6\">(3) The classification must not be based upon existing circumstances only and must not be so constituted as to preclude addition to the numbers included within a class.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">(4) To whatever class a law may apply, it must apply equally to each member thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">(5) The characteristics of each class should be so far different from those of other classes as to reasonably suggest at least the propriety, having regard to the public good, of substantially different legislation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 509 n.8.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">\u00b6 30. Petitioners' equal protection argument has two parts. First, medical personnel, as tortfeasors, would be immune from claims brought by adult children of parents who died as a result of medical malpractice. Medical personnel would have immunity from damage awards for loss of society and companionship while other non-medical personnel would not. Second, under the Respondents' interpretation of \u00a7 893.55(4)(f), adult children of parents who died as a result of medical malpractice would not be given the same opportunity to recover damages for loss of society and companionship as would minor children in the same circumstance. However, this court has already held that medical malpractice actions are substantially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>distinct from other tort actions when it upheld the constitutionality of Wis. Stat. ch. 655. <em>Strykowski, </em>81 Wis. 2d at 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">\u00b6 31. Because medical malpractice actions are substantially distinct from other tort actions, it is reasonable to conclude that the legislature has the constitutional authority to determine which classifications of persons are eligible to pursue a medical malpractice claim. Possible justifications for the statutory limit on the ability of adult children to recover for loss of society and companionship when a parent dies as a result of medical malpractice include the prevention of, <em>inter alia, </em>a sudden increase in the number of malpractice suits, increased medical costs or decreased accessibility to health care. <em>Strykowski, </em>81 Wis. 2d at 508. Furthermore, the distinction between adult children and minor children could be \"the different degree of dependency] which each would be presumed to have on their parents for their continued financial and emotional support.\" <em>Harris, </em>70 Wis. 2d at 252. Minor children rely much more heavily on their parents for financial and emotional support than do adult children, and this difference is substantial. <em>Id. </em>at 252-53. Faced with the need to draw the line on who can collect for loss of society and companionship, we follow the view established by this, and other Wisconsin courts, that the availability of claims for loss of society and companionship should be limited to those who would suffer most severely from the loss of an intimate family relationship; adult children cannot be included in this classification. <em>See Conant, </em>229 Wis. 2d at 276-77; <em>Rineck, </em>155 Wis. 2d at 662; <em>Theama v. City of Kenosha, </em>117 Wis. 2d 508, 515, 344 N.W.2d 513 (1984). Further possible justifications for treating medical personnel differently than non-medical personnel could follow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>similar policy reasoning, such as the prevention of increased health care costs, decreased health care services or physicians curtailing their practices. <em>Strykowski, </em>81 Wis. 2d at 508. As the <em>Miller </em>court has articulated, \"[t]he public has an important interest in the quality of health care, and the legislature's efforts to promote that interest cannot be said to be unreasonable.\"<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> 191 Wis. 2d at 585. Thus, Wis. Stat. \u00a7 893.55(4)(f) satisfies the five criteria of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">\u00b632. For the foregoing reasons, the classifications of tortfeasors and tort victims are not arbitrary or irrational, but are based on reasonable and rational criteria. Therefore, the Petitioners' equal protection argument must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">\u00b6 33. We hold that an adult child lacks standing to recover for loss of society and companionship in a wrongful death case involving medical malpractice. The language of Wis. Stat. \u00a7 893.55(4)(f), along with legislative history, shows that the classification of claimants entitled to bring a wrongful death suit for medical malpractice was not expanded to include adult children, and is limited to the classification of claimants enumerated in Wis. Stat. \u00a7 655.007. Further, we hold that Wis. Stat. \u00a7 893.55(4)(f) does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Wisconsin Constitution. Accordingly, the circuit court decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number><em>By the Court. </em>\u2014 The judgment of the circuit court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b395-8\"> All subsequent references to the Wisconsin Statutes are to the 1995-96 text unless otherwise noted. 1995 Wisconsin Act 10 created Wis.
