This enforcement action presents two questions: (1) whether substantial evidence supports credibility judgments made by the Administrative Law Judge and affirmed by the Board, and (2) whether Kent may now contend that the Act does not protect Glass because he was taking part in a managerial training program at the time of his dismissal. We enforce the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-17\">In an earlier enforcement proceeding, a panel of this circuit upheld a decision by the Board that Kent wrongfully discharged Glass and others and committed other unfair labor practices. <em>NLRB v. Kent Corp., </em>530 F.2d 610 (5th Cir. 1976). This proceeding was remanded to the Board on a limited issue involving Glass\u2019s entitlement to back pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-18\">A former Kent employee, Ralph Wilson, had testified before the ALJ that Glass encouraged him to call in a bomb threat to the Kent plant and that he, Wilson, had made such a call. Glass denied that he had any part in the scheme. Wilson\u2019s credibility was crucial to determining whether Glass had played such a role in the bomb threat as to render him ineligible for back pay. The panel found that the ALJ failed to make a sufficiently specific finding as to Wilson\u2019s credibility.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Upon remand, the Board referred the issue to the ALJ who presided at the initial hearing. Wilson could not be reached for questioning about his story. In his opinion on remand, affirmed by the Board, the ALJ found that Wilson\u2019s testimony was not credible. In characterizing Wilson\u2019s earlier testimony as \u201cpitiable,\u201d the ALJ explained he had meant that it was not credible. Substantial evidence on the record supports this determination. Kent obtained Wilson\u2019s affidavit implicating Glass when Wilson asked a company official for a job recommendation. Wilson gave the affidavit and got a favorable recommendation, despite the bomb threat. Notwithstanding Wilson\u2019s affidavit, Kent rehired Glass less than a week after Wilson implicated him. At the original hearing, the ALJ characterized Glass as a completely trustworthy witness. Under these circumstances, the ALJ reasonably could have credited Glass\u2019s testimony and discredited Wilson\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">On remand, Kent asserted for the first time that the Act does not protect Glass because he was taking part in a managerial trainee program when discharged. Kent seeks to excuse this untimely assertion of its theory because \u201ctwo post-appeal cases shedding light upon Glass\u2019s managerial employee status constitute extraordinary circumstances\u201d curing its failure to preserve this issue: the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., </em>416 U.S. 267, 94 S.Ct. 1757, 40 L.Ed.2d 134 (1974), and the Board\u2019s decision in <em>Curtis Noll Corp., </em>218 NLRB 1447 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">For two reasons these cases do not excuse Kent\u2019s delay. First, the Supreme Court decided <em>Bell Aerospace </em>on April 23, 1974, three months before the Board\u2019s original decision on the charges against Kent. The Board decided <em>Curtis Noll Corp. </em>on June 30, 1975, ten months before this circuit remanded the issue of Glass\u2019s entitlement to back pay. Kent neither petitioned the Board for a rehearing nor sought leave to present this theory to the panel in the original enforcement action. Except for the limited purpose of our remand, the matter was concluded by our prior adjudication. Second, the theory advanced by Kent existed prior to the decision of <em>Bell Aerospace </em>and <em>Curtis Noll. Bell Aerospace </em>rested in part upon the Board\u2019s consistent denial of the Act\u2019s protection to persons with managerial status. The factors for establishing when participation in a \u201cmanagerial trainee program\u201d will amount to managerial status did not originate in <em>Curtis Noll, </em>but, as the decision itself shows, derive from a series of cases decided by the Board many years earlier.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">Because we find that substantial evidence supports the order of the Board and because Kent failed to make a timely presentation of its argument that Glass\u2019s status as a managerial trainee denied him the protection of the Act, the Board\u2019s order is</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">ENFORCED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b275-10\">.
