He argued that Bankruptcy Rule of Procedure 203 required that notice of sale be given to all of the bankrupt\u2019s creditors. The district court denied the stay, finding Rule 203 inapplicable to sales conducted pursuant to state court orders. Although Rule 203 does not apply to reorganization proceedings, the notice to creditor rules that do apply to such proceedings do not require notice to creditors of state foreclosure sales. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-24\">American Savings &amp; Loan Association of Florida filed an action in state court to foreclose on real property owned by C.D.K. Corporation. C.D.K. subsequently petitioned for corporate reorganization under Chapter X. American's foreclosure suit was stayed. The bankruptcy court then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>ordered the state foreclosure proceedings to resume with the addition of the trustee as a party, reserving jurisdiction to designate the time and manner of the foreclosure sale. The state proceedings resulted in a foreclosure order against the debtor. Upon reconsideration of the reserved matters, the bankruptcy judge authorized the state court to proceed with the sale, reserving only the authority to review the sale results before the issuance of a title certificate. The trustee then unsuccessfully moved the bankruptcy court to stay the sale, contending among other things that the court was required by Rule 203 to give all creditors 10 days\u2019 notice of the sale. The bankruptcy judge interpreted Rule 203 to apply \u201csolely to sales conducted by and under the auspices of the bankruptcy court.\u201d The district court affirmed. The property was sold. The certificate of title issued. The trustee appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">American first suggests that the failure of the trustee to send the notice, if it was required, has become moot because title has vested in the purchaser at the foreclosure. This argument overlooks the fact that a sale without a required Rule 203 notice may be set aside. <em>See Wolverton v. Shell Oil Co., </em>442 F.2d 666 (9th Cir. 1971); <em>In re Insulation &amp; Acoustical Specialties Co., </em>426 F.2d 1189 (8th Cir. 1970); 3 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>\u00b6 58.09[2], at 515-16 (14th ed. 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">The trustee loses this appeal on the merits, however, for two reasons. <em>First, </em>Bankruptcy Rule 203 does not apply to Chapter X reorganization proceedings. <em>Second, </em>the proper notice requirements for Chapter X proceedings do not apply to state foreclosure sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Bankruptcy Rule 203, which is in essence a restatement of \u00a7 58(a) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 94(a), provides that \u201cthe court shall give all creditors at least 10 days\u2019 notice by mail of . (2) any proposed sale of property, including the time and place of any public sale, unless the court for cause shown shortens the time or orders a sale without notice . . . .\u201d The notice mandated by \u00a7 58(a) and Rule 203 is intended to afford creditors in an ordinary bankruptcy liquidation an opportunity to express their views on the propriety of the sale. Rules Bankr. Proc. Rule 203 (advisory committee notes). This rule does not apply to Chapter X proceedings. As noted in 6 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>\u00b6 3.39[1] n.2 (14th ed. 1977):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-10\">In view of \u00a7\u00a7 120 and 207 [dealing with designation by the bankruptcy judge of the elements of notice in Chapter X reorganizations], as well as the many specific provisions for notice in Chapter X, it is clear that the provisions of \u00a7 58a, b, c, d, and e are inapplicable under the chapter, as inconsistent and in conflict therewith, unless and until bankruptcy liquidation is ordered. . . . Sections 120 and 207 and the rules adapted therefrom are designed to permit the adaptation of notice to the needs of the particular matter at hand, to the extent that Chapter X does not prescribe what must be done. Section 58 is designed for use in liquidation cases and would not operate satisfactorily or efficiently if applied in a corporate reorganization case, (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWXH\">This reasoning applies with equal force to Rule 203, which is merely a restatement of \u00a7 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-12\">Further evidence that Rule 203 was not intended to apply in Chapter X proceedings is provided by the presence of Chapter X Rule 10-209, which \u201ccollects the provisions for notice specifically applicable to creditors and stockholders in Chapter X cases.\u201d Rules Bankr. Proc. Rule 10-209 (advisory committee notes). The Chapter X Rules do incorporate selected Bankruptcy Rules by reference, rather than repeating the Bankruptcy Rules within the Chapter X Rules. Rules Bankr. Proc. Rule 10-2 (advisory committee notes); 13 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>110-2.02 (14th ed. 1976). Chapter X Rule 10-209 contains no reference, however, to Bankruptcy Rule 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>In contrast to ordinary bankruptcy cases, both the filing (Rules Bankr. Proc. Rule 10-601) and the approval (11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 548) of a Chapter X petition for corporate reorganization automatically stay pending mortgage foreclosure suits. Additionally, the reorganization judge has discretionary authority in regards to the stay of state court mortgage foreclosures. <em>See </em>11 U.S. C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 513, 516(4); <em>Mongiello Bros. Coal Corp. v. Houghtaling Properties, Inc., </em>309 F.2d 925 (5th Cir. 1962). This power is an essential complement of the Chapter X court\u2019s obligation to preserve the <em>status quo </em>in order to afford interested parties a reasonable opportunity to formulate and implement a plan designed to mend the debt- or\u2019s failing financial structure. The judge has, however, discretionary authority to permit the mortgage foreclosure to proceed in the state court. <em>See, e. g., Mangus v. Miller, </em>317 U.S. 178, 63 S.Ct. 182, 87 L.Ed. 169 (1942) (ordinary bankruptcy); <em>Thompson v. Magnolia Petroleum Co., </em>309 U.S. 478, 60 S.Ct. 628, 84 L.Ed.2d 876 (1940) (reorganization); <em>Coral Gables First Nat'l Bank v. Constructors of Florida, Inc., </em>299 F.2d 736 (5th Cir. 1962) (reorganization); <em>Allen v. Watkins, </em>234 F.2d 925 (5th Cir. 1956) (ordinary bankruptcy).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">The court having permitted the foreclosure sale to proceed in state court, the question is whether notice to creditors of the state foreclosure sale was mandated by federal law pertaining to corporate reorganizations. It appears clear that once the foreclosure procedure is committed to the state court, no federal notice provisions apply. \u201c[I]f, in the exercise of its discretion, the reorganization court permits a submission of a matter to another proper court in any case, that court has jurisdiction of all the incidents of the litigation within its scope, and the judgment thereon is binding on the trustee, receiver or debtor in possession as the case may be.\u201d 6 <em>Collier on Bankruptcy </em>\u00b6 3.08, at 460 (14th ed. 1977), <em>citing Brown v. Gerdes, </em>321 U.S. 178, 64 S.Ct. 487, 88 L.Ed. 659 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">The Chapter X Rule pertaining to sales of the debtor\u2019s property provides: \u201cThe court may, on such notice as it may direct and for cause shown, authorize the trustee, receiver, or debtor in possession to lease or sell any real or personal property of the debtor, on such terms and conditions as the court may approve.\u201d Rules Bankr. Proc. Rule 10-607(b). Rule 10-209(b)(4) requires the trustee or debtor in possession to give all creditors, stockholders, and indenture trustees no less than 20 days\u2019 notice of \u201cany proposed sale of property, other than in the ordinary course of business, . . . unless the court for cause shown shortens the time or orders a sale without notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">Although Rule 10-209(b)(4) states that notice shall precede \u201cany proposed sale,\u201d it seems clear that the requirement was intended to apply only to sales conducted by the trustee or debtor in possession pursuant to an order under Rule 10-607(b). First, Rule 10-209(b)(4) places the burden of providing the required notice on the party conducting the sale ordered under Rule 10-607(b), the trustee or debtor in possession. Second, Rule 10-209(b)(4) permits sales \u201cin the ordinary course of business\u201d to be made without notice to interested parties. This rule indicates that the scope of the notice rule is limited to sales conducted by one in charge of the continued operation of the debtor\u2019s business. The notice provisions would therefore not apply to sales conducted by state officers in state court foreclosure proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
