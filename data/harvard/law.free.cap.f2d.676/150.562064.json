Finding absolutely no merit to petitioner\u2019s claims, we deny the petition for rehearing but add the following comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-17\">Ms. Beatty, whose brief on petition for rehearing lies perilously near the line separating advocacy from contempt, asserts that we have failed to address the issues raised and therefore \u201care violating the law\u201d and are guilty of \u201chigh crimes\u201d. First, we point out to petitioner that under Rule 21 of the Rules of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, this Court may affirm an opinion with merely five words, \u201cAffirmed. See Local Rule 21.\u201d Despite the lack of respectable authority supporting petitioner\u2019s original position, we wrote a short opinion, ending with the statement, \u201cWe find no other basis for challenging the Tax Court decision.\u201d By this conclusion, we meant no other basis <em>of merit. </em>That we consider it unnecessary to respond to <em>each </em>and <em>every </em>frivolous claim a petitioner raises does not indicate that we have not considered fully those claims, any more than a summary affirmance under Rule 21 would imply a failure to review all claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-19\">In her pro se brief, Ms. Beatty raised in some form the following issues: (1) constitutionality of the withholding provisions (to which she devoted 20 pages of a 29 page brief); (2) the authority of the Commissioner to determine a deficiency against petitioner; and (3) the assessment of penalties under Sections 6651(a), 6653(a), and 6654. She also mentioned, in passing, the following questions: \u201cWas appellant required to file a return when her spouse had done so\u201d; notice of deficiency \u201cdetermined in absence of record and facts;\u201d and \u201cappellant was not a person required to file a \u20181040 return\u2019 \u201d. We summarized some of these claims as \u201cincluding the constitutionality of the withholding provisions, the applicability of the requirement of filing a return to petitioner, and the authority of the Commissioner to assess a deficiency.\u201d 667 F.2d at 501-02. We think our shorthand description more than adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-20\">Petitioner objects to our reference to a \u201ctax protest\u201d case and to our labeling her return a protest return. Her objection might tax the patience of some. The return stated her name, address, marital status, social security number, etc. and answered the majority of the remaining questions with the response \u201cObject Self Incrimination.\u201d She attached to her return a 13 page <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>memo explaining the legal grounds for asserting the Fifth Amendment (consisting of case excerpts and newspaper clippings, etc.). By her own actions, Ms. Beatty has demonstrated that her return is a \u201cprotest\u201d return of the type we have often considered within the criminal context.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">Under the laws of Texas, it is clear that each spouse is liable for federal income tax on his or her share of community property and must report such income. <em>Bowling v. United States, </em>510 F.2d 112,113 (5th Cir. 1975). The record establishes that petitioner\u2019s spouse had income subject to taxation. Petitioner was liable for her share. In addition, petitioner herself earned income, in the form of commissions, subject to taxation under \u00a7 61(a)(1). The Commissioner is authorized under \u00a7 6020(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 to prepare a return for anyone who has failed to do so as required by any internal revenue law and is authorized to issue a notice of deficiency under \u00a7 6212 for taxes imposed under Subtitle A (in which \u00a7 61 is included). Clearly, Ms. Beatty failed to file a proper tax return, had income, both of her own and her community property share of her husband\u2019s wages, for which taxes were not paid, resulting in a deficiency for which the Commissioner was entitled to prepare a return and file a notice of deficiency. The assessment of penalties under \u00a7\u00a7 6651(a), 6653(a) and 6654 was within the Commissioner\u2019s authority. Petitioner failed to rebut the presumption of correctness attaching to the Commissioner\u2019s determination of taxes owed or to show that the Commissioner\u2019s determination that penalties for delinquency and negligence was not correct. Since Ms. Beatty failed to demonstrate that any genuine issue of material fact existed, the Tax Court properly granted summary judgment in this meritless case.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">While we know of few if any citizens who enjoy paying taxes<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the use of our tax dollars is to support the activities of the national government including the federal courts. \u201cTaxes are what we pay for civilized society.... \u201d <em>Compania General de Tabacos v. Collector, </em>275 U.S. 87, 100, 48 S.Ct. 100, 105, 72 L.Ed. 177 (1927) (Holmes, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-10\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b240-6\">. Perhaps the most famous statement concerning taxes is that by Benjamin Franklin, in which he said: \u201cBut in this world nothing is certain but death and taxes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
