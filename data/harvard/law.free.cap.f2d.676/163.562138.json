She brought suit against the telephone company for negligently failing to warn her of the possible danger of electrical shock when using the telephone during an electrical storm.. After a trial on the mer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>its,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the jury rendered its verdict in favor of the defendant. The plaintiff on appeal argues (1) that the trial judge erroneously instructed the jury on the standard of care owed under Mississippi law by the telephone company to the plaintiff customer, whether \u201creasonable\u201d or \u201cordinary\u201d care (as charged) or, instead \u201cthe highest degree of care\u201d; and (2) that the trial judge erroneously excluded evidence of a subsequent warning of this risk issued by the telephone company to its subscribers. Finding that the jury instructions were not erroneous and that no reversible error resulted from exclusion of the evidence, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">\n<em>The Factual Context</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">On June 29, 1971 the plaintiff, Lois Bickerstaff, was injured while talking on her home telephone during a thunderstorm. She alleges that, when she answered the telephone, lightning was conducted through the telephone lines to her telephone, entering her body through her left ear and rendering her unconscious. Bickerstaff was treated at a local hospital for damages to her left eardrum, heightened blood pressure, and a subsequent nervous breakdown.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">She sued the telephone company in Mississippi state court alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that the defendant knew or should have known of the defective design, construction, installation and maintenance of its telephone line, that the defendant breached its duty to the plaintiff to warn of the possibility of such an injury when using the telephone during a thunderstorm, and that the defendant owed the plaintiff the highest degree of care to protect her from the dangers of electricity.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The telephone company removed the action to federal court on the grounds of diversity jurisdiction. At the first trial in March 1980, the plaintiff went to trial relying only upon the failure of the defendant telephone company to warn the plaintiff of the fact that lightning can be conducted into a telephone, as allegedly required in the exercise of the highest degree of care owed to its subscribers. At the close of Bickerstaff\u2019s case the telephone company moved for a directed verdict. The trial judge granted the motion, holding that it is a matter of common knowledge that lightning is a dangerous agency, and that in this instance the defendant was under no duty to warn of matters which were common knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-14\">On Bickerstaff\u2019s appeal from this initial ruling, this court reversed and remanded the case for a new trial. In holding that the judge erred in resolving the key factual question against Bickerstaff on a motion for a directed verdict we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-15\">In this case there is no mystery as to the applicable standard under state law. Mississippi, like nearly all American jurisdictions, holds that a seller or manufacturer has no duty to warn of a danger that is known or obvious to the user .... [Citations omitted.] Stating the settled rule does not dispose of the case, however; it is necessary to decide in each case whether the danger involved is known or obvious. A clearer example of a factual issue is hard to imagine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXb\"><em>Bickerstaff v. South Central Bell Telephone Co., </em>645 F.2d 68 (5th Cir. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-16\">This issue was submitted to the jury at the second trial. From the jury verdict in the second case, Bickerstaff brings this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-17\">\n<em>Standard of Care</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b253-18\">Bickerstaff raises as her first point of error that the trial court incorrectly instructed the jury on the standard of care owed by the telephone company to the plaintiff in this case. The judge instructed the jury that the defendant \u201chad the duty to exercise reasonable care,\u201d and refused the plaintiff\u2019s proposed instruction that the telephone company was under the \u201chighest degree of care\u201d to protect the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>against injury resulting from electricity, which included the alleged duty to warn.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Bickerstaff argues that under the established standard of care in Mississippi, companies using and handling electrical power owe the public the highest degree of care. <em>Mississippi Power and Light Co. v. Shepard, </em>285 So.2d 725, 729-30 (Miss.1973); <em>Cumberland Telephone and Telegraph Company v. Cosnahan, </em>105 Miss. 615, 62 So. 824, 826 (Miss.1913). The plaintiff bases her argument principally on these two cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">In <em>Cosnahan </em>the plaintiff\u2019s decedent, a telephone repairman, had been killed while attempting to untangle a fallen telephone wire, which had become heavily charged with electricity. The telephone company was found negligent in both the stringing of its telephone wires and in its failure to warn and instruct of the danger that would arise when its telephone lines fell (\u201cthey would necessarily come into contact with the [highly charged, uninsulated] electric light wires,\u201d and that would not be known or obvious to an inexperienced employee). <em>Id. </em>62 So. at 826.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">In <em>Shepard </em>the plaintiff\u2019s decedent was electrocuted when the television antenna he was erecting came in contact with an uninsulated electric power line. The court discussed the high degree of care owed by the power company in that situation and ruled that the company\u2019s duty to insulate or guard its lines and issue a warning were questions of fact for the jury. <em>Id., </em>285 So.2d at 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">In the present case the plaintiff does not urge that her telephone equipment was defective or that the company failed to provide her with any available protective device. Additionally, it was stipulated that even with a properly designed, maintained and installed telephone system, it is possible for lightning to enter one\u2019s residence through some portion of the telephone system. Mrs. Bickerstaff solely relies upon the company\u2019s negligent failure to warn of this possibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">The plaintiff correctly urges that, under Mississippi law the highest degree of care is owed to the public with regard to construction, installation, and maintenance of electrical lines. <em>Gordy v. City of Canton, Miss., </em>543 F.2d 558, 561 (5th Cir. 1976). Nevertheless, we do not accept the plaintiff\u2019s argument that this same standard of care must apply in every situation involving telephone equipment in which the plaintiff receives an injury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Several authorities have noted, and we repeat, that the degree of care increases as the danger increases, <em>Gordy v. City of Canton, Miss., supra, </em>543 F.2d at 561; <em>Mississippi Power &amp; Light Co. v. Shepard, supra, </em>285 So.2d at 729-730, 737-38. \u201c \u2018[I]n determining the degree of care to be exercised, it is proper for the jury to take into consideration [various factors enumerated indicating the likelihood of harm or the degree of danger to which one confronting the electric-line hazard is exposed].\u2019 \u201d <em>Shepard, supra, </em>285 So.2d at 737. The testimony presented to the jury showed that the risk of this particular accident, while known to the defendant, was minimal. We are unable to hold that, under the present circumstances the district court erred in rejecting the instruction that the telephone company owed a duty of the \u201chighest degree of care\u201d with regard to warning the plaintiff of the minimal risk involved in using a telephone during a thunderstorm.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">On the previous appeal, we noted that \u201ca seller or manufacturer has no duty to warn of a danger that is known or obvious to the user.\u201d <em>Bickerstaff v. South Central Bell Telephone Company, supra, </em>645 F.2d 68 (5th Cir. 1981); <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Hobart Manufacturing Company, </em>450 F.2d 1176, 1188 (5th Cir. 1971); <em>Harrist v. Spencer-Harris Tool Co., </em>244 Miss. 84, 140 So.2d 558, 562 (1962). On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>the present retrial, therefore, the trial court, instructed the jury that the telephone company had no duty to warn of the likelihood of danger to one using the telephone during a thunderstorm if this likelihood were common knowledge, but that the jury was to decide whether there was such common knowledge. Additionally, the judge instructed the jury that, even if it found that the telephone company was under a \u201cduty to warn of the danger of using a telephone during a thunderstorm,\u201d it must also find that the defendant\u2019s admitted failure to give such a warning was a proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury. (Here, the plaintiff answered a ringing telephone during a thunderstorm; the jury may reasonably have concluded that a normally curious subscriber would have picked up the telephone and answered the call, even if aware of the minimal risk involved and regardless of whether the telephone company had furnished or printed a warning of the minimal hazard involved.)</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">On the basis of Mississippi jurisprudence regarding the duty to warn and in the light of the entire jury instructions, we do not find that the trial court gave erroneous jury instructions regarding the standard of care to be applied to the telephone company under the present factual situation.</p>\n<p id=\"ATN\">\n<em>Exclusion of the \u201cBell Notes\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">In July 1981 (after the Fifth Circuit ruling in the first appeal and before the second trial in August 1981), the t\u00e9lephone company printed in its monthly \u201cBell Notes\u201d, which is distributed to all telephone subscribers, the following warning.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">There is a slight risk of an electrical shock from lightning if you use a telephone during an electrical storm. While our equipment is designed to limit abnormal electrical surges, it is impossible to stop all of them. If you must make a call, keep it brief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-11\">At the second trial Mrs. Bickerstaff listed the \u201cBell Notes\u201d on her amended pretrial order. The defendant filed a <em>motion in limine </em>to exclude the proposed exhibit as being inadmissible proof of subsequent remedial measures, Fed.R.Evid. 407. The trial court sustained this motion before trial, subject to subsequent testimony which would allow the admission of the \u201cBell Notes\u201d under one of the exceptions to Rule 407 \u2014 to prove \u201cownership, control, feasibility of precautionary measures, if controverted, or <em>impeachment.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b255-12\">The plaintiff agrees that the evidence should be excluded on the issue of negligence, but argues that the \u201cBell Notes\u201d were admissible (under the exception to Rule 407) to impeach the testimony of witness Sessler, a supervisor and consultant with the telephone company called as an adverse witness by the plaintiff, and also the testimony of witness Fitzgerald, an electrical engineering professor called by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-13\">Sessler testified that in his opinion that, while such a warning was feasible, it was not advisable or appropriate where the risks were minimal. He subsequently explained that in his opinion a \u201cwarning\u201d was a strong statement that implied an impending danger, requiring a drastic change in behavior. In each instance, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel then moved that in his cross-examination of this witness he be permitted to question him as to the subsequent \u201cwarning\u201d given by Bell to its <em>subscribers </em>\u2014 i.e., why, if (as the witness testified) it was unwise and irresponsible to \u201cblow up\u201d the risk by affording a warning, did Bell subsequently do so? See R.3, pp. 118-119, 122-23. The district court denied these bench motions, without explanation why the exception of \u201cimpeachment\u201d did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Professor Fitzgerald testified that in his experience working with electrical matters he had never talked to anyone who did not know (1) lightning was dangerous, (2) that it could be conducted on wires that come into a house, or (3) that a telephone set was connected with wires. In the cross-examination of this expert, once again counsel for the plaintiff wanted to use the post-accident \u201cwarning\u201d by way of impeachment: \u201cIf Mr. Fitzgerald says that he\u2019s never even heard of anyone who did not know that this is dangerous, then I want to ask him, wonder why South Central Bell started warning everybody beginning in July of 1981?\u201d R.4 at pp. 213-14. The district court again denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">Rule 407 (quoted at note 3) specifically provides that its prohibition of evidence of subsequent remedial measures \u201cto prove negligence or culpable conduct\u201d does not require the exclusion of such evidence \u201cwhen offered for another purpose, such as ... impeachment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The leading authorities on the federal evidence rules have pointed out the difficulties with regard to the \u201cimpeachment\u201d exception. Professor Wright has pointed out that, in connection with the other rules, the impeachment \u201cexception\u201d may swallow up the \u201crule\u201d insofar as utilized on cross-examination of an adverse witness<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> unless strained limitations upon otherwise permissible impeachment testimony are adopted, 23 Wright and Graham, Federal Practice and Procedure, \u00a7 5289 at pp. 146-47 (1980). Judge Weinstein reaches a similar conclusion, 2 Weinstein\u2019s Evidence, HH 407[02] at pp. 407-10 &amp; 11, 407[05] (1981), although he points out that such cross-examination may properly be restricted when its thrust is not to reflect on the witness\u2019s testimony but rather to show that the defendant was negligent, <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 407[05] at p. 407-25. Without extended discussion, Professor Moore merely notes that the trial judge should guard against the improper admission of such evidence \u201cto prove prior negligence under the guise of impeachment.\u201d 10 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice, \u00a7 407.04 at p. IV-159 (2d ed. 1981). Another commentator rather plainly indicates that, where a party opens up the issue by claiming that all reasonable care was exercised at the time, the party\u2019s subsequent conduct by way of alleviation of the hazard is then proper impeachment testimony under the Rule 407 exception. Saltzburg and Redden, Federal Rules of Evidence Manual 181, 183 (3d ed. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">Under these authorities\u2019 preponderant view of the impeachment exception, possibly unwise but nevertheless provided by Rule 407, the district court should probably have allowed these experts to be impeached by the telephone company\u2019s subsequent conduct that tended to contradict their opinions. Particularly in the case of the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>ant\u2019s own consultant Sessler, why \u2014 if indeed as he testified it would be irresponsible to warn customers of this insignificant risk \u2014 did the telephone company in fact later provide such warnings? The three decisions cited by the commentators all allowed impeachment, although perhaps despite occasional broad language their holdings could be distinguished with regard to application to the present facts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See also Annot., Subsequent Remedial Measures, 50 ALR Fed. 935 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Since we have concluded that under the present circumstances, even if error was committed it was harmless, we will assume, without squarely deciding this close issue, that impeachment of these experts should have been allowed, as moved for.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, an error in the exclusion of evidence is not grounds for reversal unless substantial rights are affected or unless the affirmance is inconsistent with substantial justice. Fed.R.Civ.P. 61; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111. Our examination of the record in this regard convinces us that the jury verdict was not affected by the denial of the slight impeachment of these experts by the telephone company\u2019s subsequent conduct inconsistent with their opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The substantial issues of the appeal concerned whether the telephone company was required \u201cin the highest degree of care\u201d to afford these warnings, or whether instead under the \u201cordinary care\u201d standard no such duty was imposed on it; and whether, if the company was under such a duty, its failure to afford the warning was a proximate cause of the injuries. On these issues, the evidence supports the instructions given and the verdict of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">True, the plaintiff argued that even in \u201cordinary care\u201d such a warning was required, in spite of the concededly minimal risk \u2014 and testimony of the defendant\u2019s experts was offered for and impeachable with regard to this issue also: Sessler, that affording such a warning would be irresponsible and counter-productive; Fitzgerald, that no such warning was required because the minimal danger was obvious to every telephone user. But the \u201cwarning\u201d by which their testimony was sought to be impeached \u2014 the \u201cslight risk of an electrical shock\u201d in the use of a telephone during an electrical storm, and the instruction that \u201c[i]f you must make a call, keep it brief\u201d \u2014 , included within a monthly brochure perfunctorily sent one month to telephone subscribers, was not so substantially contradictory of their opinions as to cast more impeaching doubt upon them than was already furnished to the jury through their own contradictory testimony and the virtually undisputed factual background (mini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>mal risk, known to some but not necessarily all subscribers) upon which their testimony rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">For the reasons stated above, we find no reversible merit in either point of error raised by the plaintiff. We therefore AFFIRM the judgment in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b253-8\">. The case was first brought to trial in March 1980. A directed verdict in favor of the defendant was reversed by the Fifth Circuit in an unpublished opinion of April 30, 1981, and the case was remanded. 645 F.2d 68. A full trial on the merits was held in August 1981. At this second trial, the jury rendered a verdict in favor of the defendant, following which the present appeal was taken.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b254-8\">. The defendant argues that Mississippi has applied a lower standard of care to telephone companies. <em>Burch v. Southern Bell Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., </em>178 Miss. 407, 173 So. 300, 302 (Miss. 1937). <em>Burch, </em>however, did not involve an electrical injury. The issue there involved the placement of a telephone wire across a driveway and the injury resulting to a workman riding atop a loaded truck who was caught by the wire and thrown from the truck. We do not find the decision dispositive of the present issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b255-7\">. Fed.R.Evid. 407 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-8\">Rule 407. <em>Subsequent remedial measures. </em>When, after an event, measures are taken which, if taken previously, would have made the event less likely to occur, <em>evidence of the subsequent measures is not admissible to prove negligence or culpable conduct </em>in connection with the event. This rule does not require the exclusion of evidence of subsequent measures when offered for another purpose, such as proving ownership, control, or feasibility of precautionary measures, if controverted, or <em>impeachment. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b256-6\">. See 23 Wright and Graham, Federal Practice and Procedure, \u00a7 5289 at pp. 145-146:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">In ignoring requests to delete \u201cimpeachment\u201d from Rule 407 the Advisory Committee provided a good illustration of what can happen when one common law rule is maintained without attention to the facts that a number of closely related rules have been altered. For example, it is doubtful that the plaintiff, at common law, could have called the defendant to the stand, asked him if he thought he had been negligent, and impeached him with evidence of subsequent repairs if he answered \u201cno.\u201d But after the Advisory Committee provided that a party can impeach his own witness, that a witness can express an opinion on the ultimate issue, and that prior inconsistent statements can be used as substantive evidence, it is difficult to see what is to prevent this. Although some commentators have expressed the hope that trial judges will not permit the rule to be used in this fashion, they have not given much useful advice on how this is to be done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-11\">It is possible that the Advisory Committee intended that the impeachment exception should be used to undermine Rule 407, though this seems unlikely. If not, they have given the trial judge very little power to prevent this result. Negligence or culpability is usually an ultimate issue in the case so that questions going to that issue are clearly relevant. If the defendant or his witnesses are competent to testify on that issue, it is difficult to see how the probative worth of their testimony could be so low as to be excluded under Rule 403. And if the witness testifies that in his opinion there was no negligence, the relevance as impeachment of repairs that he has undertaken or supervised seems clear in view of the \u201cimpeachment\u201d exception in Rule 407; therefore, exclusion under Rule 403 seems difficult to justify.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b257-9\">. <em>In Dollar v.
