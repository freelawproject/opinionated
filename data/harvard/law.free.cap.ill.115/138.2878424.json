If labor and materials are furnished to a party in possession of a lot as a mere tenant at sufferance, with which to enable the occupant to build a house thereon, with knowledge that he is not the owner, and the material and labor and advances are charged-to such occupant alone, the owner of the property not directing or knowing of the improvement until after its completion, the latter will not be liable for the price, nor will his property be subject to any lien therefor.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b138-13\" pgmap=\"138\">6.

N. M. Laws, Judge, presiding.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-4\" pgmap=\"139\">This was a petition by John C. Proctor and Charles W. Tripp, to enforce a lien for materials furnished and labor performed in and about the erection of a dwelling house on a certain lot in the city of Peoria, against Mary Tows and William W. Downing. The defendants are brother and sister. The title to the lot is in Mrs. Tows, but the building was erected at the immediate instance of Downing, and has been occupied by him as a residence since. The claim of the petitioners is, that they furnished the materials and procured the labor to be performed by virtue of a contract with Mrs. Tows, through Downing, as her agent,\u2014or, as an alternative position, that the materials were furnished and labor performed pursuant to a contract with Downing to erect a dwelling house on her lot, and that she, knowing what was being done, silently acquiesced therein. The defendants deny both claims. They contend that Mrs. Tows consented that Downing might build a house upon her lot, and occupy it, indefinitely, free of rent, upon condition of his keeping up repairs and paying taxes, and that she would aid him in building, by advancing means.</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-5\" pgmap=\"139(156) 140(66)\">The material facts disclosed by the record are, Downing had two sisters, Mrs. Tows, the defendant, a married woman, residing in New York, and Mrs. Fuller, residing in Cleveland. Downing\u2019s financial condition was apparently not good, and there was a desire by these sisters to aid him in procuring a home for himself and family. Mrs. Fuller was visiting at Downing\u2019s in the summer of 1877, and she then assisted in selecting the lot which was afterwards purchased by Mrs. Tows, and she subsequently made, or aided in making, drawings and plans for the dwelling house. But she advanced no money, and assumed no liability on account of the purchase of the lot or the erection of the building, and beyond, perhaps, a letter to Mrs. Tows, with regard to the lot, and it may be the mailing to her of the drawings and plans, she had no further participation in the transactions. Information was communicated to Mrs. Tows that the lot could be purchased for $700, but it appears that she was unable to raise more than $650. That amount she sent in a check to Downing, and with it he purchased the lot, and took the deed to Mrs. Tows. Afterwards he proceeded to erect thereon the house on account of which this lien is sought to be enforced.</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-5\" pgmap=\"140(328) 141(407) 142(271)\">Tripp testified, as his evidence is abstracted, that Downing, after getting the deed, came down; \u201csaid he wanted to make arrangements about building on the lot; said he had the money; said they had written him they had money enough. Downing said he wished to go ahead and build the house, and said there was not money enough, and asked credit. I told him as long as he .was authorized to act as her agent in the matter, I would sell him material to build the house; sell him the material and furnish labor and all to build the-house, at ten per cent interest after the house was completed, at the usual prices for all material and labor at what it cost in cash. I furnished the cash-and paid it. That was the offer I made him. After talking it over he said he would have to wait a week to get another letter. He read the letters or told me what they were. I think he read letters that I had not heard read here. She objected to the amount of interest, and said she did not think she could pay that much money. I never saw Mrs. Tows. I don\u2019t want anybody to understand that I ever saw her or received any letters from her. Mr. Downing, represented himself to be her agent. After Mr. Downing had received several letters he said he had some money. He thought they should go ahead. They went to work and put the sills and lower joist down and lower foundation. The bargain was that he was to have a year\u2019s time, with ten per cent interest. The first bargain was along late in the season,\u2014November or December, 1877,\u2014two or three months after he got the lot. The bargain then was to fill the bill just as I have stated. After that he came down and said he had got another letter, in which she refused to furnish the money to build the balance of the house. He made a good deal of complaint about it, and said she did not do as she had agreed. I told him if that was the case I would not furnish the bill of lumber. \u2018Well,\u2019 he says, \u2018I have got money enough to pay for this material for the foundation, and keep it in good shape for the winter.\u2019 He went ahead and finished up that and stopped. In the spring, or toward spring, March or April, he came down, and said: \u2018I have got a letter now, and we will go ahead. I have permission now to go ahead. It is all right.\u2019 I made the bargain to take the cash, provided they sent it, for the bill, with just simply the profit on the lumber, and if they did not send the money, with ten per cent interest. The building was to be completed about June\u2014may.have been latter part. The extent of the time, unless secured on the property, was one year,\u2014that was what he understood and I understood. Ten per cent was the usual rate of interest at that time. I paid it to parties myself. I furnished the amount stated in the bill,\u2014$1102 and some cents. 1 have not seen the bill since the last trial. The bill is $1101.49. I furnished all that material. We charged him no profit on anything only the lumber, and we only charged him the usual profit on that. These charges are the same as had been agreed upon between us. The lumber, material and labor were all used in building the house on this .lot upon which Mr. Downing, lives. They have never paid us any portion of this indebtedness. There is due us the amount of this bill, with interest on it at ten per cent, from July, 1878. I had a conversation with Mr. Downing about this matter, previous to bringing suit. He told me she had refused to pay it, and to commence on her right away. This was in 1879. Mr. Downing moved into the house when completed, and has lived there ever since.\u201d On cross-examination he testified: \u201cMr. Downing did not pretend, when we talked at the time of this contract, that he had seen Mrs. Tows, but that he had letters. He said he had letters. I did not ask to see the letters. He told me what the contents were, and I supposed that what he said was in the letters. He did not claim to state any conversation with Mrs. Tows\u2014\u25a0 only claimed to state the contents of the letters, in different letters. They are not all here. I have heard things that are not here. I only know what he told me.\u201d He further said: \u201cI do not think he saw Mrs. Tows. She was in New York, and he running a train. He told me at one time that Mrs. Tows refused to pay, and that was the reason I stopped. At one time he said he thought charges had been made 'on the books against Mrs. Tows, and he added that the account was charged to W. W. Downing as agent. He produced the books, and then admitted that there was no charge against Mrs. Tows, and none against W. W. Downing as agent. The entire bill was charged against William W. Downing alone. \u201d He also said: \u201cI knew the deed was made to Mrs. Tows. * * *' I knew the lot was in her name, for his use. There was nothing in the deed that said for his use, but he told me so. \u201d\u25a0 After testifying as to the sending the lumber up to Downing, he proceeds thus: \u201cHe gave directions how to charge it. He told me to charge it to Mr. Downing. Never heard of anybody else in connection with it. All my orders were, that when there was an order given to send the lumber, was directed to take my orders from Mr. Downing. I did so. \u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-5\" pgmap=\"142(142) 143(285)\">Downing testified that he made the contract for the lumber, etc., with Tripp, in his own name; that he did not represent that he was the agent of Mrs. Tows, or contract in her name as such. His language is : \u201cAt the time of making the contract there was no time set for payment\u2014he was to give me all the time I wanted. That is all the contract there was\u2014 that he -would furnish the lumber, and take me for it. There was no Mrs. Tows mentioned, nor Mrs. somebody else. She was not mentioned, only occasionally. When the $350 came I told him she said she would not send any more. She sent me $350 to assist me to put up the building. I told him of it. There was nothing said about her liability, or what she would do in the matter. I never mentioned Mrs. Tows\u2019 name in buying the lumber, as agent or otherwise. Tripp never told me that he would not furnish further supplies unless Mrs. Tows would be responsible for it. There never was any conversation of the kind, and Tripp knows it. I bought the lumber on my own credit. Tripp agreed to give me all the time I wanted. I was to pay for it as I could get the money. I stated all the circumstances. I did not cover up anything. He said go ahead, and he would see me through. I bought in my own name, and he did not give time to pay anything on it until he sued me. I never said that I was acting as her agent, in any way, shape or form, only in buying the lot.\u201d He says Mrs. Tows sent him the $350 above alluded to, in a letter, late in the fall of 1877, and that he showed Tripp no more letters after that. He was asked this question: \u201cIf he sold the lumber to you, and did all this work upon your credit, why did you take any of these letters dovm and read them to him?\u201d To which he responded: \u201cTo show him I was trying to get them to help me, and so I could pay him. He was interested in getting his money, as much as I was in paying him. He had nothing to do with Mrs. Tows. I took him the letters to show him I was disappointed in getting the money, and that I was not going back on him. I supposed she would help me out. \u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-5\" pgmap=\"143\">Letters written by Mrs. Tows were introduced in evidence, as follows:</summary><summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-6\" pgmap=\"143\">First\u2014To W.

I could not get any more, yet at the same time I do not want you to lose it. But before paying for it, you must get a reliable man who understands those things, to make a thorough investigation of the title. See that there are no judgments now or have been against him, as they could come against the property at any time if there were. You must have some lawyer do this for you,\u2014some one that you can depend upon to make out an abstract of the property, for I should not like to lose it, -as I am denying myself many comforts and pleasures to accomplish this, as F. knows nothing about it. And now, in regard to the house. One of the size you name can be built here for $900. Either they are charging too much, or material is much more expensive there than here. I would not dare to undertake so much at present, so I think you had better put up a back building,\u2014say a dining room and kitchen for the winter, with two rooms over,\u2014and which will make you comfortable, and stop the rent. In the spring, I hope to get as far as that, if I am strong enough, and then we will see about the front house. This I should say should not exceed $300. At any rate, see what can be done, and when the title is complete, begin at once. Leave space enough in front for house and garden.

I never authorized W. W. Downing to act as my agent in making any contract or agreement upon any building in Peoria, and I never had any notice that any person claimed to so act for me. William W. Downing is my brother. I purchased a lot in the city of Peoria, and paid for the same with my own means, for the purpose of giving a home to my brother. I sent him the money to put up a small rear building on said lot, to be used as a home for my brother. I never agreed to furnish any more money, and did not know anybody was putting a building on there upon my credit or the credit of my property. I never consented to any building being put upon my lot upon my credit. I knew my brother was erecting a small rear building on the lot, for which I sent him the $350.\u201d On cross-examination: \u201cI bought the lot as a home for my brother and his family. I paid $650 for the lot, and took the title in my own name. No one ever consulted me about the building. I hold the property absolutely in my own right. My brother bought the lot for me.

It will be observed, by reading it, that there is no proof that Mrs. Tows authorized Downing to contract debts in her name, or in anywise to incumber her property. The only semblance of evidence to that effect will be found in the declarations of Downing, testified to by Tripp, and which Downing denies to have been made. Concedijig they were made, they prove nothing, for Mrs. Tows was not present, and is not shown to have ever approved of them or even to have heard of them. An agency can not be proved by the mere declarations of an agent, when the fact of agency is in issue. (Whiteside v. Margaret, 51 Ill. 507; Ranson, v. Curtiss, 19 id. 456; Maxey et al. v. Heckethorn, 44 id. 437.) The evidence both of Mrs. Tows and Downing, moreover, expressly negatives the fact of agency. There is evidence that Mrs. Tows knew that Downing was building a house upon her land, but not upon her credit. She had given him $350 with which to build the house, and there is no proof that she knew that he was building a house to cost more than that sum, much less that he was contracting debts by such building, in her name, or to be charged against her property. There is not only no actual, but, also, no implied ratification of any act of Downing, in that respect, as the act of her agent, for an implied ratification must be based upon a full knowledge of all the facts. Cadwell v. Meek, 17 Ill. 220; Manufacturers\u2019 National Bank v. Barnes, 65 id. 69; Farwell v. Meyer, 35 id. 40.</p> <p id=\"b149-5\" pgmap=\"149\">If it be conceded that Downing was the agent of Mrs. Tows, to build a house on her property, still it would not follow that his power to bind her was unlimited. An agent furnished with funds and instructed to build a house with those funds, has no implied power to build on credit. The mere possession of this property by Downing conferred no power on him to bind anybody\u2019s interest but his own. Baxter v. Hutchings, 49 Ill. 116; McCarty v. Carter, id. 55.</p> <p id=\"b149-6\" pgmap=\"149(134) 150(166)\">It can not even be said there is satisfactory evidence that anybody but Downing was intended to be credited in the matter of this building. It is indeed positively affirmed by Tripp that the credit, at Downing\u2019s request, was given to Mrs. Tows, but this is as positively denied by Downing, and the books of the petitioners tend to corroborate Downing. The petitioners are not only charged with knowledge by the record, but they actually knew that this lot belonged to Mrs. Tows. It was, then, incumbent on them, before they advanced money and furnished materials on her credit, to know that the party at whose instance they advanced and furnished them, was lawfully empowered by her to receive them on her credit. Had they observed this precaution, it may be that the house would not have been built,\u2014it is-certain they would not have been losers. As it is, their loss is the result of their own negligence. The lien can not be enforced against the interests of Mrs. Tows. Had Downing any legal title or estate in the property, that title or estate might, undoubtedly, be sold. But he has none. The absolute title in fee is in Mrs. Tows. Downing is a mere tenant at sufferance. She may let him stay there a lifetime, or she may turn him out without delay. He has taken his chances, and built upon the property without any definite contract as to the time he shall be allowed to enjoy possession. The conveyance of the property would forfeit Downing\u2019s tenancy, and terminate his interest. King v. Lawson, 98 Mass. 309; Palmer v. Bowker, 106 id. 317; Cunningham v. Holton, 55 Me. 36; Recklaw v. Schanck, 43 N. Y. 488; Squires v. Fithian, 27 Mo. 138; 1 Washburn on Real Prop. 582.</p> <p id=\"b150-5\" pgmap=\"150\">We see no cause to disturb the judgment of the Appellate Court, and it is therefore affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b150-6\" pgmap=\"150\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
