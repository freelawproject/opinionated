It concerns the admission and amusement tax, which, for convenience, we shall refer to as the admissions tax, authorized by Md.Code Ann. art. 81, \u00a7\u00a7 402-411 and imposed by local ordinance. In particular, the question is whether and to what extent the \u201cadditional\u201d admissions tax authorized by \u00a7 402(c) is to be counted for purposes of the maximum \u201crate of tax\u201d set by \u00a7 403. At one time, the answer to that question was very clear; unfortunately, in an attempt to clarify other provisions in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>the admissions tax law, the General Assembly, in 1972, made it unclear.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">We can frame the question by examining pertinent parts of three provisions. Sections 402(a) and (b), respectively, allow counties and incorporated municipalities to levy a tax \u201con the gross receipts of every person ... obtained from sources within the county [or municipality] derived from the amounts charged for\u201d admission to certain types of places described in those subsections.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The tax, though imposed locally, is to be collected by the Comptroller.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Section 402(c) authorizes the counties and incorporated cities and towns to levy</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">\u201can additional tax of five cent[s] (5$) for each person provided with an admission without charge or at reduced rates whenever a charge for admission is made to any other person not in excess of fifty cents (50$); and a tax of ten cents (10$) whenever a charge [f]or admission to such other persons is in excess of fifty cents (50$), but not in excess of one dollar ($1.00); and a tax of fifteen cents (15$) whenever a charge for admission to such other person is in excess of one dollar ($1.00).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">That tax also is to be collected by the Comptroller.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Finally, \u00a7 403(a) provides, in relevant part, that: \u201cThe rate of tax imposed under \u00a7 402 shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the gross receipts of every person, firm or corporation subject to the tax____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">Prince George\u2019s County has imposed a tax under \u00a7 402(a) at the rate of 10%. It has also imposed the \u201cadditional\u201d tax authorized by \u00a7 402(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">Appellant Wild World, Inc. operates a water amusement park in Prince George\u2019s County. To enter the park, a patron must buy an admission ticket that has a fixed price of more than $1.00. Not everyone pays the full fixed price, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>however. Through the use of coupons issued by appellant and made generally available to the public, if one person pays the full admission price, other persons, in his or her group may enter the park at a reduced price. Indeed, the record indicates that some 60-70% of the tickets actually sold are at a reduced price.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Appellant collected from patrons and remitted to the Comptroller 10% of the gross receipts it received from all ticket sales, including 10% of the revenue from reduced price admissions. It did not collect or remit, however, the additional 15$/ticket imposed pursuant to \u00a7 402(c), arguing that the collection of that additional tax would cause the total tax to exceed the 10% maximum rate established by \u00a7 403(a). Appellant\u2019s argument was rejected by the Comptroller, by the Maryland Tax Court, and by the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The issue, as we said at the outset, is purely a legal one of statutory interpretation; there is no dispute of underlying fact, no contest over the Comptroller\u2019s arithmetic, and no issue requiring any administrative expertise. Appellant looks at the language of \u00a7 403(a)\u2014that \u201c[t]he rate of tax imposed under \u00a7 402 shall not exceed [10%] of the gross receipts,\u201d points out that the \u201cadditional\u201d tax is imposed under \u00a7 402, and concludes, <em>ergo, </em>that it is subject to the 10% limitation. The Comptroller counters with what is essentially a two-part argument. First, he says, the limitation in \u00a7 403(a) is on the \u201crate of tax\u201d imposed under \u00a7 402; the tax authorized by \u00a7 402(a) and (b) <em>is </em>a rate applied to gross receipts, but the tax under \u00a7 402(c) is a \u201cflat\u201d tax on specific amounts and therefore not a \u201crate.\u201d Second, he urges that, to the extent there is any ambiguity, we should consider the general legislative intent which, he claims, supports his reading of the statutes. We agree with the Comptroller in both respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Section 402(c) is hardly a model of clarity, and so, in approaching the issue, it might be helpful to examine, in some more concrete fashion, how these provisions operate (or at least how the Comptroller urges they should operate). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>If an amusement operator\u2014a park owner such as appellant\u2014had a fixed admission price for adults of $5.00 and a separate fixed price for children of $2.00 and the $2.00 reduced price for children was not dependent upon an adult admission, the total tax would be under \u00a7 402(a) or (b). If an adult and one child entered under that arrangement, the tax would be 70c\u201450c on the adult ticket and 20c on the child\u2019s ticket, assuming a 10% rate. No tax would be imposed under \u00a7 402(c) because the reduced price for the child\u2019s ticket was not dependent upon the admission of any other person. That would be true as well if the child were admitted free; in that event, the total tax would be 50 for the adult\u2019s ticket.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">If, however, the $2.00 admission price for children was dependent upon an adult paying the $5.00 charge, both taxes would be imposed. In that event, under \u00a7 402(a) or (b), 50c would be collected on the adult\u2019s ticket and 20c would be collected on the child\u2019s; in addition, another 15c would be collected on the child\u2019s reduced price admission based on the fact that the price of the adult admission exceeded $1.00.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the child was admitted free, a 50c tax under \u00a7 402(a) or (b) would be collected on the adult\u2019s ticket and 15c would be collected under \u00a7 402(c) on the child\u2019s admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Using these examples, one can see that the tax under \u00a7 402(c) is truly an \u201cadditional\u201d tax. If the tax rate imposed pursuant to \u00a7 402(a) or (b) is at the maximum 10% permitted under \u00a7 403(a), the effect of imposing the tax under \u00a7 402(c) would, in virtually every case, result in a gross tax in excess of 10% of appellant\u2019s gross receipts. Only if the tax rate imposed under \u00a7 402(a) or (b) were less than the maximum allowed rate of 10% could the tax under \u00a7 402(c) be collected without the combined tax exceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>10% of gross receipts. Whether \u00a7 403(a) permits the counties and incorporated municipalities to impose the full 10% under \u00a7 402(a) or (b) <em>and </em>impose and collect the \u201cadditional\u201d tax under \u00a7 402(c) is the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">The primary canon of statutory construction has always been to give effect to the intention of the Legislature. <em>State v. Fabritz, </em>276 Md. 416, 421, 348 A.2d 275 (1975); <em>Haskell v. Carey, </em>294 Md. 550, 556, 451 A.2d 658 (1982). In <em>Kaczorowski v. City of Baltimore, 309 </em>Md. 505, 525 A.2d 628 (1987), the Court explained that, while a court should follow the plain meaning of the words used by the Legislature, the \u201crule is not rigid.\u201d A statute must be read,, not in isolation, but to give effect to the purpose intended by the Legislature. At 514-15, 525 A.2d 628, the Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ4\">\u201cWhen we pursue the context of statutory language, we are not limited to the words of the statute as they are printed in the Annotated Code. We may and often must consider other \u2018external manifestations\u2019 or \u2018persuasive evidence,\u2019 including a bill\u2019s title and function paragraphs, amendments that occurred as it passed through the legislature, its relationship to earlier and subsequent legisla-' tion, and other material that fairly bears on the fundamental issue of legislative purpose or goal, which becomes the context within which we read the particular language before us in a given case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Under this view, a construing court appears to be limited to the precise words of the statute only when they are \u201cclearly consistent with [the] apparent purpose (and not productive of any absurd result)____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 515, 525 A.2d 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">In order to gain a full appreciation of the legislative purpose behind \u00a7\u00a7 402 and 403, one must examine some of the legislative history of those provisions. Although these provisions, or their precursors, have been part of the Maryland law since 1936, we may begin with 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">The law at that time provided for both a State and a local tax on admissions. Md.Code Ann. art. 81, \u00a7 402 (1965 Repl.Vol., 1968 Supp.) imposed a State tax of one-half of one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>percent on gross receipts from admissions. Section 403 authorized Baltimore City, 13 of the counties, and the incorporated municipalities in those 13 counties to levy their own tax on such receipts. Although any local tax was to be levied \u201cto the same extent and in the same manner as that levied by the State,\u201d the \u201crate of tax which may be levied\u201d by the subdivisions \u201cneed not be the same as that imposed by the State.\u201d Section 403(a). The Comptroller was to collect both the State and the local tax. Section 404 levied an \u201cadditional\u201d State tax on free and reduced price admissions at precisely the rate stated currently in \u00a7 402(c). There was no counterpart provision to current \u00a7 403(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">By 1969 Md.Laws, ch. 161, the General Assembly increased the State tax to 4V2%. The \u201cadditional\u201d State tax on free and reduced price admissions provided for in \u00a7 404 was not affected. In a subsequent special session in December, 1969, the Legislature again amended \u00a7 402 to tax some types of admissions at the previous rate of <em>lk% </em>rather than at the new rate of 4V2%.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">In 1971, the Legislature rewrote the law once again, on both an interim and, what it thought would be, a permanent basis. For one year\u2014fiscal year 1972\u2014it reduced the State tax under \u00a7 402 to <em>xk%, </em>the proceeds of which, after deducting the cost of administration, the Comptroller was to pay over to the subdivisions. The local tax, authorized under \u00a7 403, and the \u201cadditional\u201d State tax imposed under \u00a7 404 were not disturbed for that year. See 1971 Md.Laws, ch. 429, Sec. 1. Effective July 1, 1972, however, the whole structure was changed. <em>Id., </em>Secs. 2 and 3. The State tax was repealed outright. Section 402 was rewritten to authorize the counties and incorporated cities and towns to impose a local admissions tax. The remaining sections dealing with the admissions tax were repealed, thereby leaving no provision for (1) the Comptroller to collect the tax, (2) any maximum or fixed rate of tax, or (3) the \u201cadditional\u201d tax on free or reduced price admissions. All of the law governing the admissions tax would have been contained in the newly rewritten \u00a7 402.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>The Legislative Council\u2014the then-counterpart of the Legislative Policy Committee (see Md.Code Ann. art. 40, \u00a7\u00a7 27-40, 1965 Repl. Vol.)\u2014evidently realized that the Legislature had acted somewhat precipitously, and so it proposed a bill to the 1972 session that would have added new sections 403 and 404 (1) to set a maximum rate for the local tax of 10%, (2) within that maximum, to allow the subdivisions to tax various admissions at different rates (\u00a7 403), and (3) to allow the local governments to have the tax collected by the Comptroller (\u00a7 404). See Report to the General Assembly of 1972, Legislative Council of Maryland, in particular committee reports, minutes, and proposed bill concerning Item 66(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">The simple bill proposed by the Legislative Council (H.B. 31) was substantially amended during the legislative process, however, resulting in another wholesale rewriting of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The final version (1972 Md.Laws, ch. 689) took account of the three concerns noted by the Legislative Council. With amendments not relevant here, \u00a7\u00a7 403 and 404 were enacted as proposed by the Legislative Council.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Legislature also decided to add back into the law (or, more appropriately, to block the deletion from the law) a number of other provisions that would have been repealed under the 1971 Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See, for example, \u00a7\u00a7 405-411 of art. 81 dealing with exemptions from the tax, the manner of reporting and collection, penalties for evasion of the tax, and remittance of the proceeds of the tax by the Comptroller. One of the provisions added back was the \u201cadditional\u201d tax at issue here. Unfortunately, and for reasons shrouded in the collective mind of the House Committee on Ways and Means, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>that provision was added to \u00a7 402, as subsection (c), rather than placed in a separate section, as it formerly had been.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">It is, of course, that placement in \u00a7 402 that has created the issue before us, for no corresponding amendment was made to \u00a7 403(a). Had the \u201cadditional tax\u201d been authorized in a separate section, there could be no doubt (and indeed appellant conceded at oral argument) that it would not be subject to, or taken into account for purposes of, \u00a7 403(a). What effect, then, do we give to this placement of the language?</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">There is no independent evidence or indication in any of the available legislative history that the Legislature intended to change this aspect of the law from what it had been. The \u201cadditional\u201d tax on free or reduced price admissions had been part of the admissions tax law since the original enactment of that law in 1936. See Md.Laws 1936 (Spec. Sess.), ch. 10, \u00a7 3; Md.Laws 1937, ch. 231, \u00a7 2; Md.Laws 1939, ch. 277, \u00a7 4. Indeed, despite changes in the rate of the basic tax from time to time (see ante), the amount or rate of the \u201cadditional\u201d tax\u20145c if the principal ticket price was 50c or less, 10c if that ticket price was between 50c and $1.00, and 15c if that ticket price was over $1.00\u2014has remained the same since 1936. In the title to ch. 689, as amended to reflect the amendments made to the substantive provisions, the Legislature made clear that one purpose of the bill was \u201cto provide for a tax on admissions without charge or at reduced rates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">If appellant\u2019s position prevails, that intent would be entirely frustrated. As we observed earlier, if the county or municipality imposed the general admissions tax at the full 10% rate allowed by \u00a7 403(a), it could not, as a practical matter, also impose or collect the \u201cadditional\u201d tax under \u00a7 402(c), for that would necessarily result in a tax liability in excess of 10% of gross receipts. One section or the other, then\u2014\u00a7 402(c) or \u00a7 403(a)\u2014would be rendered nugatory, which is hardly a desirable reading of the statute or one that would seem to comport with legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>That is not the extent of the problem, however. Even if the county or municipality imposed the general admissions tax at a rate less than 10%, unless that rate were significantly less than 10%, it would be practically impossible to administer both taxes, for one could never be certain at the time of admission whether the \u201cadditional\u201d tax under \u00a7 402(c) would, in fact, cause the total tax to exceed 10% of gross receipts. At what point during the reporting period would the amusement owner stop collecting the \u201cadditional\u201d tax? Appellant\u2019s response, at oral argument, was that he would continue to collect the \u201cadditional\u201d tax from patrons but that if, at the end of the reporting period, it turned out he had collected too much, he would simply keep the excess as though it were part of the admission price. We certainly do not share that view. There is no indication that the Legislature intended to have amusement owners collect a tax from patrons and keep any part of it as a windfall.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">In summary, then, it seems clear to us that the Legislature could not have intended, simply by placing the \u201cadditional\u201d tax in \u00a7 402, to have the statute read as appellant desires. To be complete, however, we look to see if the Comptroller\u2019s reading is permitted by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Section 403(a) states that the \u201crate of tax\u201d imposed under \u00a7 402 shall not exceed 10% of the gross receipts of the person subject to the tax. That clearly applies to the tax imposed under \u00a7 402(a) or (b), for the tax authorized by those subsections is plainly stated to be \u201con the gross receipts\u201d of the taxpayer. The tax authorized by \u00a7 402(c) is <em>not </em>based on the gross receipts, however. It is on individual admissions and is neither measured by nor has any relationship to either the amount actually received for the reduced price (or free) admission (see n. 2, ante), or to the taxpayer\u2019s gross receipts from any or all admissions. Moreover, it is neither expressed nor really expressible as a \u201crate.\u201d If the measuring full price is lOe, the \u201crate,\u201d based on a 5e tax, would be 50%; if the measuring full price is 50\u00abu, the \u201crate,\u201d based on a 5$ tax, would be 10%; if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>measuring full price is 60c, the \u201crate,\u201d based on a 10c tax, would be 16.7%; if the measuring full price is $10.00, the \u201crate,\u201d based on a 15c tax, would be 1.5%.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">On this analysis, it is apparent to us that the Comptroller\u2019s view of the statutory interplay is fully supported by a literal reading of \u00a7 403(a). That, together with the absurd or inconsistent results flowing from appellant\u2019s interpretation, lead us to conclude that the judgment of the Circuit Court should and must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-12\">. To the extent that an incorporated municipality within a county imposes its own tax, the county may not levy the county tax on receipts obtained from sources within the municipality.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b191-6\">. Although the tax is on the reduced price admission, it is determined by the price of the required regular price admission. If the child\u2019s ticket was 50$ (or was free), for example, and the parent\u2019s ticket was 75$, the tax under \u00a7 402(c) would be 10$.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b194-6\">. Section 404(a) was amended to <em>require </em>the Comptroller to collect the tax; the initial bill provided that the Comptroller \"may\u201d collect the tax at the request of the local legislative body.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b194-7\">. It must be remembered that sections 2 and 3 of the 1971 Act never actually took effect. They were to become effective on July 1, 1972, but ch. 689, which took effect June 30, 1972, intervened and replaced that Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
