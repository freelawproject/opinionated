The court conducted a disposition hearing and committed appellant to the custody of the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene for an appropriate residential placement. The court also conducted a restitution hearing and ordered appellant and her mother to pay, jointly and severally, $297.00 for the medical expenses of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>the victim. Appellant raises three questions which we have partially rephrased:</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">I. Whether the evidence was sufficient to support the judgment of restitution because there was no proof that the victim\u2019s injuries related to appellant\u2019s delinquent act?</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">II. Whether there was proof that the victim\u2019s medical expenses were reasonable and whether the trial judge erred in permitting the victim\u2019s mother to give testimony that the medical expenses were reasonable?</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">III. Whether the restitution judgment was invalid because the trial judge failed to consider the age and circumstances of the child?</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">Appellant and several other minor girls were angry with the victim and wanted to \u201cget her\u201d. On the pretext of buying the victim a soda, appellant and her companions lured the victim into an open field. Once in the field, appellant brought her hands up and under the victim\u2019s neck, a maneuver known in wrestling as a \u201cfull Nelson\u201d, and threw the victim to the ground. Appellant\u2019s companions then beat the victim until she bled and her nose and cheekbone were broken.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">At the restitution hearing, the victim\u2019s mother testified that shortly after the attack she took the victim to the local hospital\u2019s emergency room for treatment. The victim was treated and released. The mother also testified that she incurred $297.00 in medical expenses as a result of the victim\u2019s injuries. These expenses included x-rays, a small pharmaceutical charge and, presumably, the standard emergency room fee. On cross-examination, the mother admitted her lack of first hand knowledge that appellant and her companions were the cause of the victim\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-11\">Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 3-829(a) (1984 Repl.Vol. &amp; Cum.Supp.) states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>(a) The court may enter a judgment of restitution against the parent of a child, or the child in any case in which the court finds a child has committed a delinquent act and during the commission of that delinquent act has:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-5\">(2) Inflicted personal injury on another, requiring the injured person to incur medical, dental, hospital, or funeral expenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">\u00a7 3-801(k) of the Courts Article, <em>supra, </em>defines \u201cDelinquent Act\u201d as \u201can act which would be a crime if committed by an adult.\u201d Under Maryland law, assault and battery is not a single offense, but rather refers to two crimes or if it refers to the crime of battery, the word \u201cassault\u201d is superfluous. <em>Woods v. State, </em>14 Md.App. 627, 632, 288 A.2d 215 (1972); R. Gilbert and C. Moylan, Jr., <em>Maryland Criminal Law Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 3.2 (1983 and 1985 Supp.). Under the facts of this case, appellant\u2019s delinquent act would be characterized as a battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">In any event, either assault or battery is a misdemeanor and all participants are chargeable as principals. <em>Ellison v. State, </em>56 Md.App. 567, 581, 468 A.2d 413 (1983); 1 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law \u00a7 198 (14th ed. 1979 and 1987 Supp.). On this basis, appellant is liable for the full amount of the restitution judgment regardless of the degree of her participation. Gilbert and Moylan, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 21.2. The fact that appellant\u2019s participation in the attack was not the immediate cause of the injuries to the victim which required medical attention is irrelevant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Appellant\u2019s second argument, that the evidence completely failed to support a restitution judgment for any amount, is meritless. Appellant asserts that the mother\u2019s testimony did not establish that the medical treatment related to the victim\u2019s injuries stemming from the attack. The mother\u2019s testimony provided sufficient evidence of this relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Here the basic question raised by appellant is whether there was sufficient proof of the reasonableness of the medical expenses in the amount of $297.00. The statute, Courts Article \u00a7 3-829(c) limits, in the case of personal injuries, the amount of the judgment authorized by subsection (a) to \u201creasonable medical ... [and] hospital ... expenses\u201d not to exceed $5,000.00.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Although the State had access to the actual medical bills,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it failed to introduce them at the restitution hearing. Inexplicably the State relied solely upon the testimony of the victim\u2019s mother to prove the amount of the expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">Appellant cites <em>Metroplitan Auto Sales v. Koneski, </em>252 Md. 145, 154, 249 A.2d 141 (1969) and <em>Kujawa v. Baltimore Transit Co., </em>224 Md. 195, 208, 167 A.2d 96 (1961) for the proposition that medical bills, even if placed in evidence, are inadequate to prove the reasonableness of the charges they reflect. <em>See also Thomas v. Owens, </em>28 Md.App. 442, 346 A.2d 662 (1975) and 25A C.J.S. \u00a7 162(10) (1966 and Cum. Supp.). We see no reason why the rule should not be applied in this case which the Court stated in <em>Kujawa v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number><em>Baltimore Transit Co., </em>224 Md. 195 at 208, 167 A.2d 96 (1961) and quoted in <em>Metroplitan, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-5\">\u201cThe medical bills, absent a showing of reasonableness, were properly excluded. Evidence of the amount or payment of medical bills does not establish the reasonable value of the services for which the bills were rendered or justify recovery therefore. * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">252 Md. at 154, 249 A.2d 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">In <em>Kujawa, </em>at trial, the mother of the plaintiff was not allowed to prove the proffered unauthenticated medical bills. The Court of Appeals affirmed and stated in 208:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AM\">In excluding the other medical bills, the court did not require the personal appearance of the billing doctors. The only requirement was that the plaintiffs should \u201chave evidence\u201d that the charges were reasonable. The medical bills, absent a showing of reasonableness, were properly excluded. Evidence of the amount or payment of medical bills does not establish the reasonable value of the services for which the bills were rendered or justify recovery therefor. 25 C.J.S., <em>Damages, </em>\u00a7 162(6), citing <em>Washington, B. &amp; A. Elec. R. Co. v. Kimmey, </em>141 Md. 243, 118 Atl. 648 (1922).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-8\"><em>Kujawa </em>does not require the actual presence of the billing entities but only that there is evidence that the charges are reasonable. It would have been a simple matter, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>for the State to have had a representative of the hospital testify and to have introduced the actual bills. Restitution procedures under \u00a7 3-829 may result in a judgment that is just as much a judgment as one rendered in a tort or any other action for damages; therefore, we hold that the same rules, as to the introduction of bills for claimed expenses, apply. We will strike the judgment and remand for further proceedings in accordance with the foregoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">Although we have remanded under II, for the purpose of judicial economy, we will address appellant\u2019s third issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Appellant argues that the judgment was invalid because the court failed to consider the age and circumstances of the child as required by Court\u2019s Article, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 3-829(b) which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-4\">(c) Considering the age and circumstances of the child, the court may order the child to make restitution to the wronged party personally.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The import of this section is clear. A trial court need not impose a restitution judgment against a child, but should it choose to do so the trial court must consider the age and circumstances of the child. Whenever liability is jointly imposed upon a child and a parent, as in the present case, the commands of this section must nonetheless be met. The only remaining issue is whether the record reflects a sufficient examination by the trial court of the age and circumstances of appellant prior to the imposition of the restitution judgment. The trial court did consider these factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3-818 of the Courts Article, the trial court received into evidence at the disposition hearing a \u201cprogress report\u201d from the State Department of Juvenile Services. The report made the trial court aware of: 1) a prior delinquent act of appellant\u2019s, 2) appellant\u2019s disquieting home life, 3) appellant\u2019s general poor attitude towards school and authority, and 4) the Department\u2019s recommendations. The progress report and the State\u2019s petition made the trial court aware of appellant\u2019s age.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">It is clear from the record that the trial court not only became aware of appellant\u2019s age and circumstances, but also considered these factors in making its disposition and order of restitution, even though it did not explicitly restate this consideration at the time of the restitution hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">JUDGMENT VACATED; CASE REMANDED FOR PROCEEDINGS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS OPINION; COSTS TO BE PAID ONE-THIRD BY APPELLANT AND TWO-THIRDS BY CECIL COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b58-8\">. In her reply brief, appellant argues that \u00a7\u00a7 3-829(a) and (c), when read together, forbid a juvenile court from entering a restitution judgment against appellant when the undisputed facts were that appellant did not physically cause the victim\u2019s injuries. Appellant cites <em>In Re Herbert B., </em>303 Md. 419, 426-27, 494 A.2d 680 (1985) and <em>In Re Jose S., </em>304 Md. 396, 401-03, 499 A.2d 936 (1985) in support of this proposition. While not disagreeing with any conclusion or legal import of either cited case or of \u00a7\u00a7 3-829(a) and (c), we do not read those authorities to modify common law principles of accomplice liability. <em>In Re Herbert B. </em>and <em>In Re Jose S. </em>are distinguishable, if not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>for other reasons, because accomplice liability was never an issue before the Court of Appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b59-10\">. That the same standard should be applied here as is applied in the District Court under Md.Rule 3-701, Small Claims Actions, was not argued and for that reason we do not address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b59-11\">. The bills would have reflected medical expenses of $298.95. The mother\u2019s testimony, however, established that the charges were $297.00.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
