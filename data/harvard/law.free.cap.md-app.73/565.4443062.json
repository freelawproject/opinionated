That the admission of the blood test evidence was: (a) not in compliance with MD.FAM.LAW CODE ANN. \u00a7 5-1029; and (b) a violation of appellant\u2019s due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights;</p>\n<p id=\"b593-13\">II.

Shanholtz, </em>57 Md.App. 92, 468 A.2d 1365, <em>cert. denied </em>300 Md. 90, 475 A.2d 1201 (1984), in which we held that by virtue of legislative enactment, blood test results which meet certain threshold requirements are admissible. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>This controversy is governed by \u00a7 5-1029 of the MD. FAM.LAW CODE ANN. (1984) which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">5-1029. Blood tests.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-6\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014On the motion of a party to the proceeding or on its own motion, the court shall order the mother, child, and alleged father to submit to blood tests to determine whether the alleged father can be excluded as being the father of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-7\">(b) <em>Approved laboratory </em>required.\u2014The blood tests shall be made in a laboratory selected by the court from a list of laboratories provided by the Administration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-8\">(c) <em>Form of </em>results.\u2014The laboratory shall report the results of each blood test in writing and in the form the court requires.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-9\">(d) <em>Copies of results. </em>A copy of the results of each blood test shall be provided to the parties or their counsel in the manner that the court directs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-10\">(e) <em>Results as </em>evidence.\u2014(1) The results of each blood test shall be received in evidence if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-11\">(i) definite exclusion is established; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-12\">(ii) the testing is sufficiently extensive to exclude 97.3% of alleged fathers who are not biological fathers, and the statistical probability of the alleged father\u2019s paternity is at least 97.3%.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-16\">(2) A laboratory report is prima facie evidence of the results of a blood test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-17\">(3) If a laboratory report is admitted in evidence, the laboratory technician who made the test is subject to cross-examination by any party to the proceeding.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-18\">We begin our analysis of the applicability of this section to the appellant\u2019s claims by setting out the following facts which are undisputed by the parties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>(1) Appellee\u2019s witnesses are employed by an approved blood testing laboratory and are qualified in the field of paternity testing, but are not trained statisticians. Appellant\u2019s witness is a trained statistician and although he is not employed by a blood testing laboratory he does consult, as part of his employment, with the paternity testing laboratory at Johns Hopkins Hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-5\">(2) The blood tests were performed by an approved laboratory and the testing was done for blood group markers in seven different systems, six in the red cell laboratory and for HLA<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in the white cell laboratory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-6\">(3) The combination of the HLA and red cell tests is sufficiently extensive to exclude more than \u201c97.3% of alleged fathers who are not biological fathers\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">(4) The \u201cpaternity index\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in this case is 460 to 1, i.e. it is 460 times more likely that appellant could produce the 'single sperm carrying the necessary genetic information than a random man in the population.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-8\">(5) The prior probability<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> used by the laboratory in converting the paternity index to a percentage was .5, and that number is the standard used for such tests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-9\">(6) Using a prior probability of .5, the percentage which results from application of Bayes\u2019 Theorem<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to the paternity index of 460 to 1 is 99.78%.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>At this point, however, the dispute is centered on \u00a7 5-1029(e)(l)(ii), which requires that \u201cthe statistical probability of the alleged father\u2019s paternity [be] at least 97.3%\u201d. Appellant argues that this phrase should be construed strictly and that the method used to arrive at the percentage should be scrutinized according to the technical definition given by statisticians to the term \u201cstatistical probability\u201d. This argument forms the basis for his claims that: (1) appellee\u2019s witnesses, who lack training in statistics, are incompetent to interpret and to present the results of the blood test as a \u201cstatistical probability\u201d of paternity; and (2) the methodology used to arrive at the statistical probability of paternity is based on a scientifically invalid formula and therefore it is not a true \u201cstatistical probability\u201d of paternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">In <em>Haines v. Shanholtz, supra, </em>we held that by virtue of the adoption of Chapter 784, Acts of 1982, the legislature expressly recognized the reliability of genetic testing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 59 Md.App. at 97, 468 A.2d 1365. We found the legislative intent \u201cclear\u201d and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">[G]enetic testing is valid, subject to cross-examination of those responsible for performing and evaluating the tests. The trial judge has the discretion of admitting testimony that may have a bearing on the <em>weight </em>of the testimony offered as to the genetic testing, but not, by reason of the statute, as to the admissibility <em>vel non </em>of genetic testing to establish paternity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 98, 468 A.2d 1365 (emphasis in original). The question that arises in the case <em>sub judice </em>is therefore: whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>appellant\u2019s two-pronged attack goes to the admissibility of genetic testing or to the weight of the testimony offered, the former being impermissible as a result of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">We conclude that the first prong of appellant\u2019s attack, regarding the qualifications of appellee\u2019s witnesses, goes to the weight of the testimony offered, but we find it unpersuasive. Our review of the legislative history of \u00a7 5-1029(e)(l)(ii) does not support appellant\u2019s claim that the legislature intended that the results of the blood test be expressed in terms of a \u201ctrue\u201d \u201cstatistical probability\u201d. Neither the Judicial Proceedings Committee of the Maryland State Senate nor the Judiciary Committee of the Maryland House of Delegates received testimony from a statistician, and the legislative history is devoid of any indication that there was testimony regarding the precise scientific formula required in order to render a \u201ctrue\u201d statistical probability. We hold that the legislature used the term \u201cstatistical probability\u201d within the context and according to the meaning contained in the testimony of the experts from whom it heard: those in the blood testing community, including appellee\u2019s witness Margaret Brooks.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Mrs. Brooks testified at trial that the terms plausibility and probability are interchangeable in the blood testing community. We must assume the legislature was aware of this and we therefore reject the \u201cscientifically literal\u201d interpretation of \u00a7 5-1029(e)(l)(ii) urged by appellant. To the blood testing community, the terms plausibility and probability carry with them a distinction without a difference.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To express the paternity index ratio, which in this case is 460 to 1, as percentage requires the use of a statistical formula.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The legislature called the resulting percentage a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>\u201cstatistical probability\u201d.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Based on the foregoing, we conclude that appellee\u2019s expert witnesses are qualified, within the relevant community, to conduct the calculations necessary to express the 460 to 1 paternity index as a percentage as is required by the statute. We note that appellant\u2019s witness, Dr. Chase, acknowledged at trial that the methods and terms used by the blood testing laboratory are universal in the field of paternity testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">Appellant\u2019s second challenge, regarding the admissibility of the laboratory report, is permissible only to the extent that it goes to the weight of the testimony offered. As we pointed out in <em>Haines, </em>once appellee meets the requirements of \u00a7 5-1029(e)(l)(ii), the statute \u201cmandates the admissibility of the test results\u201d. 57 Md.App. at 100-01, 468 A.2d 1365. Appellant attempts to circumvent this holding by attacking the genetic testing procedure used and by arguing that the intent of the legislature was hardly to sanction an inaccurate or unreliable scientific methodology which results in an incorrect determination of paternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">We acknowledged in <em>Haines </em>that the Legislature stopped short of adopting \u201cany specific tests to establish the percentages necessary to include or exclude putative fathers\u201d. 57 Md.App. at 96, 468 A.2d 1365. We surmised that the reason for this was that the \u201cGeneral Assembly recognized that new technology may become available and, by not addressing any specific combination of tests, laboratories will be allowed to utilize the most effective tests without further legislative change\u201d. <em>Id. </em>The fact that the application of Bayes\u2019 Theorem, with a prior probability of .5, to the paternity index does not yield a \u201ctrue\u201d statistical probability of paternity does not invalidate the procedure or the result. The procedure used in this case is universally accepted by the relevant community of paternity blood testers and is the same procedure that was being used in 1984 when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>Legislature amended the blood testing statute to require the introduction of blood test evidence. Indeed, the laboratory that performed these tests and computed these results is the same one that supplied the experts who testified in regard to the 1982 statutory amendment and who testified in <em>Haines.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">By contrast, the interpretation urged upon us by appellant would effectively nullify the statute. If we were to agree with his expert, Dr. Chase, no blood testing laboratory could produce results sufficient to satisfy the \u201cstatistical probability\u201d requirement of the statute since they would not have access to the relevant non-genetic evidence needed to assign an \u201caccurate\u201d prior probability of paternity to Bayes\u2019 Theorem. This interpretation runs counter to the legislative goal which, as expressed in <em>Haines, </em>was \u201cto protect illegitimate children through court ordered support based upon <em>sophisticated and reliable </em>genetic testing.\u201d 57 Md.App. at 96, 468 A.2d 1365 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">\n<em>Admission of the Blood Test as a Violation of Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">Appellant contends that even if appellee properly complied with the blood test statute, the admission of any opinion evidence concerning the father\u2019s alleged \u201cstatistical probability\u201d of paternity violates the due process provisions of the United States and Maryland Constitutions.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> He also claims that apart from the due process violation, the introduction of statistical and mathematical evidence on the ultimate issue before the jury effectively deprived him of a fair and impartial trial by jury as guaranteed by Article 23 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">Appellant\u2019s due process challenge is actually a two-pronged attack. He asks whether: (1) due process of law permits a paternity index to be converted to a statistical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>probability of paternity through the use of Bayes\u2019 Theorem with an assigned prior probability; and (2) the limited reference population used in this case<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> can be used to compute the \u201cpaternity index\u201d used in the equation.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Once appellant\u2019s paternity index has been calculated, it must then be converted to a statistical probability in order to determine whether it meets the 97.8% benchmark for admissibility set forth in \u00a7 5-1029(e)(l)(ii). The mathematical equation used in making this transformation is Bayes\u2019 Theorem, a basic formula of probability theory. It is expressed as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">In this formula, P(F) represents the prior probability and it is factored into the equation in order to account for the non-genetic evidence of the accused man\u2019s paternity.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">Ideally, the prior probability should reflect an assessment of all the relevant non-genetic evidence in each individual case and should take into consideration such factors as the accused man\u2019s opportunity for access to the child\u2019s mother during the period of conception, the evidence linking the child\u2019s mother to other men during that time period and the credibility of the witnesses. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>however, an assumed prior probability of fifty percent (.5) was used in converting appellant\u2019s paternity index to a statistical probability. He contends that this was a violation of his due process rights. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-11\">Appellant claims that the methodology employed by all of appellee\u2019s experts assumes a fact not in evidence (the prior probability) and it is therefore scientifically inaccurate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>and invalid. We disagree. The evidence presented at trial makes plain that within the relevant community of blood testers, the paternity probability calculations in the present case were based upon scientific methods, accepted worldwide, which incorporate both Bayes\u2019 Theorem <em>and </em>the .5 prior probability.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> All of the experts who testified at trial agreed that the paternity index, representing only the purely genetic evidence (the HLA and the red cell tests), was 460 to 1. Furthermore, using Bayes\u2019 Theorem and a prior probability of .5, all of the experts (including appellant\u2019s expert Dr. Chase) calculated the same probability percentage of 99.78%.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The mathematical basis for the .5 figure was explained by Dr. Chase in the following manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\">If you know nothing about a set of possibilities then the principle of insufficient reason says you are entitled to assign equal prior probability to those alternatives. [T]hat\u2019s what\u2019s used to get this .5. This .5 comes from a principle that says we don\u2019t know whether he was the father or somebody else was the father. So we are going to split the probability fifty-fifty between the two possibilities. We are going to load him with 50 percent of it and give the other percent to all the other men.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">When calculating a statistical probability of paternity, the blood testing laboratory does not have before it any of the individualized non-genetic evidence, and it therefore uses a standard figure (.5) whenever it makes its calculations. This fact neither renders the methodology \u201cscientifically invalid\u201d nor does it deny appellant an opportunity to present the non-genetic evidence. If the laboratory\u2019s calculations meet the prerequisites for admissibility set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>\u00a7 5-1029(e)(l)(ii) the blood test evidence is admitted, but it is neither conclusive nor does it create a presumption, it is merely one piece of evidence that is put before the jury. Appellant was free to, and in fact did, put on non-genetic evidence which not only disputed generally his paternity but, in effect, was an attack upon the use of the .5 prior probability figure. This allowed him an opportunity to counterbalance appellee\u2019s introduction of the blood test results and the prior probability on which they were based and served to protect his due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">We decline to respond to appellant\u2019s second contention, regarding the sufficiency of the reference population used in determining the paternity index, on the basis of Maryland Rule 1031 c 5 and this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Van Meter v. State, </em>30 Md.App. 406, 352 A.2d 850 (1976). Nowhere in the record or in the briefs does appellant offer any argument in support of his claim that the reference population used was inadequate. In his brief, appellant merely states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-6\">The record also raises a serious question about whether the \u201creference population\u201d used by the Baltimore RH Laboratory, consisting in total of a mere 12,000 persons, is legally sufficient upon which to predicate the appellant\u2019s paternity index\u201d of 460:1. Appellant respectfully submits that there is no legally sufficient evidence to support the assumption made by the Baltimore RH Laboratory that this data base is adequate to use with Bayes\u2019 Theorem to extrapolate the statistical \u201cplausibilities\u201d made in this case, or that it is a proper \u201creference population\u201d at all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">Yet, he offers no proof to support his conclusion. From this bald assertion, appellant leaps to the conclusion that his due process rights have been violated because of the size of the reference population used. Appellant, by failing to include in his brief any argument to support his claim that the reference population was insufficient, provides us with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>nothing to consider as a basis for his contention.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Appellant does provide some argument on his right to a fair and impartial jury trial claim; however, we are not persuaded. He argues that the \u201cstatistical approach to the case distracted the jurors from weighing the evidence and determining the ultimate credibility of the plaintiff and defendant ...\u201d and that the jury \u201cunquestionably was overwhelmed\u201d by the testimony that the \u201cplausibility\u201d of the appellant\u2019s paternity was \u201c99.78%\u201d, and therefore he was denied a right to a fair and impartial trial. The \u201cstatistical approach\u201d to this case is no different from any other paternity case, and it is precisely what is required by the statute. The fact that the percentage obtained, 99.78%, may be perceived as \u201coverwhelming\u201d because of the extent to which it reaches 100% conclusiveness does not in any way prevent appellant from receiving a fair trial. The \u201cstatistical probability of paternity\u201d required by the statute comprises only one part of the evidence that is put before the jury concerning the alleged father\u2019s probable paternity.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It is not the only evidence and it does not create an irrebuttable presumption of paternity. Appellant was allowed to put on evidence in support of his claim that he is not the child\u2019s father. All of the evidence went to the jury and there is no evidentiary support for his claim that the jurors improperly relied on the statistical probability as being dispositive of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">\n<em>Hearsay</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Appellant next argues that the court erred in excluding from evidence a hearsay statement in which another man, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>Larry Klouser, admitted sexual access to appellee during the crucial period of conception and indicated that he could have been the father. Klouser had died sometime before trial. Although appellee admitted a close relationship with Klouser, she denied any sexual relations. Appellant\u2019s counsel proffered that Theresa Driscoll, who is appellant\u2019s sister and who was an acquaintance of both appellee and Klouser,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYN\">will testify that Larry Klouser told her ... that he had had a sexual relationship with the plaintiff in August of 1981 and stated ... that he could have easily been the father or implied to her that he could have been the father and wanted to stay out of this controversy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AjV\">Kammer cited to the trial court and cites on appeal <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. v. Kuhl, </em>296 Md. 446, 463 A.2d 822 (1983) and <em>Houck v. DeBonis, </em>38 Md.App. 85, 379 A.2d 765, <em>cert. denied </em>282 Md. 734, <em>U.S. cert. denied </em>434 U.S. 967, 98 S.Ct. 511, 54 L.Ed.2d 454 (1977), to support his contention that the Klouser statement was admissible under the declaration against interest hearsay exception. The trial court refused to read the two cases and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-4\">It is not admissible. It is pure hearsay. Absolute, clear hearsay. It is not admissible. It may affect the primary interest. That\u2019s something else, but as to the legitimacy of a child in a bastardy case ... [i]t is entirely different. It is not admissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-5\"><em>Aetna </em>and <em>Houck </em>support appellant\u2019s position that Klouser\u2019s statement would be a declaration against interest. The basic reasoning in those cases may, in succinct form, be summarized in the following statement from <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>at 819-820 (Cleary, 3rd Ed. 1984) concerning the two main requirements for satisfying the exception to the hearsay rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-6\">[F]irst, the declaration must state facts which are against the pecuniary or proprietary interest of the declarant, or the making of the declaration itself must create evidence which could endanger his pocketbook if the statement were not true; second, the declarant must be unavailable at the time of trial. The first requirement has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>believed to furnish the safeguard of special trustworthiness justifying most of the exceptions to the hearsay rule____ The declarant ... must ... have had the opportunity to observe the facts, as witnesses must have. (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-6\"><em>McCormick </em>points out that if the first requirement is met, it furnishes \u201cthe safeguard of special trustworthiness [which justifies] most of the exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">In <em>State v. Standifur, </em>310 Md. 3, 526 A.2d 955 (1987), the Court was presented with the question of whether a declaration against the penal interest of an unavailable witness, offered by the State against the accused in a criminal trial, is sufficiently reliable to qualify under the common law exception to the hearsay rule and to satisfy the Confrontation Clauses of the Constitution of the United States and the Declaration of Rights of Maryland. Judge McAuliffe, writing for the Court, began his treatment of this question by noting that a declaration against penal interest is recognized in Maryland as an exception to the hearsay rule. 310 Md. at 9, 526 A.2d 955 (citations omitted). He also pointed out that it is similarly excepted by the Federal Rules of Evidence and by a majority of the states, and quoted from Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(3) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-8\">The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-9\">(3) Statement against interest.\u2014A statement which was at the time of its making so far contrary to the declarant\u2019s pecuniary or proprietary interest, or so far tended to subject him to civil or criminal liability, or to render invalid a claim by him against another, that a reasonable man in his position would not have made the statement unless he believed it to be true. A statement tending to expose the declarant to criminal liability and offered to exculpate the accused is not admissible unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>From this, Judge McAuliffe went on to consider the ramifications of inculpatory statement that implicate third persons. These \u201cinculpatory statements of an accomplice no longer involved in the criminal enterprise are inherently suspect and the particular circumstances surrounding the making of such statements must be carefully examined.\u201d 310 Md. at 15, 526 A.2d 955 (footnote omitted). As a result of the Court\u2019s careful analysis, the statement under analysis in <em>Standifur </em>was held to be not admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we have an allegation that an unavailable third party (Klouser), made an inculpatory statement (that he could be the child\u2019s father) which was against his pecuniary interest. In determining whether this alleged hearsay statement should be admitted, we find Judge McAuliffe\u2019s discussion of whether a third party\u2019s statement qualifies as a declaration against penal interest instructive:</p>\n<p id=\"A2q\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>310 Md. at 17, 526 A.2d 955. Judge McAuliffe\u2019s analysis closely tracks that contained in <em>McCormick, supra, </em>\u00a7 279 at 824-27 concerning both civil and criminal cases, and in our opinion it is equally applicable to cases, such as the one <em>sub judice, </em>where a statement is offered as a declaration against pecuniary interest.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>In summary, a trial judge considering the admissibility of a hearsay statement offered as a declaration against penal interest must carefully consider the content of the statement in the light of all known and relevant circumstances surrounding the making of the statement and all relevant information concerning the declarant, and determine whether the statement was in fact against the declarant\u2019s penal interest and whether a reasonable person in the situation of the declarant would have perceived that it was against his penal interest at the time it was made. The trial judge should then consider whether there are present any other facts or circumstances, including those indicating a motive to falsify on the part of the declarant, that so cut against the presumption of reliability normally attending a declaration against interest that the statements should not be admitted. A statement against interest that survives this analysis, and those related statements so closely connected with it as to be equally trustworthy, are admissible as declarations against interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Applying the <em>Standifur </em>test to the facts of the case <em>sub judice, </em>we hold that the exclusion of the Klouser declaration, when considered \u201cin the light of all known and relevant circumstances surrounding the making\u201d of it and \u201call relevant information concerning\u201d Klouser, was not an abuse of discretion. The proffered declaration of Klouser was made after appellant was named as the putative father, a fact which attenuates the conclusion that the statement was indeed against the declarant\u2019s interest. Once appellant had been named in the paternity suit, it was unlikely that Klouser would be accused of being the father and subjected to a paternity suit whose outcome could affect his pecuniary interest. Thus, at that point in time, he had little to lose.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Absent from the proffer were the relevant circumstances and information surrounding Klouser\u2019s making of the statement which are necessary to establish the required indicia of truthfulness. <em>See generally Brennan v. State, </em>151 Md. 265, 134 A. 148 (1928) (statement by third person that he was the father of the child admitted as exception to general rule excluding such statements in paternity cases where testimony was to come from third party\u2019s sister, and where suicide note existed which stated that his suicide was brought about by the birth of the illegitimate child.) On the contrary, there was no evidence that would support the conclusion that Klouser indeed had sexual intercourse with appellee during the period of conception. Such a relationship is denied by her and, in fact, she claims that Klouser was not interested in a sexual relationship with her because he was a homosexual. Thus, the only testimony in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>regard is the proffer of appellant\u2019s sister. Although the fact that the witness was appellant\u2019s sister would affect credibility rather than admissibility, it is a fact that must be considered in applying the <em>Standifur </em>test. We hold that the evidence was insufficient to prove that the trial judge did abuse his discretion when he excluded the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\"><em>Jury Instructions </em>(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Kammer argues that the trial court\u2019s failure to explain the term <em>\u201cprima facie </em>\u201d to the jury constitutes prejudicial error. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">After the trial court instructed the jury, the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-8\">MR. BARNES (Appellant\u2019s attorney): The exceptions are two-fold. I wanted you to explain one phrase that you used in the blood test. You said prima facie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-9\">THE COURT: What?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-10\">MR. BARNES: You said prima facie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-11\">THE COURT: That is what I said. That\u2019s what it says in the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-12\">MR. BARNES: This is a legal phrase. I think you should tell them what it means. What it means in the lawyer\u2019s vernacular\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-13\">THE COURT: You tell them in closing argument. All right with me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-14\">MR. BARNES: Will you instruct them prima facie\u2014 what that means?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-15\">THE COURT: Sure. I won\u2019t quarrel with that. You can explain it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-16\">MR. BARNES: But will you instruct them the definition of prima facie?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-17\">THE COURT: I might.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-18\">The trial court, however, did not instruct the jury on the meaning of <em>prima facie. </em>The trial court did instruct the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>jury that \u00a7 5-1029(e)(2) stated that \u201ca laboratory report is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the result of a blood test\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Sections (b) and (e) of Rule 2-520, Instructions to the Jury, govern the disposition of this issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\">(b) Written Requests.\u2014The parties may file written requests for instructions at or before the close of the evidence and shall do so at any time fixed by the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-7\">$ * * * * sK</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-8\">(e) Objections.\u2014No party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless the party objects on the record promptly after the court instructs the jury, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the objection. Upon request of any party, the court shall receive objections out of the hearing of the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">The trial court properly asked the parties for proposed instructions. Kammer must have been aware that the trial court would give an instruction based on \u00a7 5-1029(e), and would include the term <em>\u201cprima facie \u201d, </em>because of the centrality of that section to the issues. Kammer should have prepared either a written instruction, or orally proffered to the court a proposed definition. He did neither, and his \u201cexception\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> failed to provide the trial court with a proposed definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">Under Rule 2-520(b), where a trial court fails or refuses to give an instruction on a specific issue, it is the responsibility of the party proposing the instruction to make- a proper request, which includes submitting to the trial court the contents of the proposed instruction. Without this, the trial court need not act. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the trial court was not presented with a proposed definition of the term <em>\u201cprima facie </em>There was not a proper request for the disputed instruction and we will therefore not address the issue. Md.Rule 1085.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>In addition, under Rule 2-520(e) a party may not assign as error on appeal the failure to give an instruction unless there is a proper objection, which necessarily includes the stating of the grounds. Here, sections (b) and (e) of Rule 2-520 must be read together. Rammer\u2019s purported objection failed to state adequately the grounds for his objection, not because the trial court was unaware of the subject of the objection, but because Rammer failed to provide the court with a proposed instruction. Rammer, in his brief, very cogently provides this Court with several definitions of the term <em>\u201cprima facie </em>\u201d, but it was fatal not to have done so at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Rammer also argues that the trial court\u2019s failure to give the following instruction, based on <em>Staley v. Staley, </em>25 Md.App. 99, 335 A.2d 114, <em>cert. denied, 275 </em>Md. 755 (1975), constituted prejudicial error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-6\">If you find the plaintiff in this case associated with another man, under suspicious circumstances, at or about the time of her pregnancy, you may consider this fact on the issue of paternity in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">In <em>Staley, </em>we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-8\">[Sjince there was evidence of a relationship between the mother and her alleged paramour during the period of conception, the chancellor did not err in admitting evidence of possible misconduct occurring between them at times subsequent to the period of conception.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">25 Md.App. at 108, 335 A.2d 114. Central to our analysis in <em>Staley </em>was the existence of competent evidence that both the husband of the plaintiff, and the alleged putative father, the paramour, had visited the plaintiff under \u201csuspicious circumstances\u201d at the time of conception. Explicit in the <em>Staley </em>analysis was the recognition that the proffered evidence, to be competent on the issue of the mother\u2019s sexual relations with men other than the alleged father, must relate to the time of conception. <em>Id. </em>at 106-07, 335 A.2d 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Appellant asserts that the <em>Staley </em>instruction was required because of the testimony of Lois Kammer, Theresa Driscoll and the appellee. Lois Kammer is the wife of Rammer\u2019s brother and the sister of Klouser, the latter of whom, appellant alleges, had a relationship with appellee under \u201csuspicious circumstances\u201d. Theresa Driscoll is Rammer\u2019s sister. Lois Kammer testified that she knew her brother, Larry Klouser, was bisexual and that he and the appellee were close friends; also, that appellee spent the night with her brother sometime between 1979 and 1981. Theresa Driscoll testified that several times during the summer of 1981 Larry Klouser; appellee and herself went to the beach. All three were good friends. Appellee denied that she and Larry Klouser ever had sexual relationship but stated that Mr. Klouser was a confidant to whom she sometimes told her inner secrets. She also testified that Larry Klouser was a homosexual and that he was more like a \u201cgirlfriend\u201d and admitted that she did visit his home alone on many occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">From this testimony, the trial court did not err when it refused to give a <em>Staley </em>based instruction. Under Maryland law, \u201ca litigant is entitled to have his theory of the case presented to the jury, but only if that theory of the case is a correct exposition of the law and there is testimony in the case which supports it.\u201d <em>Sergeant Co. v. Pickett, </em>285 Md. 186, 194, 401 A.2d 651 (1979) (quoting <em>Levine v. Rendler, </em>272 Md. 1, 13, 320 A.2d 258 (1974)). The evidence which speaks to \u201csuspicious circumstances\u201d at the time of conception in August of 1981, was: (1) the testimony of appellee that during 1981, she saw Klouser approximately once a week and was alone with him in Klouser\u2019s basement living quarters \u201con many occasions\u201d; and (2) the testimony of Lois Kammer that appellee and Klouser spent the night together in Klouser\u2019s basement, but she did not know \u201cexactly when\u201d. Ms. Driscoll could state only that the frequent contact between appellee and Klouser occurred sometime \u201cfrom 1979 to 1981\u201d. Appellee\u2019s denial of any sexual contact combined with Ms. Driscoll\u2019s inability to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>sufficiently narrow the period in which the alleged questionable conduct occurred, clearly distinguishes this testimony from that in <em>Staley. </em>We hold that the trial judge correctly concluded that this testimony, although relevant, did not meet the standard required to justify the requested instruction. <em>Twining v.
