Saia, appeals from a judgment rendered by the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. Appellee, Gloria E. Sain, sought a declaratory judgment that the residuary clause of Sadie Cataldi\u2019s will was void. Ms. Sain requested an injunction against the personal representative prohibiting any distribution of estate assets. At the conclusion of Ms. Sain\u2019s case, the court found that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>residuary clause was patently ambiguous and therefore unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">On appeal, appellant raises four issues. The first issue asks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">\u201cIs a bequest to \u2018survivors\u2019 of a class or group of designated beneficiaries in the residuary clause of a Will restricted to surviving members of the class or group as a matter of law, and is such a bequest ambiguous?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYE\">Since we agree with appellant that such a bequest is not ambiguous and is restricted to surviving members of the group, we need not and do not reach the other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Sadie Cataldi died in October, 1983. By her will dated October 25, 1980, she made a specific bequest of $1,000 to the Franciscan Monastery. The balance of the estate was to pass by way of the residuary clause in her will, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-8\">\u201cAll the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate, I give, devise, and bequeath in equal shares to the survivors of the following: Charlie B. Saia (my nephew), Grace Saia Carr (my niece), Margaret Saia (my niece), Annette Belford (my niece), Richard E. Caperna (my grand-nephew), Charles Citrano, Jr. (my nephew), Wendi Louise Carr (my great-niece), and Rosaline Grauso (my niece).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">The appellant is one of the eight individuals named by Sadie Cataldi in the residuary clause. Appellee is an heir at law but not one of the legatees, nor is she a descendant of any of the legatees.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">RESIDUARY CLAUSE</p>\n<p id=\"b350-11\">The basic issue in the case <em>sub judice </em>is whether the word \u201csurvivors\u201d is subject to a precise and definite meaning or whether it is so ambiguous as to render the residuary clause unenforceable. We hold that the word \u201csurvivors,\u201d when used to limit a group, is not ambiguous but is subject to a precise definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>The Court of Appeals of Maryland has not hesitated to interpret the word \u201csurvivors\u201d as found in a testamentary clause. In <em>Ross v. Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co., </em>168 Md. 65, 176 A. 483 (1934), the testator set up an elaborate scheme of disposition, leaving a significant share of his estate to his six children. The will then provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\">\u201cBut if any of my sons shall die before he or they shall have received the whole of the property I hereby give to him or them; or if any of my daughters shall die without issue living at the time or times of her death or their deaths, then shall the trustee hold the property belonging to him, her or them thus dead, <em>in trust for the use of the survivors, </em>in the same manner, and for the same estates and purposes, as those above mentioned.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">The issue before the Court was whether the word \u201csurvivors,\u201d as found in that provision, was limited to the testator\u2019s six children or did it include his grandchildren. In holding that the provision only applied to his children, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">\u201cThese children are the six specifically named members of a group to take the share of any child in the group that had fallen in on the happening of the particular contingency created by the will____ <em>A survivor is one who continues to live after the death of those who comprise his group </em>... it seems to us to be clear law as well as good sense that, in a case like this, where there is an ultimate limitation upon a contingency to a group of persons plainly described, and there is a person answering the description <em>in esse </em>when the contingency happens, that person alone can take.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-9\"><em>Ross, </em>168 Md. at 72-73, 176 A. 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">Numerous other states have been asked to interpret testamentary clauses using the word \u201csurvivors.\u201d In <em>Croft v. McKie, </em>235 S.C. 231, 111 S.E.2d 210 (1959), the testator left each of his seven children a tract of land for his or her \u201csole and separate use.\u201d The will provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>\u201cIf any of the children should die childless, \u2018her or their share shall revert to my estate for division among the survivors.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-5\"><em>Croft, </em>111 S.E.2d at 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">In interpreting the word \u201csurvivors\u201d in that provision, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">\u201cUnless there is something in the context of the instrument or attendant circumstances showing a different intention, the authorities are generally to the effect that the word \u2018survivor\u2019 should be given its literal interpretation as meaning one who outlives another, one of two or more persons who live after the other or others have died.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-8\"><em>Croft, </em>111 S.E.2d at 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">Similarly, in <em>Holt v. Miller, </em>33 N.E.2d 19 (Ohio App.1937), the Court considered a provision of a will which devised a remainder life estate to the testatrix\u2019s two children, Clinton Howard Miller and Lindy Pearlette Miller, share and share alike, and to the \u201csurvivor of them.\u201d The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARj\">\u201cThis language could not, in its common acceptation, have included the children of Lindy Pearlette Holt. When the two children of the testator were mentioned in the item in connection with the expression, \u2018survivor of them\u2019, Clinton Howard Miller could have no survivor but his sister, Lindy Pearlette Holt, and she could have no surviv- or but Clinton Howard Miller. \u2018Survivor\u2019 means the longest liver of two or more persons mentioned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-10\"><em>Holt, </em>33 N.E.2d at 21; <em>see also Hummell v. Hummell, </em>241 N.C. 254, 85 S.E.2d 144 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">More recently, in <em>Estate of Carlson, </em>39 Ill.App.3d 281, 350 N.E.2d 306 (1976), the Court construed the following clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-12\">\u201cI give, devise and bequeath all of my property of every kind and nature to my niece and nephew, Barbara Ann Carlson and Bernard D. Carlson, and the nephew of my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>wife, William Perry Filbert, or their survivors or survivor, share and share alike.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-5\"><em>Estate of Carlson, </em>350 N.E.2d at 307-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">The principal issue in the case was whether the words \u201ctheir survivors or survivor, share and share alike,\u201d created an ambiguity requiring construction of the will. <em>Estate of Carlson, </em>350 N.E.2d at 308. The Court, finding no ambiguity, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-7\">\u201cWhen the term \u2018survivor\u2019 is used in conjunction with a gift to a group or class of beneficiaries, under the common law the survivorship clause of the will is deemed to indicate the intention of the testator that, should any member of the class predecease the testator, the share of the deceased beneficiary goes to the remaining named members of the class, rather than to this [sic] children or issue of the predeceased beneficiary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-8\"><em>Estate of Carlson, </em>350 N.E.2d at 309. <em>See also In re Estate of Gallop, </em>248 So.2d 686 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">Thus, the case law supports our holding that the word \u201csurvivors\u201d is not ambiguous but is readily definable.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">Finally, the leading authorities agree on the precise definition of \u201csurvivors.\u201d We quote from some of them:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-11\">\u201cTo survive another is to outlive such other.... A gift to survivors, after a life estate, enures only to those who are alive at distribution. The word \u2018survivors,\u2019 when used of a class, is limited to the individuals of such a class, and does not include their children.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-12\">4 Page, <em>Wills, </em>\u00a7 34.32 (4th ed. 1961 &amp; Supp.1986).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-13\">\u201cThe primary and literal meaning of the word \u2018survive\u2019 is to outlive another person or live beyond a designated date or the happening of a designated event, and the literal meaning of \u2018survivor\u2019 is one who so outlives another person, etc. It is generally held that in the absence of an expression of a contrary intention, their primary meaning is to be attributed to the words in question, when they are used in wills. Under some circumstances the English courts uphold a construction of the term \u2018survivor\u2019 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>mean \u2018other,\u2019 but American judges have been very reluctant to countenance this reading of the word.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">80 Am.Jur.2d <em>Wills </em>\u00a7 1228 (1975).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">\u201cThe word \u2018survivor\u2019 and the like may refer to the one who shall survive or outlive another, or to the \u2018longer liver\u2019 or \u2018longest liver\u2019 of two or more____ Whether or not the words \u2018survivor,\u2019 \u2018surviving,\u2019 and the like are to be given a literal construction depends largely on the intention of the testator. Such words are given their natural, ordinary, or literal meaning when not explained by the context, where there is nothing in the will requiring a different construction, or where such meaning is in accordance with the will as a whole ... such words will be construed according to their usual and common acceptation unless a different meaning plainly appears to have been intended____ The view has been expressed, however, that the construction as \u2018other\u2019 is a forced construction, and that the literal meaning is preferred to such construction in the absence of any provision of the will requiring that construction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">96 C.J.S. <em>Wills </em>\u00a7 729 (1957).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-11\">\u201cThe word \u2018survivor\u2019 means one who outlives another; one of two or more persons who lives after the other or others have died. But in some cases, although <em>not </em>in Maryland, in order to carry out the intention of the testator ... the word \u2018survivors\u2019 has been held to mean \u2018others\u2019____ In order to read \u2018survivors\u2019 as meaning \u2018others\u2019 there must be an ultimate gift over, or some other indication of manifest intention to oust the ordinary and natural interpretation____\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-15\">Miller, <em>Construction of Wills, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 272, 276 (1927).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-16\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the testatrix, with the exception of $1,000, left her entire estate \u201cto the survivors\u201d of eight named individuals. There is no indication in the will that the testatrix intended that anyone but those eight persons share in her estate. Case law, including that found in Maryland, and numerous treatises have not hesitated to attach a precise and definite meaning to the word \u201csurviv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>ors.\u201d In this case, the word \u201csurvivors\u201d is readily subject to its primary meaning of one who outlives another; it is limited to the individuals of a class and does not include their children. Those persons listed in the residuary clause and alive at the time of the testatrix\u2019s death are entitled to take equal shares under the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
