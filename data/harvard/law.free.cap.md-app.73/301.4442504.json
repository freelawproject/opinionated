BELL, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">This is an appeal from the judgment of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, affirming a decision of the Anne Arundel County Board of Appeals to uphold the issuance of a building permit to Eugene and Joyce Causey,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> two of the appellees herein,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> authorizing the relocation of two mooring pilings in Bear Neck Creek. Appellants, Dorothy Gray and Alice Peters, the owners of the waterfront property adjoining that owned by the Causeys, present four questions for our resolution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-5\">1. Did the Circuit Court of [sic] Anne Arundel County in affirming the County Board of Appeals properly consider the arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, and illegal acts of the County Board of Appeals?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-6\">2. Did the County Board of Appeals of Anne Arundel County make findings of fact upon which the circuit court could affirm its opinion and order?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-7\">3. Did the circuit court, and the County Board of Appeals of Anne Arundel County err in not finding that the Anne Arundel Code, Section 10-111(B) requires the Office of Planning and Zoning to designate the location of the pilings and in selecting the sideline location Planning and Zoning must choose the option which will cause the least interference to neighboring uses, as specifically stated in said section of the Code?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-8\">4. Did the court err in not finding that the County Board of Appeals erred in determining that it and the Office of Planning and Zoning may not consider existing admitted violations of the setback requirement in the use of the pilings and the boat slip created thereby or their authority to place conditions on the use of the pilings and boat slip?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>We discern no error; therefore, we affirm. In explaining our decision, we will address the issues in an order somewhat different than that proposed by appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The events giving rise to this appeal began on July 2, 1980, when the Causeys installed two mooring pilings in the water adjoining their waterfront property. Installation was made without benefit of a building permit and their subsequent application to the County for the issuance of a permit was denied. Despite the denial of the application, the pilings were not removed. The Causeys\u2019 efforts to maintain the pilings by obtaining a variance or otherwise acquiring official sanction for their continued installation, and appellants\u2019 opposition to such actions, resulted in several years of litigation,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which culminated when the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County passed a judgment finding that the pilings were located too close to the center of Bear Creek in violation of \u00a7 13-300.16(a)(1) of the Anne Arundel County Code (1967).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Having been unsuccessful in their efforts to maintain the pilings as installed, the Causeys filed an application, which included a permit drawing, for a building permit to relocate the pilings consistent with the circuit court\u2019s decision. The Office of Planning and Zoning, having computed the center <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>line and side property line setback requirements in accordance with Art. 28 \u00a7 10-111 of the Anne Arundel County Code (1985) and concluded that those requirements were met,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> granted the application and issued the requested permit. Appellants appealed the issuance of the building permit to the County Board of Appeals. While that appeal was pending, appellees removed the pilings and relocated them pursuant to the building permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">The County Board of Appeals took testimony and heard argument on appellants\u2019 appeal and issued an Opinion and Order upholding the issuance of the permit. The Board rejected appellants\u2019 interpretation of \u00a7 10-lll(b)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> as requiring the Office of Planning and Zoning to refuse to issue a building permit for the installation of pilings if any of the options in \u00a7 10-lll(c) would cause interference to neighboring uses. Instead, the Board interpreted that section to \u201c[require] that an option be chosen, and that the option chosen be the one which causes the least interference to neighboring uses.\u201d It then found that the option that would cause the least interference to neighboring uses was option 3, the \u201ccenter of the cove\u201d option. Having found that the location of the pilings as proposed by appellees was in compliance with the side property line setback requirement contained in subsection (c)(3), as well as the center line <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>setback requirements of subsection (a)(1), the Board concluded that the building permit was properly issued. Finally, the Board rejected appellants\u2019 argument that it should consider and regulate the placement of boats in slips created by mooring pilings, opining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-4\">Section 10-111 ... does not address the issue of \u201cslips\u201d (as defined in \u00a7 1-101 of the Code), nor does it allow for consideration of the location of vessels. The matter before the Board involves the placement of pilings in the water; it is that matter only which is the subject of this appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Appellants fared no better on its appeal of the Board\u2019s decision to the circuit court. That court, having received memoranda from the parties and heard oral arguments, affirmed the decision of the County Board of Appeals, specifically adopting its interpretation of \u00a7 10-lll(b) and categorically determining that the Board was correct in finding that the County Code did not authorize the regulation of boats in slips.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">\n<em>Interpretation and application of \u00a7 10-111(b)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">The primary argument advanced by appellants is that the interpretation placed upon \u00a7 10-111 by the Board of Appeals and the circuit court is erroneous. They also contend, on a related issue, that \u201cthe Board did not consider the \u2018interference\u2019 matter and the appellees and the County presented no evidence on the \u2018interference\u2019 factors\u201d, rendering the Board\u2019s decision arbitrary, capricious, and invalid as a matter of law. We perceive these complaints to relate to the propriety of the Board\u2019s, and the court\u2019s, interpretation of \u00a7 10-111 as well as to the Board\u2019s application of the law to the facts it found. We will address each contention in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">The thrust of appellants\u2019 argument is that, pursuant to subsection (b), a piling must be located by the Office of Planning and Zoning so as to cause the least interference with neighboring uses. To reach this result, appellants focus primarily upon the first clause of the subsection\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>\u201cthe location of a ... piling ... shall be designated by the Office of Planning and Zoning ...\u201d\u2014and the Webster\u2019s Dictionary definition of \u201cdesignate\u201d\u2014\u201cto point out the location of ...: specify\u201d. From this they reason \u201cthat Planning and Zoning need not accept, as has occurred here, the pilings\u2019 location designated by appellees, to wit, in the area adjoining the appellants\u2019 waterfront.\u201d They construe the proviso, \u201cprovided that the choice of location is limited to the option specified in subsection (c) of this section that will cause the least interference to neighboring uses\u201d, to mean that \u201cPlanning and Zoning must locate the pilings in applying the option chosen (center of cove) where they will cause the least interference to neighboring uses.\u201d In short, appellants\u2019 interpretation of subsection (b) emphasizes the location of the pilings as the critical issue in defining the nature and extent of interference to neighboring uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">Appellees take a different view. They assert, consistent with the interpretation of the Board and the circuit court, that <em>\u201c[i]t is the option </em>selected from section (c) which must cause the least interference, <em>not the precise location </em>of each piling.\u201d (emphasis in original) In their view, to interpret the subsection as appellants do requires that a portion of the proviso, namely, \u201cprovided that the location is limited only to the option specified in subsection (c) of this section\u201d, be deleted from consideration, thus violating a cardinal principle of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">In order to resolve this issue, it is of course necessary that we review and apply the appropriate rules of statutory construction. Before doing so, however, we must address a threshold issue: What is the appropriate standard of judicial review of this matter?</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">\u201c... [T]he order of an administrative agency, such as a county zoning Board, must be upheld on review if it is not premised upon an error of law and if the agency\u2019s conclusions \u2018reasonably may be based upon the .facts proven.\u2019 \u201d <em>A.D. + Soil, Inc. v. County Commissioners, </em>307 Md. 307, 338, 513 A.2d 893 (1986), quoting <em>Annapolis v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number><em>Annap. Waterfront Co., </em>284 Md. 383, 399, 396 A.2d 1080 (1979). This is the same rule that has been enunciated and applied in connection with the decisions of the Maryland Tax Court. <em>See Ramsay, Scarlett and Company, Inc. v. Comptroller, </em>302 Md. 825, 834, 490 A.2d 1296 (1985); <em>Thames Point Associates v. Supervisor, </em>68 Md.App. 1, 9, 509 A.2d 1207 (1986); <em>Comptroller v. World Book Child-craft International, Inc., </em>67 Md.App. 424, 438-39, 508 A.2d 148, <em>cert. denied, </em>307 Md. 260, 513 A.2d 314 (1986); <em>Matthew Bender &amp; Company, Inc. v. Comptroller, </em>67 Md.App. 693, 705-06, 509 A.2d 702 (1986). The statement of the rule makes clear that the standard of review to be applied depends upon the nature of the agency finding being reviewed. <em>Thames Point Associates, </em>68 Md.App. at 9, 509 A.2d 1207. It has been interpreted to require a three-step analysis, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-4\">1. First, the reviewing court must determine whether the agency recognized and applied the correct principles of law governing the case. The reviewing court is not constrained to affirm the agency where its order \u201cis premised solely upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>[Ramsay, Scarlett </em>] [302 Md. at] 834, 490 A.2d 1296.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-5\">2. Once it is determined that the agency did not err in its determination or interpretation of the applicable law, the reviewing court next examines the agency\u2019s factual findings to determine if they are supported by substantial evidence, <em>i.e., </em>by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. <em>Id. </em>At this juncture, the <em>Ramsay, Scarlett </em>court reminds us that \u201c[I]t is the agency\u2019s province to resolve conflicting evidence, and, where inconsistent inferences can be drawn from the same evidence, it is for the agency to draw the inferences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 835, 490 A.2d 1296.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">3. Finally the reviewing Court must examine how the agency applied the law to the facts. This of course is a judgmental process involving a mixed question of law and fact, and great deference must be accorded to the agency. The test of appellate review of this function is \u201cWhether, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>... a reasoning mind could reasonably have reached the conclusion reached by the [agency], consistent with a proper application of the [controlling legal principles].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 838, 490 A. 1296.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><em>Id. </em>Thus, where the issue before the appellate court is one of law, the Court\u2019s review \u201cis expansive, that is, the appellate court may substitute its judgment for that of the [administrative agency].\u201d <em>Thames Point Associates, </em>68 Md.App. at 10, 509 A.2d 1207. Where, however, the issue involves review of the agency\u2019s factual determinations or a mixed question of law and fact, a more restricted standard of review\u2014determining whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support the factual findings or determining whether, applying the appropriate legal principle, a reasoning mind could have reached the conclusion reached by the agency\u2014applies. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">At the heart of the controversy <em>sub judice </em>is the meaning of subsection (b) of \u00a7 10-111. This is an issue of statutory construction. Such an issue involves a question of law, <em>Comptroller v. Mandel Re-election Com., </em>280 Md. 575, 578, 374 A.2d 1130 (1977). <em>See Montgomery County v. Fulks, </em>65 Md.App. 227, 232-36, 500 A.2d 302 (1985); therefore, our review of the interpretation of that subsection by the Board of Appeals and the circuit court is expansive.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Approaching the construction of subsection (b), it is necessary to review the cardinal principles of statutory construction. \u201cTo ascertain and effectuate the actual legislative intention in enacting any statute is, of course, the cardinal rule of statutory interpretation,\u201d <em>State v. Intercontinental, Ltd., </em>302 Md. 132, 137, 486 A.2d 174 (1985); <em>In Re Criminal Investigation No. 1-162, </em>307 Md. 674, 685, 516 A.2d 976 (1986); <em>Sites v. State, </em>300 Md. 702, 710, 481 A.2d 192 (1984), the primary source of which is the language of the statute itself. <em>Blum v. Blum, </em>295 Md. 135, 140, 453 A.2d 824 (1983). We said in <em>Ford Motor Land Development v. Comptroller, </em>68 Md.App. 342, 346-47, 511 A.2d 578, <em>cert. denied, Comptroller v. Ford Motor Land Dev., </em>307 Md. 596, 516 A.2d 567 (1986):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>\u201cWhere the language [of the statute] is clear and free from doubt the court has no power to evade it by forced and unreasonable construction\u201d, <em>State Tax Commission v. C &amp; P Telephone Company, </em>193 Md. 222, 231, 66 A.2d 477 (1949). Thus, where \u201cthere is no ambiguity or obscurity in the language of a statute, there is usually no need to look elsewhere to ascertain the intent of the General Assembly\u201d. <em>City of Baltimore v. Hackley, </em>300 Md. 277, 283, 477 A.2d 1174 (1984). Furthermore, the statute must be construed considering the context in which the words are used and viewing all pertinent parts, provisions, and sections so as assure a construction consistent with the entire statute. <em>Comptroller v. Mandel Re-election Comm., </em>280 Md. 575, 579, 374 A.2d 1130 (1977). And, if there is no clear indication to the contrary, a statute must be read so that no part of it is \u201crendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless, or nugatory.\u201d <em>Board of Education, Garrett County v. Lendo, </em>295 Md. 55, 63, 453 A.2d 1185 (1982); <em>Baltimore Building and Construction Trades Council v. Barnes, </em>290 Md. 9, 15, 427 A.2d 979 (1981). On the other hand, we \u201cshun a construction of the statute which will lead to absurd consequences\u201d. <em>Erwin &amp; Shafer, Inc. v. Pabst Brewing Company, </em>304 Md. 302, 311, 498 A.2d 1188 (1985), or \u201ca proposed statutory interpretation if its consequences are inconsistent with common sense.\u201d <em>Blandon v. State, </em>304 Md. 316, 319, 498 A.2d 1195 (1985).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Moreover, we \u201cmay not insert or omit words to make a statute express an intention not evidenced in its original form.\u201d <em>Hackley, </em>300 Md. at 283, 477 A.2d 1174 (1984). In other words, courts should \u201cavoid creating [an] ambiguity where none exists ... [and] be wary of inserting words with a view toward making the statute express an intention which is different from its plain meaning____\u201d <em>Fulks, </em>65 Md.App. at 233, 500 A.2d 302. (citations omitted)</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Applying these principles to subsection (b) produces a clear result. Although the subsection could have been more artfully drafted, application of the rules of statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>construction makes plain that the Office of Planning and Zoning\u2019s designation of the location of a piling \u201cis limited only to the option specified in subsection (c)\u201d and, further, that it is the selection of that option which must cause the least interference to neighboring uses. As appellees point out, interpreting that subsection as appellants would have us do would require that we not consider the phrase, \u201cprovided that the location is limited only to the option specified in subsection (c) of this section\u201d, at all. As we have seen, this we cannot do. We conclude that appellees are correct; it is the option selected, not the location of a piling, which is the appropriate object in reference to which the determination of whether neighboring uses are subjected to the least interference possible must be made. The object of the phrase \u201cthat will cause the least interference to neighboring uses\u201d, is clearly the phrase \u201coption specified in subsection (c) of this section\u201d and not the term \u201cthe location\u201d. Thus, neither the Board of Appeals nor the circuit court premised its decision solely upon an erroneous conclusion of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">Appellants\u2019 argument that \u201cthe Board did not consider the \u2018interference\u2019 matter\u201d is directly related to its interpretation, not only of the ordinance, but of the nature of the interference at which the ordinance is directed. Were appellants correct, that the ordinance requires the Office of Planning and Zoning, in designating the location of the pilings, to select that location which causes the least interference to neighboring uses, it would naturally follow that, in order to discharge its responsibilities, the Office of Planning and Zoning would have to consider the neighboring property owners\u2019 \u201cactual\u201d use of their piers and the effect that the installation of pilings at any given location would have on those \u201cuses\u201d. If, on the other hand, appellees\u2019 interpretation of the ordinance is correct, there is no need to consider the \u201cactual\u201d neighboring uses. We have rejected the premise on which appellants base their argument and we also reject the conclusion which flows from it. But we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>think appellants\u2019 argument is untenable for another reason as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Implicit in the Board\u2019s interpretation of subsection (b) is the determination that the interference at which the statute is directed is \u201cspatial\u201d, rather than \u201cactual\u201d. Determining the degree of interference with neighboring uses by reference to an option for the placement of pilings on the usable water area adjacent to a permit holder\u2019s property necessarily and, in this case, certainly, involves restricting the amount of usable water space available to a permit holder for location of pilings and, concomitantly, expanding, to the extent of the restriction, the usable water space available to the adjacent property owners for their use. Reference to the ordinance demonstrates that this is so. The ordinance, by providing four options for the determination of side property line setbacks and by requiring that pilings be located in accordance with that one of the four that causes the least interference to neighboring uses, contemplates both a restriction of the permit holder\u2019s ability to locate pilings and an expansion of neighboring property owners\u2019 ability to use the water adjacent to and surrounding their property. This is accomplished because each of the four options will ordinarily produce differing areas of usable water space, depending upon the configuration of the subject property. The option which most limits the permit holder\u2019s choice of location, thus leaving the greatest usable water area for neighboring uses is deemed, under the ordinance, to be the one that causes the least interference to neighboring uses. Under this approach, it is unnecessary for the reviewing authority to determine, or even to consider, what the actual neighboring uses are. Nor is it necessary that it be determined to what extent such uses are affected by the location of the pilings. What is at issue is which of the four options provided is most restrictive of the permit holder\u2019s use of the water abutting his property and, in turn, most expansive of the adjoining property owner\u2019s use.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>The critical element of this phase of the inquiry is the determination of the option which is least restrictive to neighboring uses. That determination, involving the application of the law to the facts, is a mixed question of law and fact. As we have seen, the standard of appellate review of such a question is \u201cwhether, ... a reasoning mind could reasonably have reached the conclusion reached by the [agency], consistent with a proper application of the [controlling legal principles].\u201d We hold that a reasoning mind could reasonably have reached the conclusion that the Board reached.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Consequently, we also hold that the circuit court did not err in affirming the Board\u2019s conclusion on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">\n<em>Inadequate findings of fact</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Appellants assert that the Board failed to make adequate findings of fact as required by the Board of Appeals Rule 18.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> They acknowledge that the Board referred to each of the factors required to be considered before granting a permit for the installation of pilings; however they argue that the Board utterly failed to make a finding regarding each factor. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Unlike the situation in <em>Ocean Hideaway Condo, v. Boardwalk Plaza, </em>68 Md.App. 650, 515 A.2d 485 (1986), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Board's Opinion and Order, consisting of ten pages, made adequate findings of fact. Not only did the Board summarize the testimony of the various witnesses that appeared before it, but it discussed the relevant ordinance, and made findings and drew conclusions, albeit some of the findings were made by reference back to the summarized testimony, and applied the law. Although the findings are not set out in the form that appellants would prefer, reviewing the Opinion and Order in context, and in its entirety, we are convinced that the decision in this case does not suffer from the deficiencies noted in the cases relied upon by appellants.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, we discern no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">\n<em>Power to regulate use of pilings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A9o\">Appellants finally contend that, even if appellees' pilings are \u201ctechnically within proper setbacks\u201d, the Board erred in refusing to consider and regulate the use of the pilings and boat slip. Specifically, appellants argue that the Board was under a duty to impose conditions as to the use of slips created by the installation of pilings. This argument is premised upon the provision in \u00a7 13-300 of the Anne Arundel County Code (1967) which prohibits the \u201cuse\u201d of a structure permitted by the Code used in a manner contrary to the general welfare and upon the definition of \u201cuse\u201d to mean \u201ca purpose for which a site is employed, taking the form of a structure or activity.\u201d \u00a7 1-120, Anne Arundel County Code (1985). Because the Code provides for the creation of a \u201cslip\u201d, \u201ca water area that is used for the wet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>storage or temporary docking of a watercraft in conjunction with a pier, piling, buoy, or other similar facility\u201d, \u00a7 l-100(62)(i), appellants contend that Planning and Zoning could, and should, have imposed conditions as to the use of such a slip so as to cause the least interference to neighboring uses. Their failure to consider even the existence of the \u201cslip\u201d and their refusal to impose conditions, were, in appellants\u2019 view error.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">We agree with the Board, that the only issue before it was the appropriate placement of the pilings in the water, not the placement of boats in the slip created by the pilings. The Board did not err and, consequently, neither did the circuit court in affirming its ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b329-9\">.

Section 13-300.16(a)(l), \u201cPiers\u201d, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-8\">(a) Private piers, wharves, mooring pilings, and buoy installations shall be limited to the lesser of: (1) one-half (I/2) the distance from mean high water line to the centerline of the body of water upon which it is situated____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">Upon the recodification of the Anne Arundel County Code in 1985, this section became Art. 28, \u00a7 10-111(a)(1). Unless otherwise stated, all future references to the Anne Arundel County Code are to Article 28.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b331-5\">. Article 28 \u00a7 10-111(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">(c) A pier, piling, or buoy installation shall be located at least 15 feet from a line extended:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-7\">(1) from the side property line at a 90 degree angle to the main course of the body of water;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-8\">(2) from the extension of the last course of the property line into the water;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-9\">(3) from the side property lines to the center of cove; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-10\">(4) from the side property lines generally parallel with existing piers located on adjacent properties.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b331-11\">. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-12\">(b) The location of a pier, piling or buoy installation shall be designated by the Office of Planning and Zoning provided that the choice of location is limited only to the option specified in subsection (c) of this section that will cause the least interference to neighboring uses.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b339-7\">. In this case, the parties agreed that appellees\u2019 suggested location for the pilings complied with each of the four options. In this case, given the configuration of the Causey\u2019s property, the center of the cove option is clearly the most restrictive of the four. Under that option, extending the Causey\u2019s property lines to the center of the cove to each of the property lines, forms a triangle in which the side closest to appellants\u2019 property slants away from appellant\u2019s property; thus the usable water space, available for placement of pilings, is less than that available by the application of other options.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b339-8\">. Rule 18. Findings and conclusions.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-9\">(a) Within (30) thirty days after the termination of the proceedings, the County Board of Appeals shall prepare and file in the proceedings and, where appropriate, in the land records of the county, a written succinct memorandum of their findings and conclusion; ... the County Board of Appeals\u2019 findings of fact shall rest entirely upon the pleadings and evidence presented at the hearings.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b340-5\">. There is not even a colorable similarity between the Opinion and Order in this case and that in <em>Ocean Highway, supra, See </em>66 Md.App. at 653-54, 515 A.2d 485. Nor may the Opinion and Order be rationally equated to the agency decisions at issue in <em>Turner v. Hammond, </em>270 Md. 41, 310 A.2d 543 (1973); <em>Pistoria v. Zoning Board, </em>268 Md. 558, 302 A.2d 614 (1973); <em>Baker v. Board of Trustees, </em>269 Md. 740, 309 A.2d 768 (1973); <em>Montgomery v. Board of County Commissioners, </em>256 Md. 597, 261 A.2d 447 (1970); <em>Bluebird Cab Company v. Department of Employment Security, </em>251 Md. 458, 248 A.2d 331 (1968). In none of these cases did the administrative agency go to the lengths that the Board did in this case in reviewing the evidence, finding facts, stating its conclusions from the evidence, and applying the law to the facts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
