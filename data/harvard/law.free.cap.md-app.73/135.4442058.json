We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">In this state, it has been firmly established that in criminal cases, when the defendant takes the stand as a witness in his own behalf he thereby places his character in issue and may be asked on cross-examination if he has been convicted of crime. <em>Burgess v. State, </em>161 Md. 162, 155 A. 153 (1931); <em>Niemoth v. State, </em>160 Md. 544, 154 A. 66 (1931); <em>Boone v. State, </em>2 Md.App. 80, 233 A.2d 476 (1967). The defendant is thus subjected to the same rules of cross-examination that govern other witnesses. <em>Davis v. State, </em>237 Md. 97, 205 A.2d 254 (1964); <em>Allen v. State, </em>183 Md. 603, 39 A.2d 820 (1944); <em>Guy v. State, </em>90 Md. 29, 44 A. 997 (1899). But when it is the defendant\u2019s criminal history that is being inquired into, the trial court should be mindful that there is more than mere credibility being attacked. A more pervasive potential for prejudice must be considered, namely, the prejudice that is likely to emanate from advising the trier of fact that the very defendant on trial before it is already a convicted criminal. <em>See Burrell v. State, </em>42 Md.App. 130, 399 A.2d 1354 (1979). Such prejudice is especially dangerous when the earlier crime is similar to that for which the defendant is currently being tried. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>States Supreme Court, in <em>Loper v. Beto, </em>405 U.S. 473, 92 S.Ct. 1014, 31 L.Ed.2d 374 (1972), observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\">That a record of prior convictions may actually do more than simply impeach a defendant\u2019s credibility has been often noted. <em>See, e.g., </em>C. McCormick, Evidence, \u00a7 43, p. 93 (1954):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-6\">The sharpest and most prejudicial impact of the practice of impeachment by conviction ... is upon one particular type of witness, namely, the accused in a criminal case who elects to take the stand. If the accused is forced to admit that he has a \u201crecord\u201d of past convictions, particularly if they are for crimes similar to the one on trial, the danger is obvious that the jury, despite instructions, will give more heed to the past convictions as evidence that the accused is the kind of man who would commit the crime on charge, or even that he ought to be put away without too much concern with present guilt, than they will to its legitimate bearing on credibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">405 U.S. at 482-83 n. 11, 92 S.Ct. at 1019 n. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">Judge Karwacki, speaking for this Court in <em>Duckett v. State, </em>61 Md.App. 151, 485 A.2d 691 (1985), <em>aff'd, </em>306 Md. 503, 510 A.2d 253 (1986), outlined the Maryland law governing the admission of evidence to impeach a witness, including a defendant-witness, through a showing of his criminal record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-9\">(1) The credibility of a witness is always a relevant issue in any case, civil or criminal;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-10\">(2) When a defendant in a criminal case elects to testify in his own defense, he subjects himself to the same rules of cross-examination that govern other witnesses;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-11\">(3) Evidence of a witness\u2019s prior conviction of an infamous crime is always admissible to impeach his credi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>bility regardless of the age of that conviction. Md. Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \u00a7 10-905 (Repl.Vol.1984, Cum.Supp.1987).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">(4) The admissibility of evidence of a witness\u2019s prior conviction of a non-infamous crime is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge who must consider the nature of the crime and the length of time since it occurred in determining the relevance of the conviction to the witness\u2019s credibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">61 Md.App. at 153-54, 485 A.2d 691. <em>See also, </em>L. McLain, <em>Maryland Evidence, </em>\u00a7 609 (1987). Therefore, the fact that a witness has been convicted of a crime is admissible to attack the witness\u2019s credibility only where the prior conviction was for (1) an infamous crime, (2) a crime involving moral turpitude, or (3) a lesser violation of the law which has some tendency to show that the witness is not to be believed. <em>State v. Duckett, </em>306 Md. 503, 510 A.2d 253 (1986); <em>Ricketts v. State, </em>291 Md. 701, 436 A.2d 906 (1981); <em>Paschall v. State, </em>71 Md.App. 234, 524 A.2d 1239 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">The Court of Appeals, in <em>Garitee v. Bond, </em>102 Md. 379, 62 A. 631 (1905), defined infamous crimes as those crimes of treason, felony, perjury, forgery, and other offenses, classified generally as <em>crimen falsi, </em>which impress upon their perpetrator such a moral taint that to permit him to testify in legal proceedings would injuriously affect the public administration of justice. <em>Accord, State v. Duckett, supra; Ricketts v. State, supra; Paschall v. State, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">It has never been fully determined what offenses, other than treason or felony, involve such moral turpitude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>as to have a legitimate bearing on one\u2019s credibility. The term \u201cmoral turpitude,\u201d while imprecise, connotes conduct which is \u201cbase or vile and contrary to the accepted and customary conduct between men.\u201d <em>State v. Duckett, supra; Ricketts v. State, supra; Dental Examiners v. Lazzell, </em>172 Md. 314, 191 A. 240 (1937). Moral turpitude suggests, therefore, \u201csuch a disregard for social values on the part of the perpetrator, that one could reasonably infer that such a person\u2019s testimony is suspect.\u201d <em>Ricketts, </em>291 Md. at 711, 436 A.2d 906. Finally, it has been held that to constitute moral turpitude the conduct involved must be intentional and not merely an act of negligence or an accident. <em>Ricketts, supra; Lazzell, supra; Paschall, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Crimes that are determined to be infamous or involving moral turpitude are always admissible as impeachment devices; the admission into evidence of a witness\u2019s prior conviction for a non-infamous crime is left to the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Cousins v. State, </em>230 Md. 2, 185 A.2d 488 (1962); <em>Cason v. State, </em>66 Md.App. 757, 505 A.2d 919 (1986); <em>Burrell v. State, supra. </em>To be admitted for impeachment purposes, such a lesser crime must taint an individual\u2019s credibility. The trial court, when exercising its discretion to admit or exclude lesser crimes as impeachment devices, needs to take into consideration the length of time since the offense occurred and the nature of the offense. <em>State v. Duckett, supra; Cousins v. State, supra; Paschall v. State, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">When dealing with the nature of the offense, the trial court must inquire whether the crime proffered for impeachment purposes involves, for example, the element of deceit, lying, or dishonesty which could lead a rational person reasonably to conclude that one who would commit such a crime would be less likely to tell the truth than one who would not commit such a crime. If that inquiry draws an affirmative response, the prior conviction is <em>prima facie </em>relevant; if the response is in the negative, however, then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>the evidence of the prior conviction should be considered \u201cclearly irrelevant\u201d and thus simply not admissible. <em>Burrell v. State, </em>42 Md.App. at 140, 399 A.2d 1354.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Next, the trial court needs to consider when the crime was committed. As a general rule, the farther in the past the crime, the weaker its relevance to present credibility. Judge Wilner, speaking for this Court in <em>Burrell v. State, supra, </em>likened the time requirement to the law of gravity. He noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-6\">[The time requirement] is somewhat akin to the law of gravity: the farther away one is from the mass, the less is its gravitational pull or influence. But, like another aspect of the law of gravity\u2014the larger the mass, the stronger is its pull at any given distance\u2014so it is that the more enormous the earlier crime <em>(i.e., </em>the more it embodies and therefore exudes dishonesty), the more likely will be its relevance, and thus its admissibility, even after the elapse of long intervals. With respect to other than infamous crimes, therefore, admissibility for impeachment purposes seems to be a function of a more or less direct ratio between the degree of dishonesty inherent in the earlier crime and the time elapsed since its commission. The greater the degree of dishonesty inherent in the earlier crime, the longer is the period of time since its commission that the conviction remains relevant, and therefore admissible, for impeachment purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">42 Md.App. at 140-41, 399 A.2d 1354.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">In conclusion, then, the law in Maryland relative to impeachment by a prior conviction bases its emphasis on the nature of the crime. The crime must be an infamous crime, one involving moral turpitude, or a lesser crime of a type which tends to indicate that the person convicted should not be believed. Therefore, it is essential that the crime itself <em>clearly </em>identify the nature of the prior conduct of the witness in order to show that he, as a result of his conviction of that crime, is unworthy of belief. <em>See, State v. Duckett, </em>306 Md. at 508, 510 A.2d 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>\n<em>Breaking and Entering\u2014Md.Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7 31A</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Appellant contends that statutory breaking and entering is not an infamous crime and thus could not have been admitted for impeachment purposes pursuant to Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \u00a7 10-905, <em>supra. </em>He further asserts that statutory breaking and entering requires no specific intent, and the trial court should have exercised its discretion to exclude evidence of the conviction. The State argues that statutory breaking and entering is an infamous crime or a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, echoing the trial judge who, as noted <em>supra, </em>stated, \u201cBut I consider breaking and entering an offense involving moral turpitude.\u201d This divergence of opinion as to the nature of statutory breaking and entering is understandable, since the crime, as pointed out by Judge Moylan, is a \u201clate starter in the burglary field____\u201d Moylan, <em>The Historical Intertwining of Maryland\u2019s Burglary and Larceny Laws or the Singular Adventure of the Misunderstood Indictment Clerk, </em>4 U.BaltL.Rev. 29, 31 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">At common law, burglary is defined as the breaking and entering of a dwelling house of another by night with the intent to commit a felony therein. <em>Jennings v. State, </em>8 Md.App. 312, 259 A.2d 543 (1969); <em>Reagan v. State, </em>4 Md.App. 590, 244 A.2d 623 (1968); <em>Hall v. State, </em>1 Md.App. 392, 230 A.2d 473 (1967). The requirement that each element of the offense\u2014breaking, entering, dwelling house, nighttime; felonious intent\u2014must be proved created problems for the prosecution when the facts of the case did not dovetail with all the elements of burglary. For instance, in <em>Dobbs\u2019 Case, 2 </em>East P.C. 513 (1770), the defendant, in the night, broke and entered a stable, within the curtilage of a dwelling, with the intent to disable a race horse. The horse died, and Dobbs was subsequently convicted of the felony of maliciously killing the horse. In the trial for burglary, however, he was held not guilty \u201cfor his intention was not to commit the felony, by killing and destroying the horse, but a trespass only to prevent his running; and therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>no burglary.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As a result of these problems, legislatures enacted statutes to make criminal conduct closely related to burglary that could not be prosecuted as burglary! <em>See, e.g., </em>Md.Code Ann. art. 27, \u00a7 30 (Breaking dwelling with intent to steal or commit felony); Md.Code Ann. art. 27, \u00a7 31B (Breaking and entering storehouse, etc., of another); Md.Code Ann. art. 27, \u00a7 32 (Breaking outhouse, etc., or into boat with intent to commit felony); Md.Code Ann. art. 27, \u00a7 33A (Breaking into building or boat with intent to steal). <em>See generally, </em>R. Perkins &amp; R. Boyce, <em>Criminal Law, </em>246-72 (3d ed. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">In 1973, the Maryland Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee received testimony from the State\u2019s Attorneys of various counties and Baltimore City that there was a need for a burglary offense of less severity than common law burglary or any of the then applicable statutory burglary-type crimes. The existence of such an offense, it was argued, would facilitate prosecutors in the handling of cases in which the felonious intent, a required element of common law burglary and all of the then statutory burglary offenses, of the intruder could not be clearly shown. Senate Bill 218 was drafted and submitted to the 1973 General Session with the intent of creating a criminal offense to comply with the State\u2019s Attorneys\u2019 wishes. Legislative Council of Maryland, Report to the General Assembly of 1973, at 122, item no. 187 (1973). <em>See also, </em>1973 Journal of Proceedings of the Senate of Maryland\u2014Regular Session <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>136.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Senate Bill 218 was passed as introduced, without any amendments, by both houses of the Maryland General Assembly. <em>See, </em>1973 Journal of Proceedings of the Senate of Maryland\u2014Regular Session 136, 255, 274; 1973 Journal of Proceedings of the House of Delegates of Maryland\u2014 Regular Session 280, 2444, 2593. Governor Marvin Mandel signed the enrolled bill into law on May 24, 1973. 1973 Md.Laws 661. That law read, as it does now, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ\">Any person who breaks and enters the dwelling house of another is guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not more than three (3) years or a fine of not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">Md.Code Ann. art. 27, \u00a7 31A (Repl.Vol.1982, Cum.Supp. 1987). The gravamen of the offense is the breaking and entering of the dwelling of another. To be convicted of statutory breaking and entering, as is evident from the legislative intent of the bill, no intent to commit a felony or to steal personal property need be shown. <em>See, </em>R. Gilbert &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>C. Moylan, <em>Maryland Criminal Law\u2014Practice &amp; Procedure, </em>\u00a7 11.3 (1983), <em>see also, </em>Moylan, <em>supra, </em>4 U.Balt.L. Rev. 29, 31 (1974). The misdemeanor crime of statutory breaking and entering, therefore, is a nebulous one as it relates to the intent of the perpetrator, since no showing of any particular intent is required for a conviction under art. 27, \u00a7 31A. All that must be shown is that the perpetrator broke and entered a dwelling place of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Returning to the facts of this case, the trial judge admitted appellant\u2019s prior breaking and entering conviction in order to impeach appellant\u2019s credibility because he considered any breaking and entering to be an offense involving moral turpitude. We disagree. Since misdemeanor breaking and entering involves no felonious or larcenous intent, it is a crime of general intent that includes within its scope a variety of acts, including some that are reckless or negligent. <em>See Ricketts v. State, </em>291 Md. at 713, 436 A.2d 906. A conviction for that offense may result either from a well-planned scheme\u2014or merely rash, impetuous conduct of a defendant. While the record before us does not include the underlying facts of appellant\u2019s prior conviction, appellant\u2019s counsel stated in his objection that appellant had been convicted of breaking and entering his sister\u2019s home. For all we can determine from the mere fact of the conviction, appellant might have broken and entered his sister\u2019s home to commit a felony or merely to recover his own property. Consequently, the conviction of breaking and entering does not necessarily indicate such \u201cbase or vile\u201d conduct as would constitute it a crime of moral turpitude. We hold, therefore, that it is not an offense involving such moral turpitude that evidence of a conviction may be used for impeachment purposes. Nor is it among those crimes classified as <em>crimen falsi, </em>which, by their nature, speak directly to the credibility of the offender. While statutory breaking and entering is a lesser offense of the \u201cinfamous crime\u201d of burglary, a felony, <em>Johnson v. State, </em>38 Md.App. 100, 379 A.2d 436 (1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>282 Md. 734 (1978), breaking and entering itself is not a felony or an infamous crime. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>Therefore, it cannot be used automatically for impeachment purposes pursuant to Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \u00a7 10-905.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Finally, we do not believe that statutory breaking and entering is among those lesser violations having \u201csome tendency to show that the person charged is not to be believed under oath.\u201d <em>Cousins v. State, </em>230 Md. at 4, 185 A.2d 488. This is so because the offense of statutory breaking and entering lacks the proof of any conduct that \u201ccould lead a rational person reasonably to conclude that one who would commit such a crime would be less likely to speak the truth than one who would not commit such a crime,\u201d <em>Burrell v. State, </em>42 Md.App. at 140, 399 A.2d 1354, and the lack of a requirement of any particular <em>mens rea </em>makes it impossible to say that one\u2019s conduct in committing that crime renders his credibility suspect. <em>See, State v. Duckett, </em>306 Md. at 509, 510 A.2d 253.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">In summary, therefore, we conclude that the trial court was in error in permitting the appellant to be impeached by his prior breaking and entering conviction because breaking and entering pursuant to Md.Code Ann. art. 27, \u00a7 31A is neither an infamous crime, nor a crime of moral turpitude, nor a lesser offense of such nature that its commission would impute taint to one\u2019s credibility as a witness. Thus, we add Md.Code Ann. art. 27, \u00a7 31A breaking and entering to those offenses that cannot be used for impeachment. <em>See, e.g., State v. Duckett, </em>306 Md. 503, 510 A.2d 253 (1986) (assault and battery); <em>Lowery v. State, </em>292 Md. 2, 437 A.2d 193 (1981) (per curiam) (possession of barbiturates); <em>Ricketts v. State, </em>291 Md. 701, 436 A.2d 906 (1981) (indecent exposure); <em>Nesbit v.

During the State\u2019s cross-examination of the appellant, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-8\">THE STATE: And you\u2019re saying that the dogs were never placed in the den?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-9\">APPELLANT: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-10\">THE STATE: She\u2019s incorrect when she said that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-11\">APPELLANT: Yes, sir. I didn\u2019t even\u2014I wasn\u2019t even aware she had a den.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-12\">THE STATE: Sir, you had been in that house previously; hadn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-13\">APPELLANT: Yes, sir, I had.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-14\">THE STATE: You knew where every piece of furniture was in that house; didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-15\">APPELLANT: I wouldn\u2019t say every piece, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-16\">THE STATE: Well, sir, on March 14th, 1986, didn\u2019t you tell Detective Davidson that you knew where every piece of furniture was in that premises?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-17\">APPELLANT: I told him that I could describe the room. Not every piece of furniture or every knickknack or what color the carpet was or anything like that. I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>could describe the couch and I could describe the kitchen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\">THE STATE: And you didn\u2019t know there was a den?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">APPELLANT: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-7\">APPELLANT'S ATTORNEY: Your Honor, may I approach the bench?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-8\">THE COURT: Sure. Come up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-9\">(BENCH CONFERENCE)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-10\">(THEREUPON, THE DEFENDANT NOT PRESENT AT THE BENCH.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-12\">APPELLANT\u2019S ATTORNEY: If he\u2019s going to impeach Mr. Bane through his statement, I think the proper way to do it is to give him the statement to look at it before asking him that type of question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-13\">THE COURT: No, sir. You are absolutely wrong. You ask the question first, and if he denies it, then you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-14\">APPELLANT\u2019S ATTORNEY: In addition, Your Honor, I would have a continuing objection to any questions asked concerning the statement, whether it\u2019s for impeachment or for substantive purposes, as a violation of his Sixth Amendment right, as he asked for counsel and was not afforded one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-15\">THE COURT: Was this litigated?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-16\">THE STATE: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-17\">THE COURT: And it was denied?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-18\">THE STATE: Your Honor, the motion was denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-19\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-20\">APPELLANT\u2019S ATTORNEY: I just want the record to reflect that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-21\">THE COURT: All right. I have no problem with that. We\u2019re not going to re-litigate here, that\u2019s for sure, although I will note that I have the authority to re-litigate it, but I\u2019m not about to do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-22\">APPELLANT\u2019S ATTORNEY: I just want the record to reflect that I object and move to strike the last question concerning the use of the statement for impeachment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>purposes, and I would like possibly to have a continuing objection to any other question involved with his statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-4\">THE COURT: I will grant you a continuing objection to protect your position with respect to the statement. And as I understand it, it\u2019s based on your contention that the denial of your motion to suppress it was incorrect?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">APPELLANT\u2019S ATTORNEY: That\u2019s correct, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">THE COURT: Okay. I\u2019ll give you a continuing objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">APPELLANT\u2019S ATTORNEY: Thank you, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-8\">(BENCH CONFERENCE TERMINATED.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">Appellant asserts that the questioning concerning the \u201cevery piece of furniture\u201d was improper impeachment because the State had not laid a proper foundation. Appellee, however, asserts that this issue is not properly preserved for appeal because appellant is now asserting a different reason for error than he did at trial. Specifically, appellee contends that although appellant\u2019s initial objection focused on improper foundation, he abandoned that objection and asserted that the statement made to Detective Davidson by appellant was made in violation of appellant\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">We disagree. By objecting to further questioning about the statement on constitutional grounds, appellant did not abandon his initial objection on the ground that no proper foundation had been laid. Counsel clearly indicated that the new objection on constitutional grounds was in addition to, not in lieu of, his initial objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">Under Maryland law, a witness may be impeached by cross-examination to show that the witness previously made a statement contrary to the one made on the witness stand. <em>Foster v. State, </em>297 Md. 191, 464 A.2d 986 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 1073, 104 S.Ct. 985, 79 L.Ed.2d 221 (1984); <em>Gray v. State, </em>43 Md.App. 238, 403 A.2d 853, <em>cert. denied, </em>286 Md. 747 (1979); <em>Yowell v. State, </em>28 Md.App. 279, 344 A.2d 442 (1975). <em>See generally, </em>L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>McLain, <em>Maryland Evidence, </em>\u00a7 613.1 (1987). To impeach a witness by a prior inconsistent statement, a proper foundation must be laid. <em>State v. Kidd, </em>281 Md. 32, 46 n. 8, 375 A.2d 1105 <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1002, 98 S.Ct. 646, 54 L.Ed.2d 498 (1977); <em>Campbell v. Patton, </em>227 Md. 125, 175 A.2d 761 (1961). When using a previously made <em>oral </em>statement for impeachment, the cross-examiner must inform the witness of the time and place the statement was made, the person to whom it was made, and its substance. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Appellant\u2019s contention that the State was required to show him a prior statement before using it to impeach him would have been correct only if the prior statement had been a written one. <em>See Whisner v. Whisner, </em>122 Md. 195, 89 A. 393 (1914).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The purpose of laying a foundation is \u201cto accord the witness the opportunity to reflect upon the prior statement so that he may admit it or deny it, or make such explanation of it as he considers necessary or desirable.\u201d <em>Devan v. State, </em>17 Md.App. 182, 193, 300 A.2d 705, <em>cert. denied, </em>268 Md. 747 (1973). <em>See also, Sanders v. State, </em>1 Md.App. 630, 232 A.2d 555 (1967). Here, the State gave the appellant the following facts concerning the prior statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">1. The time\u2014March 14, 1986.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-8\">2. To whom the statement was made\u2014Detective Davidson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-9\">3. Substance of the statement\u2014\u201c... didn\u2019t you tell Detective Davidson that you knew where every piece of furniture was in the premises?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">Absent from these facts is an express statement of the place where the statement was made. That, however, is not fatal to a proper foundation because, as we said in <em>Devan v. State, </em>17 Md.App. at 193, 300 A.2d 705, \u201cthere is no unvarying formula or ritual required for the establishment of a foundation to impeach.\u201d We believe a proper foundation was laid here because appellant was given sufficient information concerning his prior statement that he had \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>opportunity to reflect upon the prior statement so that he [could] admit it or deny it, or make such explanation of it as he considered] necessary or desirable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This is confirmed by appellant\u2019s response to the prosecutor\u2019s question about his prior statement: \u201cI told him that I could describe the room. Not every piece of furniture or every knickknack or what color the carpet was or anything like that. I could describe the couch and I could describe the kitchen.\u201d It is pellucid, therefore, that appellant had been given enough information to enable him to \u201cmake such explanation of [the statement] as he considered] necessary or desirable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">JUDGMENTS REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED FOR NEW TRIAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b165-13\">.

Because the second degree rape charge involved a proof of force, <em>see </em>Md.Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 463(a)(1), the battery charge was merged into the rape conviction as a lesser included offense. <em>See, Brooks </em>v. <em>State, </em>284 Md. 416, 397 A.2d 596 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b166-18\">. The State has not argued that appellant's comment constituted a waiving of his counsel\u2019s objection. The court apparently did not regard it as a waiver, since it proceeded to rule on the objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b167-18\">. The record does not contain the certified copy of the conviction. The appellant\u2019s pre-sentence report, included with the record, reveals that the appellant was convicted of statutory breaking and entering pursuant to Md.Code Ann. art. 27, \u00a7 31 A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b167-19\">. At the end of the trial the court did give a cautionary instruction concerning the use by the jury of appellant\u2019s prior conviction. <em>See, Piles v. State, </em>233 Md. 487, 197 A.2d 238 (1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b168-10\">. The danger of a trier of fact drawing an improper inference from evidence of admitted prior convictions has led the Court of Appeals to place restrictions upon the admissibility of such evidence for any substantive purpose. <em>See, Cross v. State, </em>282 Md. 468, 386 A.2d 757 (1978); <em>Ross v. State, </em>276 Md. 664, 350 A.2d 680 (1976). Thus, the fact that the appellant was being tried, <em>inter alia, </em>for breaking and entering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>pursuant to Md.Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 31A would itself be a sound reason for rejecting evidence of a prior conviction of the same offense for purpose of impeachment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b170-10\">. Section 10-905 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-11\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014Evidence is admissible to prove the interest of a witness in any proceeding, or the fact of his conviction of an infamous crime. Evidence of conviction is not admissible if an appeal is pending, or the time for an appeal has not expired, or the conviction has been reversed, and there has been no retrial or reconviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-12\">(b) <em>Certificate under seal as </em>evidence.\u2014The certificate, under the seal of the clerk of the court, of the court in which the conviction occurred is sufficient evidence of the conviction.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b174-6\">. Other elements of common law burglary have also presented problems. <em>See e.g., Marston v.
