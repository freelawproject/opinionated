All but 18 months of that sentence was immediately suspended in favor of three years probation upon his release from confinement. Within 30 days after the entry of judgment, Rendelman filed both a notice of appeal to this Court and an application pursuant to Md.Code Ann. art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 645JA-645JG and Md.Rule 4-344 for review of sentence. Although Rendelman was represented by the Public Defender\u2019s Office in the appeal, the application for review of sentence was filed <em>pro se </em>and all proceedings pursuant to it were conducted by Rendelman without benefit of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-14\">In an unreported opinion filed June 1, 1987, this Court affirmed the judgment from which the appeal had been taken. <em>Rendelman v. State, </em>S.T.1986, No. 1449. Meanwhile, on March 11, 1987, the sentence review panel, based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>principally on certain opprobrious conduct of Rendelman since his initial sentence, struck the suspended part of that sentence, thereby effectively increasing his potential period of incarceration by some eight and a half years. The order stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\">\u201cThis matter having come before the Court on February 20, 1987, for a hearing on the Defendant\u2019s Petition for Modification of Sentence, and the Court having considered the arguments of counsel for the State and the defendant acting in proper person as well as written submissions from both sides, it is thereupon, this <em>11th </em>day of <em>March, </em>1987,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">ORDERED, that the sentence originally imposed in this case be modified as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ank\">a. That the defendant is sentenced to the Division of Correction for a period of ten (10) years, <em>no </em>portion of said sentence to be suspended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-7\">c. That the Court strongly recommends placement of the defendant at the Patuxent Institute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">From that order, Rendelman has brought this appeal, complaining that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-9\">\u201cI. The appellant was improperly denied his right to assistance of counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-10\">II. The three judge panel erroneously increased appellant\u2019s sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-11\">III. The statutory provisions of Art. 27, \u00a7 645JA permitting the increase of a sentence, upon application for review, are violative of the due process and double jeopardy set forth in the Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-12\">IV. The three judge panel was without jurisdiction to render a decision following the termination of the thirty day period established by statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-13\">V. Appellant is entitled to withdraw his application for review of sentence in light of the failure of the State to send him notice of such hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>The State naturally contests the merit of all of these complaints; it has, in addition, moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that no appeal lies from an order of a sentence review panel. That, of course, is a threshold issue that'we must resolve first.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">(a) Appealability</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Md.Code Ann. art. 27, \u00a7 645JA(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-7\">\u201cUnless no different sentence could have been imposed or unless the sentence was imposed by more than one trial judge, every person convicted of a crime by any trial court of this State and sentenced to serve, with or without suspension, a total of more than two years imprisonment in any penal or correctional institution in this State shall be entitled to have the sentence reviewed by a panel of three or more trial judges of the judicial circuit in which the sentencing court is located. However, a person has no right to have any sentence reviewed more than once pursuant to this section. Notwithstanding any rule of the Court of Appeals to the contrary, the judge who sentenced the convicted person shall not be one of the members of the panel, but if he so desires he may sit with the panel in an advisory capacity only.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Section 645JC authorizes the panel to \u201corder a different sentence to be imposed or served, including ... an increased or decreased sentence.\u201d If the panel orders any different sentence, it \u201cshall resentence and notify the convicted person in accordance with the order of the panel.\u201d Section 645JG directs the Court of Appeals to promulgate Rules to implement the statute, which the .Court has done through Md.Rule 4-344.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">In <em>Glass v. State, </em>24 Md.App. 76, 329 A.2d 109 (1974), the appellant had been convicted of an attempted sex offense and of assault, for which he received concurrent sentences of five and two years. As did Mr. Rendelman, Glass filed both an appeal and an application under \u00a7 645JA-JG for review of sentence. During the pendency of the appeal, the sentence review panel confirmed the existing sentence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Glass moved to supplement the record on appeal to add the proceeding before the sentence review panel in order to provide a basis for his challenge to certain aspects of that proceeding. We denied that motion on the ground that no appeal would lie from an order of a sentence review panel. The Court stated, at 79, 329 A.2d 109:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-5\">\u201cThe appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland is bestowed by legislative enactment. The statutes provide no right of appeal to that Court by a person from an order of a sentence review panel nor is an appeal from such an order designated to be within its appellate jurisdiction. Under Courts Art. \u00a7 12-301 \u2018... a party may appeal from a final judgment entered in a civil or criminal case by a circuit court. The right of appeal exists from a final judgment entered by a court in the exercise of original, special, limited, statutory jurisdiction, unless in a particular case the right of appeal is expressly denied by law.\u2019 A sentence review panel is not a court. \u2018 \u201cCircuit court\u201d means the circuit court for a county ... \u2019 and the courts of the Supreme Bench of Baltimore City. Courts Art. \u00a7 12-101(d). The right of appeal from the order of a sentence review panel is clearly not within the contemplation of Courts Art. \u00a7 12-301. Courts Art. \u00a7 12-308 specifically designates those actions, cases, causes, suits or proceedings with respect to which the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland has exclusive initial appellate jurisdiction. Proceedings before a sentence review panel is not among them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">(Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">We reaffirmed that conclusion in <em>State v. Ward, </em>31 Md.App. 68, 354 A.2d 834 (1976). The defendant there had initially been sentenced to three years imprisonment, all of which was suspended in favor of three years probation. Subsequently, upon a finding that conditions of the probation had been violated, the court struck the probation and directed execution of the three-year sentence. Upon an application for review filed pursuant to \u00a7 645JA, a review panel modified that order by suspending all but 18 months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>of the three-year sentence. The State appealed, contending that the panel had no jurisdiction to consider the application because it was filed more than 30 days after the initial imposition of the sentence. See State\u2019s Brief in No. 759, S.T.1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">On Ward\u2019s motion, we dismissed the appeal. We began by quoting and confirming what we had said in Glass\u2014that \u201c[a] sentence review panel is not a court\u201d <em>(State v. Ward, supra, </em>at 72, 354 A.2d 834) and that no appeal would lie from its order. We acknowledged that, under <em>State ex rel. Sonner v. Shearin, </em>272 Md. 502, 325 A.2d 573 (1974), and <em>State v. Wooten, </em>277 Md. 114, 352 A.2d 829 (1976), the State could appeal from the denial of a motion to correct an illegal sentence, but found, in that case, that (1) the sentence at issue was not facially illegal and (2) the State had never asked the trial court to correct the action of the review panel and so its appeal did not fall within the narrow exception allowed by <em>Shearin </em>and <em>Wooten.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The State\u2019s motion to dismiss this appeal is based principally upon <em>Glass </em>and <em>Ward. </em>We do not believe those cases are controlling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">In <em>Teasley v. State, </em>298 Md. 364, 370, 470 A.2d 337 (1984), the Court of Appeals observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-8\">\u201c[ajppellate review of sentences is extremely limited in Maryland; only three grounds of review are recognized: (1) the sentence may not constitute cruel and unusual punishment or otherwise violate constitutional requirements; (2) the sentencing judge may not be motivated by ill will, prejudice or other impermissible considerations; and (3) the sentence must be within statutory limitations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">In light of this limited scope of appellate review, we think that there is a significant difference between a confirmance or reduction in sentence by a review panel, as occurred in <em>Glass </em>and <em>Ward, </em>and an increase ordered by it, as occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>Putting aside the special issues pertaining to the ability of the <em>State </em>to appeal from a reduction in sentence, the fact is that, where the panel merely confirms the existing sentence, the relevant inquiry ordinarily is into that sentence and the procedure leading to its initial imposition. The sentence either violates Constitutional or statutory requirements or it does not; the trial judge who imposed the sentence acted properly and complied with mandatory procedure or did not. Challenging what occurred before the review panel usually adds nothing of real substance. Where the panel <em>increases </em>the sentence, however, the focus \u2022 is necessarily and quite properly on what occurred before the panel. <em>Its </em>sentence, not that initially imposed by the trial judge, is what must pass muster, because that is the effective sentence in the case. <em>That </em>is the sentence that must be within Constitutional and statutory limits; it is that proceeding that must comport with required procedure; it is the <em>panel </em>then that must be free of \u201cill will, prejudice or other impermissible considerations.\u201d <em>Teasley, supra, </em>at 370, 470 A.2d 337.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Viewed in this light, it is apparent that some of the legal underpinning of <em>Glass </em>and <em>Ward </em>is not entirely accurate and that the actual holdings in those cases cannot control the situation now before us. In particular, where, as here, the review panel effectively increases the sentence imposed (or directed to be executed) by the trial judge, the notion that the panel does not constitute a \u201ccourt\u201d or that its order does not constitute a \u201cjudgment\u201d simply does not comport with either logic or reality. It is, and must be, a court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Only a court can sentence a convicted criminal to jail. That is peculiarly a judicial function (see <em>Ex Parte United States, </em>242 U.S. 27, 37 S.Ct. 72, 61 L.Ed. 129 (1916)) which, in this instance, is committed to the Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Rule 4-344, at least implicitly, recognizes the review panel as a court. Section (a), which makes specific reference to \u00a7\u00a7 645JA-JG, requires that the application be filed \u201cin the sentencing court\u201d; \u00a7 645JF defines \u201csentencing court\u201d as \u201cthe court in which the sentencing judge imposed the sentence____\u201d There is nothing in the Rule to suggest that, once filed in \u201cthe sentencing court,\u201d the application is acted upon by any other tribunal. What seems plain from all of this is that the sentence review procedure remains, as it must, in the court where the case was tried and the sentence imposed. The statute merely provides a procedure for three judges, acting for the court, to review the sentence imposed by a single judge, acting for the court. The decision of the panel, to the extent that it changes the sentence, is the decision of the court; indeed, by finally concluding the rights of the parties at that level, it is the final judgment of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">For these reasons, we conclude that, subject to the limited scope of appellate review noted in <em>Teasley, supra, </em>the order of the panel in this case is appealable by Rendelman. We therefore deny the State\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-9\">(b) Right to Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">Quite apart from whether Rendelman had a Constitutional right to the assistance of counsel in the sentence review proceeding (see <em>Consiglio v. Warden, State Prison, </em>153 Conn. 673, 220 A.2d 269 (1966); <em>Stack v. State, </em>492 A.2d 599 (Me.1985); <em>In re Croteau, </em>353 Mass. 736, 234 N.E.2d 737 (1968)), he clearly had a statutory right to such assistance. Section 645JE of art. 27 provides, in relevant part, that any person having the right to file an application for review \u201cshall have the right to be represented by counsel retained by him, or appointed by the sentencing judge ... in connec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>tion with filing application for such review.\u201d More significantly, in terms of this case, \u00a7 645JE states further that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADG\">\u201c[i]f the panel holds a hearing in connection with any review of a sentence pursuant to this subtitle, the defendant shall be entitled to appear in person at the hearing and to be represented by counsel retained by him, or previously appointed by the sentencing judge, or appointed by one or more members of the panel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">Md.Rule 4-215 \u201cmandates a procedure specifically designed to protect\u201d the right to counsel. <em>Vincenti v. State, </em>309 Md. 601, 604, 525 A.2d 1072 (1987). The Rule requires the court to inform the defendant of his right to counsel and to decline to accept any express waiver of counsel until assured, after an examination of the defendant on the record, that the waiver is a knowing and voluntary one.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">There can be no doubt that Rendelman knowingly, voluntarily, and effectively waived his right to counsel at his trial. All of the requirements of Rule 4-215 were complied with; indeed, the judges presiding at different points in the proceeding implored him in vain to accept the benefit of counsel. It is equally clear that no advice was given to him and no inquiry pursuant to the Rule was made by the review panel. He filed the application <em>pro se </em>and he appeared at the February 20 hearing without counsel, and yet, despite his representation by counsel in his then-pending appeal, no one asked whether he understood that he had a right to counsel in the sentence review proceeding, whether he wanted counsel, or whether he had made any effort to obtain counsel. Two questions are thus presented: (1) does Rule 4-215 apply to sentence review proceedings and, (2) if so, could the panel rely on the waiver of counsel at trial as extending to the review proceeding?</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">We have no difficulty at all with the first of these questions. As noted above, the Rule was intended to implement and protect the right to counsel; there is a right to counsel at these proceedings; the Rule therefore applies. In <em>Vincenti v. State, supra, </em>309 Md. 601, 525 A.2d 1072, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>and even more recently in <em>Wilkes v. State </em>(S.T.1987, <em>No. 54, </em>Op. filed 11/4/87 <em>sub nom. Maus v. State, </em>311 Md. 85, 532 A.2d 1066), the Court held that the Rule applied even in probation revocation proceedings, which are regarded as civil in nature. If Rule 4-215, a rule of criminal procedure, applies in probation revocation proceedings, surely it must apply in sentence review proceedings which are criminal in nature and where, unlike revocation proceedings, the sentence can be <em>increased.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">In arguing the second question\u2014that the valid waiver at trial extended over to the review proceeding\u2014the State relies principally on <em>Grandison v. State, </em>305 Md. 685, 752, 506 A.2d 580, <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 107 S.Ct. 38, 93 L.Ed.2d 174 (1986). We think <em>Grandison </em>is distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\"><em>Grandison </em>was a capital punishment case. The defendant had effectively waived counsel prior to trial and represented himself at the guilt/innocence stage. At the sentencing proceeding, he indicated a desire to have counsel, claiming that \u201che was entitled to change his mind about representation because the case actually was two separate trials.\u201d 305 Md. at 751. 'The trial court disagreed; it found that he had validly waived counsel and required him to proceed <em>pro se. </em>The Court of Appeals affirmed, rejecting his arguments that he was entitled to a \u201creadvisement\u201d of his right to counsel and that his earlier waiver was not applicable to the sentencing proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\"><em>Grandison </em>is distinguishable for two reasons. First, the sentencing proceeding there was an inextricable part of one trial; the waiver was effective for the trial, and that included the sentencing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That unity does not exist here. A sentence review proceeding is not part of the trial; indeed, the trial (sentencing) judge may not sit with the review panel except in an advisory capacity. Art. 27, \u00a7 645JA(a); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>Md.Rule 4-344(d). Second, in <em>Grandison, </em>the judge in the sentencing proceeding actually made a finding of waiver, based on Grandison\u2019s pre-trial conduct. No such finding was made in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">The need for such a finding was underscored in <em>Wilkes v. State, supra, sub nom. Maus v. State, </em>311 Md. 85, 532 A.2d 1066. There, as here, the State\u2019s waiver argument was premised on the fact that, on earlier occasions, the defendant had been properly informed of his right to counsel. Acknowledging that the failure to obtain counsel in the face of that advice could constitute a waiver, the Court observed, at 33 of the slip opinion, that \u201c[t]he problem here is first, that the trial [i.e., hearing] judge made no finding of a knowing and intelligent waiver of this right, based upon Wilkes\u2019s inaction or otherwise. And more fundamentally, the judge did not comply with the requirements of Rule 4-215(d).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">In this context, a sentence review proceeding is not much different than a first post-conviction proceeding. They are both independent, post-trial, post-judgment proceedings at which the applicant/petitioner has a right to counsel. A waiver of counsel at trial would no more carry over into a sentence review proceeding than it would to a post-conviction proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Given the real jeopardy faced by an applicant for sentence review\u2014the possibility of an increased sentence\u2014we believe that Rule 4-215 is applicable and must be satisfied. A waiver cannot be tacitly assumed from what occurred prior to trial. Because there was no compliance with the Rule in this case, we shall vacate the order appealed from and remand for a new hearing. We therefore need not address the remaining questions raised by Rendelman, all of which are, or may become, moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">ORDER OF SENTENCE REVIEW PANEL VACATED; CASE REMANDED FOR NEW HEARING; MONTGOMERY COUNTY TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b361-6\">. We do not mean to suggest here, as we did in <em>Glass </em>and <em>Ward, </em>that the action of a review panel is entirely immune from appellate review when the sentence is not increased. Denial of a fundamental right by the panel, such as the right to counsel (see infra), must be subject to appellate review, even if the sentence is not increased, for, absent that denial, the panel might have been persuaded to decrease the sentence. The distinction between an increase in sentence and a mere confirmance or decrease has more to do with attacks on the sentence itself, the factors that were considered, and the general conduct of the sentencing proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b364-9\">. Compare Md.Code Ann.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc. art., \u00a7\u00a7 3-820 and 3-821 making the adjudicatory and disposition proceedings in juvenile causes entirely separate proceedings and affording a right to counsel \"at every stage of any proceeding under this subtitle.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
