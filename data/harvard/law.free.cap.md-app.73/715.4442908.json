BELL, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b743-11\">The facts of this case are not in dispute. James W. S\u00faber, appellant, an employee of Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (W.M.A.T.A.), appellee, reported to his supervisor, on January 21, 1986, that he had been injured in the course of his employment. After he had completed an Employee Report of Injury form, the matter was referred to appellee\u2019s workmen\u2019s compensation claims agent for investigation. Thereafter, appellant received temporary total disability benefits accounting from January 22, 1986 through April 30, 1986. Appellant returned to full time employment duties after having been examined by a doctor to whom appellee had referred him.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>Appellant filed a claim for workmen\u2019s compensation with the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission on or about May 22, 1986. Having assigned a consideration date <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of June 16, 1986, the Commission notified appellee both that a claim had been filed and of the consideration date. When there was no response from appellee, the Commission issued a pro forma order on June 20, 1986. That order provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-4\">After due consideration of the above entitled case the Commission finds that the said claimant sustained an accidental personal injury arising out of and in the course of employment by the said employer on 1/21/86 that the nature and extent of disability sustained, if any, cannot be determined at this time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Pursuant to that order, appellant, on July 7, 1986, submitted for consideration by the Commission the \u201cissue\u201d of the \u201cnature and extent of any permanent partial disability\u201d to appellant\u2019s cervical spine and shoulder. A copy of the \u201cissue\u201d was sent to appellee. On August 25, 1986, appellee responded by filing four \u201cissues\u201d of its own. In addition to the issue raised'by appellant, it challenged whether appellant sustained an accidental personal injury arising out of and in the course of his employment and whether his disability was the result of an accidental personal injury arising out of and in the course of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">When the matter came on for hearing, the Commissioner, over appellant\u2019s objection, permitted appellee to pursue its late filed issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-7\">I\u2019ll tell you what we\u2019ll do. That\u2019s quite a time after the consideration date. I don\u2019t know whether it slipped through the Claims Examiner, but whatever the situation, I\u2019m going to hear the testimony, but I\u2019ll tell you now that I\u2019m inclined to look very distastefully at raising the issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>at this particular time after this long period of time has passed. It might work as a prejudice\u2014we\u2019ll take the testimony and I\u2019ll make a ruling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">After hearing the testimony, the Commissioner passed an order finding that \u201c... the claimant did not [sustain] an accidental injury arising out of and in the course of his employment as alleged to have occurred on January 21, 1986____\u201d Therefore, he disallowed the claim and rescinded and annulled the June 20, 1986 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Appellant appealed to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, attacking the authority of the Commission to consider issues which were submitted after the consideration date and after the pro forma order had been issued by the Commission, in violation of its published rules and regulations. He also questioned whether appellee had waived its right to contest the claim. No issue was presented as to the propriety of the Commission\u2019s ruling on the merits. Both sides moved for summary judgment. The lower court granted appellee\u2019s motion, ruling that Maryland Code Ann. art. 101 \u00a7 40(c) \u201callows the Commission to hear those issues at a later time, to litigate those issues at a later time, and the Commissioner ruled correctly.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">On appeal, appellant presents the same two issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-8\">1. Did the Maryland Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission commit error by its refusal to enforce and adhere to the published agency rules and to permit the Employer\u2014 self-insurer to raise defenses of accidental injury and causal connection to the claim for workmen\u2019s compensation benefits?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-9\">2. Did the Employer\u2014self-insurer knowingly or intentionally waive its defenses to the claim for worker\u2019s compensation benefits by failing to contest the claim within the period of time allowed under the Commission\u2019s procedural rules as well as by voluntarily paying Appellant James W. S\u00faber all temporary total disability benefits claimed before deciding to contest the claim and only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>after receiving notice that Claimant intended to seek additional workmen\u2019s compensation benefits?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Section 40(c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-6\">(c) Modification or changes. The powers and jurisdiction of the Commission over each case shall be continuing, and it may, from time to time, make such modifications or changes with respect to former findings or orders with respect thereto as in its opinion may be justified; provided, however, that no modification or change of any award of compensation shall be made by the Commission unless application therefor shall be made to the Commission within five years next following the last payment of compensation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">This provision is exceedingly broad, indeed, it is \u201cone of the broadest re-opening statutes\u201d, which, \u201cnot only gives the Commission continuing jurisdiction over each case, [but] it also invests the Commission with blanket power to make such changes [in its former findings or orders] as in its opinion may be justified.\u201d <em>Subsequent Injury Fund v. Baker, </em>40 Md.App. 339, 345, 392 A.2d 94 (1978). It authorizes the Commission to reopen a case for the purpose of reconsidering an issue already decided, <em>Adkins v. Weisner, </em>238 Md. 411, 412-14, 209 A.2d 255 (1965); <em>Charles Free-land v. Couplin, </em>211 Md. 160, 164-68, 126 A.2d 606 (1956); <em>Hathcock v. Loftin, </em>179 Md. 676, 678, 22 A.2d 479 (1941); <em>Stevenson v. Hill, </em>170 Md. 676, 681-84, 185 A. 551 (1936), even in the absence of a change of facts or newly discovered evidence. <em>Baker, </em>40 Md.App. at 346, 392 A.2d 94. <em>See Ratcliffe v. Clarke\u2019s Red Barn, </em>64 Md.App. 293, 300, 494 A.2d 983 (1985). Because, \u201c[i]n a real sense, \u00a7 40 (c) gives the Commission a revisionary power akin to that available to courts under Md.Ann. Code Courts article \u00a7 6-408, and Maryland Rule 625 a. [present Rule 2-535], but without the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>thirty day limitation,\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it is clear that the Commission is not \u201cirrevocably bound by its earlier findings.\u201d <em>Vinci v. Allied Research, </em>51 Md.App. 517, 522, 444 A.2d 462 (1982). <em>See Anchor Motor v. Sub. Injury Fund, </em>278 Md. 320, 328, 363 A.2d 505 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">This Court, in <em>East Coast Freight Lines, Inc. v. Harris, </em>37 Md.App. 256, 377 A.2d 530 (1977), considered the question whether the Commission had authority to entertain \u201cissues\u201d filed after the adoption of an award of compensation and to vacate that award. There, the employer filed issues late, and the question whether the employer was insured was a matter that was the subject of considerable confusion. 37 Md.App. at 262, 377 A.2d 530. The Commission, having entertained the late filed issues and found that the employee\u2019s claim for compensation should be disallowed, \u201crescinded and annulled\u201d its prior order. 37 Md. App. at 261, 377 A.2d 530. On appeal to the Circuit Court, the employee argued that filing issues late was, in effect, a request for rehearing pursuant to Art. 101 \u00a7 56(e), which permits the Commission to grant a motion for rehearing \u201conly upon grounds of error of law, or newly discovered evidence\u201d. The Circuit Court agreed and reversed the Commission\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">We reversed. Noting that because no hearing had been held in the first place, filing of issues late could not constitute a Motion for Rehearing, we rejected the \u00a7 56(e) argument. 37 Md.App. at 262, 377 A.2d 530. Then, declining to \u201cdecide whether the Commission\u2019s actions in that case was a modification or change within the meaning of Art. 101, \u00a7 40(c)\u201d, 37 Md.App. at 264, 377 A.2d 530, we acknowledged that the Commission\u2019s powers and jurisdiction over its cases \u201cshall be <em>continuing, </em>and it may, from time to time, make such modifications or changes with respect to former findings or orders with respect thereto <em>as in its opinion may </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number><em>be </em>justified____\u201d (emphasis in original) 37 Md.App. at 263, 377 A.2d 530, quoting <em>Plater v. Kane Warehouse Co., </em>241 Md. 462, 466, 217 A.2d 102 (1966). We held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-5\">... when, as here, the Commission without a hearing renders an award of temporary total disability, it has continuing jurisdiction under \u00a7 40(c) and Rule 11<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, and may, under the rule, for good cause, set the case down for a plenary hearing upon \u201cissues\u201d timely filed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">37 Md.App. at 264, 377 A.2d 530. We went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUY\">Even in the absence of a specific rule, we think the Commission would have authority to reserve continuing jurisdiction where, as here, the award which was made was inadvertent, was not one upon which a hearing had been held, was temporary only and could not be deemed to constitute a final award.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">37 Md.App. at 264-265, 377 A.2d 530, citing <em>Porter v. Bethlehem\u2014Fairfield Shipyard, Inc., </em>188 Md. 668, 53 A.2d 668 (1947); 3 A. Larson, The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation \u00a7 81.53 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">The case <em>sub judice, </em>of course, is not on all fours with <em>East Coast Freight Lines, supra: </em>in the instant case, the issues were filed more than two months after the pro forma order issued, as opposed to three days in <em>East Coast Freight Lines, </em>and the award which was made may not be characterized as \u201cinadvertent\u201d. Furthermore, in this case, the Commission\u2019s rules of procedure were not relied upon, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>either by the Commission or by the court, to justify the Commission\u2019s actions. On the other hand, this case is like <em>East Coast Freight Lines </em>in that the order was issued without a hearing and, in context, was temporary only. Despite the differences, and considering the plain and unambiguous language of \u00a7 40(c), and the interpretation placed upon it by the Maryland courts, we hold that the same result as that reached in <em>East Coast Freight Lines </em>is mandated in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">This is simply a case of a commissioner exercising the continuing powers and jurisdiction that the Commission has over its cases to modify prior findings after hearing the evidence. Although there was no statement from appellee as to the reasons for filing its issues late, appellee not having been required by the Commissioner to make one, it is obvious that the Commissioner, having heard all of the evidence was convinced that appellant did not sustain an accidental personal injury in the course of his employment. Thus, the Commissioner exercised his discretion to consider appellee\u2019s issues because \u201cthe interests of justice and proper administrative procedure required such action\u201d. <em>East Coast Freight Lines, </em>37 Md.App. at 263, 377 A.2d 530. Neither the fact that he need not have allowed appellee to raise issues, nor the fact that, preliminary to and as a condition of entertaining them, he could have required appellee to show good cause for not raising the issues timely provides any basis for complaint by appellant where, as here, the record reflects that the Commissioner had a substantial basis for his actions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Appellant reminds us that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>An agency of the government must scrupulously observe rules, regulations, or procedures which it has established. When it fails to do so, its action cannot stand and courts will strike it down.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-4\"><em>Board ofEduc. of A.A. County v. Barbano, </em>45 Md.App. 27, 41, 411 A.2d 124 (1980). Noting that the Commission has promulgated rules, pursuant to Maryland Code Ann. art. 101 \u00a7 10, among them Rule .08<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>, pertaining to the consideration date, and Rule .12, governing the filing of applications for review, appellant argues that adoption of appellee\u2019s position vis-a-vis the breadth of \u00a7 40(c) would render \u00a7 40(c) an alternative to appeal from an unfavorable decision by the Commission and would render the Commission\u2019s regulations a nullity. Appellant thus maintains that the Commission and the Circuit Court have erroneously interpreted and applied \u00a7 40(c) so as to \u201cdefeat the clear requirements set out in the other provisions of the Act or required by [the Commission\u2019s] own rules and procedures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>A similar argument was made in <em>Williams v. McHugh, </em>51 Md.App. 570, 444 A.2d 475 (1982), which was concerned with the effect of Commission Rule 15A on the power of the Commission to modify or change its prior findings and order pursuant to \u00a7 40(c). Judge Lowe\u2019s response is instructive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-4\">This was obviously a procedural guideline permitting the Commission to clear its dockets of abandoned cases, while leaving some discretion to decide a questionable case within the construction guides of \u00a7 63. It <em>clearly did not intend to restrict itself so as mandatorily to curtail its right\u2014or duty\u2014to modify or change its former orders or findings when it felt justified, within five years of a compensation payment as legislatively authorized in Art. 101 \u00a7 40(c). </em>Indeed, if the Commission had intended to restrict further its discretionary modification authority to the possible detriment of a claimant, such rule would have been ultra vires to that extent and purpose, as failing to conform with \u00a7 40(c) and \u00a7 63. Art. 101, \u00a7 10. (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">51 Md.App. at 571-72, 444 A.2d 475. We agree with this assessment of the relationship between procedural rules promulgated by an agency and the statute pursuant to which the agency acts. We too find it \u201cinconceivable that the Court would interpret a quasi judicial Commission\u2019s procedural rule [so as to] impose substantive limitations adversely upon a [litigant], contrary to the discretion given the Commission by statute.\u201d 51 Md.App. at 573, 444 A.2d 475. We point out in this regard that \u00a7 10 provides that \u201call such rules and regulations shall conform to the provisions of this article.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">WAIVER</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">Appellant next argues that appellee waived its right to challenge his claim for compensation or is estopped to assert a defense to the claim. The premise for this argument is that appellee voluntarily accepted appellant\u2019s claim when it, in violation of Commission Rule .07, paid appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>temporary total disability benefits prior to an award by the Commission<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">We have already determined that a Commission rule cannot limit the Commission\u2019s exercise of discretion given it by statute. Furthermore, acceptance of appellant\u2019s position would present the anomalous situation in which one who has been unjustly enriched can parlay that unjust enrichment into an irrevocable right. We refuse to accept that position. Merely because it made temporary total benefit payments, which it is not entitled to recover, to appellant prior to a claim being filed and, in addition, failed timely to file issues, appellee did not, as a matter of law, waive its right, and is not estopped, to contest appellant\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b744-8\">.

Appellee, relying upon <em>Roadway Express, Inc. v. Gray, </em>40 Md.App. 66, 389 A.2d 407, <em>cert. denied, </em>283 Md. 737 (1978); <em>Robin Exp., Inc. v. Cuccaro, </em>247 Md. 262, 230 A.2d 671 (1967); <em>Stevenson v. Hill, </em>170 Md. 676, 185 A. 551 (1936); <em>Gold Dust Corp. v. Zabawa, </em>159 Md. 664, 152 A. 500 (1930), contends that, since appellant did not appeal the Commission\u2019s judgment on the merits, the propriety of the Commissioner\u2019s exercise of discretion pursuant to \u00a7 40(c) was not before the Circuit Court and is not now before this Court. As noted earlier, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>\u00a7 40(c) revisory power is analogous to that of Md. Rule 2-535, which prescribes the limits of the court\u2019s revisory power. The granting or denial of a motion to strike out an enrolled judgment pursuant to that Rule is in the nature of a final judgment, and, therefore, is appealable. <em>Kraft v. Sussex Constr. Corp., </em>35 Md.App. 309, 310-11, 370 A.2d 570 (1977). <em>See First Federated Commodity Trust Corp. v. Commissioner of Securities, </em>272 Md. 329, 332-33, 322 A.2d 539 (1974). Appellate review of such a decision involves determining whether the hearing judge abused his or her discretion. <em>See New Freedom Corp. v. Brown, </em>260 Md. 383, 386, 272 A.2d 401 (1971). Given the similarity between Rule 2-535 and \u00a7 40(c), we think the identical principle applies: a decision to modify prior findings and orders, or the denial of same, is appeal-able and may be overturned upon a showing of an abuse of discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b750-9\">.
