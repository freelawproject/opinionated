During the course of the robbery, a shot was fired. One of the victims\u2014Mary Henderson\u2014followed the robber as he made his escape and reported seeing him heading toward Swann Avenue, changing his clothes as he ran.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Police officers responded promptly. From the information obtained from the victims and from an anonymous call, several of them went looking for the assailant in the Uplands Apartment development, located on Swann Avenue about a block from the bus stop. Officer Wagner observed appellant emerging from the building at 405 Swann Avenue dressed in a blue-gray suit and carrying a gray jacket in one hand and a shopping bag in the other. Appellant walked away from the officer, at an increasingly brisk pace. When he got to a corner, he dropped the shopping bag and ran behind one of the buildings. Officer Wagner saw appellant cross Swann Avenue and go into the building at 400 Swann Avenue; he relayed that information by police radio to Officer Brown, who was also on the scene searching for the robber.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">Officer Brown saw appellant go into 400 Swann Avenue carrying a gray coat; he followed him in and brought him back outside. Officer Garrity then arrived with the victims. Inside the shopping bag, picked up by Officer Wagner, were three purses, which the women, respectively, identified as their own, a ski mask, a glove, and a handgun containing five live rounds and one spent cartridge. Several of the victims identified the gray coat taken from appellant as looking like the coat worn by the robber. Also inside the shopping bag was a black vinyl case containing certain papers belonging to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">None of the victims was able to identify appellant as the masked robber. Although the shopping bag certainly was full of incriminating evidence, appellant, directly disputing Officer Wagner\u2019s testimony, contended that he never had the shopping bag. He claimed that he was on his way to the Westside Skill Center, that he had stopped at 400 Swann <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>Avenue to meet one Karen Lucas, a fellow student at that center, and that his school papers allegedly found inside the shopping bag, had been in his coat pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">As a result of this incident, the State\u2019s Attorney filed four criminal informations against appellant (Nos. 28514739-28514742), each charging him with the following eight offenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-6\">Count 1\u2014Robbery with a deadly weapon;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-7\">Count 2\u2014Attempted robbery with a deadly weapon;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-8\">Count 3\u2014Robbery;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-9\">Count 4\u2014Assault with intent to rob;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-10\">Count 5\u2014Assault;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-11\">Count 6\u2014Theft of less than $300;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-12\">Count 7\u2014Use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-13\">Count 8\u2014Unlawful carrying of a handgun.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-14\">Appellant was first brought to trial on all of these charges in November, 1985. He was convicted on all four counts of robbery with a deadly weapon (Count 1 of each information) and apparently on Counts 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 of each information as well. It is not clear what happened to Counts 2 and 4, except that there is no indication (and appellant makes no contention) that he was acquitted on those counts at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-15\">On February 22, 1986, the court granted appellant\u2019s motion for new trial on all counts set forth in the four informations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was brought to trial again in June, 1986; on that occasion, the jury was unable to reach a verdict on any of the counts, and so a mistrial was declared.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-16\">Appellant\u2019s third trial took place in August, 1986. Precisely what occurred at that trial is not altogether clear from the record before us\u2014a matter we shall discuss in more detail later. It appears, however, that only five counts were submitted to the jury\u2014the four flagship counts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>of robbery with a deadly weapon and one count of use of a handgun in the commission of a felony. The jury acquitted of the latter offense<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but, once again, was unable to agree on Count 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Undaunted by its three false starts, and now down to only one count in each information, the State decided to try again. Prior to his fourth trial, appellant moved to dismiss Count 1 (of each information) on the related grounds of double jeopardy and collateral estoppel. His argument centered solely on the effect of his acquittal on Count 8. He posited that the only deadly weapon indicated by the evidence was a handgun, that his acquittal on Count 8 sufficed as a finding that he had not used a handgun, and that, <em>ergo, </em>a fact necessary to his prosecution on Count 1 had been decided in his favor and could not be re-litigated. That conclusion, he urged, was mandated by <em>Ashe v. Swenson, </em>397 U.S. 436, 90 S.Ct. 1189, 25 L.Ed.2d 469 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">The court denied his motion, whereupon he was brought to trial for the fourth time on Count 1 of each information. He was convicted on all four charges, given substantial sentences, and appeals. He raises six issues, to which, <em>nostra sponte, </em>we have added a seventh. In the end, we shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">(1), (2)</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">Double Jeopardy/Collateral Estoppel</p>\n<p id=\"b657-9\">In the \u201cStatement Of The Case\u201d section of his brief, appellant informed us that, at his third trial, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>disposed of Counts 2 through 7 of each information by granting \u201cjudgments of acquittal\u201d as to them. The State did not challenge that assertion in its brief, and indeed the docket entries for the third trial clearly indicate that disposition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Aware that Count 3 of each information charged simple robbery, a necessary included element in robbery with a deadly weapon, we questioned whether, in light of that disposition, retrial on Count 1 might be precluded under <em>Wright v. State, </em>307 Md. 552, 515 A.2d 1157 (1986). Given the generally dismal state of the record,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> however, we directed the parties to address that issue and, if necessary, to supplement the record in order to address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">In response to that order, the State filed certain excerpts from the transcript of proceedings at the third trial, which we have accepted as a supplement to the record. Md.Rule 1027.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">At the conclusion of the State\u2019s case at the third trial, defense counsel moved for judgment of acquittal, arguing briefly that the State had failed to show \u201cthat the evidence seized was in possession of my client and that he is, in fact, the robber that\u2019s involved in this case.\u201d The motion was denied. At the end of the entire case, counsel renewed the \u201cmotion for judgment of acquittal at this time for the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>reasons____\u201d Without responding to the motion, the court asked the prosecutor which counts he was pressing; he replied that he wanted \u201cthe four armed robbery counts and the four handgun counts to go to the jury.\u201d The judge then said that it was her practice in multiple robbery cases to send only one handgun count to the jury, as she was not inclined to give consecutive sentences if there were multiple convictions on that count. The prosecutor indicated no objection to that approach. The colloquy then concluded thusly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: Now, do you [defense counsel] have any argument as to the first and eighth counts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-7\">MS. JULIAN: No, your Honor. I\u2019ll submit on the record on the motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-8\">THE COURT: All right. Well, it will go to the jury as to each of the indictments [sic, informations] on the first and eighth counts although I will only require one verdict as to the eighth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">From this, it is clear that the docket entry for August 11 is indeed in error. The court never entered a judgment of acquittal as to Counts 2 through 7, and it certainly never ruled, or even suggested, that the evidence presented by the State was legally insufficient with respect to those counts. It is apparent that the State simply decided not to press those middle counts, as in <em>Bynum v. State, </em>277 Md. 703, 357 A.2d 339, <em>cert. denied </em>429 U.S. 899, 97 S.Ct. 264, 50 L.Ed.2d 183 (1976). The predicate for the Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Wright v. State, supra, </em>307 Md. 552, 515 A.2d 1157\u2014a finding by the trial court of evidentiary insufficiency on a lesser included offense\u2014is missing here. On the more complete record, therefore, we find no merit to the issue that appeared to be very real from the record as we received it.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\"><em>Appellant\u2019s </em>double jeopardy/collateral estoppel argument, as we observed, rests on the implication he draws from his acquittal on Count 8. In <em>Powers v. State, </em>285 Md. 269, 401 A.2d 1031, <em>cert. denied </em>444 U.S. 937, 100 S.Ct. 288, 62 L.Ed.2d 197 (1979), the Court of Appeals, after reviewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>what it regarded as the relevant pronouncements of the Supreme Court, concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzS\">\u201cthe doctrine of collateral estoppel applies after a jury, at a single trial, acquits on one count of a multicount indictment and is unable to agree upon a verdict on a related count of the same indictment <em>involving a common issue of ultimate fact, which if found in favor of an accused would establish his innocence on both counts.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-5\"><em>Id., </em>at 288, 401 A.2d 1031. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">As initially pointed out in <em>Ashe v. Swenson, supra, </em>397 U.S. at 444, 90 S.Ct. at 1194, and as reiterated in <em>Powers </em>and later in <em>Wooten-Bey v. State, </em>308 Md. 534, 544, 520 A.2d 1090 (1987), collateral estoppel in criminal cases \u201cis not to be applied with the hypertechnical and archaic approach of a 19th century pleading book, but with realism and rationality.\u201d Quoting from <em>Ashe, </em>the <em>Wooten-Bey </em>Court held that the reviewing court must \u201cexamine the record of a prior proceeding, taking into account the pleadings, evidence, charge, and other relevant matter, and conclude whether a rational jury could have grounded its verdict upon an issue other than that which the defendant seeks to foreclose from consideration.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Appellant has not given us much of an opportunity to do that, for no part of the proceedings of the third trial, save the few pages of transcript dealing with the disposition of Counts 2-7, furnished by the State in response to our order, has been included in the record. We don\u2019t know, other than in a general way, what evidence was presented to that third jury; nor do we know what instructions were given or what argument was made to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">Appellant\u2019s position is very simple and direct: \u201c[T]he use of a deadly weapon is a necessary element for conviction under Article 27, Section 488. Here the Appellant was found not guilty of the use of the handgun in the third trial. The only State theory of the case was that a handgun was involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>The State has a somewhat more conjectural view. It notes, on the one hand, that the robber wore a mask, that none of the victims were able to identify appellant, and that he was dressed differently when apprehended than was the robber at the time of the robbery; on the other hand, it stresses that he was in possession of the gun and the fruits of the crime shortly before his apprehension. From this, the State posits that the third jury may have concluded that appellant was not the actual robber (or wielder of the handgun) but may have entertained some feeling, short of unanimity, that he was an accomplice of or receiver for the actual robber, who escaped. That possibility, it argues, is not irrational under the evidence, and it would explain the acquittal on Count 8 and the inability to agree on Count 1. Indeed, the State notes that, at one point, defense counsel entertained the same notion based, apparently, on her conversation with some of the jurors on the third jury. At sentencing in this proceeding, she stated to the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AF4\">\u201c[I] made a note and I remember going over that prior to this trial. Some of the jurors were saying that they could not agree, they could not say he was the actual gunman because the man\u2019s face was covered but they felt ... [interruption by court] he was somehow involved. So I believe they had a theory there was more than one person involved and some way or another he came across the bag but was not the gunman.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">In the absence of a more complete record of the third trial, which appears to have been available and which was appellant\u2019s duty to produce, it is impossible for us to make an objective analysis of which view is sounder.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But that is not really the test. The test framed in <em>Ashe, Powers, </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number><em>Wooten-Bey </em>is \u201cwhether a rational jury <em>could have </em>grounded its verdict,\u201d as the State suggests, or other than as appellant suggests. Notwithstanding the trial judge\u2019s thoughts, from what is before us, we believe that the jury could have done so. With or without an accomplice instruction, members of the third jury could rationally have believed that appellant was criminally involved but was not the actual gunman. If <em>that </em>were the basis of its verdict on Count 8, the acquittal would not necessarily involve \u201ca common issue of ultimate fact, which if found in favor of [appellant] would establish his innocence on both counts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Partiality Of The Trial Judge</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">Appellant complains that the trial judge, Judge Bothe, \u201charangued defense counsel from day one, aided the able prosecutor whenever possible and presided in a totally narrow minded fashion, denying Appellant a fair and impartial trial.\u201d More particularly, he asserts that the judge \u201cmade short shrift of Appellant\u2019s- collateral estoppel argument,\u201d that she \u201cbreezed through\u201d a motion to stay to allow him to file an immediate appeal from the denial of his motion to dismiss, that she failed to \u201cformally rule\u201d on a motion to recuse herself, that she attempted to \u201cassist the State\u201d in its examination of Officer Brown, that she \u201cwent out of her way to rehabilitate the impeached officer,\u201d that she \u201ccommenced arguing ... with defense counsel\u201d and \u201cwent into a diatribe with counsel which was somewhat unintelligible,\u201d that she interrupted questioning by defense counsel, that her \u201cpredisposition\u201d was \u201coverwhelmingly against\u201d appellant, and that \u201c[h]er attitude was hostile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">These are, of course, very serious charges which, if true, would require a reversal. To determine whether, and to what extent, they <em>are </em>true, we have read nearly the entire transcript of the proceeding. Several conclusions emerge.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">Appellant\u2019s statements that Judge Bothe \u201cmade short shrift\u201d of his collateral estoppel argument and \u201cbreezed through\u201d his motion for stay are wholly unfounded. Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>Bothe said that she had read the written motion to dismiss and some of the cases cited; she listened to counsel\u2019s argument but made clear that she simply did not agree with it. Counsel continued to press a point that the judge, on several occasions, said she found unpersuasive. The colloquy pertaining to that motion extended over 21 pages of transcript. As to the motion for stay, Judge Bothe noted that, with the three previous trials, the case had dragged on for over a year, and she could see no good reason to delay the ultimate resolution of appellant\u2019s guilt or innocence any longer. Her concluding statement, which appellate counsel seems to take wholly out of context, was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-5\">\u201cLet the record reflect I read your cases. I read your memorandum. I read Pulley, and I cannot understand why the defendant is so reluctant to bring this case to finality. It\u2019s really a travesty that it has had to go on for so long without resolution. Let\u2019s hope this time a conclusion can be reached.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Appellant did, as he claims, then ask Judge Bothe to recuse herself</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-7\">\u201cbecause of the manner in which the case is proceeding and has proceeded so far, the anger expressed at counsel while trying to put the motion on the record, the fact that he does not feel like he will get a fair trial, having had the case heard in this court before.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">The court made no direct ruling on this motion; the judge simply ignored it and went on to other business. That, of course, was not only discourteous, but improper; appellant was entitled to a response. It is clear, however, that the motion was implicitly overruled, for Judge Bothe certainly did not recuse herself, and appellant never pressed for a response. On the merits, we find no basis at that point for a recusal. Neither the loss of pretrial motions nor the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>that Judge Bothe had presided at the third trial would be sufficient grounds to require recusal; and, although we cannot discern voice inflections or mannerisms from a transcript, we can find nothing in the written record to demonstrate anger on the part of the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The major thrust of appellant\u2019s argument goes to the judge\u2019s intervention in the questioning of certain witnesses and to arguments that took place between Judge Bothe and defense counsel. A good bit of this took place during counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Officer Brown, when counsel attempted to point out and examine the officer with respect to perceived inconsistencies between his current testimony and testimony given at the earlier trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Judge Bothe did indeed step in at several points to clarify questions posed by counsel or to give the witness an opportunity to explain or clarify the alleged inconsistencies. Some of these intrusions were in response to objections by the prosecutor to particular questions or to the form of the cross-examination; some were <em>sua sponte </em>but to which no immediate objection by appellant was made; some were wholly unnecessary and served only to provoke an argument with defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">In <em>Belt v. State, </em>48 Md.App. 669, 678, 429 A.2d 300, <em>cert. denied </em>291 Md. 771 (1981), we cautioned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-8\">\u201cThe trial judge\u2019s role is that of an impartial arbitrator and that appearance is not generally compatible with an inquisitorial role. It is the better practice for a trial judge to inject himself [or herself] as little as possible in a jury case ... because of the inordinate influence that may emanate from his [or her] position if jurors interpret his [or her] questions as indicative of his [or her] opinion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">When a judge interjects himself or herself into a case to any significant extent, as, despite prior admonitions from this Court, Judge Bothe seems wont to do <em>{see McMillian v. State, </em>65 Md.App. 21, 499 A.2d 192 (1985)), he or she invites this kind of argument and risks not only a reversal of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>conviction but embarrassing censure as well. <em>See </em>Md.Rule 1231 (Md.Code of Judicial Conduct), Canon 3A.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The major confrontation between Judge Bothe and defense counsel came, as we indicated, during cross-examination of Officer Brown, the arresting officer. Most of it arose from an attempt by counsel to show that some of the details mentioned by the witness in his current testimony had not been mentioned by him in testimony given at earlier trials. It was not clear, however, that the witness had ever been asked about those details at the prior trials; counsel did not show the witness the transcript of his earlier testimony or call his attention to specific questions and answers but simply challenged him for including some details for the first time. The court felt that was improper; counsel persisted; and an argument ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Having considered the record as a whole and viewing the judge\u2019s interruptions and comments complained about in context, we conclude, as we did in <em>McMillian v. State, supra, </em>65 Md.App. 21, 27, 499 A.2d 192, that \u201cwhile the court should certainly have exercised greater restraint, the remarks were not tantamount to reversible error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">(4)</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">Suppression Of Officer Wagner\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">Just before the actual commencement of trial, defense counsel moved <em>in limine </em>to suppress the entire testimony of Officer Wagner on the ground that he had committed perjury. This, in turn, was based on the assertion that, at appellant\u2019s second trial, Officer Wagner testified that he had observed appellant exit the building carrying the shopping bag, whereas at the third trial he said only that he saw appellant holding the bag and placing it down.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">Our first response to appellant\u2019s complaint is that it was not preserved for appellate review. No objection was made to Officer Wagner\u2019s testimony at trial and no motion was made to strike it on this or any other ground. A pretrial motion <em>in limine </em>alone does not suffice to preserve an objection to evidence. <em>See Offutt v. State, </em>44 Md.App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>670, 677, 410 A.2d 611 (1980); <em>Eiler v. State, </em>63 Md.App. 439, 445-46, 492 A.2d 1320 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Even if the objection had been preserved, we would have found it utterly without merit. How the alleged inconsistency constitutes perjury was a mystery to Judge Bothe and it is a mystery to us. While there may have been some inconsistency in the testimony given at the various trials, a point that was forcefully brought to the jury\u2019s attention by defense counsel, there was no evidence of perjury, and certainly no conviction of perjury, which is the necessary predicate for exclusion. See Md.Code Ann.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc. art., \u00a7 9-104: \u201cA person <em>convicted </em>of perjury may not testify.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">(5)</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Miranda</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">Officer Brown arrested appellant. He eventually filled out a report known as an arrestee data sheet containing certain information he received from appellant. The information, Brown said, is routinely asked; it includes the defendant\u2019s name, address, and date of birth. Brown said that appellant, whose name is Avery V. Ferrell, gave him the name James Edward Ferrell.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">Appellant now claims that this \u201carrestee information\u201d was taken in violation of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), presumably meaning that adequate warnings were not given to him before this information was sought. Although appellant has failed to supply us with any factual foundation for that assertion, even if it were true there would be no error. As we held in <em>Grimes v. State, </em>44 Md.App. 580, 586, 409 A.2d 767 (1980), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds </em>290 Md. 236, 429 A.2d 228 (1981): \u201cUntil the Court of Appeals directs us otherwise, we shall adhere to the view that routine questions seeking a person\u2019s name and address are not proscribed by <em>Miranda, </em>and if the person answers such questions, his answers are not rendered inadmissible by the exclusionary rule announced in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>Miranda.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Cf Mills v. State, </em>278 Md. 262, 275, 363 A.2d 491 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">(6)</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Self-Incrimination</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Appellant was represented by counsel at all four of his trials. Defense counsel in this case had represented him at his third trial and, although the record is not altogether clear on this, possibly at his first and second trials as well. Appellant had elected to testify in his own defense at one or more (perhaps all) of his earlier trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">At the conclusion of the State\u2019s case, following the denial of appellant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal, this colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-9\">\u201c[THE COURT:] As to the defendant\u2019s testifying or remaining silent, he has been advised of those rights very thoroughly I think, so I don\u2019t know that we need to formally do them again. You are aware of your rights in that regard, Mr. Ferrell. Is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-10\">THE DEFENDANT: (Nodding affirmatively)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-11\">THE COURT: That you can testify or remain silent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-12\">THE DEFENDANT: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-13\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t think we need to review those.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b667-14\">Subsequently, without any further comment, counsel called appellant to testify. Appellant now claims he was not adequately informed of his right to remain silent. We find no basis for that assertion. See <em>Stevens v. State, </em>232 Md. 33, 192 A.2d 73 (1963); <em>State v. McKenzie, </em>17 Md.App. 563, 303 A.2d 406 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-15\">(7)</p>\n<p id=\"b667-16\">Request for Bench Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b667-17\">Appellant, who had elected a jury trial at his three prior trials, contends that, on this occasion, he twice requested a court trial and that the court erred in denying him one.

JULIAN: Good morning, Your Honor.

Not another word was said about a court trial; at no time did either counsel or appellant express any dissatisfaction with the fact that the case would be tried by a jury. It is clear to us, notwithstanding appellant\u2019s ambiguous blurt, \u201cI am not praying no jury trial,\u201d that, after discussion with his attorney, he elected a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b656-17\">.

From everything that followed, it is apparent that the handgun count submitted to the jury in the third trial was actually Count 7 of the information\u2014use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence\u2014and not Count 8, charging unlawful carrying of a handgun. The parties have consistently referred to the acquittal as Count 8, however. The original information contained nine counts. At some point, Count 6, charging theft, was struck and the ensuing Counts 7, 8, and 9 were renumbered as Counts 6, 7, and 8, respectively. The \u201cuse of a handgun\u201d charge, originally Count 8, became Count 7. In order to maintain consistency with the statements and arguments in the briefs, we shall refer to the handgun charge submitted to the jury at the third trial as Count 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b658-7\">.

We note further that, in clear derogation of the requirements set forth in The Maryland Court Reporters\u2019 Manual, published by the Administrative Office of the Courts, the transcripts of the fourth trial do not contain a table of contents showing \"all exhibits and where they are marked for identification and received in evidence.\" <em>Id., </em>Subject: Appeal Transcript of Proceedings, p. 2.

That is a flat-out misstatement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b669-6\">ROBERT M. BELL, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ahy\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Contrary to the majority opinion, reversal is not merely warranted in this case, it is required. In my opinion, the crux of this appeal involves the question whether appellant received the fair trial that the Maryland and federal Constitutions guarantee him. A fair reading of the entire transcript of the trial, not just that portion concerning Officer Brown, reveals that appellant did not, and, indeed, could not have, received a fair trial before this trial judge. I therefore dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">At bottom, the issue does involve, as the majority in part 3 of its opinion recognizes, the court\u2019s interjection of itself in the trial by substantial and frequent interventions in the questioning of witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">To be sure, a trial judge may question witnesses. In doing so, however, the trial judge must stay within appropriate bounds. We addressed the limits of those bounds in two recent cases, <em>Cardin v. State, </em>73 Md.App. 200, 533 A.2d 928 (1987) and <em>Smith v. State, </em>66 Md.App. 603, 505 A.2d 564, <em>cert. denied, </em>306 Md. 371, 509 A.2d 134 (1986). In each, we quoted, with approval, from <em>Bell v. State, </em>48 Md.App. 669, 678, 429 A.2d 300 (1981):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-10\">The trial judge\u2019s role is that of an impartial arbitrator and that appearance is not generally compatible with an inqui<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>sitorial role. It is the better practice for a trial judge to inject himself as little as possible in a jury case, <em>United States v. Green, </em>429 F.2d 754, 760 (D.C.Cir.1970), because of the inordinate influence that may emanate from his position if jurors interpret his questions as indicative of his opinion. <em>See, also, Patterson [v. State, </em>275 Md. 563, 578-80, 342 A.2d 660 (1975)]. The appearance that a judge may have abandoned his role as an impartial arbitrator, is especially hazardous when cross-questioning a defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-5\">Yet, if counsel have faltered in their advocacies, it is not improper for the trial judge to be \u201cmeticulously careful to make sure that the full facts [are] brought out\u201d, <em>Jeffries v. State, </em>5 Md.App. 630, 632 [248 A.2d 807] (1959), or to seek to discover the truth when counsel have not elicited some material fact, or indeed when a witness has not testified with entire frankness. Annot., 84 A.L.R. 1172, 1193 (1933). Such questioning may even bear upon the credibility of a defendant in a proper circumstance. <em>Madison v. State, </em>200 Md. 1, 12 [87 A.2d 593] (1952); <em>King v. State, </em>[14 Md.App. 385, 287 A.2d 52, <em>cert. denied, </em>265 Md. 740 (1972) ] at 394 [287 A.2d 52], This should be achieved expeditiously, however, if at all, for a protracted examination has a tendency to convey to a jury a judge\u2019s opinion as to facts or the credibility of witnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-6\"><em>Cardin, </em>73 Md.App. at 229-230, 533 A.2d 928; <em>Smith, </em>66 Md.App. at 618-19, 505 A.2d 564.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">The Court of Appeals has provided additional guidance. In <em>Vandegrift v. State, </em>237 Md. 305, 311, 206 A.2d 250 (1965), the Court held that \u201c[t]he questioning by the trial judge showing his disbelief of the witness\u2019 testimony [is] beyond the line of impartiality over which a judge must not step.\u201d There, the trial judge questioned the witness repeatedly on the same subject matter and reminded the witness that he was under oath and subject to penalty for perjury. <em>See also Marshall v. State, </em>291 Md. 205, 213, 434 A.2d 555 (1981), in which the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>... [A] judge presiding over a jury trial ... should exercise th[e] right [to interrogate witnesses to clarify issues] sparingly. It is a far more prudent practice for the judge to allow counsel to clear up disputed points on cross-examination, unassisted by the court. In this manner, the judge is most likely to preserve his [or her] role as an impartial arbiter, because he [or she] avoids the appearance of acting as an advocate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">The Court in <em>Brown v. State, </em>220 Md. 29, 39, 150 A.2d 895 (1959), disapproved the questioning of a defendant by the trial judge in such a way as to \u201cindicate sarcastically, so that the jury could not have failed to understand, that the judge did not believe [the story the defendant] was telling....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The permissible bounds of interjection and inquiry thus appear to be clear. A trial judge should interject himself or herself as little as possible into the trial of the case, giving due opportunity for the advocates to present, in their own way, the facts in support of their cause. <em>See Marshall, </em>291 Md. at 214, 434 A.2d 555. When the judge does interject himself or herself, it should be solely for the purpose of clarifying or sharpening issues or eliciting material facts which the advocates have not presented. The more protracted the examination of a witness, the more likely it is that the examination will convey to the jury the trial judge\u2019s opinion concerning the credibility of that witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Turning to the case <em>sub judice, </em>the majority has very considerately characterized the trial judge\u2019s actions in this case as stepping in \u201cat several points to clarify questions posed by counsel or to give the witness an opportunity to explain or clarify the alleged inconsistencies.\u201d This characterization is not supported by the record. On the contrary, the record discloses that the trial judge, totally oblivious of any bounds, interjected herself repeatedly, into the proceeding. In fact, there were more than a hundred such instances. The judge participated, to some extent, in the questioning of each witness called to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>To be fair, some of the trial judge\u2019s interjections were innocuous and some were for the purpose of clarifying questions posed by counsel; the vast majority of them, however, were much more serious. A few examples are demonstrative. During the State\u2019s case, the court\u2019s interventions included participating freely and frequently in the direct examination of witnesses,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> assisting the assistant State\u2019s Attorney in the presentation of his case,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> when he did not wish help, and, indeed, resisted it;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> interrupting cross-examination by defense counsel to assist State\u2019s witnesses in responding to questions;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and explaining the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>testimony of State\u2019s witnesses.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial judge also rephrased questions, rather than ruling on objections by defense.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Moreover, in addition to correcting defense counsel in front of the jury and suggesting how questions should be phrased, the trial judge raised objections <em>sua sponte.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>During the defense case, the judge, without regard to, and in fact, in spite of, the defense strategy, cross-examined de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>fense witnesses during their direct examination.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In some instances, the trial judge anticipated issues which had not yet been raised and, in at least one other, questioned a witness concerning his testimony in a prior trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">Throughout trial, the trial judge asked questions repetitious of testimony already given by the witness, thus emphasizing that testimony for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Specific reference to the trial judge\u2019s actions during the testimony of appellant and Wheatley further demonstrates the egregiousness of the judge\u2019s conduct. The judge interrupted appellant\u2019s direct examination to question appellant or make observations on seven occasions. On the first, the judge referring to appellant\u2019s reference to a Kuti, asked, \u201cYou mean a muslim type thing? <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The next three interruptions were for the purpose of asking questions that rehashed testimony previously given by appellant, thereby emphasizing it to the jury. During cross-examination, the judge interrupted the prosecutor to question appellant about using other names. In addition, when appellant began to respond broadly to a broad question asked by the prosecutor, the judge instructed him to \u201cjust answer the question\u201d, and immediately thereafter interpreted his explanation as: \u201cYou mean that he [a police officer] lied.\u201d The judge\u2019s participation in redirect examination continued to be frequent and active.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>The trial judge\u2019s interjections during the testimony of Wheatley were more serious. Demonstration of the correctness of this assertion is perhaps best achieved by quoting pertinent excerpts directly from the record, as appropriate. The trial judge\u2019s first interruption came early in the direct examination of Wheatley and it was for the purpose of asking the witness what time he had first seen appellant. The next interruption occurred as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-5\">Q. (By appellant\u2019s counsel) Let me ask a general question. Under what circumstances did you see Mr. Ferrell that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-6\">A. I had noticed Mr. Ferrell being arrested as I was leaving my girlfriend\u2019s house one morning. That\u2019s how I remember his face. Right now I am presently incarcerated and I had noticed Mr. Ferrell at the jail where I am being detained and I had remembered his face from being arrested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-7\">Q. Had you noticed anything unusual before you noticed the arrest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-8\">A. Yes, ma\u2019am, I did. Early in the morning I noticed a guy running by me removing a mask from his head.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-9\">The Court: You say you were staying at your girlfriend\u2019s house?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-10\">The Witness: Yes, I was there the night before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-11\">The Court: Where does she live?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-12\">The Witness: On Swan. Upland Apartments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-13\">The next significant interruption occurred after Wheatly had testified concerning the complexion and weight of the robber. At that time the court interrupted to ask \u201cWhat do you consider yourself to be?\u201d, to which the witness replied, \u201cWell, I\u2019m dark or medium dark I suppose.\u201d When the focus of the examination turned to Wheatley\u2019s observations of appellant\u2019s arrest, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-14\">Q. (By appellant\u2019s counsel) Now, did there come a time where you saw the arrest? That\u2019s what you\u2019ve testified, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>A. Yes, ma\u2019am. I had noticed Mr. Ferrell being arrested after I had left my girlfriend\u2019s house about twenty, thirty minutes later and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-5\">The Court: Twenty or thirty minutes had gone by since you saw the man with the\u2014taking off the mask?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-6\">The Witness: About. Yes, ma\u2019am. I got the cigarettes, went back to my girlfriend\u2019s house and had breakfast. In that amount of time, maybe thirty minutes is when I left for good at which time I came out. This is when I noticed Mr. Ferrell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-7\">The Court: Being arrested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-8\">The Witness: Yes, ma\u2019am. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-9\">The Court: You had never seen him before that day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-10\">The Witness: No, ma\u2019am, I had not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">Similar interruptions occurred during Wheatley\u2019s cross-examination. After the prosecutor had explored the circumstances under which Wheatley had seen appellant being arrested and had begun to develop the facts from which it could be determined whether Wheatley\u2019s identification was reliable, perhaps' the most significant interjection on the part of the trial judge occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-12\">Q. (By the prosecutor) Then you went into your girlfriend\u2019s house, stayed twenty or thirty minutes and then when you came out you saw the defendant whom you now recognize. You didn\u2019t know him at the time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-13\">A. No, sir, I did not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-14\">Q. And you haven\u2019t seen him for the past twenty months until very recently.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-15\">A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-16\">Q. I believe you told us very candidly you just met him during your recent incarceration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-17\">A. Yes, sir. I noticed him, you know. He is housed in the same section of the jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-18\">The Court: How much of a look at him did you get that day when you saw him being arrested?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-19\">The Witness: Pretty good. I stopped and signified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-20\">The Court: Did you stop and watch what was happening?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>The Witness: Yes, ma\u2019am. Him being arrested. I stopped and watched.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\">The Court: What all did you see?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-6\">The Witness: The average arrest procedures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-7\">The Court: Tell us.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-8\">The Witness: His hands being cuffed behind his back and put into the\u2014into the, you know, truck like thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-9\">The Court: Did you see anybody else there besides police?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-10\">The Witness: No, just police, ma\u2019am. Just police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-11\">Q. (By prosecutor) You don\u2019t recall seeing a number of ladies of all ranges in age relatively old to quite young?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-12\">A. No, sir. I couldn\u2019t actually say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-13\">The Court: How was he dressed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-14\">The Witness: I can\u2019t remember as a matter of fact, ma\u2019am, his exact clothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-15\">The Court: Well, the next time you saw him was twenty months later?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-16\">The Witness: Yes, ma\u2019am. About.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-17\">The Court: But you remembered his face?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-18\">The Witness: Yes, ma\u2019am, I did. As a matter of fact, the shape of his head I remember.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-19\">While it is true that we do not have the benefit of having heard and seen the witnesses testify live, several things are obvious from the examination of Wheatley by the trial judge. First, the trial judge did not wait for the advocates to do their job before plunging in and asking questions. Second, the questions the trial judge asked were those affecting the credibility of the witness. Third, and most important, given the nature of the questions the trial judge asked and the context in which they were asked, \u201cthe jury could not have failed to understand, that the trial judge did not believe the story [the witness] was telling----\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-20\">As I read the transcript, it is clear that the trial judge was not an impartial arbitrator, but an advocate for the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>The majority acknowledges that some of the trial judge\u2019s interventions were \u201cwholly unnecessary and served only to provoke an argument with defense counsel\u201d, that \u201cthe court should certainly have exercised greater restraint\u201d, and further, that this Court has previously admonished the trial judge for past indiscretions of this kind. <em>See McMillian v. State, </em>65 Md.App. 21, 499 A.2d 192 (1985). Nevertheless, the majority holds that the judge\u2019s interruptions and comments were not tantamount to reversible error. It observes in passing that many of the <em>sua sponte </em>interjections and comments were not \u201cimmediately objected to\u201d,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which seems to suggest that had there been objections, the result might have been different. I can concur with the majority only insofar as it acknowledges error on the part of the trial court. As indicated, I consider the error to mandate reversal. In that regard, I call to the majority\u2019s attention the case of <em>Elmer v. State, </em>239 Md. 1, 9, 209 A.2d 776 (1965) in which the Court of Appeals, commenting upon the trial judge\u2019s declaration, in front of a jury, that a witness was hostile, held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-5\">We think under the unusual circumstances here presented and the unquestionably harmful effects of the judge\u2019s remarks in the presence of the jury as we point out in more detail below, the accused was not afforded a fair and impartial trial and he was, therefore, denied due process of law, which, under the authorities cited above, would call for our review of the propriety of the court\u2019s remarks, even if' no objection had been made thereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The authorities cited by the Court included <em>Bryant v. State, </em>207 Md. 565, 115 A.2d 502 (1955); <em>Wolfe v. State, </em>218 Md. 449, 146 A.2d 856 (1958) and <em>Rowe v. State, </em>234 Md. 295, 199 A.2d 785 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>In <em>Bryant, </em>although holding that the record did not show that the trial judge\u2019s actions deprived the accused of a fair and impartial trial, the Court commented that: \u201c[t]he degree of severity of the trial judge\u2019s rebukes of an attorney, when the occasions require them, is left to the discretion of a judge \u2018as long as they do not prevent a fair and impartial trial\u2019 207 Md. at 585, 115 A.2d 502. Similarly in <em>Wolfe, </em>in which a trial judge, attempting to assist an unrepresented defendant, made prejudicial remarks in the presence of the jury, the Court of Appeals, on its own motion, took \u201ccognizance of and corrected] the ... error even though such error may not have been properly includable in the assignment of errors____\u201d 218 Md. at 455, 146 A.2d 856. The Court reiterated the general rule, however, that generally an issue may not be raised on appeal unless preserved by appropriate objection. Rather than improper remarks by the trial judge, <em>Rowe </em>involved, the effect of the court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury as to a finding of insanity. Even though no assignment of error was made as to that issue, the Court stated, \u201cwe think we must, under the unusual circumstances of this case, take cognizance of the plain error <em>sua sponte.\u201d </em>234 Md. at 302, 199 A.2d 785.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">I also remind the majority that at issue here is whether we should exercise our discretion to review an issue which was not raised and decided below. Maryland Rule 1085 contemplates that an appellate court \u201cwill not ordinarily decide any point or question which does not plainly appear by the record to have been tried and decided by the lower court.\u201d Its prohibition, however, is not absolute, as evidenced by the \u201cuse of the adverb \u2018ordinarily\u2019 [which] implies that there may be extraordinary circumstances in which review will be granted despite the lack of a ruling at the trial level.\u201d <em>Smith v. State, </em>64 Md.App. 625, 632, 498 A.2d 284 (1985). As this Court observed in <em>Smith, </em>\u201cIn the final analysis, the question of whether to review an issue not raised and decided below is discretionary with the appellate court.\u201d 64 Md.App. at 632, 498 A.2d 284, citing <em>Booth v. State, </em>62 Md.App. 26, 38, 488 A.2d 195 (1985). Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>like the exercise of discretion to notice plain error, \u201c... this discretion should be exercised in favor of review when the \u2018unobjected to error [is] compelling, extraordinary, exceptional or fundamental to assure the defendant a fair trial\u2019 \u201d. 64 Md.App. at 32, 498 A.2d 284, quoting <em>State v. Hutchinson, </em>287 Md. 198, 203, 411 A.2d 1035 (1980). It cannot be gainsaid that the error in this case easily meets each of those criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Thus, it is plain that \u201cwhen the trial result[s] in a denial of due process\u201d, <em>Elmer, </em>239 Md. at 8, 209 A.2d 776, the Court should review the propriety of the actions of the trial court <em>sua sponte </em>or, at the very least, at the suggestion of appellant, even if that suggestion is presented for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">To the majority\u2019s suggestion that under these circumstances, simply an admonition is sufficient, the following should be noted. An admonition has not worked in the case of this trial judge in the past and, furthermore, an admonition will not ameliorate the adverse effects suffered by appellant as the result of the trial judge\u2019s actions. It is my view that the failure to take definitive action in this case effects a travesty of justice and undermines the very principles of due process contained in the federal and Maryland Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">Because the trial judge\u2019s interjections in the trial denied appellant a fair trial and due process of law, I would reverse appellant\u2019s convictions and remand the case for a new trial. Moreover, I would instruct that the new trial be conducted before another judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">I also have a problem with the majority\u2019s resolution of appellant\u2019s double jeopardy/collateral estoppel issues. I agree with appellant\u2019s \u201csimple and direct\u201d position: \u201c[T]he use of a deadly weapon is a necessary element for conviction under Article 27, Section 488. Here the Appellant was found not guilty of the use of the handgun in the third trial. The only State theory of the case was that a handgun was involved.\u201d Although appellant admittedly did not provide us with a transcript of the third trial, that appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>premise is correct is obvious and is not seriously contested. Mere conjecture, which is the only stuff of which the State\u2019s position is made, does not suffice to sustain the majority\u2019s holding. This is particularly so where, as here, neither the State nor the trial judge, during the argument on appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss, disputed, or even suggested, that the State\u2019s theory of the case was that appellant acted in concert with someone else, or that the evidence tended to prove such a theory. All the State posits is, as the majority acknowledges, the conjecture that \u201cthe third jury may have concluded that appellant was not the actual robber (or wielder of the handgun) but may have entertained some feeling, short of unanimity, that he was an accomplice of or receiver for the actual robber, who escaped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">I also have difficulty with the majority\u2019s position with regard to the election of a jury trial issue. At the conclusion of the colloquy with the court concerning his election, appellant specifically stated, in what I consider to be unambiguous terms, that \u201cI am not praying no jury trial.\u201d The court did not respond to that statement or conduct any inquiry with respect to it. I think that, at the very least, there should have been some inquiry made by the trial court to ensure that appellant\u2019s election was freely and voluntarily made. Since that was not done, I believe that the case should be reversed for that reason as well.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b672-5\">. By way of example, the judge interrupted the direct examination of Mary Henderson and Cherome Hines, witnesses to the robbery, as well as Officers Brown and Wagner, on several occasions, and proceeded to conduct the questioning of those witnesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b672-6\">. During the State\u2019s examination of Officer Brown, the trial judge interrupted direct examination to direct the officer\u2019s attention to appellant for the purpose of identification. She also assisted the State by developing testimony concerning the time that elapsed between the officer seeing a gun and apprehending appellant. Similarly, while Officer Wagner was on the witness stand, the judge stated, \"I think he can tell us what the description was\u201d, thus suggesting that the State ask Officer Wagner to relate the description of the robber given him by one of the witnesses. Other efforts to assist the State in similar ways occurred during the testimony of Hines and Barbara Means.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">In the case of Means, the judge, as she did during Brown\u2019s testimony, asked the witness to identify the robber, which, as the State reminded her, she had already done.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b672-8\">. When the judge reminded the State that it had not questioned Officer Brown about a \u201cbriefcase\u201d which the police had recovered, the State had to point out to her that his concern at that time was what the officer observed at the scene and that the officer had not seen the \u201cbriefcase\u201d at the scene. Also <em>see </em>the reference to Barbara Means in n. 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b672-9\">. Examples of this can be found during the cross-examinations of Officers Brown, Garrity, and Wagner and of Mary Henderson. In the case of Officer Brown, the judge provided assistance on more than one occasion. On one occasion, after defense counsel had read from the officer\u2019s prior testimony, and before the officer had answered a question based on that prior testimony, the judge prompted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-10\">\u201cIf you previously testified that you had the coat when you went out of the building, would that be what happened, that you did have the coat?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-11\">On another, the court interrupted defense counsel to observe:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>\u201cMs Julian, he does not deny what he said before and I believe he said if you have a record saying he said it before, that\u2019s what he said. Is that right officer?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">The record does not reflect that the officer said any such thing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b673-8\">. In addition to explaining testimony given by Officer Brown, the trial judge also interpreted the testimony of Officer Wagner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b673-9\">. A good example of this occurred during the State\u2019s direct examination of Hines. Although appellant\u2019s counsel objected to the question, \"Were you able to see anything about this individual although you couldn\u2019t see his facial features?\u201d, the judge never ruled on the objection. Instead, she instructed the witness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-10\">\"You can tell us what you can tell us about what he was wearing, what he looked like insofar as you were able to see him. She already said ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-11\">Tell us everything you can remember of what you were able to observe of him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-12\">Other examples occurred during the testimony of Officer Brown and Mary Henderson.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b673-13\">. During the cross-examination of Officer Brown, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-14\">[by defense counsel] You also reported that Mrs. Henderson stated that she saw the suspect go into 4608 Manordene and exit a short time later after the actual robbery wearing a light windbreaker carrying a black duffel bag and then run North through the complex of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-15\">The Court: This is all hearsay. This is something she told somebody else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APi\">The Witness [Off. Brown]: This was told Officer Garrity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-17\">Mr. Townsend [Prosecutor]: I have had a continuing objection to this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-18\">The Court: I sustain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-19\">The record does not reflect that a continuing objection had been granted the prosecutor. Later, the court sustained an objection which was never made. Although defense counsel pointed this out to her, the judge did not respond.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b674-7\">. In addition to appellant, the trial judge cross-examined appellant's brother (concerning the distance from Westside Skill Center, where appellant testified he was going, to 904 West Lexington Street, where appellant lived), his mother (concerning the relationship between appellant and a defense witness), L. Leurs, an investigator for the public defender, and Delano A. Wheatley, the defense witness who claimed to have seen the robber, whom he testified was not appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b674-8\">. This occurred during the cross-examination of Leurs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b674-9\">. This is significant because Henderson had testified that appellant was wearing a \"muslim type of head covering\u201d after he had changed clothes and because the judge did not await the completion of direct examination to begin her questioning.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b678-7\">. Appellant\u2019s counsel did object on one occasion to the court\u2019s interruptions and moved for mistrial. In the colloquy that followed, the trial judge declared: \"I only interrupt when the questions are improper.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
