At trial, the State introduced appellant\u2019s financial records into evidence to show an accumulation of savings consistent with the State\u2019s theory that appellant had been selling narcotics. Neither the prosecutor nor defense counsel mentioned appellant\u2019s finances in their initial closing arguments. In his rebuttal argument following defense counsel\u2019s closing argument, however, the prosecutor did address appellant\u2019s pecuniary resources. Appellant objected to this on the ground that it was beyond the scope of defense counsel\u2019s closing argument and thus not proper rebuttal. The trial judge overruled the objection, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AT7\">I\u2019m going to let the State argue fully. I don\u2019t think the State in closing argument necessarily is to be limited to rebutting exactly what was said by defense counsel. I\u2019ll permit it. In my discretion I think that there can be reference to any evidence that has been introduced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">The prosecutor then completed his argument concerning appellant\u2019s finances. Appellant made no request to address the jury on the issue. The sole question appellant presents on appeal is: \u201cDid the trial court err when, over objection, it permitted the prosecutor to make a new argument during rebuttal that had not been brought out in the defendant\u2019s closing argument?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">Appellant contends that by permitting the State to address an issue in its rebuttal argument which the parties did not address in their initial closing arguments, the trial court \u201cpermits the State to insulate this new argument from any response by the defense.\u201d We agree. In the few reported criminal cases where this has occurred, courts have re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>versed convictions where the State was allowed to raise a new issue in rebuttal argument which was prejudicial to the defendant. <em>See Bailey v. State, </em>440 A.2d 997 (Del.Supr., 1982); <em>State v. Peterson, </em>423 S.W.2d 825 (Mo., 1968) and <em>People v. Bundy, </em>295 Ill. 322, 129 N.E. 189 (1920); <em>c.f Moore v. United States, </em>344 F.2d 558 (D.C.Cir., 1965) (no prejudicial impact). We have been cited to no Maryland cases directly on point, nor have we found any.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">In the case at bar, the argument that appellant had substantial savings, consistent with the theory that he was selling cocaine, was a pertinent argument. A police officer testified that he bought cocaine from appellant, but his identification of appellant as the seller was seriously disputed. Therefore, we are not convinced that the State\u2019s unrebutted argument was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The conduct of a trial is left largely to the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 413, 326 A.2d 707, 714-15 (1974). Had the trial judge given the defendant an opportunity to rebut the State\u2019s new argument, the probability for error in this regard could have been avoided. <em>Brown v. Rogers, </em>19 Md.App. 562, 571-72, 313 A.2d 547, 553 (1974). Because no such opportunity was given, the trial judge\u2019s decision was an abuse of discretion. Appellant\u2019s failure to request the opportunity is not significant under the circumstances of this case. His timely objection to the State\u2019s argument alerted the court that he did not want the State to make an unrebutted argument. It was the prosecutor and the trial court who varied the normal procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">CASE REMANDED FOR A NEW TRIAL.
