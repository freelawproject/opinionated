We hold that it may.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">Gregory Thornton pled guilty to an assault charge in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on February 14, 1985 and was sentenced to ten years\u2019 imprisonment. Mr. Thornton made no Application for Leave to Appeal this conviction. On October 29, 1986, however, he filed a Petition for Post Conviction Relief pursuant to article 27, \u00a7 645A of the Annotated Code of Maryland, and a hearing was held on January 19, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">In an Order filed February 26,1987 the court granted Mr. Thornton\u2019s Petition on the ground that his guilty plea was unsupported by a statement of facts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A review of the trial transcript revealed the failure to show the existence of a factual basis for the plea.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The hearing judge concluded that the absence of a statement of facts resulted in a guilty plea that was accepted \u201cin violation of the Maryland Rules and is ground for post conviction relief,\u201d and granted Mr. Thornton a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">The State now seeks leave to appeal this ruling, arguing that the omission was a procedural defe\u201ect to which Mr. Thornton is bound. <em>See Curtis v. State, </em>284 Md. 132, 150, 395 A.2d 464 (1978) (tactical decisions and legitimate procedural requirements will normally bind a criminal defendant). Citing article 27, \u00a7 645A of the Annotated Code of Maryland, the State also argues that a new trial was improperly granted even if the omission \u201cinvoked a fundamental right [because Thornton] offered nothing to rebut the presumption that his waiver by procedural default was knowing and voluntary, and offered no \u2018special circumstances\u2019 to overcome the waiver.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>We disagree with the State\u2019s reasoning and affirm the hearing judge\u2019s decision. We address each of the State\u2019s arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">II. Nature of the Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"AVP\">Md. Rule 4-242 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">(c) Plea of Guilty.\u2014The court may accept a plea of guilty only after it determines, upon an examination of the defendant on the record in open court conducted by the court, the State\u2019s Attorney, the attorney for the defendant, or any combination thereof, that (1) the defendant is pleading voluntarily, with understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea; and (2) there is a factual basis for the plea. The court may accept the plea of guilty even though the defendant does not admit guilt. Upon refusal to accept a plea of guilty, the court shall enter a plea of not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">The Court of Appeals of Maryland has stated that this rule (formerly Md.R. 731c) \u201cis similar to that contained in rules governing the acceptance of guilty pleas in other state jurisdictions and in federal prosecutions under Federal Rule 11.\u201d <em>State v. Priet, </em>289 Md. 267, 282, 424 A.2d 349 (1981). Inasmuch as this case presents an issue of first impression, we look to the federal rule, cases and commentary as well as Maryland law for guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">(c) Advice to Defendant. Before accepting a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the court must address the defendant personally in open court and inform him of, and determine that he understands, the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-10\">(1) the nature of the charge to which the plea is offered, the mandatory minimum penalty provided by law, if any, and the maximum possible penalty provided by law, including the effect of any special parole term----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-11\">(d) Insuring That the Plea is Voluntary. The court shall not accept a plea of guilty or nolo contendere without first, by addressing the defendant personally in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>open court, determining that the plea is voluntary and not the result of force or threats or of promises apart from a plea agreement. The court shall also inquire as to whether the defendant\u2019s willingness to plead guilty or nolo contendere results from prior discussions between the attorney for the government and the defendant or his attorney____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">(f) Determining Accuracy of Plea. Notwithstanding the acceptance of a plea of guilty, the court should not enter a judgment upon such plea without making such inquiry as shall satisfy it that there is a factual basis for the plea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">(g) Record of Proceedings. A verbatim record of the proceedings at which the defendant enters a plea shall be made and, if there is a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the record shall include, without limitation, the court\u2019s advice to the defendant, the inquiry into the voluntariness of the plea including any plea agreement, and the inquiry into the accuracy of a guilty plea.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Thus, under both federal and Maryland law, before the court may accept a guilty plea, it must determine on the record that the defendant understands the nature of the charges and the consequences of the plea, that the plea is a voluntary one, and that a factual basis supports the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">A criminal defendant is afforded these protections because <em>\u201ca </em>plea of guilty is <em>\u2018a </em>grave and solemn act\u2019 to be accepted only with care and discernment.\u201d 1 Wright &amp; Miller, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure, </em>R. 11 (2d ed. 1982) (quoting <em>Brady v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 748, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 1468, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970)). <em>\u201cA </em>plea of guilty is more than a confession which admits that the accused did various acts; it is itself a conviction; nothing remains but to give judgment and determine punishment.\u201d <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 242, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 1711-12, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969); <em>Sutton v. State, </em>289 Md. 359, 364, 424 A.2d 755 (1981). The defendant waives several constitutional rights when he pleads guilty.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>First, is the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment and applicable to the States by reason of the Fourteenth. <em>Malloy v. Hogan, </em>378 U.S. 1 [84 S.Ct. 1489, 12 L.Ed.2d 653 (1964)]. Second, is the right to trial by jury. <em>Duncan v. Louisiana, </em>391 U.S. 145 [88 S.Ct. 1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 491 (1968) ]. Third, is the right to confront one\u2019s accusers. <em>Pointer v. Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400 [85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-5\"><em>Boykin, </em>395 U.S. at 243, 89 S.Ct. at 1712; <em>Sutton, </em>289 Md. at 365, 424 A.2d 755. Under the Due Process Clause, a waiver of constitutional rights will be upheld only if it is \u201can intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938). This requirement of what has commonly become known as an \u201cintelligent and knowing\u201d waiver applies to the rights guaranteed a criminal defendant to ensure he receives a fair trial. Inasmuch as a guilty plea constitutes a waiver of the right to a trial, \u201c[g]uilty pleas have been carefully scrutinized to determine whether the accused knew and understood all the rights to which he would be entitled at trial, and that he had intentionally chosen to forgo them.\u201d <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 238, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 2053, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973); <em>Sutton, </em>289 Md. at 365, 424 A.2d 755.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">In <em>McCall v. State, </em>9 Md.App. 191, 263 A.2d 19, <em>cert. den., </em>258 Md. 729 (1970), we restated the premise that \u201c[i]t is fundamentally a basic right that an accused be advised of the nature of the charges against him and of the consequences of a plea of guilty ... and this is implicit in a knowing acceptance by the court of a guilty plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 196, 263 A.2d 19 (citing <em>Owens v. State, </em>243 Md. 719, 222 A.2d 838 (1966)). In order to assure that this right is not abrogated, the effective acceptance of a guilty plea requires an affirmative showing, on the record, that the plea was entered</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">(1) voluntarily\u2014that is not through coercion, terror, inducements, or subtle or blatant threats; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>(2) with an intelligent understanding\u2014that is not through ignorance or incomprehension:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-5\">(a) of the nature of the offense; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-6\">(b) of the possible consequences of the plea; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-7\">(3) unconditionally.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b280-8\"><em>Id. </em>9 Md.App. at 195, 263 A.2d 19 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">A guilty plea that at first glance appears to be voluntary, in fact may not be. Although, as defined in <em>McCall, </em>the elements of \u201cvoluntariness\u201d and \u201cintelligent understanding\u201d are distinct, these elements are also closely linked. As the Supreme Court explained, \u201cbecause a guilty plea is an admission of all the elements of a formal criminal charge, it cannot be truly voluntary unless the defendant possesses an understanding of the law in relation to the facts.\u201d <em>McCarthy v. United States, </em>394 U.S. 459, 466, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 1171, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1969).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the defendant must understand not only the nature of the charges, but also that his conduct actually falls within the charge. <em>Id. </em>at 467, 89 S.Ct. at 1171; <em>McCall, </em>9 Md.App. at 197, 263 A.2d 19. Otherwise, although the defendant may act without coercion or threats, his decision to plead guilty may not be deemed truly voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">We also concluded in <em>McCall, </em>after reviewing the then current Supreme Court <em>Boykin </em>decision, that there is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>\u201cconstitutional[ ] mandate[] that the record affirmatively show that there was a factual basis for the plea.\u201d <em>McCall, </em>9 Md.App. at 199, 263 A.2d 19 (citing <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 244 n. 7, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 1713 n. 7, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969)). Thus, \u201cthe trial court must determine that the conduct which the defendant admits constitutes the offense charged to which he has pleaded guilty.\u201d <em>Id. See also McCarthy, </em>394 U.S. at 467, 89 S.Ct. at 1171.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The factual basis inquiry serves a dual purpose. First, an examination of the law and the acts which the defendant admits he committed \u201cprotect[s] a defendant who is in the position of pleading voluntarily with an understanding of the nature of the charge but without realizing that his conduct does not actually fall within the charge.\u201d <em>Id.; McCall, </em>9 Md.App. at 199, 263 A.2d 19. Second, the court\u2019s exposure of the defendant\u2019s state of mind on the record \u201cnot only facilitates [the judge\u2019s] determination of a guilty plea\u2019s voluntariness, but ... also facilitates that determination in any subsequent post-conviction proceeding based upon a claim that the plea was involuntary.\u201d <em>McCarthy, </em>394 U.S. at 467, 89 S.Ct. at 1171. <em>See also Boykin, </em>395 U.S. at 244, 89 S.Ct. at 1712 (adequate record \u201cforestalls the spin-off of collateral proceedings that seek to probe murky memories\u201d); <em>U.S. v. Dayton, </em>604 F.2d 931, 938 (5th Cir. 1979), <em>cert. den., </em>445 U.S. 904, 100 S.Ct. 1080, 63 L.Ed.2d 320 (1980) (factual basis of a guilty plea must be on the record so that a reviewing court can determine whether an abuse of discretion occurred).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">The factual basis requirement is inextricably linked to the voluntariness requirement. In <em>Carreon v. U.S., </em>578 F.2d 176 (7th Cir.1978), the appellate court found the trial court had violated the factual basis requirement of Rule 11 by relying on counsel\u2019s statement that the defendant had been informed about possible defenses. The trial judge did not personally inquire about the underlying facts, but had the charges read from the indictment and asked the defendant only whether he had committed the offenses charged. <em>Id. </em>at 178. The appellate court vacated the judgment explain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>ing, \u201cThere is no adequate substitute for demonstrating <em>in the record at the time the plea is entered </em>the defendant's understanding of the nature of the charge against him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 179 <em>(citing McCarthy, </em>394 U.S. at 470, 89 S.Ct. at 1173) (emphasis in original). The court also reasoned that although <em>McCarthy </em>involved a direct appeal, the court\u2019s rationale for permitting McCarthy to plead anew was equally compelling in a collateral review such as <em>Carreon. Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9s\">When the factual-basis requirement is not satisfied, ... the question of voluntariness is left open____ [Mjerely ordering a voluntariness hearing is likely to be an ineffectual means of assuring that the defendant\u2019s rights were protected when the plea was taken, inasmuch as the defendant\u2019s subjective state of mind is crucial and his proof is likely to be \u201climited to his own plaintive allegations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b282-6\"><em>Id. {citing McCarthy, </em>394 U.S. at 469, 89 S.Ct. at 1172).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">More recently, the Supreme Court of Vermont addressed a violation of Vt.R.Crim.Proc. 11, which closely parallels the federal rule. In <em>In re Dunham, </em>144 Vt. 444, 479 A.2d 144 (1984), the court found that the trial record disclosed no factual basis for the wilfulness element of the defendant\u2019s guilty plea to second degree murder. <em>Id. </em>479 A. 2d at 147. Except for this violation of Rule 11(f)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>, all parts of Rule 11 were complied with. <em>Id. </em>at 146. The defendant argued the violation was a \u201cfundamental error resulting in a complete miscarriage of justice,\u201d whereas the State argued the error was merely \u201ctechnical,\u201d not requiring reversal in a post-conviction proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 146. <em>(See United States v. Timmreck, </em>441 U.S. 780, 99 S.Ct. 2085, 60 L.Ed.2d 634 (1979) (Technical violations of Rule 11 are not subject to collateral attacks; such violations are neither constitutional nor jurisdictional and the error resulted in neither a \u201ccom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>p\u00edete miscarriage of justice\u201d nor in a proceeding \u201cinconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.\u201d). The <em>Dunham </em>court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-4\">Since the defendant\u2019s understanding of the elements of an offense as applied to the facts goes directly to the voluntariness of his plea, the record must affirmatively show sufficient facts to satisfy each element of an offense. The requirement of VtR.Cr.P. 11(f) involves an understanding by the defendant that the conduct admitted violates the law as explained to him by the court. Absent this, no matter how perfectly the other parts of Rule 11 have been observed, we cannot find a voluntary plea.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-5\"><em>In re Dunham, </em>479 A.2d at 148. The court, therefore, vacated the defendant\u2019s sentence, explaining that to allow the plea to stand \u201cwould work a complete miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Three generally accepted methods of establishing a factual basis for a guilty plea in federal and state courts are: inquiry of the defendant, inquiry of the prosecutor, or examination of the presentence report. J.L. Barkai, \u201cAccuracy Inquiry for all Felony And Misdemeanor Pleas; Voluntary Pleas But Innocent Defendants?\u201d, 126 U.Pa.L.Rev. 88, 118 (1977). This list is not exhaustive, however, and courts may evaluate and select an appropriate method on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">Typically, a factual basis is not adequately established by a simple inquiry as to whether a defendant is pleading guilty or whether he committed the crime as charged. If the judge includes a terse layman\u2019s description of the offense charged, however, and the accused acknowledges such conduct, a sufficient factual basis is established, according to several jurisdictions. Elsewhere this practice has been disparaged as inadequate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">Although the accused is typically interrogated by the judge, some courts allow the defense attorney or the prosecutor to conduct the questioning. The testimony of these attorneys has also been accepted in some states as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>a source of the factual basis, provided the defendant is present. A prosecutor\u2019s testimony usually consists of a summary of the evidence he expects to present at trial. This method of establishing a guilty plea\u2019s accuracy has been limited at times, however, by requirements that a prosecutor supply concrete facts rather than merely assert that a factual basis exists, and that the truth of the evidence thus summarized be confirmed by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">Another source of information as to a guilty plea\u2019s factual basis is the testimony of witnesses before the judge at the plea hearing, through formal written statements, or by transcripts from grand jury or preliminary hearing proceedings. In addition, some states allow the factual basis to be established by probation or presentence reports, charging documents, or \u201cany appropriate procedure.\u201d Despite the diversity of methods for the accuracy inquiry, many states agree that it need not be conducted at the time of the plea, but may occur any time prior to sentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 121-22 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">As one commentator observed shortly after <em>Boykin </em>and <em>McCarthy </em>were decided, \u201cthe question will soon arise whether the due process clause also \u2018incorporates\u2019 the last provision of the rule\u2014that the judge be \u2018satisfied that there is a factual basis for the plea.\u2019 ... Under rule 11, the judge is expected to inquire of the defendant or the government attorney or to examine the presentence report in order to determine what facts the defendant admits and assess their relation to the law. It may be that such a process is now also required by the Constitution.\u201d \u201cThe Supreme Court, 1968 Term,\u201d 83 Harv.L.Rev. 7, 185 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">We conclude that the statement of facts is indispensible to the court\u2019s finding of voluntariness on the defendant\u2019s part and to the court\u2019s own determination that a factual basis supports the guilty plea. We hold that the omission of a statement of facts violates the essence of the due process protections afforded a criminal defendant. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>not a procedural defect, therefore, but is a denial of a fundamental right.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">III. Waiver of the Right</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Next, the State argues that even if, as we hold, the defendant has a fundamental right to a statement of facts, the right was waived pursuant to article 27, \u00a7 645A of the Maryland Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">In <em>Curtis v. State, </em>284 Md. 132, 395 A.2d 464 (1978), the Court of Appeals construed subsection (c) of Maryland\u2019s Post Conviction Procedure Act, Md.Ann.Code art. 27, \u00a7 645A \u201cRight of appeal of convicted persons.\u201d Subsection (c) deals with waivers and is erroneously interpreted by the State in this appeal. Subsection (c) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-8\">(c) <em>When allegation of error deemed to have been </em>waived.\u2014For the purposes of this subtitle, an allegation of error shall be deemed to be waived when a petitioner could have made, but intelligently and knowingly failed to make, such allegation before trial, at trial, on direct appeal (whether or not said petitioner actually took such an appeal), in any habeas corpus or coram nobis proceeding actually instituted by said petitioner, in a prior petition under this subtitle, or in any other proceeding actually instituted by said petitioner, unless the failure to make such allegation shall be excused because of special circumstances. The burden of proving the existence of such special circumstances shall be upon the petitioner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-9\">When an allegation of error could have been made by a petitioner before trial, at trial, on direct appeal (whether or not said petitioner actually took such an appeal), in any habeas corpus or coram nobis proceeding actually instituted by said petitioner, in a prior petition under this subtitle, or in any other proceeding actually instituted by said petitioner, but was not in fact so made, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that said petitioner intelligently and knowingly failed to make such allegation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">The <em>Curtis </em>court summarized the \u201cwaiver rule\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>[W]here the petitioner establishes that he did not in fact intelligently and knowingly fail to raise an issue previously, such issue cannot be deemed to have been waived. He need not, in addition, establish \u201cspecial circumstances.\u201d It is only where the petitioner in fact intelligently and knowingly failed to raise an issue, or where he is unable to rebut the presumption of an intelligent and knowing failure that he must show \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d in order to excuse his failure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-5\"><em>Curtis, </em>284 Md. at 140, 395 A.2d 464. The court explained further, however, that the \u201cwaiver rule,\u201d requiring an \u201cintelligent and knowing\u201d failure to raise an issue, does not govern every situation where the possibility existed for an allegation of error to have been raised in a prior proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 141, 395 A.2d 464. The court reviewed numerous cases<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and concluded that, by failing to raise an issue earlier, a criminal defendant may be precluded from asserting \u201ca broad spectrum of rights which are deemed to fall within the category of tactical decisions by counsel or involve procedural defaults.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 147, 395 A.2d 464. This waiver of tactical decisions and procedural errors operates even in the absence of an \u201cintelligent and knowing\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>decision by the defendant. <em>Id. </em>The court reasoned, under basic principles of statutory construction, that the Legislature used the term \u201cwaiver\u201d in a narrow sense, and intended subsection (c) to apply only where federal case law required an \u201cintelligent and knowing\u201d waiver. <em>Id. </em>at 149, 395 A.2d 464, citing <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938) and <em>Fay v. Noia, </em>372 U.S. 391, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">On the other hand, the <em>Curtis </em>court identified the following as constitutionally protected fundamental rights that do require an \u201cintelligent and knowing\u201d waiver to be valid: the right to counsel <em>(Johnson v.

State, </em>285 Md. 19, 400 A.2d 406 (1979). In <em>Williams v. State, </em>292 Md. 201, 438 A.2d 1301 (1981), however, the court did recognize as fundamental the defendant\u2019s right to be present in person at the trial to confront witnesses. The court reasoned that because the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights were involved, an \u201cintelligent and knowing\u201d waiver was required. <em>Id. </em>at 219, 438 A.2d 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number><em>Wyche v.

Summarizing the waiver rule, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-4\">[W]hen the court finds that the possibility existed for a petitioner to have previously raised a particular allegation but he did not do so, the allegation will be deemed waived because of the failure to have previously raised it only if the right upon which the allegation is premised is a non-fundamental right. Conversely, if the right upon which the allegation is premised is a fundamental right, the allegation will not be deemed waived simply because it was not raised at a prior proceeding. Fundamental rights as we have said, may be waived only where the petitioner intelligently and knowingly effects the waiver.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A24\"><em>Id. </em>at 407, 454 A.2d 378 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">IV. Application of Law to This Case</p>\n<p id=\"ADN\">The record in the case <em>sub judice </em>reveals the following colloquy at the proceedings in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">MR. SCHENKER [Assistant State\u2019s Attorney]: Judge, calling the case of Gregory Thornton, 48501714 and 16. Your Honor, this is an assault by shooting. We have independent witnesses as well as recovery of the gun, and spent projectiles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-7\">MS. SHEPERD: Bridget Sheperd, Assistant Public Defender on behalf of Mr. Thornton. Mr. Thornton is currently doing a ten-year sentence in the Department of Correction____ [Addressing the defendant] I\u2019ve explained to you before, the State is offering you ten-months concurrent starting from today. I\u2019m sorry, ten years, ten years from today concurrent with your present sentence____ Understanding that, do you wish to enter a guilty plea? What do you want him to plead to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-12\">MR. SCHENKER: One assault would be fine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-13\">MS.

THORNTON: I wish to do that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The defendant was then sworn and \u201cqualified\u201d by defense counsel. He testified that he understood that by pleading guilty he was giving up his right to a trial, to confront the State\u2019s witnesses, and other related constitutional rights. The examination by Ms. Sheperd concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Arg\">Q And you understand, sir, that when you plead guilty, you only get four limited grounds to appeal, jurisdiction, legality of sentence, competency of counsel, and voluntariness of the plea; do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-6\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-7\">Q Understanding all the rights that you are giving up, do you wish to enter a guilty plea?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-8\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-9\">MS. SHEPERD: I believe he is qualified, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-10\">THE COURT: Accept the plea, impose the sentence as agreed upon, ten years to the Department of Correction to commence today concurrent with any existing sentence ____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">Establishing a factual basis for the defendant\u2019s guilty plea does not require \u201ca litany or other ritual which can be carried out only by word-for-word adherence to a set \u2018script.\u2019 \u201d Fed.R.Crim.Proc. 11, Notes of Advisory Committee on Crim. Rules; <em>see also State v. Priet, </em>289 Md. 267, 275-77, 424 A.2d 349 (1981). An inquiry may be made of the defendant, of the attorneys, or by whatever means is appropriate in a specific case. The inquiry, however, must be sufficient to develop the underlying facts from which the court will determine whether the conduct which the defendant admitted constituted the offense to which he has pled guilty. <em>Priet, </em>289 Md. at 279, 424 A.2d 349. As the court explained in <em>Priet:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-12\">[B]y its express terms, the rule mandates that a guilty plea not be accepted unless it is determined by the court, after questioning of the defendant on the record, that the accused understands the \u201cnature\u201d of the charge. This, of course, is an essential requirement of the rule and must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>be applied in a practical and realistic manner. It simply contemplates that the court will explain to the accused, in understandable terms, the nature of the offense to afford him a basic understanding of its essential substance, rather than of the specific legal components of the offense to which the plea is tendered. The nature of some crimes is readily understandable from the crime itself. Necessarily, the required determination can only be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the relevant circumstance in their totality as disclosed by the record, including, among other factors, the complexity of the charge, the personal characteristics of the accused, <em>and the factual basis proffered to support the court\u2019s acceptance of the plea.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 288, 424 A.2d 349 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The record in this case is devoid of any discussion concerning the nature of the charge, the facts of the case, or the defendant\u2019s understanding of the relationship between the two. Nor did either counsel proffer any facts as to what the State, given the opportunity, would prove. Thornton\u2019s plea, therefore, \u201ccould not be voluntary in the sense that it constituted an intelligent admission that he committed the offense [because he did not] receive \u2018real notice of the true nature of the charge against him, the first and most universally recognized requirement of due process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Priet, </em>289 Md. at 280-81, 424 A.2d 349 (quoting <em>Henderson v. Morgan, </em>426 U.S. 637, 645, 96 S.Ct. 2253, 2257-58, 49 L.Ed.2d 108 (1976); <em>Smith v. O\u2019Grady, </em>312 U.S. 329, 61 S.Ct. 572, 85 L.Ed. 859 (1941)).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">In <em>Wyche v. State, </em>53 Md.App. 403, 406, 454 A.2d 378 (1983), we posited the following two-prong test to determine if the requirement for an \u201cintelligent and knowing\u201d waiver is satisfied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-8\">1. [Whether] the record expressly reflects that the defendant had a basic understanding of the nature of the right which was relinquished or abandoned; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>2. [Whether] the record expressly reflects acknowledgement that the relinquishment or abandonment of that right was made or agreed to by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AI\">Applying this test to the instant case, we must answer both prongs in the negative. With the omission of the most basic information\u2014the statement of facts\u2014Thornton could not have been \u201cproperly advised\u201d before his guilty plea was accepted. <em>See Machibroda v. United States, </em>368 U.S. 487, 493, 82 S.Ct. 510, 513, 7 L.Ed.2d 473 (1962); <em>Wyche, </em>53 Md.App. at 406, 454 A.2d 378. We conclude, therefore, that the omission of a statement of facts constituted the denial of a fundamental right for which there was no voluntary, knowing and intelligent waiver. We hold that the factual basis for the guilty plea must be stated on the record in open court, and the defendant, at minimum, must acknowledge that he has heard the recited facts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">We take this opportunity to reiterate the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-6\">First, although the procedure embodied in Rule 11 has not been held to be constitutionally mandated, it is designed to assist the district judge in making the constitutionally required determination that a defendant\u2019s guilty plea is truly voluntary. Second, the Rule is intended to produce a complete record at the time the plea is entered of the factors relevant to this voluntariness determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>tion. Thus, the more meticulously the Rule is adhered to, the more it tends to discourage, or at least to enable more expeditious disposition of, the numerous and often frivolous post-conviction attacks on the constitutional validity of guilty pleas.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-5\"><em>McCarthy, </em>394 U.S. at 465, 89 S.Ct. at 1170.</p>\n<p id=\"A-\">APPLICATION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A2c\">.
