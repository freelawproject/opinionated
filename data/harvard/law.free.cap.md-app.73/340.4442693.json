BELL, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b367-14\">People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County appeals from a decision of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, reversing in part and remanding in part, the administrative order of the County Board of Appeals of Baltimore County. Upon a finding of error in the county-wide comprehensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>zoning, the County Board had conditionally granted Robert W. Mockard, et al., appellees, a piecemeal zoning reclassification. Appellees filed a cross-appeal. The issues we will deal with on appeal are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-4\">1. Whether the Board\u2019s limitation on the future use of the subject property is an invalid condition on the reclassification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-5\">2. Whether the Board failed to make proper findings as required by the Baltimore County Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-6\">3. Whether there was an error in the comprehensive zoning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Appellees, Robert W. Mockard, et al., petitioned the Baltimore County Board of Appeals for a reclassification of property zoned Business, Local (BL-CS-2). They claimed that there was an error in the 1984 comprehensive zoning map and requested a reclassification of the property to the next higher intensity business zone, Business, Major (BM-CS-2). Appellees filed an \u201copen plat\u201d reclassification which, if granted, authorizes any permitted use within the designated classification. The Board, finding error, granted the reclassification for the specific purpose of expanding appellees\u2019 existing used and new car dealership.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">Both parties appealed the Board\u2019s decision to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. The court affirmed the Board\u2019s finding of error in the comprehensive zoning but found that the conditional zoning was invalid. The court remanded the case to the Board to determine whether, based on the factors delineated by the county code, the prospective classification was warranted. Both appellant and appellees agree with the circuit court\u2019s finding regarding the invalidity of conditional zoning. Appellant appeals the court\u2019s finding of error. It claims that the evidence before the Board demonstrated that the requested reclassification was unwarranted. Appellees cross-appeal, contesting the court\u2019s remand to the Board for findings under the Baltimore County Code. They argue that the finding of error in the comprehensive zoning should be affirmed, and the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>dition should be stricken without remanding the case to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">Conditional Zoning</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Conditional zoning is a zoning reclassification subject to conditions not generally applicable to land similarly zoned. \u201c[W]hen an area of land is rezoned from one classification to another, and such change is not outright but subject to some type of conditions, then we are confronted with a conditional zoning problem.\u201d <em>Board of County Comm\u2019rs of Washington County v. H. Manny Holtz, Inc., </em>65 Md.App. 574, 579, 501 A.2d 489 (1985), quoting Miller, <em>The Current Status of Conditional Zoning, </em>Institute on Planning, Zoning, &amp; Eminent Domain 122 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">In <em>Montgomery County v. National Capital Realty Corp., </em>267 Md. 364, 297 A.2d 675 (1972), the Court said, \u201cThe invalidity of conditional zoning in Maryland is not seriously open to question.\u201d <em>National Capital Realty Corp., </em>267 Md. at 373, 297 A.2d 675. This Court continues to reaffirm the invalidity of conditional zoning. <em>H. Manny Holtz, Inc., </em>65 Md.App. at 586, 501 A.2d 489. In <em>Holtz, </em>appellant argued that the Maryland Code provision granting local legislative bodies the general authority to rezone land contained an express grant of conditional zoning power. <em>H. Manny Holtz, Inc., </em>65 Md.App. at 580, 501 A.2d 489. We held that, although \u201cvarious states have been attracted to conditional rezoning as a valuable planning tool, we are not inclined to construe the statute to provide for conditional use zoning in Maryland.\u201d <em>H. Manny Holtz, Inc., </em>65 Md.App. at 586, 501 A.2d 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">In chartered counties such as Baltimore County, there are certain limitations to the general rule invalidating conditional zoning. The Baltimore County Code provides two alternative methods for those seeking reclassification.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>Sections 2-58.1(l)-(n) permit a form of conditional zoning.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Baltimore County, Md.Code \u00a7 2-58.1(1) (1985 Cum.Supp.) allows a petitioner to submit a specific site plan.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> That section requires petitioners to provide extensive documentation, including a specific site plan and an environmental impact statement. \u00a7 2.58.1(1) &amp; (2). If a petitioner chooses to submit a site plan, the requirements set forth in \u00a7 2-58. l(j)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> must be satisfied before a reclassification will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>be granted. The reclassification is contingent upon compliance with the submitted site plan and is specifically exempted from the uniformity requirement of Baltimore County Code \u00a7 22-20, Baltimore County, Md.Code, \u00a7 2-58.1(n) (1985 Cum.Supp.).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellees did not choose to proceed under this method of reclassification.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellees sought an unconditional (or \u201copen plat\u201d) reclassification. Section 2-58.1(j) sets forth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>the requirement for such an unconditional reclassification.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellees were not required to submit any of the documentation necessary for a specific site reclassification. An unconditional reclassification, if granted, allows appellees to engage in any use permitted by the new zoning classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Even though appellees proceeded under and requested an unconditional reclassification, they introduced substantial evidence at the hearing of their intent to use the property to expand the existing car dealership. Neighboring property owners testified that they were concerned about a general reclassification, but had no objections to appellees\u2019 extension plans. Thus, it is not surprising that in finding error, the Board specifically conditioned the reclassification \u201cfor the specific purpose of expanding the existing used and new car dealership.\u201d In this way, the Board apparently felt it could grant the reclassification and at the same time protect the quality of life of the surrounding neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">While we appreciate the Board\u2019s concerns, we cannot ignore the method it chose to implement them. Appellees requested an unconditional reclassification. The Board did not grant it. Appellees did not follow the procedure necessary for the granting of a specific site reclassification. The Board did grant that type of reclassification. Thus, we affirm the trial judge\u2019s decision that the Board\u2019s conditional granting of the reclassification was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Appellees propose that we strike the condition but affirm the Board\u2019s decision to reclassify the property. We disagree. It is possible that the Board would have granted the reclassification despite the invalidity of the condition. But it is equally as likely that the Board would not have granted the reclassification unless it could attach the condition. Thus, it is necessary to remand the case to the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>to determine whether <em>all </em>permitted uses under the prospective classification are, in fact, warranted.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">Section 2-58.1(j)(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The circuit court found that in granting the reclassification the Board\u2019s opinion did not reflect the requisite consideration of factors enumerated in \u00a7 2-58.1(j)(2). The court remanded the case to the Board to consider whether, based on those factors, the reclassification to BM was warranted. Section 2-58.1(j)(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">\u201cThat the prospective reclassification of the property is warranted by that change or error. <em>Any finding of such a change or error and any finding that the prospective reclassification is warranted may be made only upon consideration of factors </em>relating to the purposes of the zoning regulations and maps, <em>including, but not limited to, all of the following: </em>Population trends; availability and adequacy of present and proposed transportation facilities, water-supply facilities, sewerage, solid-waste disposal facilities, schools, recreational facilities, and other public facilities, compatibility of uses generally allowable under the prospective classification with the present and projected development or character of the surrounding area; any pertinent recommendation of the planning board or office of planning and zoning; and consistency of the current and prospective classifications with the master plan, the county plan for sewerage and water-supply facilities, and the capital program.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">Under that provision, the Board must make two findings: 1) that there was error in the comprehensive zoning, and 2) that the prospective reclassification is warranted. Both of those findings may be made \u201conly upon consideration of factors ... including, but not limited to, all of the following....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>Two issues are before us on appeal. The first involves an interpretation of the phrase \u201cconsideration of factors.\u201d The second issue is whether the Board\u2019s finding of error in the comprehensive zone plan was in accordance with \u00a7 2-58.1(j)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Consideration of Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Appellees filed a cross-appeal, arguing that \u00a7 2-58.1(j)(2) does <em>not </em>require the Board to enter specific findings as to each factor. They claim that the Board is only required to \u201cconsider\u201d the factors. In support of their argument, appellees quote a provision from the Anne Arundel County, Md.Code dealing with specific factors to be taken into account in rezoning cases. That provision provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">\u201cRezoning shall be granted or denied ... but a rezoning may not be granted except on the basis of an <em>affirmative finding </em>that: ____\u201d (Specific factors omitted.) (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Anne Arundel County, Md.Code, art. 28, \u00a7 11-102 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">Appellees argue that the words \u201caffirmative finding\u201d necessitate express findings. Conversely, they claim that the Baltimore County Board need only \u201cconsider\u201d certain factors, hence the Board did not need to objectively deal with the factors. We do not agree with appellees\u2019 conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">The threshold question is, irrespective of the specific language used in a given statute, on what basis does a court review an agency\u2019s actions? In <em>United Steelworkers of America AFL-CIO, Local 2610 v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>298 Md. 665, 272 A.2d 62 (1984), the Court answered that question as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-11\">\u201cJudicial review of administrative action differs from appellate review of a trial court judgment. In the latter context the appellate court will search the record for evidence to support the judgment and will sustain the judgment for a reason plainly appearing on the record whether or not the reason was expressly relied upon by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>the trial court. However, in judicial review of agency action, the court may not uphold the agency order unless it is sustainable on the agency\u2019s findings and for the reasons stated by the agency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-4\"><em>United Steel Workers, </em>298 Md. at 679, 272 A.2d 62. <em>See also </em>Abrams, <em>Guide to Maryland Zoning Decisions </em>92-93 (2d ed. 1984). The court may not supply factual findings which were not made by the Board. <em>Ocean Hide Away Condominium Ass\u2019n v. Boardwalk Plaza Venture, </em>68 Md.App. 650, 664-65, 515 A.2d 485 (1986). It is only when the Board\u2019s finding is uncontradicted from other sources and only one conclusion could be reached, that a lack of findings will not warrant remand. <em>Gough v. Board of Zoning Appeals for Calvert County, </em>21 Md.App. 697, 704, 321 A.2d 315 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Anderson, <em>American Law of Zoning, </em>\u00a7 16.41, states succinctly the reasons why administrative agencies should make express findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">\u201cGiven express findings, the court can determine whether the findings are supported by substantia] evidence, and whether the findings warrant the decision of the board. If no findings are made, and if the court elects not to remand, its clumsy alternative is to <em>read </em>the record, <em>speculate </em>upon the portions which probably were believed by the board, <em>guess </em>at the conclusions drawn from credited portions, <em>construct a basis </em>for decision, and <em>try to determine </em>whether a decision thus arrived at should be sustained. In the process, the court is required to do much that is assigned to the board, and the latter becomes a relatively inefficient instrument for the construction of a record.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Hence, we hold that \u201cconsideration of factors\u201d requires an articulation of the findings as to each of the applicable factors contained in \u00a7 2-58.1(j)(2). The Board must make such findings in <em>both </em>a finding of error in the comprehensive plan and in a decision that the reclassification was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>Finding of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">As discussed earlier, in finding error or that a reclassification is warranted, the Board must consider factors, \u201cincluding, <em>but not limited to, </em>all of the following____\u201d Section 2-58.1(j)(2). This means that, in order to make either of those findings, the Board must <em>at least </em>articulate its findings as to the 13 identified factors. Under that section, the Board is not limited in its determination to consideration of just those factors. A petitioner can also establish error in the comprehensive zoning with probative evidence to show that the assumptions or premises relied upon by the Council at the time of the comprehensive (re)zoning were invalid. The presumption of validity accorded comprehensive zoning may be overcome by evidence establishing that there were then existing facts which the Council, in fact, failed to take into account, or subsequently occurring events which the Council could not have taken into account. <em>Howard County v. Dorsey, </em>292 Md. 351, 356-58, 438 A.2d 1339 (1982), citing <em>Boyce v. Sembly, </em>25 Md.App. 43, 50-53, 334 A.2d 137 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the Board\u2019s decision failed to include findings relative to the factors set forth in the Code. It is conclusory in nature and lacks sufficient indication of which, if any, factors the Board considered in making its determination. In this case, the evidence introduced at the hearing does not lead to the inevitable conclusion that there was an error in the existing comprehensive plan. There was testimony by appellees\u2019 own witness that the present zoning provides for a reasonable use of the subject property. While some of the nearby property is zoned BM, the property to the immediate west is zoned BL and BR. Finally, there is no indication that there was any evidence before the Board demonstrating that the Council relied on erroneous assumptions or premises in formulating the comprehensive zoning plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">We hold that the Board\u2019s finding of error in the comprehensive plan was not made in accordance with \u00a7 2-58.1(j)(2). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>There is no evidence that the Board properly considered the factors contained in that section. Thus, we are unable to reach the issues of whether there was convincing evidence of error and whether the Board\u2019s finding of error was fairly debatable.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">Although with more specificity than expressed by the trial judge, we affirm the remand of the case for the Board to decide whether there was an error in the comprehensive zoning plan. In making that determination, the Board must at least \u201cconsider,\u201d as we have defined that word, the factors found in \u00a7 2-58.1(j)(2). Secondly, the Board must at least \u201cconsider\u201d those factors and make specific findings as to whether the proposed reclassification is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.
