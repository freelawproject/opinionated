The gist of an action to recover damages for a personal injury inflicted by a vicious dog, is the keeping of the dog in a negligent manner, after knowledge of .his vicious propensities, rather than the keeping of the animal with such knowledge.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b181-8\"><em>2. </em>Two or more persons may be joined as defendants in such action; and the recovery, if any, may be joint or several.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b181-9\">3. When it has been shown that the animal has been kept after knowledge of his dangerous character has been acquired, or circumstances have been shown from which the law would imply knowledge, and an injury has followed, this would be <em>prima facie </em>evidence of negligence.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b181-10\">4. One may negligently keep and harbor a vicious dog, knowing him to be such, without being the owner of the animal; and he may thus keep and harbor a vicious dog without owning or controlling the premises where he may be kept; and he may be chargeable with notice of the viciousness of the dog through his neglect to take notice of his vicious habits.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b181-11\">5- A witness may be interrogated on cross-examination concerning facts which affect his credibility by showing bias or prejudice in favor of the party who called him as a witness; and if the witness denies the facts inquired about, the cross-examining party may prove them by other witnesses.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b181-12\">6. Where a non-expert witness has detailed the facts within his knowledge, and, without objection, has been permitted to answer the question: \u201cFrom your knowledge of the dog, what do you say as to'his being a peaceable, quiet dog?\u201d he may be cross-examined as to the facts which form the basis of his opinion, and as to his want of knowledge of facts; but he can not be asked to give his opinion upon a state of facts which is not shown to be within his knowledge.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b181-13\">7- For counsel, in the course of argument to the jury, to charge the opposite party with deliberate purpose and effort to sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>press the truth, and with naving hired an attorney for that purpose, without justification in the evidence, or to state or assume as facts matters which are not in evidence, or to comment on testimony which had been ruled out, is an abuse of privilege, and is misconduct for which a new trial should be granted.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b182-5\">8. It is a duty of the trial court which is not merely discretionary, when counsel grossly abuses bis privilege to the manifest prejudice of the opposite party, to interpose and admonish the offending counsel and to instruct the jury in regard thereto; and if it fail to do so, it is ground for a new trial.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b182-6\">9. The form in which an objection to such an abuse of privilege is brought to the notice of the trial court is not material; and when the record shows that the opposing counsel addressed his objections and exceptions directly to the court, and the full record being before the reviewing court, it does not appear that the trial court took any notice thereof, nor that it acted thereon, it will be presumed to have refused to rule out the objectionable matter, and such failure and refusal will be ground for reversal.</headnotes>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b182-7\">(Decided March 6, 1900.)</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-8\">Error to the Circuit Court of Sandusky county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-9\">The defendant in error brought suit in the court of common pleas of Sandusky county against the defendants who are the children and heirs of the late Rutherford B. Hayes, alleging in her amended petition, upon which the case was tried, that heretofore, to-wit, on the first day of January, A. D. 1893, and from thence and until, and at the time of the injury to the said plaintiff, as hereinafter mentioned, the said defendants wrongfully, injuriously and negligently, did keep and harbor a certain dog, and that they, and each of said defendants, during all that time had notice of and well knew that said dog was fierce, vicious and dangerous, and as they and each of them well knew, that said dog was in the habit of attacking, biting, chasing and frightening teams, horses and horses attached to wagons, carriages and other vehicles, and also in the habit of attacking and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>biting mankind, of all of which said defendants and each of them had at all times full knowledge; and that said dog did afterwards and while so kept and harbored by said defendants as aforesaid, to-wit, on the eighteenth day of August, 1893, and while plaintiff was riding in a buggy along and on the public highway, run out upon the public highway upon which plaintiff was then traveling as aforesaid, and fiercely and ferociously did spring at and viciously attack the horse drawing the buggy in which plainMff was then riding; and by reason of said attack so made by said dog upon said horse the said horse became and was frightened and unmanageable and overturned the buggy in which plaintiff was riding and threw plaintiff with great force and violence upon the ground, thereby inflicting upon plaintiff\u2019s head and other parts of her body dangerous wounds and injuries, whereby she sustained a great loss of blood from her head and other parts of her body, a severe shock of the nervous system, partial loss of memory.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-6\">And by means of the injuries so as aforesaid inflicted upon plaintiff, she has sustained permanent mental and physical injuries, total loss of hearing in one of her ears, and has at all times since she received said injuries endured constant pain and hodily suffering.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-7\">Motion to make the amended petition more definite and certain was made and overruled, and likewise a special demurrer to the amended petition, on the ground that separate causes of action against the several defendants are improperly joined.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-8\">Defendants answered separately. It is not deemed necessary to set out in detail the defenses included in these several defenses. A trial was had in the common pleas court, resulting in a verdict for the plaintiff. A special verdict was also returned by the jury which is substantially the facts as alleged in the amended petition. Motion was made to set aside both the special and general verdicts upon a large <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>number of grounds, among which were the allegation that the court had erred in admitting evidence offered by the plaintiff and excepted to by the defendant and that there was misconduct of the attorneys for the plaintiff in the argument to the jury. Motion for a new trial was overruled, judgment rendered upon the verdict, and the judgment was affirmed in the circuit court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-5\">Petition in error is filed here to reverse the judgment of the circuit court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-6\">It appears in the bill of exceptions that a witness, Lucy Keeler, was examined on behalf of the defendants, and after stating in detail her knowledge of the habits of the dog in question, she testified as follows, without objection:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-7\">Q. From your knowledge of him what do you say as to his being a quiet, peaceable, good natured dog? A. I am quite sure he was a quiet, peaceful, good natured dog from my knowledge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-8\">On cross-examination she was asked the following-questions :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-9\">Q. Suppose that a man was driving along the public highway in a sleigh with his wife a.nd babe in the wife\u2019s arms, and the dog would leap at the horse, at the head of the horse, spring at him with an attempt to grab the horse by the head or nose, miss the horse, pass on by, then come back at the lady that was sitting in the sleigh and jump at her, and suppose she was pulled over away from the dog and the dog would run around and jump at the man, and the dog was driven away with a whip, your opinions would be somewhat changed about the good nature of this dog, would it not?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-10\">Objected to by defendant\u2019s counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-11\">Overruled by the court, to which ruling of the court the defendant at the time excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-12\">A.

Now suppose that dog had run upon the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>highway from thirty to forty different times and leaped at horses hitched to wagons and carriages, leaped at their noses and barked and frightened them and ran after them and barked, now would that change your opinion of the good nature of this dog?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-6\">Objected to by defendant\u2019s counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-7\">Overruled by the court, to which ruling of the court the defendant\u2019s counsel at the time excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-8\">A. I think that Avould change my opinion if it were proven to me.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-9\">Also Dr. George O.

From your knoAvledge of this dog you may state Avhat his character was. generally, just describe him? A. Well, I could better, probably, if you put it his disposition, I don\u2019t know as I can get at really the character of the dog.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-11\">And on cross-examination as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-12\">Q. Supposing this dog in question in the winter time of 1892 and 1893, in February, 1893, had sprang out at a horse hitched to a cutter in which cutter there was a woman with a babe in her arms,, and husband sitting beside her, they were driving this horse along, this dog jumped out and made a leap at the horse\u2019s nose or head, missed that and went on and then turned and came back at the woman and tried to catch her, jumped at her, and the husband pulling her over, kept her away from the dog, that he then ran around at the husband and made at him, and the husband struck him with a Avhip to keep him off, have you taken that fact into consideration in your testimony here when you say this dog was a peaceful dog?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-13\">Objected to by defendant\u2019s counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-14\">Q.

Have you taken that in consideration what I have said? A. I never heard that before.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-6\">Q. Did you take this in consideration when you said you thought the dog was a peaceable dog? A. I never have heard of that, never have known of that taking place, if I would have known that that had taken place \u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-7\">Q. If that actually did take place as I have stated, then what would you say?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-8\">Objected to by defendant\u2019s counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-9\">Overruled by court, to which ruling of the court defendant\u2019s counsel at the time excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-10\">A. I would consider the dog then if he would do that in a vicious manner that he would be a vicious dog.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-11\">Also William E. Lang testified in behalf of the defendant as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-12\">Q. Well, from your knowledge of the dog, your observations of him, yon may state what manner or character of dog he was as to being a quiet, peaceable, inoffensive dog?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-13\">Objected to by plaintiff\u2019s counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-14\">Court overruled the objection, to which ruling of the court plaintiff\u2019s counsel at the time excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-15\">A. I should say he was an inoffensive dog.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-16\">And on cross-examination:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-17\">Q. Now what do you say about a dog that would run and jump over the fence and attack horses and spring at their heads and noses and cause them to run away, and run after them barking, what would you say about that kind of a dog, would that be a vicious dog in your opinion?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-18\">Objected to by defendant\u2019s counsel. .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-19\">Court overruled the objection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-20\">By Court: The Court has held that you were entitled to ask the witnesses as to the character of this dog as to whether peaceable, quiet character or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>not. This witness, however, answered this was not a vicious dog, that was his answer directly, and it seems to me that the cross-examination should be as broad as the testimony of the witness in chief. I think that that is proper cross-examination of such an answer as he was permitted to give in direct examination. The question may stand, to which ruling of the court the defendant\u2019s counsel at the time excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-6\">A. Well, I think likely I would.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-7\">By Court: In connection with this testimony on cross-examination, it is not for the purpose of giving the jury his opinion of this dog on trial, but simply cross-examination on his standards of opinion, it is all the time a question for the jury to determine whether or not this dog was vicious or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-8\">Q. What would you say about a dog in your opinion as to whether he was vicious or not who would run out upon the sidewalk and spring at a man and throw him down and catch hold of the man\u2019s coat with his teeth and hold him down till he was kicked off, in your opinion would that dog be a vicious dog?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-9\">Objected to by defendant\u2019s counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-10\">Court overruled the objection, to which ruling of the court the defendant\u2019s counsel at the time excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-11\">By Court: I will say that that is permitted by the court simply on the grounds that they have the right to ask the witness on cross-examination his standard of opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-12\">And also A. H. Jackson was called by defendants and testified as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-13\">Q. From your knowledge of the dog, what do you say as to his being a peaceable, quiet dog? A. I always judged he was, never saw anything to make me think otherwise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-14\">And on cross-examination as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b187-15\">Q. Would you say this dog was a quiet, peaceable dog if he would run out upon the highway and attack a man and force him to the ground and take hold of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>his shoulder and hold him there until he was kicked off?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-5\">Objected to by defendant\u2019s counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-6\">Court overruled the objection, to which ruling of the court the defendant\u2019s counsel at the time excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-7\">A. No, if I had known of such a thing as that, or convinced that such a thing took place, I wouldn\u2019t consider him a quiet dog.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-8\">Q. Would you say this dog was a quiet, peaceable dog, if he would run out, jump over the fence and run out at horses and teams, and spring at their heads and frighten them, would you say then he was a quiet dog and follow after them?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-9\">Objected to by defendant\u2019s counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-10\">By Court: I think this cross-examination should relate to the knowledge of the witness, the holding of the court is, you may cross-examine him on his opinion and what his opinion would be if he had knowledge of such things, I think you should adhere to that rule as laid down. The witness gives his opinion as to the dog, the court holds you may ask if he knew this, that or the other thing, I do not think that question is in proper form.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-11\">Plaintiff\u2019s counsel withdrew the question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-12\">Q. If you knew that this dog was in the habit of jumping out over a fence and springing at horses and jumping for their noses, barking and growling and frightening horses and causing them to run away, would you say he was a quiet, peaceable dog? .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-13\">Objected to by defendant\u2019s counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-14\">Court overruled the objection, to which ruling of the court the defendant\u2019s counsel at the time excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-15\">A. If I knew that to be the case, he did anything of that kind, I certainly wouldn\u2019t call him a quiet, peaceable dog.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-16\">By Court: That is admitted simply for the purpose of cross-examining this witness as to his opinion, not for the purpose of giving opinion of the dog in question, and should not be so considered by the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>\u00a13. C. Garver, one of the attorneys for the plaintiff, in argument to the jury made use of the following language, Avliich Avas objected to as noted:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-6\">\u201cNever before in my short experience of nearly eighteen years did I see that stubborn, unrelenting effort upon the part of mortal man to suppress truth and nothing but the truth, as Avas upon the part of the defendants in this case.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-7\">Col.

Bartlett: I take exceptions, if your honor please, to that last statement of counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-11\">Mr. Garver: They kneAV that if the truth was told in this case, though the heavens Avould fall, they could not escape a verdict at your hands. * * * That dog Avas alloAved to live only up to the time that they kneAV this case would have to be tried by a jury of tAvelve men.

One of the important things and one of the most important things in this case is: Did these defendants have notice? Fanny Hayes, out upon the grounds within 260 feet of the public highway, Avith this dog barking with that voice of his, as has been described to you, what do you say? Called back \u2014 \u201cCome back.\u201d The cries of that old man brought to his assistance one of the inmates of that house, the man that was upon the ground, and when that dog heard that familiar sound of the old man Elliget he knew enough to obey and to return.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-8\">Col.

From the time the testimony in this case was offered until the time when the feeble arguments are to close, Ave are to be stopped; stopped for why? I will tell you AAdiy. He thinks he Avill lure us from the point and the thread of our theme. I say that that was the purpose and the intention of counsel. When witnesses were testifying he was talking, and he objected, and objected, and objected, hoping that you would miss a part of this; that you would not be able to hear it all, and so it was from the mouth of that distinguished lawyer when anything hurt or cut deep: \u201cI object!\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b190-11\"><em>Bartlett </em>&amp; <em>Wilson </em>and <em>B.

And the witnesses answered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>as above, not that the particular conduct which they observed was \u201cquiet,\u201d \u201cpeaceable\u201d and \u201cgood-natured,\u201d and \u201cnot vicious,\u201d but that he was a dog of that character; and the facts sought to be ascertained by the cross-examination was what the witnesses meant by the terms \u201cquiet and peaceable,\u201d \u201cgoodnatured,\u201d and \u201cnot vicious.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-6\">The jury could not have been misled by this testimony, especially with these specific instructions given by the court at the time as' to the only purpose for which it was admitted, and for which it could only be considered by the jury. In fact, it was the province of the jury to pass upon the character of the dog after the witnesses in question had detailed all the facts to the jury for which the witnesses were called upon to give their respective opinions as to the character of the dog; and having done so, any cross-examination tending to test the witness\u2019 opinion was competent. 40 Ohio St., 376; 1 Greenleaf on Evidence, sec. 468; <em>Clipper </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>18 Ohio, 375; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Boggs, </em>20 Ohio St., 516.</p>\n<p data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-7\">The purpose of this cross-examination was not to establish the character of the dog, or for giving an opinion of the dog in question, but solely for testing the witness as to his opinion expressed- in chief. 8 O.

We are not even told whether counsel expected the court to make a ruling.</p>\n<p data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-6\">We especially direct the court\u2019s attention to the fact that the record does not show that counsel for defendants below directed the statements of his exceptions to the court, nor that the court\u2019s attention was ealled to them; and we insist that if there was any error in statements of Mr. Carver, that he did not save his exceptions by objecting thereto and asking the court to rule upon them. The presumption is that the court did its full duty, and if Col. Bartlett had asked the court for a ruling upon any objection, or for instructions to the jury upon any statement of Mr. Carver, the court would have complied with his request. <em>Warder et al. </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>58 Ohio St., 81; 19 Ohio. 300; 10 Ohio St., 223; 20 Ohio, 48; 22 Ohio St., 324.</p>\n<p data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-7\">Plaintiffs in error admit in their pleadings that Birchard A., Webb C. and Rutherford P.

C. D., 108; 15 C. C.

The defendants have earnestly and persistently kept this theory of the case before all the courts by motion, demurrer, answer and argument; and this is done with such evident sincerity that we think that this contention is entitled to consideration before we proceed to the matters on which we dispose of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The real foundation of an action like the one at bar is not the keeping or harboring of the animal, as was said in one of the courts below, for he may be kept as a watch dog for the protection of the keeper\u2019s person or property. Nor is it merely the keeping and harboring of the dog after knowledge\u00bb of his vicious and dangerous propensities and habits; for if he were cowardly, indolent and peaceable, he would not be of much service as a guardian of person or property. A person who has need for a watch dog, of necessity chooses one of more or less brute ferocity, and the law has never yet said that he may not lawfully keep such a protector by him; but the very qualities of the animal for such a purpose require that he shall be securely kept, so that injury may not result to innocent persons, who may be where they have a right to be and are in the pursuit of lawful purposes. Hence the gist of such an action as this is not the keeping of the dog with knowledge of his dangerous nature, but rather the negligent failure to properly restrain the animal, and to keep him so safely that he may not injure any one who is lawfully at the place.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Following this principle that the action is based on the negligent keeping, it has been laid down as the law, in many cases, that when it has been shown that the animal has been kept after knowledge of his dangerous character has been acquired, or circumstances from which the law would imply knowledge, and an injury has followed, this would be <em>prima facie </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>evidence of negligence. Ray on Imposed Duties, Personal, 618, 619; 2 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. Law (2nd ed.), 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">One may thus negligently keep and harbor a vicious dog, knowing him to be such, without being the owner of the animal; and he may thus keep and harbor a vicious dog without even owning or controlling the premises where he may be kept; and he may be chargeable with notice of the viciousness of the dog through his neglect to take notice of its vicious habits. Kn<em>owles </em>v. <em>Mulder </em>(Mich.), 16 Am. St. Rep., 627 and cases cited in note; <em>Brice </em>v. <em>Bauer, </em>2 Am. St. R., 454 and cases cited. It follows that there is nothing illogical, inconsistent, impracticable or illegal in charging two or more persons with negligently keeping and harboring a dog, with knowledge that he was vicious and dangerous. If the proof should sustain the charge as to all, the verdict and judgment would be against all. If the charge should be supported by the evidence as to some of the defendants and not as to others, the verdict and judgment should be against those so found guilty of the negligence charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">There is no misjoinder of defendants apparent on the face of the pleadings in this case; the rights of the several defendants were carefully guarded by the trial judge in submitting the case to the jury, and, although the evidence is rather weak as to some of the defendants, there is not a total want of evidence as to any, when the case is viewed in the light of the principles which we have here indicated. It is not the province of this court to weigh the testimony. We therefore find no error in the mode in which this suit was brought, nor in the joint judgment against all of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">Of the other errors alleged upon this record, three, ' at least, require especial attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">On the trial of the case in the common pleas court, one Charles J. Patterson was examined as a witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>in behalf of the defendants. On the cross-examination of this witness he was asked the following question:</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Q. Did you say to Amelia Kern on a week ago last Tuesday morning here in the court house, you don\u2019t want to say anything against Hayes\u2019, if they ask you if the dog was cross then you must say no, the reason they shut the dog up was because they would lay in the front room on the carpet in front of people, and if you didn\u2019t there, if you would stick to the Hayes\u2019s I would give you $10.00, $15.00 or $25.00, and if you stuck to Smiths you wouldn\u2019t probably get anything, you want to work for your own pocket book, did you say that to her?</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The answer of the witness was a denial, except that he admitted that he had told Amelia Kern, in answer to a question by her, Avhy the dogs were shut up. Amelia Kern was afterwards permitted, over an objection by defendants, to contradict Patterson. The ground on Avhich this testimony was admitted, as stated by the court, was that it tended to show prejudice or bias on the part of the witness; and the court especially cautioned-the jury that this testimony was not to be considered except as affecting the credit of the witness Patterson. There was no error in this. It is clearly within a well recognized exception to the rule as to evidence collateral t-o the issue. <em>Kent </em>v. <em>State, </em>42 Ohio St., 426; <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Hitchcock, 1 </em>Wels., Hurl., &amp; G., 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">A more serious question arises concerning the hypothetical questions propounded to the witnesses Lucy Keeler, George O. Harlan, William E. Lang and A. H. Jackson. The counsel for the defendants inquired particularly of each of these witnesses as to their actual knowledge of the dog, his habits, manner and conduct, and in every instance followed this line of inquiry with substantially this question: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>\u201cFrom your knowledge of the dog, what do you say as to his being a peaceable, quiet dog?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">It was said by Owen, J., delivering the opinion of this court in <em>Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Schultz, </em>43 Ohio St., 283; \u201cWhere it is practicable to place palpably before the jury the facts supporting their opinions, the witnesses should be restricted in their testimony to such facts, and the jurors left to form their opinions from these facts, unaided by the mere opinions of the witnesses.\u201d And see <em>Torpedo Co. </em>v. <em>Fishburn, </em>61 Ohio St., 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">But whether this question was properly permitted or not, it was asked and answered without objection from , the plaintiff, and the trial judge was right in holding that the cross-examination of these witnesses' should be as broad as the examination in chief. But the defendants complain that the cross-examination was allowed to be made much broader than the examination in chief; and we think that their contention is a just one. It is true that the trial judge, in overruling the objection to the question on the cross-examination of the witness Lang, remarked: \u201cIt is not for the purpose of giving the jury his opinion of this dog on trial, but simply cross-examination on his standards of opinion. It is all the time a question for the jury to determine whether or not this dog was vicious or not.\u201d . The questions which were allowed, however, went much further than to test the standards of the opinions which had been expressed by each of the witnesses. Each witness had expressly given his opinion of the disposition of the dog, as based on the actual knowledge of the witness. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel were not content to show that the witness had no knowledge of specific instances of conduct by the dog, which would indicate a different disposition from that testified to, \u00e1nd were not content to let the jury draw the inferences as to the weight to be allowed to the opinion of the witness, in view of such lack of a broader knowledge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>of the habits of the dog; but the plaintiff was per. mitted to assume a state of facts, not Avithin the knowledge of the witness, and upon that to demand of the non-expert witness, an opinion as to one of the material facts in issue in the case, a fact, too, as to which the testimony of experts was not competent. The question called for the hypothetical opinion of each witness so interrogated, in a matter which did not involve scientific knowledge or skill, and substituted that opinion for the deliberate judgment of the jury upon the sworn facts of the case. That was the effect of this line of inquiry, notwithstanding the reason given for it by the trial judge. This was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The defendants also insist that they were deprived of a fair trial by misconduct of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel on the argument to the jury. The facts are given in the statement and need not be repeated here. The language which was objected to is reprehensible to the last degree. It is none the less reprehensible and none the less inexcusable, because it Avas spoken by counsel of standing and ability. Thus spoken and passing unrebuked by the court, although the attention of the latter was frequently challenged by the counsel for defendants, it could not fail to impress itself on the jury as sanctioned by the character of the counsel and approved by the trial judge. Just and severe invective, which is supported by the testimony, is not improper. A generous latitude should be allowed to counsel; but the argument should always be decorous and should not impair the impartial administration of justice. Therefore, as it was held by the supreme court of North Carolina, in <em>Coble </em>v. <em>Coble, Admr., </em>79 N. C., 589, \u201cit is not within the privilege of counsel, in argument to a jury, to use language calculated to humiliate and degrade the opposite party in the eyes of the jury and by-standers, particularly when he has not been impeached.\u201d The charge that the defendants were engaged in a phe-&gt; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>nomenal effort to suppress the truth and that they had made use of their wealth for the express purpose of keeping out the truth, was a serious and uncalled for attack on the integrity of the defendants and their counsel; and it cannot he excused as a reference to the numerous objections to evidence which are apparent in the record, because it is the right of a party to make such objections, and it is not the right of his adversary to charge him with bad motives in doing so. Nor wall we hunt for excuses to palliate the impropriety of discussing evidence alleged to have been ruled out, or of stating or suggesting as facts matters which were objected to as not having been given in evidence, when the court sits mute, when appealed to expressly upon these points.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">\u201cIt may be laid down as law, and not merely discretionary, that when counsel\u2019grossly abuses his privilege to the manifest prejudice of the' opposite party, it is the duty of the judge to stop him then and there. If he fails to do so, and the impropriety is gross, it is good ground for a new trial.\u201d <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>N. C. Ore Dressing Co., </em>65 N. C., 563.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">\u201cNo duty incumbent on the judge of a trial court is more imperative, nor more important to the fair and orderly administration of justice, than that of interposing to restrain everything in the course of the trial that tends to mislead the jury and to divert their minds from the strict line of inquiry with which they are charged.\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>75 N. Car., 224; <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Trenton, </em>112 Mo., 390. \u201cThe courts have usually been very firm, whenever occasion has required, in confining counsel within proper and reasonable bounds to whatever is pertinent to the matter on trial. Statements of alleged facts not adduced in evidence, and comments thereon are irrelevant, not pertinent and are therefore clearly not within the privilege of counsel; and any such practice on the part of counsel should be promptly checked, especially when objected to by the other side.\u201d <em>Rolfe </em>v. <em>Rum-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number><em>ford, </em>66 Me., 566, citing <em>Berry </em>v. <em>State, </em>10 Ga., 511; <em>Mitchum </em>v. <em>State, </em>11 Ga., 615; <em>Bulloch </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>15 Ga., 395; <em>Dickerson </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>25 Ga., 225; <em>Wright-man </em>v. <em>Providence, </em>1 Clifford, 521, and <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Henniker, </em>41 N. H., 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">\u201cThat the practice complained of is highly reprehensible, no one can doubt. It ought in -every instance to be <em>promptly repressed. </em>For counsel to undertake by a side wind to get that in as proof which is merely eonjectur\u00e9, and thus to work a prejudice in the mind of the jury, cannot be tolerated. Nor ought the presiding judge to wait until he is called on to interpose. For it is usually better to trust to the discrimination of the jury as to what is, and what is not, in evidence, than for the opposite counsel to. move in the matter. For what practitioner has not regretted his untoward interference, when the counsel thus interrupted resumes. \u2018Yes, gentlemen, I have touched a tender spot, the galled jade will wince; you see where the shoe pinches!\u201d <em>Berry </em>v. <em>State, </em>10 Ga., 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">An apt illustration of the truth of the last quotation, and of the evil of non-interference by the court, is presented in that which took place in this case when the counsel made objection to certain statements of plaintiff\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">The record shows that the counsel for the defendants addressed his objections to the court at the time the improper language was spoken. The defendants, therefore, did not waive any of their rights; and, although it does not appear that the court then, or at any time, took any notice of the objections, the defendants had done all that they decently could do to obtain action by the court, and cannot be prejudiced by its failure or refusal to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">The distinction between this case and that of <em>The Warder, Bushnell &amp; Glessner Co. </em>v. <em>Jacobs, </em>58 Ohio St., 77, is that in this case we have a full record, embodying all of the evidence, the arguments of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>counsel, the charge of the court, ruling on the motion for new trial, etc., so that upon an inspection of the whole record there is no room for a presumption that the trial court did its duty in the premises. On the contrary it thus appears that the court took no notice of the objections raised by the counsel for defendants, and refused to rectify its error on the motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
