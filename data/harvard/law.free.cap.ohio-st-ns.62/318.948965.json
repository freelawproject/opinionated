In an action brought under such statute, to recover the penalty of five thousand dollars, for the death of a person caused by lynching, it is error for the court to charge the jury to the effect that if the collection of individuals, who lynched the deceased, had assembled without any unlawful purpose, and after-wards committed the acts of violence which resulted in the death of such person, the plaintiff could not recover, and that the verdict should be for the defendant.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b339-5\">5.

Church, as the administrator of Chas. W. Mitchell, deceased, filed a petition against the Board of Commissioners of Champaign county, under the \u201cAct for the Suppression of Mob Violence,\u201d passed April 10,1896 (92 O. L., 136), to recover five thousand dollars for the lynching of said Mitchell, at Urbana, in said county. Defendant demurred to the petition and the demurrer .was sustained by the court of common pleas and the petition dismissed. The circuit court reversed the judgment of the court of common pleas and the defendant then answered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-10\">The first defense contained in the answer of the defendant is a general denial, and the second defense alleges that the said act is repugnant to the constitution of Ohio. A demurrer to the second defense of the answer was sustained; and on the trial of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>case, the court gave to the jury the following special charge upon the request of the defendant: \u201cThe jury is charged, as a matter of law, that although you may find and believe from the evidence before you in this case, that said Charles W. Mitchell, referred to in the petition, suffered death at the hands of a collection of individuals in Champaign county, Ohio, on or about the 4th day of June, 1897; if you further find from the evidence that said collection of individuals did not assemble for any unlawful purpose, and did not intend to do damage or injury to any one, and did not pretend to exercise correctional power over other persons by violence, and without authority of law, at the time of assembling, but was or were, attracted and induced through motives of curiosity, and the events that had transpired around the court house yard and jail during the night and morning preceding, to meet and assemble together; and being thus assembled, without any unlawful purpose and not intending to do damage, or injury, to any one, or pretending to exercise correctional power over any other person or persons by violence and without authority of law, afterwards, committed the acts of violence resulting in the death of said Charles W. Mitchell, then the plaintiff in this case cannot recover, and your verdict should be for the defendant.\u201d And afterwards, in the general charge, the court instructed the jury, in part as follows: \u201cMuch has been said concerning the meaning of special charge No. 5, given on behalf of the defendant, and the court therefore deems it proper to instruct the jury that the meaning which you are to give to that charge is that, and I give it in the words of the charge itself, omitting the first introductory sentences, if, after being assembled, the collection of individuals referred to before, without any unlawful purpose having been formed and not intending to do damage or injury to any person, or pretending to exercise correctional power over any other person; committed the acts <em>o\u00ed </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>violence which resulted in the death of Charles W.

W. Caldwell brought his action, under the same statute, against the Board of County Commissioners of Cuyahoga County, to recover the sum of one thousand dollars for an injury which he alleged that he had received at the hands of a mob in that county, A demurrer to the petition, on the ground that the petition does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and that said act is unconstitutional, was sustained by the court of common pleas, and the judgment of the court of common pleas was affirmed by the circuit court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b341-6\">These cases came up on petitions in error to reverse the respective judgments of the circuit court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b341-7\"><em>T.

We think not. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>26 Mo., 429.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-5\">It follows, if our contention as to the construction of this statute is right, that the court correctly stated the law to the jury in said special charge No. 5 and if the court erred in its modification of said special charge in the general charge, it was error to the prejudice of the plaintiff in error therein, and not the defendant in error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-6\">The act is unconstitutional and void and in controvention of the following provisions of the Constitution of the State of Ohio. Article 1, Section 1. Bill of Rights. Article I, Section 5. Article II, Section 32. Article I, Section 16. Article I, Section 19. Article IV, Section 1. Article XII, Section 5.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-7\">And is repugnant to Article 14, Section 1 of the amendment to the constitution of the United States.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-8\">This was the first and only statute ever enacted by the legislature of Ohio prescribing a minimum amount of damages to be recovered, and no court in America, except the circuit court of Champaign county, Ohio, has ever yet held such a statute to be constitutional or valid. This statute also differs from all statutes of a similar nature passed in other states in many essential particulars.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b343-9\">The statute of April 10, 1896, is in violation of Article 1, Section 5 of the constitution.

The right to defend against the action to recovar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>money is as necessary as the right to defend one brought to recover specific real or personal property. <em>Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Rosser, </em>53 Ohio St., 24.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-4\">Deprivation of a remedy is equivalent to the deprivation of the right, which it is intended to vindicate, unless another remedy exists or is substituted for that which is taken away.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-5\">My property is as much imperiled by an action against me for money, as it is by an action against me for my lands or my goods. <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Blodgette, </em>155 Ill., 441.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b344-6\">All courts shall be open and every person, for an injury done him and his lands, goods, etc., shall have remedy by due course of law. <em>People ex rel </em>v. <em>Supervisors, </em>74 N.

Such power assimilates itself more closely to despotic rule than any other attribute of government. Erwin\u2019s Appeal, 16 Pa. St., 256; A. &amp; E.

The amount of the recovery is not a tax. It does not go into any public fund of the state or county. It is not a fund to be applied to any governmental expense which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>state, in the exercise of its police powers, may authorize. <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Vernon, </em>1 AM.

There are limitations upon the police power. The legislative judgment is not always conclusive. Statute passed in the exercise of police power must not be in conflict within any of the provisions of the state or federal constitutions. They must not, under the pretense of regulation, take from the citizen any of the essential rights and privileges which the constitution confers. Cooley\u2019s Const. Lim., 6 Ed., 710; Dillon Munc.

The amount of recovery is made to depend upon the extent of the injury received. And by fixing the amount of damages, if the injury be slight, in the sum of $500, or if serious in the sum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>of $1,000, or if resulting in permanent disability to earn a livelihood by manual labor in the sum of $5,-000, the legislature has left no room for construction or judicial interpretation of the statute. It has by plain and unambiguous language made the statute compensatory and measured the amount of recovery in damages in proportion to the injury received.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b350-4\">Our contention is strengthened by reference to sections 3 and 5 of the act, in both of which the amount of recovery is denominated \u201cdamages.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b350-5\">In the construction of this statute the familiar maxim <em>\u201cexpressio unkis est exclusio alterius \u201d </em>or as otherwise expressed, <em>\u201cexpressum facit taciturn,\u201d </em>applies with all its force.

If this statute is penal it does not appear from the words of the act, they express an intent quite to the contrary. <em>Waller </em>v. <em>Harries, </em>20 Wend., 562; <em>State </em>v. <em>Heman, </em>70 Mo., 441; Sutherland Stat.

The amendatory act has the same effect upon the original act as if the amended statute had been embodied in the original act of April 10th, 1896, at the time of its passage. 37- Ohio St., 275.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-6\">Statutes <em>in pari materia </em>are to be construed together, each legislative act is to be interpreted with reference to other acts relating to the same matter or subject.

What we did and do claim is that statutes in derogation of the common law and of common law right; statutes imposing taxes, spoliating and confiscating property, and civil damage acts, must receive, a strict construction and will not be extended by construction further than is indicated by the express terms of the law; statutes in modification or derogation of the common law will not be presumed to alter it further than is expressly declared. <em>Howe </em>v. <em>Newcombe, </em>146 Mass., 76; <em>Dean </em>v. <em>Railway, </em>199 N.

What would be compensation in one case would not apply in another.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b354-10\">Therefore, the legislature did not design that there should be any inquiry as to damages, but fixed an amount as absolute regardless of whether the next of kin were pecuniarily injured or not.

What, for instance, is the meaning of the phrase, \u201cto exercise correctional power,\u201d as found in section 1 ? What is the meaning and scope of the phrase, \u201cany act of violence,\u201d in that section? Is a man \u201clynched\u201d when a mob merely unlawfully touches him, and is one thus merely unlawfully touched by a mob to recover $500 under section 4? What is the meaning of the phrase \u201ctemporarily disabling,\u201d in section 2 ? Does it mean disabling for the period of one hour, or one day, or for one, two or five years? And is it a disability of such uncertain and indefinite duration for which section 4 confers the right to recover of a county a thousand dollars? What is the meaning of the phrase, \u201cby voilence,\u201d as used in section 1? How much violence does that phrase imply? Are all degrees of violence equally \u201clynching,\u201d for which under section 4, a party may recover from $500 to $5000? This statute is punitive and penal in its character. The sums recoverable therein are absolutely forfeited, if the conditions of recovery exist. Neither more nor less than the amount stated in the statute can be recovered. Such a notion as that of the measure of damages has no place whatever in this statute. A statute which imposes a forfeiture must be clear, and the intention manifest. <em>Bond </em>v. <em>Swearinger, </em>1 Ohio, 395; <em>State ex rel. Brickman, 7 </em>C. C., 165; 3 C.

Section 2828 fixes the maximum rate of taxation for county purposes, beyond which county commissioners may not go in the levying of taxes; but section 7 of the act in question provides that \u201can order to the commissioners of any county against which such recovery may be made, to include the same, with cost of action, in the next succeeding tax levy for said county, shall form a part of the judgment in every such case.\u201d There is no provision for paying the amount of these recoveries by installments, but the entire aggregate the statute requires to be put into the next succeeding tax levy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b362-4\">The statute in question may become unenforceable by reason of the aggregate amounts of recoveries against a county equalling or exceeding the entire tax duplicate of the county.</p>\n<p data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b362-5\">This statute opens a wide door for the perpetration of frauds upon the counties of this state and is, therefore, against public policy and void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b362-6\">Under this legislation by conspiracy three or more persons (\u201ca collection of individuals\u201d) might assemble for the unlawful purpose of making an assault upon one of their own number, in order that the injured party might maintain an action against the county for $500 or $1000, as the case may be, and then divide the spoils among the conspirators, it being practically impossible to ever discover the fact of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b362-7\">Sections 3 and 4 provide for the recovery of certain fixed and definite sums for the injuries therein mentioned, and that too without any reference whatsoever to the actual damages sustained, The statute contemplate no such idea as that of the measure. Taxation is a mode of taking private property. Section 19 of the bill of rights provides that, \u201cPrivate property shall ever be held inviolate, but subservient to the public welfare.\u201d This statute takes private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>property and makes it subservient to private welfare. <em>Weismer </em>v. <em>Village of </em>Douglas, 64 N.

If this sum is to be regarded as a fine upon the county, it is grossly excessive, and hence, in violation of Sec. 9, Art. 1 of the Ohio constitution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-6\">Section 8 of the act is a section which defines a crime, but omits to fix any penalty, whatsoever, leaving the matter of penalty wholly to the discretion of the court. Such legislation is clearly unconstitutional for several reasons. 1st. It is an attempt to clothe a court with legislative power, that is power to fix penalties for crimes, which is contrary to article 2, section 1 of the Ohio constitution, which provides as follows: Legislative power cannot be delegated. <em>Railroad Company </em>v. Commissioners, 1 Ohio St., 77; 14 Amendment, Fed. Const., and 10 Met, (Mass.), 26; 4 Ohio N. P. Reports, 251; 6 Dec., 367.</p>\n<p data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-7\">At common laiv a county cannot be held liable for the negligence or other wrongful acts of its officers. <em>Commissioners </em>v. <em>Mighels, </em>7 Ohio St., 110; <em>Western </em>College, <em>etc., </em>v. <em>City of </em>Cleveland, 12 Ohio St., 377.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b363-8\">Davis, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AbCa\">These cases require a decision of the question whether \u201cAn act for the Suppression of Mob Violence,\u201d passed April 10,1896 (92 O. L., 136), is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">It is argued that the provisions of this statute contravene article one of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States, and are also repugnant to the constitution of Ohio; because they violate the right of trial by jury, because they authorize the taking of property without due process of law, because they are a violation of private rights, of property, because they are an exercise of judicial functions by the legislature, and because the object <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>and purposes of the statute are not within the taxing power.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">In the ardor of attack, it seems to have been overlooked that the constitution extends its protection over individuals, as well as counties and municipal corporations. Even a criminal has some rights which cannot be forfeited. Every person who is accused of crime, is guaranteed a fair trial; and he cannot be deprived of life or liberty without due process of law. The faith of the body politic is pledged to make good the constitutional guarantees to the individual. To the counties and municipal corporations are delegated, in large measure, the duties of local administration. Within their jurisdiction they stand in the place of the state, in enforcing the laws, and in protecting the life, the liberty and the property of the citizen. If a large number of the people of any county become imbued with the lynching spirit, or negligent and indifferent to the due and orderly enforcement of the laws, so that lawless men may act with impunity, then there is no course for the state to take, other than to intervene and directly protect the individual, as well as to enforce upon the community the observance of good order/</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The power of the state to do this cannot well be questioned. What is known as the police power is based on the public safety, the public health and morals, and the general welfare; and it is, therefore, as broad as these conditions may require. In this respect, as in other respects, the power of the legislative branch of the state government is plenary, except as it may be specifically and clearly limited in the constitution. Within these limitations the legislature may prescribe such laws, sanctioned by fines, penalties, forfeitures or damages, as will enforce the observance of the peace and dignity of the state, and compensate the injured party; for, unfortunately the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>public conscience is oftentimes more easily quickened in this way than by teaching and persuasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Now as to the alleged violation of the right of trial by jury, it may well be doubted whether counties and municipalities have any such absolute right of trial by jury that they may complain of its infringement by the legislature. They are creatures of constitutional and legislative enactment. They have only such powers and privileges as are given them, and these powers and privileges may, in general, be modified or taken away.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">But cases like these need not be disposed of on that ground. The contention is that the statute deprives the defendant of the right to have the amount to be paid assessed by a jnry as damages. A county or municipality can no more complain of this statute as an infringement npon the right of trial by jury, than the man who has been tried by a jury and found guilty of a crime, can complain that the law under which he is tried does not provide that the jury shall assess the amount of his fine, or adjudge the extent of his imprisonment. The primary purpose of the legislature was punishment and correction. The expressed object of the law is \u201cthe suppression of mob violence.\u201d That the legislature might, in the exercise of the police power, fix the amount of a penalty without the intervention of a jury was lo.ng ago decided by this court in <em>Cincinnati, Sandusky and Cleveland Railroad Company </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>37 Ohio St., 265. And this being so, it is of no concern to the party paying the penalty, to whom the state, in its sovereignty, may pay it. It may well, as under this statute, turn the money over to those who suffer by the act of lynching. In this respect, it makes no difference whether in the statute it be called penalty, or compensation, or damages. Nor does it alter the case that the amount is fixed, that is, determined by the statute, as in this case; or Oiat it is to be found by a jury. Nor yet does it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>matter that it is declared to be \u201cfor the suppression of mob violence,\u201d as in this case, or \u201cfor compensating parties whose property may be destroyed in consequence of mobs or riots,\u201d as in the statute which was upheld in <em>Darlington </em>v. <em>The Mayor, etc., </em>31 N. Y.. 187; because the imposition of any amount by authority of the state is, in either case, essentially penal and corrective in its nature. The party paying the money so recovered, that is, as a penalty, has no right to complain that the sovereign pays it over to the person injured, or pays it for the benefit of the minor children of a person suffering death by lynching, or to the next of kin of such person; nor that the sovereign provides that \u201csuch recovery shall not be regarded' as a part of the estate of the person lynched, nor be subject to any of his liabilities.\u201d Nor is it a matter which can be put in issue for trial by jury; for the legislature does not authorize, nor attempt, a compensation of the injury according to the measure of the injury, to be settled on an inquirj of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">We have dwelt on this phase of the law more than we have thought necessary, because it is the source of the main contention in these cases. We shall very briefly advert to the remaining questions presented for our consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">In the nature of things, the limitations of the taxing power are not ordinarily, nor necessarily, limitations on the police power; but the matter is set at rest for the cases at bar, by the constitution itself, which provides as follows: \u201cThe commissioners of counties, the trustees of townships, and of other similar boards, shall have such power of local taxation, for police purposes, as may be prescribed by law.\u201d <em>Const., Art. </em>x, <em>See. 7. </em>This court held in <em>Sessions </em>v. <em>Crunkilton et al., </em>20 Ohio St., 349, 358, that when local taxation is exercised for purposes which are demanded by, or are conducive to, <em>public </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>health, convenience, or <em>welfare, </em>it is within the constitutional meaning of \u201cpolice purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">From what has been said, it will appear that this statute does not authorize, nor attempt, the taking of private property for a private use, nor even the taking of private property for a public use in the exercise of the right of eminent domain. It authorizes the recovery of a penalty against the county, and authorizes an order to be made on the commissioners of the county, to include the same in the next succeeding tax levy. This, as we have seen, the legislature has power to enact, under the general police power, the general taxing power, and Sec. 7, Art x, of the constitution. Hence section 19 of article. 1 of the constitution does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">Again, this legislation is not an exercise of judicial power; because it does not adjudicate any transaction, case, or controversy, which arose before its enactment, and of which the judicial tribunals might have been cognizant. It provides what shall be the law, binding upon the judicial department, after its enactment; and is not, in any sense, a trespass upon the province of the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Having disposed of the foregoing objections to the statute, Ave assume that the contention that it provides for the taking of property without due process of laAV, is already sufficiently answered. Many other questions have been raised and discussed. They are all such as might well have been addressed to the legislature; but they cannot be considered here. We conclude that the act is constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">On the trial of the case of <em>Church, Adm., etc., </em>v. <em>The Commissioners of Champaign County, </em>in the common pleas court, the court charged the jury in substance, that if the collection of persons who lynched Mitchell, had assembled without any unlawful purpose, and afterwards committed the acts of violence Avhich resulted in the death of Mitchell, the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>tiff could not recover, and the verdict should be for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">The court afterwards made an explanation of this instruction; but the explanation did not explain, especially since the court instructed the jury that such unlawful purpose or design may be formed either before or at the time of assembling, \u201cor it may be formed <em>with the agreement </em>of mutual assistance after they have assembled,\u201d and that, \u201cno formal or express agreement need be proved to establish such unlawful purpose, but it may be inferred from all the facts and circumstances proved in the case and its existence and the time of its formation are questions of fact for the jury.\u201d And the court not only refused to instruct the jury, as requested by the plaintiff, that the fact that Mitchell was lynched was evidence that the individuals who lynched him intended to lynch him; but instead, the court charged the jury that the lynching of Mitchell might be considered as evidence of the unlawful intent; and also charged that such lynching did not raise a presumption of law that they assembled with that intent. The charge when all taken together, seems, very plainly, to have told the jury that if the crowd came together with an innocent purpose, and afterwards lynched Mitchell, they would not be a mob unless they had specifically agreed to be' a mob, after they had assembled. This charge is not merely seriously misleading. It is erroneous. It is an ancient doctrine in the criminal law, as old as Hale\u2019s Pleas of the Crown, at least, that, although the assembly was lawful, the persons assembled might unite in unlawful conduct and thus become rioters.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">In <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Commissioners of Cuyahoga County, </em>a demurrer to the petition was sustained in the court of common pleas, and the petition was dismissed. This judgment was affirmed by the circuit court. Besides the constitutional objections which we have already considered, the counsel for the commissioners <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>urge that the petition is defective, because the plaintiff therein avers that he was struck by \u201ca heavy glass insulator thrown at him by one of the mob,\u201d and was \u201cshort through the leg with a leaden bullet, fired from a revolver in the hands of some of the mob.\u201d It is argued that as the shooting was done by a, pistol in the hands of one person, and as the glass insulator was thrown by one person, it does not appear that the specific acts which occasioned the plaintiff\u2019s injuries were the acts of a \u201ccollection of individuals\u201d or a \u201cmob.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">We do not think that there is much force in this argument. It is clearly alleged in the petition that the plaintiff and his fellow workmen were assaulted by a collection of individual's, who had assembled\u2018/or an unlawful purpose, and tried to exercise correctional power over the plaintiff and his fellows, without any authority of law; and that thus and thereby the plaintiff suffered a lynching at the hands of said mob.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The petition contains a sufficient statement of a cause of action against the county, under the statute in question; and the details which are set forth in the petition are not inconsistent with the more general averments contained therein. The demurrer should have been overruled. We have carefully considered all of the arguments and authorities which counsel have submitted, and we are thoroughly satisfied with the foregoing conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">In <em>Commissioners </em>v. <em>Church, </em>administrator of Mitchell, the judgment of the circuit court is</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">In <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Commissioners, </em>the judgment of the circuit court and the judgment of the court of common pleas, are <em>Reversed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
