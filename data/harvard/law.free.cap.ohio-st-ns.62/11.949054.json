But after the construction of the improvement, when a defect dangerous to travel in a street, arising from such construction or the impairment thereof, is brought to the notice of the corporation, it becomes its ministerial duty, under the statute, to remove the defect, and a neglect or a refusal to remove the defect after such notice would make the corporation liable for an injury resulting therefrom.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b31-9\"><em>2. </em>A pedestrian who, without necessity and for his own pleasure and convenience, departs from the sidewalks and street crossings, upon which he would have avoided injury, and crosses a street intersection diagonally, and is injured by slipping into a catch-basin which lay between the crossings, must be held to have assumed the risks which lay in the path which he thus chooses.</headnotes>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b31-10\">(Decided February 20, 1900.)</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-11\">Error to the Circuit Court of Montgomery county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-12\">This action was begun by Charles H. Taylor in the court of common pleas of Montgomery county, and since its commencement he has died, and his administrator has been made a party and prosecutes the action. The amended petition upon which the action was tried alleges that prior to the 13th of December, 1892, at which time the plaintiff received the injuries complained of, the defendant constructed a catch-basin on the southeast corner of Pierce and Hawker streets; that the top of the curb at the corner of the street and on either side of the line <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>of the street crossing, was about sixteen inches above the bottom of the gutter; that there was a sudden and dangerous inclination of the ground around the catch-basin for a distance of about ten feet that extended on either side of the line of the street crossing and to the mouth of the catch-basin; and that on the date mentioned the catch-basin Avas open and unprotected; that on the night of said day there was no light of any kind at or near the said street crossing; that the manner in Avhich the catch-basin Avas constructed, the sudden and unnecessary fall given to the ground around the catch-basin, permitting the mouth of the same to remain open and unprotected, and the fact that there was no light at or near the crossing, all of which defendant knew and caused and permitted to remain in said condition, made it dangerous and unsafe for persons to travel on said street. Plaintiff also alleged that on the night of the 13th of December, 1892, while he was traveling along said Pierce street on his way home, without any fault or negligence on his part, he was precipitated against the top of and into said catch-basin, whereby he was seriously injured and sues for damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b32-5\">The defendant, in answer to the amended petition, admitted that it had constructed a catch-basin at the southeast corner of Pierce and Hawker streets prior to the 13th of December, 1892, and that on the night of said day the plaintiff was traveling on foot on Pierce street and fell and hurt himself at the corner of Pierce and Hawker streets, and denies each and every other allegation in the petition contained. Defendant also alleges that it caused the said catch-basin, curbs, gutters and street crossing to be constructed in a careful, prudent and workman-like manner, placed the same in condition safe for pedestrians and caused the same to be so kept, and they were so kept on said night of December 13, 1892, and that said city was not in any degree negligent in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>regard to said catch-basin, curbs, gutters or crossing, and in no way contributed to the plaintiff\u2019s accident; and that said accident was entirely due to the plaintiff\u2019s own carelessness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-6\">In reply, the plaintiff denied that the city of Dayton constructed the catch-basin, curbs, and street crossing in a careful manner, placed the same in a \u25a0condition safe for persons traveling on the street, and denies that they were so on that night. He \u25a0denies that he was well acquainted with the corner and catch-basin and knew them to be unsafe or dangerous, and denies that he was careless.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-7\">On the trial of said action in the court of common pleas the defendant requested the court to give the following special charge to the jury, to-wit: \u201cIf you find that the plaintiff departed from the sidewalk and way provided by the city for pedestrians, he assumed the risk of what might happen to him; and if you find from the evidence that the accident would not have happened if plaintiff had stayed upon the \u25a0sidewalk and had crossed Hawker street at the regular sidewalk crossing, and that plaintiff\u2019s act in \u2022crossing catacorner from one corner of Pierce and Hawker streets to the other where the catch-basin is, was the proximate cause of the accident, your verdict will be for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-8\">This was refused by the court and the defendant excepted. The verdict being for the plaintiff, the defendant filed a motion for new trial, which was overruled. A petition in error was filed in the cir\u25a0cuit- court and the judgment of the court of common pleas was affirmed. The action is now brought in \u25a0this court to reverse the judgments of the circuit court and of the court of common pleas.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b33-9\"><em>Edwin P.

It is sufficient, however, if the streets are kept in reasonably safe condition for the ordinary modes of travel. It is impossible to so conceive a plan of construction, and to so carefully maintain it, that injuries may not happen on the streets to heedless persons; and therefore cities and villages are not held liable as insurers against accidents occurring upon their streets, and are held only to the exercise of reasonable caution and foresight in providing for the use of the streets in the ordinary modes, and with ordinary care, by the traveler.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">The defect complained of in this case was a catch-basin for surface water, at the intersection of two streets. There is no evidence that it was imperfectly constructed or improperly placed, or that it had become defective and dangerous since its construction, It was located at a corner of the intersection so that it was out of the traveled path of pedestrians, and it was so constructed, with a projecting top stone, that persons driving upon the street, and exercising ordinary care would no\u2018t be liable to accident from it. It was similar to other catch-basins in the city f.nd was built after plans and specifications prepared in the city engineer\u2019s office, and was inspected and accepted by that officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">Rut it is the plaintiff\u2019s allegation \u201cthat the manner in which said catch-basin was constructed, the &amp;udden and unnecessary fall given to the ground around the said catch-basin, they permitting the mouth of the same to remain open and unprotected, and the fact that there was no light at or near the said crossing * * * made it dangerous and unsafe for persons to travel on said streets.\u201d The mere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>existence of tlie facts, that there was a sharp inclination of the ground to the catch-basin for the distance of ten feet, that the opening at the curb had neither screen nor .bars over it, and that the height of the curb from, the bottom of the gutter to the top of the catch-basin was sixteen inches, does not constitute negligence;. and there was no evidence to show that these were not-necessary conditions to the successful operation of the catch-basin. Indeed, there was some testimony directly to the contrary. Yet, however, these facts may be, appliances for drainage are necessary, and the manner in which drainage may be accomplished, if at all, is peculiarly within the discretion of the municipality, and it cannot be called to account by the courts respecting its errors of judgment in the plan of a public improvement. <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Cincinnati, </em>19 Ohio St., 21, 22. But, according to many authorities, it would be held liable for negligence in carrying out the plan. At least, in Ohio, it cannot be doubted that if, after the construction of an improvement according to a plan and specifications adopted by the municipal authorities, notice should be brought home to the municipality that a street was not reasonably safe for use under ordinary circumstances, by reason of a faulty construction of the improvement, it would become a ministerial duty of the corporation to remove the defect, and a failure or refusal to do so after such notice, would make it liable to respond in damages for an injury resulting from the defect. <em>City of Circleville </em>v. <em>Sohn, </em>59 Ohio St., 285. If it be conceded that such a defect existed here, there is an entire absence of proof that the corporation was aware of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Nor does it appear that the absence of a light at that point contributed in any degree to the plaintiff\u2019s injury. If he had followed the ordinary traveled'way for pedestrians, he would not have come in contact with the catch-basin, which was situated between the street crossings at the southeast corner of the inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>section of Pierce and Hawker streets. Without any necessity therefor, so far as appears in the record, and solely for his own pleasure and convenience, he left the sidewalk at the northwest corner of the street intersection and went diagonally across Hawker street to the southeast corner, where, using the plaintiff\u2019s own language, he \u201cwalked right into the basin.\u201d It is very clear, however, that he did not walk into, nor fall into, the catch-basin; for owing to the form of its construction, that could not be. It was raining and freezing, and the street was slippery. He must have fallen and slipped into the basin. The only way in which he could have gotten his leg into the opening was by sliding. It does not appear that it was the absence of a light which caused him to fall and slide into the catch-basin; but it does appear that he was out of the ordinary traveled way for pedestrians, that there was no necessity for being out of the way, and that if he had kept on the sidewalk and crossings, he would have avoided the injury. He was not exercising ordinary care for his own safety, under the circumstances; and in departing from the usual and safe way which the municipality had provided for him, he assumed all of the risks which lay in the path which he chose for himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">We, therefore, hold that the court of common pleas erred in refusing to instruct the jury as requested by the defendant, and erred also in overruling the motion of the defendant for a new trial. For these errors, the judgment of the common pleas court and the judgment of the circuit court in affirming the same, are reversed and the cause is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
