Patton, doing business under the firm name of the Patton Manufacturing Company, commenced its action aginst him, in that form, in the Franklin common pleas, and such action was pending, on issue joined therein, until July 2, 1896, when the plaintiff therein recovered a judgment against Alexander G. Patton for the sum of $1,631.34, with interest thereon, from the date thereof, and costs. That term of the common pleas began April 7, 1894.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-5\">Between the 1st and the 14th days of May, 1896, the bank took actual possession and control of said real estate and thereafter retained the same until the sale thereof under the order of said common pleas court, Alexander G. Patton had been in possession thereof from October 31, 1891, pursuant to the stipulation in said instrument.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-6\">On May 14, 1896, the bank having held said deed from the date of its delivery unrecorded, the property, therein described, was transferred on the duplicate in the county auditor\u2019s office, and on the 18th day of that month the deed was filed with the county recorder and was thereafter duly recorded in the record of deeds of said county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-7\">On May 18, 1896, after the filing of the deed for record, the property and business of said Patton went into the hands of receivers under the orders of different courts, in fact, of the courts of different states, and still remain in the hands of receivers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-8\">The company had no knowledge of the deed before it was filed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b588-9\">On September 17, 1896, execution issued on said judgment in favor of the company and a levy thereof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>was declared and returned by the sheriff as made on the real estate described in said deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-5\">Pursuant to an order of the common pleas court said lands were sold for the sum of $19,370.00 and the proceeds of such sale brought into that court and distributed, except about $2,300.00 retained to meet the issue on the subject of distribution, raised and pending between the bank and the company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-6\">At the date of said levy of execution Mr. Patton had no other property subject to levy of execution. The unpaid balance of the bank\u2019s $25,000 claim, after the partial distribution, was and is some $7,000, and the judgment of the company was and is wholly unpaid. The bank claims the undistributed fund, $2,299.36, by virtue of its deed. The company as against said instrument, claims a preference, or first lien on said fund, to the extent of its judgment, interest and costs. \u2019 ,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-7\">The issue was heard in the common pleas and decided in favor of the company. On appeal to the circuit court the same judgment was rendered, and the bank now brings the record here seeking to reverse the judgment of the circuit court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b589-8\"><em>J. T. Holmes, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-9\">The issue between the bank and the company may be stated in various forms; it comes down at last, however, upon the undisputed facts, to a question which may be thus framed:</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-10\">Did the legal title to the premises described in the deed of Patton and wife pass, by force of its terms and provisions, into the National Bank of Columbus?</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-11\">The bank affirms; the company denies.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b589-12\">Or thus:</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Did the company\u2019s judgment against Patton become a lien on the real estate described in the deed to the bank as of the first day of the April term, towit, April 7, 1896?</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-4\">The company affirms; the bank denies.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-5\">If the bank held the legal title to the lands, under favor of the deed, the lien of the judgment in favor of the company against Patton did not, and could not, attach thereto for that, such liens affect legal titles only; they do not attach to equitable rights or titles.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-6\">If the bank held the legal title to the land, on the issues made by the pleadings and the facts, whether or when its deed was recorded, or not, is wholly immaterial, and it is entitled to the fund as its property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-7\">If it did not hold the legal title under the deed; if the fee simple remained in Patton and the instrument was an ordinary mortgage, then the company\u2019s judgment became a lien on the land as of April 7, 1896, and has passed with its precedent character to and now obtains against the fund.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-8\">The deed to the bank has some of the features of a mortgage, but it is more than a mortgage by its terms and provisions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-9\">The bank took the fee with full power to convey it to a purchaser at either public or private sale under sis months\u2019 notice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b590-10\">The instrument of conveyance is not in the general or the special form of a power merely to sell real estate. There is no mention or provision of such a power, as a power, in the deed. In other words, it is important to note that the power to sell is not conferred as a specific thing. It passed to the bank with, and as one of the inherents of, the fee and in no other form can it be found actively and actually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>Tested in the grantee. That it was so Tested cannot he successfully gainsaid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-5\">If the six months\u2019 notice was an indispensable condition precedent to the exercise of the power of sale, then, it is true that the bank could not exercise it after the first day of May, 1896, for want of time within which to give the notice. This fact did not affect the title held by the bank, howeTer; it did not 'reimvest Patton with any part of the fee, or with any part of the power to conTey the fee, which had passed to the bank.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-6\">A mortgagee, strictly so-called, in Ohio, has no power to conTey the fee of the mortgagor\u2019s property pledged to him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-7\">The mortgagor holds the legal title, at least until condition broken, and his interest is liable to leTy and sale on execution. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Rittenhouse, </em>15 Ohio St., 314; <em>McArthur </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>16 Ohio St., 206.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-8\">The doctrine that a mortgagor\u2019s interest in mortgaged property is subject to leTy and sale under execution is of long standing in this state. <em>Ely </em>v. <em>McGuire, </em>2 Ohio, 223; <em>Phelps </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>Id., 244; <em>Miami, etc., Co. </em>v. <em>Bank; W., </em>249; <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>10 Ohio, 71.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-9\">This has be\u00e9n because the mortgagor, as the cases show, has been held to retain the legal title to the mortgaged premises.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-10\">As will appear in the discussion, much stress will be laid on three words of this paragraph, to-wit, \u201cnull and Toid.\u201d They will be treated again and again as though their force obliterated from the document the words which follow immediately, commencing with the copulative conjunction \u201cand.\u201d They were appropriate words, not strong enough to cut down the title which had passed in trust to the bank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>and destroy the provision and the necessity for a re-conveyance, but, to operate as a check on the grantee in the hands of the grantor whenever, if ever, he should pay the debt. Then he could say to the bank: \u201cYou now have no beneficial right in my property; you hold nothing except the naked title in fee, the trust around which has been hulled off. I want my property.\u201d On the transaction in such position, this language would have lain in the grantor\u2019s mouth, put there by the legal effect of express stipulation \u201cnull and void,\u201d and he could, upon declination or hesitation, have gone into equity to enforce the return of the title which the stipulation provided should be re-conveyed to him. <em>Roads </em>v. Symmes, 1 Ohio, 281; <em>Jackman </em>v. <em>Hallock, </em>1 Ohio, 318; <em>Baird </em>v. <em>Kirtland, </em>8 Ohio, 21.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-4\">Although there were two instruments in this 8 Ohio case, it is exactly in point, on the legal or equitable <em>status, </em>with the case at bar. <em>Loring </em>v. <em>Melendy, </em>11 Ohio, 355; <em>Haynes </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>5 Ohio St., 253; <em>Gorrell </em>v. <em>Kelsey, </em>40 Ohio St., 117.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-5\">The case of <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Alter, </em>42 Ohio St., 94, in one view comes quite near to the case at bar in its facts and its law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-6\">If the legal title to this property was in Colonel Patton and never passed to the bank, the lien of the judgment, in legal effect, is, as already stated, substantially as defined by the company\u2019s pleading.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b592-7\">What conld the sheriff have sold under the execution which he attempted to levy, by virtue of the company\u2019s judgment, in September, 1896? The situation was widely different from that of a levy by the judgment creditor in the <em>Martin-Alter </em>case. There he would have levied on the legal title and upon sale would have passed the legal title to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>lands to a purchaser. Here the fee had passed as part of the security and, as in <em>Baird </em>v. <em>Kirtland, supra, </em>it was beyond the reach of a legal lien. If the fee had passed to the bank, for its protection, it was beyond an execution, and the omission to record the deed could not change its character or prejudice the holder. A purchaser of the real estate, after six months from the execution and delivery of the deed, might obtain a prior right by obtaining and recording his deed, but a judgment creditor is not in any sense such purchaser. <em>Tousley </em>v. <em>Tousley, </em>5 Ohio St., 78.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-5\">\u2019 If we are not in error, the reported case in Ohio, which comes nearest in principle to the case at bar, is <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Way, </em>16 Ohio, 469; <em>Birchard </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>11 Ohio St., 84.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-6\">A trust is created in our deed. As already suggested, it related to \u2014 embraced\u2014something, and that something was the fee, the legal title, for the benefit and protection of the bank, the trustee. It was something which, under the notice, the bank could, without additional conveyance to it, have conveyed to a public or private purchaser, as its grantee; it had that thing when the trust deed was delivered to it and at no time forfeited or aliened it and that thing was to be re-deeded to Patton, his heirs and assigns, on payment of the debt. Such a posture of the legal title was regarded by the parties to the trust deed as necessary to the protection of the trustee. <em>Rife </em>v. <em>Geyer, </em>59 Pa. St., 393.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-7\">One looked in vain through the discussion of counsel for authority or reasoning which showed that Patton held, or had power, after 1891, to grant the fee of the property. 26 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. Law, 860.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-8\">The deed, the title, in the case at bar fall within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>the first class mentioned by Judge Dillon. It was a parting with the fee to the trustee absolutely for the purpose of raising a fund to pay the debt. The debt was past due and expressly not extended or to be extended. The limitation of notice did not qualify the title held and which the bank\u2019s deed would have conveyed to a purchaser. <em>Woodruff </em>v. <em>Robb, </em>19 Ohio, 212; <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Mackall, </em>5 Ohio St., 130; <em>Kemper </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>44 Ohio St., 210; 2 Pom. Eq., Sec. 995.</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-4\">The bank had paid and Patton had received its $25,000, good and lawful money. In the light of the facts as they then appeared to bank and grantors and as they appear from the standpoint of the present time, the bank was entitled to the fee in equity and justice and if under notice it could have sold and conveyed it, in law it took the fee to the property for all the purposes of the trust created and declared by the deed, and Patton held nothing that could be liened by a judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-5\">The case at bar does not fall within the definition of the judge, page 423 of the opinion, in <em>Sun Fire Office </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>53 Ohio St., where he says:</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-6\">\u201cThe mortgage being simply a security for the debt, is extinguished by its payment without- any reconveyance.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-7\">As' germane to more than one phase of our case, I stop to quote at this point the definition entire of the last Law Dictionary issued from the press.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-8\">1 Bouvier. \u201cDefeasance.

No case is recalled in which this court has made itself more definite and certain than in <em>Arnold </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>1 Ohio, 467.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b595-5\">The books say that technical accuracy applies the words \u201cnull and void\u201d io contracts that are of no effect whatever. <em>Van Schaack </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>36 Iowa, 203.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b595-6\">The legal effect of the \u201cnull and void\u201d clause in this deed was to render the deed inoperative and set in motion the right to the reconveyance provided for when and if the debt was paid in full.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b595-7\">Under the maxim <em>noscitur a sociis </em>\u201cnull\u201d and \u201cvoid\u201d are equivalents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b595-8\">Null is defined \u201cof no legal force or effect; void.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b595-9\">Void is defined \u201chaving no legal force; entirely null; incapable of .confirmation or ratification.\u201d Standard Dictionary; <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Ins.

Standing in a context, where that effect is not demanded by judicial determination, they must be read with the context and given that force and effect, and that only, which their collocation and \u201cthe four corners\u201d of the written instrument authorize and require, under the rules of construction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b596-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>The authorities and cases touching the \u201cnull and void\u201d feature of the deed, in connection with the re-conveyance condition, leave it clearer, if that he possible, that they may easily stand together, and each must be given its appropriate meaning, purpose and office in the instrument.</p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b596-4\">Technically, as we have seen, the words, under the definitions and cases, do not apply, and, under the rule tersely expressed in the New Hampshire case requiring that they be taken in a legal sense subject to large qualifications in view of all the circumstances calling for their application, and the rights and interests to be affected in a given case, and under the rule of interpretation that \u201can instrument must be so construed, if practicable, that the whole may stand; <em>ut res magis valeat, quam </em>pereat\u201d; <em>Ashland Mut.

Most of them are grouped in 1 Bates\u2019 Complete Digest, Columns 488-492.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b596-6\">Two or three citations may not be inappropriate, however. <em>Chamberlain </em>case, 15 Ohio St., 24B; <em>Mc-Clelland </em>v.

The debate will be over their application. The crucial point lies here; is the instrument a deed of trust or a mortgage? Did the legal title pass to the bank in trust, or remain in the grantors? <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>59 Ohio St., 80.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ALb\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number><em>Booth, Keating &amp; Peters, </em>and <em>.James M.

The following shows how clearly an eminent text-writer has summed up the Ohio doctrine: 1 Jones on Mortgages, pp. 393, 395, sec. 465; <em>Building Association </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>43 Ohio St., 427; <em>Betz </em>v. <em>Snyder, </em>48 Ohio St., 492; <em>Mayham </em>v. <em>Coombs, </em>14 Ohio, 429; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Luce, </em>14 Ohio, 514;; <em>White </em>v. <em>Denman, </em>1 Ohio St., 131.</p>\n<p data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b597-5\">The railroad company had no notice or knowledge of Patton\u2019s conveyance to the bank until it was filed for record on May 18, 1896.</p>\n<p data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b597-6\">The conveyance by Patton to the bank was a mortgage within the intention and the letter of section 4133, and consequently it as without any effect against the railroad company until it was delivered to the recorder for record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b597-7\">Any analysis of the instrument will disclose the essentials of a mortgage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b597-8\">1. The terms of this conveyance, down to and including the <em>habendum, </em>are the same as usually appear in warranty deeds. But this similarity does not affect the argument on either side, because those terms are in common use in both deeds and mortgages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b597-9\">2. It will be observed that we are not contending that this conveyance should be declared a mortgage for equitable reasons. In this deed there is no separate independent agreement. No testimony has been offered, no extraneous evidence introduced, to show the object and purpose of the parties in delivering and accepting the conveyance. The conveyance, complete in itself and embracing the whole contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>between the parties, is presented to the court. Its provisions furnish the evidence of a legal mortgage. No equity case is presented to the court. Patton\u2019s conveyance should be squared by the statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b598-4\">3. It was never intended that the bank should take absolute title to, or possession and control of, the property. Not only did the instrument not clothe the bank with the right to possess, control or enjoy the property, but also, out of abundant caution, it was expressly stipulated that the bank should not be clothed with these <em>indicia </em>of absolute title and OAvnership.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b598-5\">4. The instrument was executed and delivered for the purpose of securing the grantor\u2019s debt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b598-6\">No more appropriate language could be found by which to say that Patton had borrowed $25,000 from the bank, and that he Avas mortgaging his property to the bank for the purpose of securing the payment of the loan.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b598-7\">5. The conveyance contained a defeasance clause, the unfailing test of a mortgage. As in a mortgage, the title never passed to the grantee, as against third parties, and it was never intended that is should.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b598-8\">6. The instrument contains an additional provision.</p>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b598-9\">This provision is simply a power of sale, and the whole instrument becomes a mortgage containing a poAver of sale. But the power of sale makes the instrument none the less a mortgage in the contemplation of our statutes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b598-10\">7. Giving to the foregoing provisions their obvious effect, it is apparent that there could have been, and that there was, no default under the mortgage for at least six months subsequent to its execution and delivery. In other words, neither the bank nor any other person claiming by or under the mortgage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>had the slightest claim upon the property for at least six months. Patton was to hold possession of the premises as fully as if the conveyance had not been made, \u201cuntil said The National Bank of Columbus shall require and make a sale thereof, as hereinafter provided.\u201d But this sale could not be made by the bank until after six months\u2019 notice in writing, and upon a failure to pay the principal with accrued interest on demand. It is a significant fact that the deed forever barred the grantee from taking possession of the property conveyed. 2 Pingrey on Mortgages, pp. 1225,1227; 1 Jones on Mortgages (5th edition), sec. 62; 26 Am. &amp; Eng.

Clark, 53 Ohio St., 414, goes further than is necessary to sustain our position in the case at bar.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b600-6\">We are not asking that this conveyance be declared a mortgage for equitable reasons. In the pending case there is no separate independent agreement. No testimony has been offered \u2014 none could have been offered, in any way showing or explaining, or tending to show dr explain, the intentions of the parties to the instrument. A conveyance complete in itself is presented, an instrument embracing the whole contract between the parties. If the instrument withifi its four corners bears the evidence of a legal mortgage, such as the statute contemplates, the railroad company wins. If the whole instrument constitutes a deed, the bank wins. Consequently cases wherein the conveyances were absolute with separate independent contracts of condition or defeasance are not controlling. Connected with this is the no less important principle that the rules applied by a court of equity in working out the respective rights of the grantor and the grantee in a conveyance are not the rules that obtain when the rights of an innocent third party under the registry law \u00e1re to be determined.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b600-7\">In other words, it was claimed that the deed provided that Patton\u2019s possession should continue, until the bank \u201cshall require possession and make a sale thereof.\u201d Such an argument refutes itself.</p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b600-8\">This and other language found in the brief indicates that counsel believes that, because the bank might have conveyed the fee to a purchaser, it necessarily had the fee. Such a conclusion destroys the purpose of the well-known power of sale in a mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>gage. The fact that the bank, under the instrument, had the power to sell the property and to convey the fee, is neither controlling nor indicative. This court has held that a mortgage under the statute is none the less a mortgage because it gives the grantee the right to sell the property and to convey the fee. The naked mortgage and the mortgage with the power of sale superadded have the same legal effect, are subject to the same principles, to the same requirements as to registration and to the same rules concerning judgment, execution and levy. Indeed, the very purpose of the power is to enable a person to convey that which he does not possess. The whole argument has been crystallized in one of the briefs in <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>3 Pick., 484.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b601-5\">Burket, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGQ\">As the statutes of this state stood before the revision of 1880, \u201clands and tenements\u201d could be levied upon and sold to pay debts, sec. 420 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and statutes prior thereto. Under those statutes it was held that an equity could not be levied upon and sold to pay debts, and that a judgment did not create a lien upon an equity. <em>Baird </em>v. <em>Kirtland, </em>8 Ohio, 21; <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Way, </em>16 Ohio, 469; <em>Loring </em>v. <em>Melendy, </em>11 Ohio, 355, and many other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">The statute was amended in 1880, sec. 5374, so as to make \u201clands and tenements, including vested interests therein,\u201d subject to levy and sale for the payment of debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">Manifestly the interest which Mr. Patton retained in the surplus of the value of the real estate over and above the amount required to pay his note, and which was to be returned to him by the terms of the instrument, was a vested interest, and therefore subject to levy and sale to pay his debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>By the next section, 5375, it is provided that \u201cSuch lands and tenements, within the county where the judgment is entered, shall be bound for the satisfaction thereof from the first day of the term at which judgment is rendered.\u201d \u201cSuch lands and tenements,\u201d in this section, embraces the same as \u201clands and tenements, including vested interests therein,\u201d in the preceding section. It is therefore clear that the judgment in question became a lien upon the vested interest of Mr. Patton in the lands covered by this instrument, from the first day of the April term, 1894, of the court of common pleas, that is, April 7, 1894, and that the lien of the judgment attached, by relation, under the statute, to such vested interest as he then had in said lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Let us next inquire what vested interest he then had in the lands upon which a lien could attach in favor of the judgment creditor, and against Mr. Patton and his grantee, the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Section 4106, Revised Statutes, provides how \u201cA deed, mortgage, or lease of any estate or interest in real property\u201d shall be executed. The instrument in question was either a deed or mortgage. It was not a lease. The plaintiff in error claims that it was in legal effect a deed, while the defendant in error claims that it was in legal effect a mortgage. The statute does not define either a deed or a mortgage, but seems to take it for granted that those terms are well understood and need no definition. It must be clear that this instrument is not simply a deed, as that word is usually understood, because a deed conveys full title for a certain consideration without any interest remaining in the grantor in the realty conveyed. True, there may be conveyances by deed upon conditions, but in all such cases the grantor retains no vested interest in the estate or interest conveyed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>and if it ever returns to him, it returns upon breach of a condition, and in such cases his interest is contingent and not vested. A conveyance may also be made by deed in trust for the benefit of creditors, and in such cases the title passes under the deed to the trustee, even though the surplus, .if any, after payment of all debts, comes back to the grantor. But even in such cases it is usually regarded safer to make the grantor a party to the proceedings to sell the real estate conveyed by the deed of assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">While the instrument in question is not a straight, ordinary deed, it is claimed to be what is known as a trust deed, or deed in trust conveying the title to the bank, and out of Mr. Patton, so as to be good against the world, without record, except as against a subsequent <em>bona fide </em>purchaser without notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The question whether this instrument is a deed in legal effect as claimed, or a mortgage, is not without difficulty. The granting clause is that of an absolute deed of conveyance, and so is the <em>habendum </em>down to the word \u201cforever;\u201d and then, after a semicolon, comes the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">\u201cIn trust, nevertheless, and upon condition that said Alexander G. Patton is to hold possession of said premises as fully as if this conveyance had not been made, until said The National Bank of Columbus shall require and make a sale thereof, as hereinafter provided, that is to say; this conveyance is made for the purpose of securing to said The National Bank of Columbus the sum of twenty-five thousand (|25,000) dollars, Avith interest thereon now past due and evidenced by the promissory note of said Patton heretofore executed and delivered to said bank, dated October 19, 1891, and it shall be lawful 'for said The National Bank of Columbus, after six months notice in writing, at any time within five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>years from the date hereof, in ease said principal sum of twenty-five thousand ($25,000) dollars and the unpaid accrued interest thereon shall not be paid on demand, after the notice aforesaid, to sell said land at private sale or public auction, for cash or on credit, and apply the proceeds to the payment of whatever amount may then be due said bank on account of said indebtedness, principal and interest, and the surplus, if any, after such payment, shall be paid over to said Alexander G. Patton, and no payment or receipt of interest, or on account of said principal shall be taken, held or construed as an extension of time for payment of said past-due indebtedness ; and further, it is agreed and promised by said The National Bank of Columbus for itself, its successors and assigns, that if said Patton shall pay' said indebtedness and the interest thereon at any time, with or without demand, this deed shall be null and void, and a proper quit-claim deed of all interest in the premises aforesaid shall be executed by said bank to said Alexander G. Patton, his heirs and assigns forever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Everything contained in this trust part, of the instrument is inconsistent with, and irreconcilably opposed to, a deed passing title from Mr. Patton to the bank. He retains possession of the premises until the bank shall require and make a sale of the property. The conveyance is made for the purpose of <em>seeurmg </em>to the bank $25,000 evidenced by a past-due note. If not paid within five years the bank may sell the real estate after six months notice, and apply the proceeds upon the note, and pay the surplus, if any, to Mr. Patton. No extension shall be made, and if Mr. Patton shall pay the debt at any time, the deed shall be null and void, and the bank shall ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>ecute a quit-claim deed to Mr. Patton, his heirs and assigns forever.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">If the instrument had been intended to pass title and not operate merely as a security, the bank would have taken immediate possession of the premises; it would not have stated that the conveyance was for the purpose of <em>security; </em>it would not have provided for a power of sale, because a grantee in an absolute deed may sell when and as he pleases; it would not have agreed to pay any surplus to Mr. Patton; it would not have agreed that upon payment of the debt the deed should be null and void; and it would not have agreed to make a quit-claim deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The trust part of the instrument is throughout in legal effect the same as the condition, or defeasance clause in a mortgage. Possession is retained by the grantor (mortgagor), the instrument states that it is for the purpose of <em>security; </em>a power of sale is given to the grantee (mortgagee); the surplus, if any, is to be paid to the grantor (mortgagor) ; upon payment of the debt the deed is to be null and void, and a quit-claim deed is to be made. Those are the ear-marks of a mortgage, and both upon principle and authority this instrument must be held to be a mortgage in so far as it concerns the rights of third persons. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Alter, </em>42 Ohio St., 94; <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Dibble, </em>10 Ohio, 434; <em>Woodruff </em>v. <em>Robb, </em>19 Ohio, 212; <em>Brantley </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>97 Ga., 755; <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Union Bank, </em>5 Humph., 612; <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Watkins, </em>31 Ark., 429; <em>Newman </em>v. <em>Samuels, </em>17 Iowa, 528; <em>Eaton </em>v. <em>Whiting, </em>3 Pick., 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">On principle and authority, the , rule seems to be, that if by the terms of such an instrument the grantor retains a vested interest in the premises, the instrument, in view of our recording acts, must be held to be, in legal effect, as to the rights of third per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>sons, a mortgage; but if no vested interest remains in the grantor, the instrument will be regarded as a deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">It is usual in deeds of trust made by railroad companies and other corporations, to independent trustees, securing bonds to be sold to raise funds, to make them in form so as to pass title, and with a power of sale; yet such instruments are held to be, in legal effect, only mortgages, and that when one such trust deed has been made, the company may make others, that in legal effect the company retains a vested interest as mortgagor in possession, and that upon default such trust deeds may be foreclosed as mortgages. A case in point in our own state is <em>Coe </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>10 Ohio St., 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Much stress is laid by plaintiff in error upon the promise in the instrument in question, upon payment of the debt, to make a quit-claim deed, and it is urged that that provision shows that the title passed. We do not so construe it. The instrument was evidently intended to serve as a mortgage security to the bank, but to be so far in the form of a deed as to permit its record in the record of deeds instead of mortgages, and it was so recorded. Under these circumstances, upon payment of the debt by Mr. Patton, the instrument, even though made null and void by such payment, could not be released as a mortgage upon the margin of the deed record, without leaving a blur upon the title, and therefore for the protection of the title in case of payment, the provision for a quitclaim deed was very properly inserted. But that provision did not make the instrument a deed, but was \u00e1 strong confirmation of its being a- mortgage, because it showed that the grantor still had a vested interest in the property, the title to which he was careful to protect. The intention was to secure the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>bank and shield Mr. Patton. That intention failed of its purpose, as is often the case, when the rights of third parties intervene. In such cases courts disregard mere forms, and consider the substance and legal effect of the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">It is urged that as Mr. Patton was to hold possession of the premises until the bank should \u201crequire and make a sale thereof,\u201d he was to hold possession until the bank should require possession and make a sale. The instrument will not bear that construction. The meaning is that he should hold possession until the bank should require a sale, and make a sale thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The power of sale, instead of showing the instrument to be a deed passing title to the grantee, has the contrary effect, and aids in showing the instrument to be a mortgage, as no such power is necessary in a deed which passes title, because the deed, by its own vigor, carries with it a power of sale to the grantee, while a mortgage does not carry such power unless expressly granted therein. The power of sale in this instrument is in the nature of a power of attorney to sell and convey lands, in which case the legal title remains in the grantor until the power is executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">The only purpose to be served, or advantage to be gained, by a power of sale in a trust deed or mortgage, is to enable the trustee to take possession of the property and sell it under the power, and thereby cut off the vested rights of the grantor without the aid or delay of a proceeding in court. The grantee may, however, refuse to exercise the power of sale, and invoke the aid of a court to make the sale as upon foreclosure; and where subsequent liens have attached, such a course becomes necessary, because a sale by the trustees would convey a title burdened with such subsequent liens. Until a sale shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>made, either under the power or by the order of court, the grantor will retain his vested rights in the property, and such rights will be subject to liens the same as his other lands and tenements.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">The agreed statement of facts also shows that about the middle of May, 1891, the bank took possession of the property and held possession thereafter until the levy of the execution thereon, and the plaintiff in error urges this fact as a point in its. favor. But this possession does not appear to have been by virtue of the instrument in question, but under some other arrangement between Mr. Patton and the bank. But even if it had been made under and by virtue of this instrument, it could not have aided the bank, because this possession was late in May, after the judgment had attached as a lien on April 7 of the same year. True the judgment was not recovered until in July, but it related back and became a lien from the first day of the term, April 7, and the rights of the parties are the same as if the judgment had in fact been recovered and entered on the first day of the term, though not recovered until July, and the conveyed the same to a purchaser on the day the bank took possession, the lien of the judgment would have attached to the property as of the first day of the term. If Mr. Patton had sold his property and lien would have continued against the property in the hands of such purchaser. It is because of this statute that when transactions in real estate take place during a term of court, search of the records must be made for pending actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The instrument in question being therefore in legal effect a mortgage, Mr. Patton owned and held the legal title, and the judgment in favor of the defendant in error became a lien on the property covered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>by the mortgage on April 7, 1894, and the mortgage being then not filed for record, the judgment has priority over the mortgage, and must be first paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
