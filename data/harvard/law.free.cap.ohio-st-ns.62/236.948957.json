That for many years prior to April 9th, 1889, a partnership, known as the \u201cFranklin Mill Company,\u201d existed, composed of Rufus Peters who owned a one-fourth interest, Henry Hunsinger, who owned a one-fourth interest, Rufus Hunsinger, who owned a one-eighth interest, Thomas P.

The other one-eighth interest having been acquired by the partnership and owned by it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b257-12\">2. That on April 9th, 1889, a corporation composed of the members of the partnership was organiezd under the name of the \u201cFranklin Milling Company,\u201d in which each partner took stock in proportion to the interest he had owned in the partner<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>ship, with the addition of M. L. Sternberger, who not having been a member of the partnership subscribed for the one-eighth that had been owned in common by the members of the partnership amounting to $5,000.00.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-5\">The interest in the partnership of each subscriber of stock was turned over to said corporation in payment for the stock subscribed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-6\">3. At the date of the organization of the corporation, the partnership conveyed all of its property, both real and personal to the corporation, including a \u201cFlouring Mill,\u201d \u201cWoolen Factory,\u201d two houses and lots adjoining the same and two lots in the city of Wellston, Ohio; that said corporation was formed for the purpose of continuing the business in which the partnership had before that time been engaged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-7\">4. The stock subscribed by M. L. Sternberger was held by him one year when he elected to and did surrender the same to the corporation which after-wards held the same as company property until the assignment was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-8\">5. At the time of the reorganization, April 9th, 1889, the partnership was indebted in the sum of about $20,000, among its creditors of which was the plaintiff, Eliza Burk, Ger shorn David, James Hatton and others.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-9\">A short time previous to organization of the corporation an assessment was made among the members of the firm of $1,000.00 to the share of one-eighth, aggregating $7,000.00, to be applied upon the indebtedness. The balance of the indebtedness was over and above this $7,000.00 was carried by the corporation and renewed from year to year, and a large portion of it comprised the indebtedness at the time of the assignment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-10\">At the time of the assignment of the $7,000.00 upon the members of the partnership, Rufus Peters, who owned one-fourth interest in the partnership, was assessed the sum of $2,000. \u201e He not having the money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>to pay his part of the assessment agreed, with the other members of the partnership to assume the payment of the debt to the plaintiff amounting to $2,000.00, and that subsequent to the reorganization, plaintiff sent his note to the Iron Bank of Jackson, Ohio, for payment of principal and interest, and that the interest was paid annually and portions of the principal by said corporation which immediately charged such payments to said Rufus Peters and deducted the same from his salary due him from said corporation; that said payments reduced the plaintiff\u2019s claim to the sum of $1,000.00, which was evidenced by a promissory note payable to the order of the plaintiff, bearing the signatures of Rufus Peters and the \u201cFranklin Milling Company,\u201d which upon the payment of accruing interest was renewed from time to time in the same form until the execution of the note set forth in the petition which, last named note remains unpaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-6\">7. That Thomas P. Sutherland was president of the corporation for a portion of the time that the renewals of the indebtedness to the plaintiff were being made, and J. A. Long was the secretary thereof, and that said Sutherland was the financial agent and manager of said corporation at all times till his death, which occurred in March, 1896, that said renewals were made by J. A. Long as secretary of said corporation at the request and order of said Sutherland down to and including the note in suit, but that no resolution of the board of directors of said corporation or by-laws of the same in any way authorized the signing of commercial paper of any kind or character by the officers or agents of said corporation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-7\">8. That the notes as renewed from time to time were sent by plaintiff to Thomas P. Sutherland who was president of the Iron Bank of Jackson for collection of the interest and for such portions of the principal as were paid thereon, and said Sutherland paid the interest thereon acting for the corporation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>the \u201cFranklin Milling Company,\u201d together with the sums by which the principal was reduced, and sent to the plaintiff from time to time renewals for the amount still due said plaintiff, Said renewals being signed as heretofore found, and charged such amounts upon the books of the corporation against the salary of Rufus Peters.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-5\">9. At the time, or shortly after the organization of the corporation, J. Fhls Evans became a member of the corporation, having purchased a portion of the stock of Rufus Peters, for which he paid the sum of $500.00, he still owing the said Peters the sum of $500.00 thereon at the time of the assignment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-6\">10. That the liabilities of the partnership were treated by the corporation as debts of the corporation and in renewing the partnership liabilities the corporation treated them in the same way as liabilities of the corporation made after the incorporation; and that the transactions of Sutherland with the plaintiff in causing the notes to be renewed, were well known to all the stockholders of the corporation save M. L. Sternberger.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-7\">The renewal notes having been signed by the partnership name during the time he was a subscriber to the stock of the corpration. The plaintiff, Jacob S.

And the court coming now to state its conclusions of law from the facts so found and above set forth, it is considered by the court:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>1. That said corporation had no authority to sign said note, and that the signing thereof in the way and manner set forth in the finding of facts was \u201cultra vires.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-6\">2.

McGillwray, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-8\">The one fact controlling in this case, which must be ever kept in mind, but which must have been overlooked by the circuit court, is, that when the corporation received the partnership assets \u2014 stepped into its shoes, as it were \u2014 the partnership was indebted to plaintiff in the sum of f&gt;2,000.00, evidenced by its outstanding promissory note.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b261-9\">Consent is a necessary element in a contract of novation.

There is no finding that the corporation did not assume and agree to pay plaintiff\u2019s claim; that it was excepted from the debts of the partnership outstanding at the date of the reorganization; that any contract or arrangement was made between the partnership and corporation in any way affecting it, unless in the general agreement of assumption, and inasmuch as the fact of transferring individual or partnership property raises a strong inference of assumption of debts, the failure to find against the assumption leaves the inference stand. <em>Savings Co. </em>v. <em>Saw Co., </em>104 Mo., 425.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-9\">Our contention is that the doctrine of ultra vires and estoppel cannot apply; but if, as found by the circuit court, the corporation lacked authority to make the note, our answer is, the matter of making a note is within the corporate power. <em>Hays </em>v. <em>The Gas Light Co., </em>29 Ohio St., 330; <em>Burt </em>v. <em>Rattle, </em>31 Ohio St., 116.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-10\">And then the rule is \u2014 The doctrine of estoppel applies to a trading corporation the same as a neutral person in all transactions within its co-operate authority. <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Flour Co., </em>41 Ohio St., 552.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b262-11\">The acts of the corporation in paying interest on plaintiff\u2019s note for seven years and in reducing the principal from two to one thousand dollars, was a full and complete ratification of the acts of Sutherland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>and Long in making the notes and carrying the debt.

In the language of the finding of facts the plaintiff did not \u201cgive credit to the corporation, but looked to the firm for his loan.\u201d <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Flour Co., supra; Park Bank </em>v. <em>German-American M.

Y., 498; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Railway Co., </em>131 Mass., 258; Morowitz Corp., Sec. 232.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b263-8\">Minshall, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMQ\">The facts disclose that the corporation was formed by the incorporation of the members comprising a partnership. The change was from a partnership to a corporation. The latter took all the property of the partnership. This was accomplished by the members of the firm on the formation of the corporation, transferring their respective interests in the partnership to it, and receiving a like interest in the capital stock of the company in consideration of the transfer. The members of the partnership may be said to have simply put on a new coat. The stock seems to have been divided into interests or shares of one-eighth. The members of the. partnership having seven-eighths and holding one-eighth in common; or which is more to the purpose, each one-eighth held by the former members of the firm, represented, in the capital of the company, one-eighth plus one fifty-sixth of the capital stock, since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>the capital was all owned by those who formed the partnership. On this state of case it is very clear that the corporation was liable for this debt, whether it had expressly assumed the indebtedness of the partnership or not. It is not to be regarded as an ordinary sale of property by one to another. A partnership is a <em>quasi </em>legal entity. It owns property and has liabilities as such. Its creditors have a right to the payment of their claims from the partnership assets in preference to individual creditors, and have in equity a lien on the assets of the firm, that may be worked out through the partners. So that, Avhen the partners transferred all the property of the firm to the company, the partnership was dissolved and the rights of its creditors followed the partners and the property into the corporation, and it was bound to discharge the debts of the partnership, having received the property of the partnership on which it had obtained credit. It could not retain the property and repudiate the liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">All that the corporation paid for the property transferred to it was the stock issued in exchange \u2014 simply a metamorphosis of a partnership into a corporation, without any change of individuals, and unless it assumed the payment of the debts of the firm, there Avas no consideration for the transfer of the property \u2014 for the stock AAdthout the property represented nothing and was worth nothing. That a corporation could be formed and, with its capital, purchase a partnership and its business without, being liable for its debts unless expressly assumed, is not doubted; but this is not such a case. This is like the case of <em>Reed Brothers Company </em>v. <em>First National Bank, </em>46 Nebr., 168, where a partnership, engaged in a general mercantile business, in straitened and failing circumstances, incorporated, and the assets and business of the partnership were transferred to the coi\u2019poration and'appropriated to its object and purpose, the business of the partnership being continued by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>the corporation, it was held, that the corporation was presumptively liable for the partnership debts. See 2 Cook on Stockholders, Sec. 669, and note 3; Mor. Corp., Sections 791 and 812; <em>Broughton </em>v. <em>Pensa</em>cola, 93 U. S., 266-270; Beach on Priv. Corp., Sec. 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">There was in fact no purchase in this case; it, as shown, was simply a change from doing business in one capacity to that of another \u2014 the same persons changed from partners to corporators \u2014 and this distinction reconciles many cases on the subject, that might otherwise seem in conflict. Where there is \u00e1 purchase in fact by a new company from an old one, there is, as before observed, no liability of the new for the debts of the old company, unless assumed as a part of the consideration. But where a mere transformation is had \u2014 parties remaining the same, and the property is transferred by the members of the old company transferring their interest in it, for an equal interest in it as property of the new, the transaction does not constitute a sale by the one and a purchase by the other; it is simply a change in the manner and form of carrying on the same business by the same persons; and, brushing aside the fiction of a legal entity, it is seen that no real change has taken \u25a0place, and that in looking to the new formation for payment, the creditor looks to the same persons, possessed of the same property and rights, he contracted with in the first instance; and to construe the transaction as to creditors as a purchase, tends to operate a fraud on their rights. Every purchase implies two distinct persons \u25a0\u2014 a buyer and seller. It is a moral impossibility for one person to buy of, or sell to, himself. Modern decisions, as observed by Mr. Taylor (Private Corporations, Sec. 51), are tending to a disregard of the mental conception, that a corporation is an entity separate from its corporators, as in many instance it is simply a \u201cstumbling block\u201d in the way of doing justice between real persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>But again, the facts found show that the assumption of the debts of the partnership, was a part of the understanding and agreement by which the company was formed: The finding is, that at the date of the <em>\u201creorganization\u201d </em>the partnership eonveyed all its property, real and personal, to the corporation; and that it was formed for the purpose of <em>continuing </em>the business in which the partners had been engaged; and, \u201cThat the liabilities of the partnership were treated by the corporation as debts of the corporation, and in renewing the partnership liabilities the corporation treated them in the same way as liabilities of the corporation made after the incorporation; and that the transactions of Sutherland with the plaintiff in causing the notes to be renewed, were Avell knoAvn to all the stockholders of the corporation save M. L. Sternberger,\u201d whose relation to the corporation will be hereafter noticed. These facts are only consistent with an express understanding that the debts of the partnership were to be assumed and paid by the company. It will help, in understanding the transaction, to note the fact, that the same persons avIio formed the partnership were the incorporators of the company \u2014 there were not two real parties in existence, dealing with each other. It was conducted by one set of persons, managing a business for their OAvn profit and convenience; and what more natural in such case, than in passing from a partnership to a corporation they should determine to carry with them their liabilities as well as their property. Nothing could be gained to them by not doing so, and it would be much to their convenience to do so. And, it seems, that this is not disputed as to their creditors in general, but certain facts are found which are supposed to vary this obligation as to the claim of the plaintiff. It is found that at the time of the \u201creorganization,\u201d the firm owed some $20,000; and that a short time before, the members made an assessment on themselves of $1,000.00 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>each one-eighth interest, amounting to $7,000.00, one-eighth not being assessed. The balance of the indebtedness to be ca-rried by the company. At the time of the assessment Bufus Peters, owner of a fourth interest, was assessed $2,000.00. Not being able to pay, he assumed the payment of the debt to the plaintiff, then $2,000.00. It is claimed that this amounted to a novation. But the plaintiff was not consulted, knew nothing of the arrangement, could not have assented, and did not; and therefore there was no novation as to him. His rights remained unaffected. Under this agreement payments were made, and renewals given from time to time, when the amount was reduced to the sum for which the note in suit was given, the renewals having been signed as the note in suit, except during the time Sternberger was a subscriber to stock. When these payments were made by the corporation it immediately charged them to Peters and took credit to itself on his account for salary. This was a very clear recognition by the corporation that it regarded the debt as its own, so far as the plaintiff was concerned. It made the payments and took credit to itself in its account with Peters. This was according to the agreement between it and Peters, but the plaintiff was no party to it and did not know of it. As between Peters and the corporation it was the debt of the former, but as between the plaintiff and the corporation, it was the debt of the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Again, the fact is found that one Sternberger after the company was formed, subscribed for an eighth interest in the capital stock of the company at $5,-000.00. This, we suppose, was the one-eighth the company owned and had not been disposed of. It amounted to no more than an effort to increase the stock to that extent \u2014 one-eighth was added in the way of what is commonly called water. This, however, amounted to nothing, as in about a year after-wards, he surrendered the stock. There is no finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>that he ever paid for it \u2014 the finding is that he subscribed for it. We assume that if the evidence had warranted such a finding, it would have been made; the rule being that when a finding is requested it contains all the facts that the evidence warranted. It is also found that one Evans purchased of Peters a portion of his stock, agreeing to pay $500 for it; but the finding is that he had not paid for it at the time of the assignment. We do not see how any of these findings can in any -way affect the right of the plaintiff to be regarded as a creditor of the corporation. The fact remains that the persons who composed the partnership constituted the stockholders of the company from its organization to the assignment. But suppose it were true that Sternberger became and remained a stockholder of the company, and that Evans acquired and paid for a portion of the stock of Peters, how would this vary the rights of the plaintiff? His rights accrued when the partnership \u2022became a corporation, and cannot be changed by subsequent changes in the stockholders. His rights avail against the company and not the stockholders. The latter may wholly change and the company remain the same as to rights and liabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">But it is argued that the act of Long in signing the company\u2019s name was <em>ultra vires. </em>The doctrine ' has no application to this case. We have shown that the debt was the debt of the company; it received all the property of the plaintiff and was morally and legally bound to pay it. Every corporation has power to make a note to secure the payment of its own debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
