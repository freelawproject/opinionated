Section 5699 of the Revised Statutes, which gives a right of dower to a divorced wife in the lands of the husband in certain cases, is enabling in its character, and does not create a disability, nor impose any restraint on the power of the wife to relinquish such dower, in any lawful mode, when the divorce is granted, or at any time thereafter.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b110-8\">2. When, upon granting a divorce, a decree for alimony rendered, by a court having jurisdiction, in pursuance of an agreement be-, tween the parties,\u2019 orders the wife to execute a release of her right of dower in lands of the husband, the decree, if the wife fails to perform the same, will operate as such release, and be as effectual as a bar to her right of dower as if the deed were duly executed and delivered.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b110-9\">3.

The petition alleges, in substance, that the plaintiff was married to George C. Julier in 1856, and obtained a divorce from him for his aggression, in 1S88; that during the coverture he was the owner of the real property described, and he died seized of the same in 1896; and, that the estate of the decedent is held by the defendants, of whom she demanded her dower before the commencement of the action. The answer pleads in bar of the claim for dower, the judgment in the divorce case, by which, in pursuance of an agreement made between the husband and wife with respect to her alimony, it was adjudged and decreed that the plaintiff, within ten days after the entry of the judgment, should execute and deliver to the defendant a quit-claim deed releasing her dower and all other interests in all real estate that was then or might thereafter be owned by the husband, and in default of such conveyance the decree should so operate, and by which the plaintiff was enjoined from setting up any claim to such real estate, except in so far as the alimony allowed her was made a lien thereon. The reply admits the decree was entered in the divorce case as alleged in the answer, and the payment of the alimony thereunder in all respects as adjudged, but alleges, that the part of the decree which relates to the release of the plaintiff\u2019s dower is void for want <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>of jurisdiction, and was entered without her knowledge or consent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-5\">In the common pleas the defense was sustained and the petition dismissed. On the trial in the circuit court, to which the cause was appealed, the defendants, against their objections, were required to take the burden of proving the agreement mentioned in the decree for alimony; and the testimony was at first directed to proving a verbal agreement, in regard to the terms of which there was some conflict, but finally a written contract was discovered and produced, which was conceded to be the agreement made by the parties. That agreement, as found by the court, is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-6\">\u201cIt is agreed by way of a compromise as to the amount of alimony to be paid by George C. Julier to his wife, Jane Julier, that she proceed without unreasonable delay to file her petition for divorce and alimony against the said George C. for cause of adultery of late occurrence; and upon granting the decree of divorce by the court for the cause aforesaid, the said George O. shall pay or cause to be paid in a reasonable time, in installments, the sum of twelve thousand three hundred dollars to the said Jane; said installments to draw interest from and after ten days from the date of the decree of divorce and alimony, and the journal entry therein to contain a clause in the alternative that she shall by quit claim deed release all her right of dower and contingent right of dower to and in any and all real estate wheresoever situated, owned and held by said George 0., and in default of the execution and delivery of said deed or deeds to said George 0. the decree so made shall cut off all her said dower therein forever. The personal property of said George O. now in house No. 1200 Willson avenue shall by these presents pass to and vest in said Jane as alimony in addition to the above sum and thereby become her property. Said alimony shall be paid in the following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>installments, viz: One thousand dollars within ten days of the filing of the petition for divorce by said Jane on the grounds aforesaid, and two thousand dollars within ten days after the decree of divorce is granted by the court, no interest to be paid on either of the aforesaid installments; and $1,000 in six months after decree, $2,075.00 in eighteen months, $2,-075.00 in one year after, $2,075.00 in one year after, and $2,0^5.00 in one year after, from the date of the decree of divorce in said action, said last named sums to draw interest quarterly from the date of decree. Said George O. Julier has the option of paying any or all of said last named installments at any time before any of them shall become due, and if he does pay any or all before they fall due interest thereon to be counted to day of payment only.

It is therefore ordered, adjudged and decreed by the court that the marriage relation heretofore existing between the said Jane Julier and George C.

And in consideration of the agreement of the parties as to-alimony it is further-ordered, adjudged and decreed that the defendant do pay the said plaintiff as and for her reasonable alimony in money the sum of $8,300, payable in the following installments with interest payable quarterly from the date of this decree, viz.: $2,075 on or before the 20th day of August, A.

And it is further ordered, adjudged and decreed that said plaintiff shall, within ten days, execute- and deliver to said defendant her deed and quit claim and release of dower to and in all the real estate of said defendant wheresoever situated, and in default thereof by her, it is ordered and decreed that she be forever divested of all and every claim, title or interest by dower or otherwise in or to any real estate-now owned by said defendant wheresoever situated, or in real estate thereafter acquired by the defendant,, and the decree of the court herein shall operate as such conveyance by quit claim of real estate by said plaintiff to said defendant, and the plaintiff is en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>joined from interfering in any manner with the defendant\u2019s rights, and from setting up any claim of interest in defendant\u2019s real estate wheresoever situated.

Julier paid the plaintiff $1,000.00 in cash immediately after the execution of the said contract, and, suit having been thereupon instituted by her for divorce and alimony, further paid her, before the disposition of said suit, the sum of $3,000.00 in cash; that after the said decree of divorce was entered, he paid her the further sum of $8,300.00 with interest, and also transferred to her certain articles of personal property of the value of $300.00; that the plaintiff had no knowledge that the attorney so acting for her in the said divorce case had attempted by the contract aforesaid to obligate her to release her dower claims in the real estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>of her said husband, and that she at no time agreed to release or convey the same; that thereafter the said divorce case having come on to be heard, a decree was entered therein, a copy of which is attached to the answers of the defendants in this case, to which reference is here made; that the portions of said decree providing that the plaintiff should execute a quit claim deed to the said George C. Julier within ten days from the date thereof, and all parts thereof concerning said dower right were entered in said decree, in pursuance of said contract, with the knowledge of her attorney, but without the knowledge or assent of the plaintiff, Jane Julier, and her attorney was without authority from her to release her dower, or to contract in regard to the same.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Agk\">The court held as its conclusions of law, \u201cthat the plaintiff is not estopped to assert her right of dower in the premises described in her petition herein; that she has not conveyed or released such dower estate; that the contract so entered into prior to the commencement of the plaintiff\u2019s said action for divorce was against public policy, and was and is illegal and void; that the plaintiff was not bound by reason of the execution of the said contract, and the performance thereof by the said George 0. Julier to convey or release her said dower estate; that the judgment and decree entered by the said court of common pleas in- the said action for divorce, so far as the same directed the execution and delivery of a quit claim deed by the said plaintiff of her dower rights in the said premises, and so far as it provides that it should of itself operate as a conveyance of such dower rights, and so far as it undertook to enjoin the plaintiff from thereafter asserting her rights in the said premises, was null and void.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-7\">Thereupon judgment was rendered for the plaintiff, to reverse which the petition in error in the first of these cases, was filed in this court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-8\">The errors assigned in the other case are such only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>as occurred in the proceedings for the assignment of the dower subsequent to the foregoing judgment, which, in the view we have taken of the first case, become unimportant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b117-6\"><em>Johnson </em>cG Hackney, for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-7\">A judgment of the kind and character of this, imports absolute verity.

Her rights under the decree were clear. Her husband was ordered to pay to her $8,300.00 by way of alimony alone. So far as that portion of the decree is concerned it was perfectly valid. The court was given to understand that the amount was intended as a provision for alimony, and for no other purpose whatever.

An examination of these cases will reveal the fact that they were made under divorce and dower statutes materially different from our oAvn. 86 Mich., 600; 75 Mich., 256; 18 Nebraska, 395; 135 Ill., 448. In Iowa a divorced Avife is in no event entitled to doAver. 59 Iowa, 699; 61 Iowa, 174; 55 Cal., 384; 44 Penn St., 274; 9 B. Monroe, 454.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b129-8\">Williams, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AE\">The prevailing rule, when not affected by statute, appears to be that after the dissolution of marriage by divorce, the wife is not entitled to doAver in lands possessed by the husband during the coverture, or at the time of his death, for the reason that marriage at the death of the husband is essential to the right- of doAver in his estate. The right accrues, it is said, to Avidows and not to divorced wives. A different rule has been established in this state by statute, (now section 5699) by which it is provided, that when a divorce is granted by reason of the husband\u2019s aggression, the wife, if she survive him, \u201cshall be entitled to dower in the real estate of the husband not allowed her as alimony, of which he Avas seized at any time during the coverture, and to which she had not relinquished the right of dower.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">It cannot Avell be contended that, in order to bar this dower right of a divorced wife, it is necessary the relinquishment should be made before the divorce is obtained, nor that it may not be accomplished, Avhere the proceedings are regular, by a provision in the decree of divorce. The statute, hoAvever, is en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>abling in its character, giving a right of dower where without it none existed. It creates no disability, nor imposes any restraint on the power of the divorced wife to release her dower right in any lawful mode, either when the divorce is granted, or at any time thereafter. And a judgment of a competent court having jurisdiction of the parties and subject matter, may be as effectual a bar, as a release by deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">The rule that obtained in chancery with respect to the effect of a decree for a conveyance and the method of enforcing it, has been somewhat enlarged by our legislation, (now section 5318), by which it is enacted that: \u201cWhen the party against whom a judgment for a conveyance, release, or acquittance is rendered does not comply therewith by the time appointed, such judgment shall have the same operation and effect, and be as available as if the conveyance, release, or acquittance had been executed conformably to such judgment.\u201d So that, if the court by which the judgment in the divorce case was entered, was clothed with the necessary jurisdiction to render the same, the rights of the parties in this case are precisely the same as if the defendant in error had duly executed and delivered the deed of release as therein ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">The jurisdiction of the court in that case to render that part of the decree which relates to the release by the plaintiff therein of her right of dower, is contested here on the ground that the plaintiff\u2019s dower right was not a subject matter before the court for adjudication; and, that it was not as a separate and independent subject of adjudication, may be conceded. But under a prayer for general relief in an action for divorce, properly instituted, it is within the jurisdiction of the court to settle and adjust by its judgment, the rights of the parties with respect to the amount and nature of the alimony that shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>awarded the wife, and the terms and conditions of its payment; and, it appears to be well settled that in awarding the alimony, the court may, in its discretion, and generally will, confirm and carry into effect by its decree, any agreement which the parties have entered into concerning the same, that the court deems just and reasonable, and in doing so, may adjudge the conveyance of real property by one- to the other, in pursuance of such agreement. It it laid down as a general rule, in Nelson on Divorce and Separation, section 915, that: \u201cThe agreement of the parties with respect to permanent alimony is valid, and will generally be approved by the court, and a decree may be entered in conformity to it.\u201d In the absence of a saving provision by statute, as has already been noticed, all right of dower in the husband\u2019s lands ceased on the dissolution of the marriage relation by divorce; and when, on granting an absolute divorce, a provision was made for the wife, either in a general decree for alimony, or in a decree entered in conformity with the agreement of the parties, such provision was presumed to be in lieu of dower. And where by statute the right of dower is preserved after divorce, it seems to be an established rule that the court may make an allowance of alimony in lieu of the dower, especially where the parties have so agreed. Nelson on Divorce and Separation, Sec. 909. In <em>Owen </em>v. <em>Yale, </em>75 Mich., 256, it was held that a consent decree made after the announcement by the \"court that a divorce would be granted, providing for such divorce, and for the payment of a gross sum as alimony, \u201cto be in full of all claims of the complainant against the defendant or his property, which payment has been made according to the terms of the decree, is a bar to any claim of the wife to dower.\u201d Among other cases which sustain the jurisdiction of the court in divorce cases to render such decrees, and their binding force on the parties, are <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>86 Mich., 600; <em>Tatro </em>v. <em>Tatro, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>18 Neb., 395; <em>Calame </em>v. <em>Calame, </em>24 N. J. Eq., 440; <em>Webster </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>64 Wis., 439; <em>Twing </em>v. <em>O\u2019Meara, </em>59 Iowa, 326. On this subject it is sensibly said by Asbburn, J., in <em>Petersine </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>28 Ohio St., 596, 599, that: \u201cUnder our statute a divorce contemplates a final separation of the parties. Their paths in life henceforth diverge, and, in legal contemplation, they are to each other as strangers. When not otherwise provided, we think the statute contemplates that, at the time of decreeing the divorce, the court will adjust all the pecuniary rights of the parties in relation to each other springing out of the marital relation about to be forever annulled. To this end the court is given full discretionary authority to make such order concerning the division of the property and support of the children as to the court shall appear, finder ali the facts and circumstances, just, equitable, and reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The parties in the case before us were competent under the statute to contract with each other, and there is no reason why, in agreeing upon the amount that should be paid the wife in money, they migjit not stipulate for the release of the interest of either in the property of the other. The decree itself is conclusive evidence that the court was satisfied the agreement on which it was rendered was reasonable and just in all of its provisions as carried into the decree, all of which, in our opinion, it was within the jurisdiction of the court to confirm and enforce by its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">An objection is made to the operation of the decree in question as a bar to the right of dower claimed, on the ground that the agreement on which the decree is founded, is an unlawful one; the stipulation looking to an immediate divorce being, it is said, against public policy and rendering the whole contract void. This objection is not available. The alleged infirmity does not appear in the decree, nor in the record of that case. The agreement, what<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>ever its terms, was merged in the judgment, which, being regular on its face, and, as has been seen, rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, is supported by the conclusive presumption that every fact necessary t\u00ae sustain it was properly brought before the court. The judgment cannot be impeached except by a direct proceeding to reverse or annul it. And even in a proceeding of that character, the party asserting the illegality of the agreement as a ground of relief would find serious obstacles in the way of obtaining any assistance from the courts. Certainly as long as the decree remains in force the parties to it are estopped from alleging or proving the agreement was illegal, or disputing its validity. <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>1 Ohio St., 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">It is urged, however, that as the defendants beIoav plead and proved the agreement in support of their defense, they brought themselves within that principle which denies the aid of the courts to those who are parties to illegal transactions. That principle is not applicable to them. The agreement was no longer executory. It was executed by the decree, as fully as if tire wife in pursuance of it had lawfully made and delivered a deed of release of her dower right. Resort to the agreement was unnecessary in order to establish the right to the relief the defendants were seeking. The decree, unaided by any other fact, constituted the legal bar they set up to the dower claimed. And though they plead the agreement, and assuming the burden imposed by the court, produced it in evidence, it did not affect the validity or operation of the decree, but was as harmless as it was immaterial, being neither necessary to establish the defense, nor competent to invalidate the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">The remaining objection made to that part of the decree in question is, that it was made a part thereof, and so entered of record, without the know<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>ledge or consent of the defendant in error, the plaintiff in that case. It is admitted that the attorney who took the decree in behalf of the plaintiff had full knowledge of its contents as entered, and agreed to all of its provisions; and, that he was authorized to represent the plaintiff in the bringing and conduct of the suit, and in all things pertaining to her interests in the case, including the making of all proper arrangements for securing to her the most advantageous provisions for alimony out of the husband\u2019s estate. There was no express limitation on his authority in this respect. The plaintiff relied on his skill and judgment. In making the arrangement in her behalf, he no doubt deemed it advisable and beneficial to his client that she should relinquish her inchoate dower in order to obtain a larger amount of alimony in money than she would otherwise be able to obtain; and in so securing for her, by the surrender of a mere contingency that might never ripen into any actual value, something of present and substantial value, we are not satisfied he violated his professional trust, nor that the decree entered in pursuance of the agreement is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Besides, no fraud is charged against the defendant in that case, or his attorney, nor any collusion with the attorney of the plaintiff. The decree being a public record in her own case, was certainly sufficient to charge her with constructive notice of its provisions after its rendition; and the record here fails to show that she has not, at all time since, had actual knowledge of those provisions. Her pleading and the finding of the court on that subject, in this case, go no further than that the feature now objected to was inserted in the decree and so entered without her knowledge; and, though not important, it may be observed that the plaintiff, who alone could know what knowledge she possessed, was not produced as a witness. She did not choose to avail herself of her remedy, if she could show sufficient grounds therefor,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>by a direct proceeding to have the decree vacated or opened up, to which she might have resorted at any time short of the statutory bar, but permitted the decree to remain unquestioned until the commencement of the action below, more than ten years subsequent to its rendition, and in the meantime accepted, and retains all the fruits of the judgment, all that was beneficial to her. Upon no sound principle of law or justice can she now be released from the obligations of the judgment on the plea that she was ignorant of its provisions as entered of record, or that her attorney was without authority to have it so entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The judgment rendered in the circuit court in the first of these cases, awarding dower to the defendant in error, will be reversed, and judgment rendered for the plaintiffs in error. And the orders and proceedings in the second case, being founded on the judgment in the first one, must also be reversed and set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
