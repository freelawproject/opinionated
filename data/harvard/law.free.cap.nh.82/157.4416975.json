This question was answered affirmatively in the case of <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Company, </em>74 N. H. 435, and a further review of the authorities on the subject would appear to be unnecessary. But it is urged that the Cunningham case was an action for personal injuries, and is therefore distinguishable from the case at hand. Once granting, however, that damage has resulted from reasonable reliance upon a negligent misstatement, it is difficult to perceive why liability should be made to depend upon the nature of the injury sustained. Bodily harm was not an element of damage in the case of <em>Maxwell Ice Co. </em>v. <em>Company, </em>80 N. H. 236, and recovery was there allowed for negligent and false representations with respect to a sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">In this jurisdiction the principle is well established that negligent words as well as negligent deeds may constitute actionable fault. <em>Benoit </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>79 N. H. 11, 13, and cases cited. The determining factor is the same in each case \u2014 the relation of the parties. <em>Garland </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>76 N. H. 556, 565. Conduct becomes wrong<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>ful when it contravenes some duty which the law attaches to that relation. See <em>Conway Bank </em>v. <em>Pease, </em>76 N.
