Hook <em>v. </em>Consolidation Coal Company.</parties>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b102-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number><em>William H.

If there was any negligence on the part of the defendant, it must be found in the failure to make suitable regulations for the conduct of the work, and there is nothing in the record to indicate the absence of such regulations. The presumption is that the defendant prescribed the requisite rules, and the burden of proving its dereliction in that regard was upon the plaintiff. <em>Smith </em>v. Railroad, 73 N. H. 325, 327; <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>72 N. H. 518, 519; <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Manchester Mills, </em>70 N. H. 582, 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">\u201cIf a rule would have protected the servant, if observed, his injury may be due either to the want of the rule, \u2014 negligence of the master, \u2014 or to its non-observance, \u2014 negligence of the plaintiff or his fellow-servants. Hence, proof of an injury preventable by a different course of conduct is not of itself evidence of the master\u2019s negligence.\u201d <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Railroad, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">A like result is reached if it is conceded that it was negligent to fasten the cable to the chain under any circumstances. A witness who had worked in the defendant\u2019s coal yard for twelve years testified that he had never seen a car moved in that manner before, and while another witness, whose understanding of English was extremely limited, answered affirmatively an interrogative statement to the effect that he always hooked the cable to the chain whenever he found a car equipped with one, there is no evidence that this had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>occurred often enough to charge the defendant with knowledge of the practice. <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>72 N. H. 504, 507, 508, 517. See also <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Spaulding, </em>80 N. H. 335; <em>Sanborn </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>76 N. H. 523, 529; <em>Klineintie </em>v. <em>Company, </em>74 N. H. 276; <em>St. Pierre </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>74 N. H. 4; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Railroad, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Under such circumstances the act of the foreman in directing the movement of the cars would be an act of service. <em>Tilley </em>v. <em>Company, </em>74 N. H. 316, 318, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The same principle is applicable to the questions raised by the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions. If the defendant had no reason to apprehend the adoption of an improper method of operation, it owed its employees no duty to guard against the dangers incident to such improper method. <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Spaulding, supra, </em>336; <em>Blood </em>v. <em>New Boston, </em>77 N. H. 464, 465; <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>69 N. H. 361, 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">But assuming that the evidence warrants the conclusion that the defendant required the giving of the verbal order to \u201cstand clear,\u201d it is reasonable to infer that it also required the signalman to wait until the workmen had complied with this order before signaling for the application of the power. In the absence of direct evidence on this point, the failure of the foreman to wait until the men were out of danger would appear to be the negligence of a fellow-servant. <em>Parmaleau </em>v. <em>Company, </em>75 N. H. 69, 70; <em>Galvin </em>v. <em>Pierce, </em>72 N. H. 79; <em>McLaine </em>v. <em>Company, </em>71 N. H. 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">With reference to the complaint of lack of instructions it should be noted that the defendant\u2019s only duty in that respect was to warn the plaintiff of hidden dangers connected with the authorized mode of work. But even granting that the course pursued on the day of the accident was sanctioned by the defendant, it is difficult to perceive how an instruction that the cable might \u201cside-sweep\u201d could have given the plaintiff any \u201cknowledge he did not already possess\u201d <em>(Collins </em>v. <em>Company, </em>68 N. H. 196, 198), since at the time of the accident he was sufficiently aware of the danger to be running from it, or, to use his own expression, to be \u201cmaking a getaway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">It was nearly noon and the men were hurrying. Their purpose was to draw the cars from the yard to the coal shed. The engine and drum were located in a small power house at the entrance to the shed. The cars were to be moved forward from the rear. The cable was drawn around the edge of the last car and extended to a snatch block on one of the sidetracks near the head of the string of cars. It must have been apparent to anyone that if the cable broke away from its fastening it would follow the direction of the pull, and swing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>to one side. To have warned the plaintiff that this might happen would have been a \u201cuseless formality.\u201d <em>Ib.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-3\">The defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict should have been \u25a0 granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">\n<em>Plaintiff\u2019s exceptions overruled: defendant\u2019s exception sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"AN\">Allen, J., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
