Williams. She had \u201centrusted her safety\u201d to her husband, who was driving, and it does not conclusively appear that she was not justified in so doing. Laws 1923, c. 13. The plaintiff\u2019s intestate was but a few months old and therefore incapable of exercising any care whatever. <em>Carney </em>v. <em>Railway, </em>72 N. H. 364, 368, and cases cited. The negligence of the driver could not be imputed to either of them. <em>Noyes </em>v. <em>Boscawen, </em>64 N. H. 361; <em>Warren </em>v. <em>Railway, </em>70 N. H. 352, 360; <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Hustis, </em>79 N. H. 446, 449; <em>Bowley </em>v. <em>Duca, </em>80 N. H. 548, 549. Consequently, the only question presented by the defendant\u2019s motions is whether or not there was sufficient evidence to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>a finding of negligence on the part of the defendant contributing to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The grounds relied upon comprise (1) failure to give the statutory signals, (2) excessive speed, (3) failure to provide an automatic gong or other means of notice of the approach of trains, and (4) failure of the fireman or engineer to keep a proper lookout.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">Since no motion was made to withdraw any of these issues from the jury, if the evidence warranted the submission of one of them, consideration of the others is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">At the time of the accident the train was approaching the Alton station, which was located a half mile west of Durgin\u2019s crossing, where the collision occurred. The automobile was proceeding on the highway from New Durham to Alton.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">Collishaw testified that as the car drew near the crossing he was listening for a whistle with \u201call the attention that was possible for a man to give,\u201d and that he did not hear the statutory signal; that he looked up the track, saw no train in sight, and said to Williams, \u201cClear line\u201d; that his attention was first called to the train by a \u201csharp blast of the whistle,\u201d and that the engine was then \u201cright on\u201d them.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">Collishaw and Williams were both on the active lookout for a train. While there is no direct testimony as to what Williams heard, it is a fair inference from his conduct and his failure to reply when Collishaw called out \u201cClear line,\u201d that he did not hear any whistle.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">Mrs. Williams did not recall hearing the whistle, and a young woman on horseback on the opposite side of the crossing failed to hear it. Neither this witness nor Mrs. Williams, however, was listening for the approach of the train. The same was true of another witness, who was working in a shed nearby.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-11\">The engineer testified that he gave the statutory signal at the whistling-post and did not whistle again; that he was practically on the crossing when he first saw the plaintiff\u2019s car, and that he then had no time to whistle. He was corroborated by the conductor and trainmen, who testified that the regular crossing signal was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-12\">Sixteen witnesses in addition to those already mentioned testified that they heard a whistle. Much of this evidence is not inconsistent with Collishaw\u2019s testimony, and some of it tends strongly to support his assertion that no whistle was sounded until the danger of collision was imminent, and that the signal then given was a single sharp blast.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>The driver of an automobile approaching the crossing from the west, when a short distance therefrom, heard \u201cjust one\u201d blast of the whistle followed by the sound of the collision. He stated that the time between the whistle and the crash was very short.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Two of the passengers on the train were called as witnesses. One stated that he heard \u201cthe usual whistle that they whistle at all crossings.\u201d The other testified: \u201cThe first that attracted my attention was a blast from the whistle. ... It aroused me in some way; whether it was the regular whistle or a shorter blast I don\u2019t know, but it was near that crossing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">Of the eight witnesses who lived near the scene of the accident only one testified positively to hearing two long and two short whistles. This witness was sick in bed at the time and could state only as an expression of opinion that this signal was given at the whistling-post. Five of these witnesses did not see the train at all. One of them stated that the train sometimes whistled \u201cdown around the crossing.\u201d To the question, \u201cSometimes it whistles in fairly near the crossing, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d he answered yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">The accident occurred on Sunday, and the train in question was the regular Sunday-paper train. Although many of the witnesses were waiting for the arrival of the papers, they were not consciously listening for the approach of the train. One was \u201ctalking with the boys\u201d in front of a store. Another was indoors reading. Two were having lunch. Others were engaged in household tasks or in conversation. Several were at the station. One person testified that he was standing at the front of the station platform when he heard the engine whistle; that he immediately \u201cstepped out on the track and saw the train coming.\u201d It was then in plain sight and apparently so near the crossing that the witness was unwilling to say decisively that it had not reached that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">The station agent and two others assumed that the signal was the one ordinarily given. They did not see the train.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-9\">The assistant postmaster of Alton, called by the defendant, testified that he was waiting outside the station to meet a passenger. His testimony concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-10\">\u201cQ. As to the whistle that you heard, was it distinct or otherwise? \u25a0 A. Yes, I heard this one short blast. Q. That was, you heard the sound pretty distinctly? A. Yes. Yes, one short blast.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASi\">Cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b282-11\">\u201cQ. And that one short blast might have been two or three hundred feet from Durgin\u2019s crossing? A. I couldn\u2019t tell. Q. I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>mean, so far as you know it might have been in there? A. Well, I don\u2019t know. I heard it; I could n\u2019t see Durgin\u2019s crossing. Q. But you are sure it was one sharp blast? A. I heard one sharp blast.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">In view of this conflict in the evidence the jury may well have found that the engineer failed to give the signal required by statute (P. L., c. 249, s. 23), and that such signal, if given, would have prevented the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The defendant\u2019s contention that there can be no recovery because the negligence of Harry C. Williams was the sole cause of the collision is untenable. The rule of <em>Morier </em>v. <em>Hines, </em>81 N. H. 48, does not apply unless the driver of the automobile is \u201cfully informed of the train\u2019s approach.\u201d <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>81 N. H. 483, 487; <em>Stinson </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>81 N. H. 473, 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">It follows that the defendant\u2019s exceptions must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">The plaintiffs\u2019 exceptions require but brief consideration. The presiding justice has found that six of the eight requests for instructions were given in substance. No error is perceived in this finding, and none has been suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">Of the remaining requests, one virtually called for a ruling of law that certain conduct on the part of the engineer constituted negligence. Obviously, this was a question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">The other request was based upon the premise that Williams was entitled to rely upon the assurance of Collishaw that the track was clear. Since the essential inquiry on this issue was the reasonableness of Williams\u2019s conduct, the request was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">There was evidence that Collishaw, shortly after the accident, stated that the speed of the automobile was twenty-five miles an hour. At the trial he testified that it did not exceed six miles an hour. Commenting on this testimony, the defendant\u2019s counsel said in argument: \u201cIt is quite evident that he knew the general law of the state of New Hampshire that twenty-five miles are all right upon the state highways, and it was perfectly safe for him to say that he was running within that speed. But when he learned that there was in the state of New Hampshire a statute that provided that if he came the last hundred feet of that distance at an excess of ten miles an hour he was guilty of contributory negligence, then his speed came down to six miles an hour.\u201d P. L., c. 249, s. 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-12\">To a ruling permitting this argument to stand, the plaintiffs excepted. It is manifest from the opening averment that counsel did not profess to testify, but merely suggested in forceful language a probable explanation of Collishaw\u2019s contradictory assertions. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number><em>Topore </em>v. <em>Railroad, </em>79 N. H. 169. Since the suggested explanation might fairly be inferred from the evidence, the argument was unobjectionable. <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Railway, </em>79 N. H. 161; <em>Gosselin </em>v. <em>Company, </em>78 N. H. 149, 151; <em>Hamlin </em>v. <em>Philbrook, </em>78 N. H. 144, 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The order in each case is</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\n<em>Judgment on the verdict.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b284-7\">Allen and Branch, JJ., did not sit: the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
