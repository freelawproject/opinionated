As thus determined, the right of either seller or buyer \u201ctemporarily to withhold performance\u201d (2 Williston, Con., s. 869), or to refuse it absolutely <em>(Clark </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>51 N. H. 594, 596, and cases cited), depends upon the importance of the default or breach committed by the other party. The question is one of degree, to be decided ordinarily by the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">In the present case the trial court has found that the failure to pay was material and that the withholding of deliveries, even if a breach, was not a substantial one. Since there is abundant evidence to sustain this finding, the exceptions thereto are properly overruled and the motion for a directed verdict denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">The refusal of the court to rule that the plaintiff was obliged to give reasonable notice of, its intention to 'cancel the contract was unexceptionable because the plaintiff never elected to rescind. Deliveries were in fact continued up to the time the contract expired; the plaintiff merely withheld some 1,200 tons, which the trial court finds it had a right to withhold, in view of the unpaid balance. But even assuming that a duty of communication might have devolved upon the plaintiff under certain circumstances, such duty could hardly be said to exist in the present case, where the court finds no evidence to prove \u201cthat payments would have been made when due if refusal of further deliveries on account of non-payment had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>communicated.\u201d It is doubtful, moreover, if any exception lies to the \u201crefusal\u201d of the court to apply the principles of reasonable notice to the particular situation, in the absence of an appropriate request.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">The defendant claimed that the plaintiff\u2019s failure to deliver all the coal promised during the open season compelled it to make purchases elsewhere at an increased cost. Recovery of the amount so expended is sought under the plea in recoupment. The defendant excepted to the finding that \u201cno evidence of the open season was offered except as may be inferred from the specifications.\u201d While it is true that the defendant\u2019s division manager testified that in order to have coal enough to last through the winter months it was necessary to get approximately two months\u2019 supply each month during the summer, yet the specifications show deliveries in December, January, and February amounting to over $7,000, and the record fails to disclose any testimony whatever as to when the river was actually closed to navigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">This particular finding would seem to be inconsequential, however, in view of the further finding that it was not shown to be of material importance whether the defendant received coal by water or by rail, nor whether the deliveries were in equal monthly amounts during the open season \u201cso long as the plant had enough coal to keep running as it did until January 23, 1917.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">The remaining exception relates to a so-called ruling that the burden of proof was \u201cupon the defendant as to the matters covered\u201d by the findings. It does not appear, however, that any such ruling was made. The defendant\u2019s brief contains no reference to the exception, and it is understood to be waived. <em>Kenalos </em>v. <em>Company, </em>81 N.
