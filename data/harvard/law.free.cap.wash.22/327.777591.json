It is charged in the complaint that the respondents \u201cdid wilfully and unlawfully <em>permit </em>one John Doe to work and labor . . . more than eight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>hours in one calendar day.\u201d The superior court sustained a demurrer to the complaint, and the city has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Statutes and ordinances similar in character have been held unconstitutional by many courts, and we have not been cited to a single cas\u00e9 wherein their constitutionality is asserted. The principle upon which they are held to he unconstitutional is that they interfere with the constitutional right of persons to contract with reference to compensation for their services, where such services are neither unlawful nor against public policy, nor the employment such as might he unfit for certain classes of persons, \u2014 as females and infants.</p>\n<p id=\"AJA\">Every person <em>sui juris </em>has a right to make use of his labor in any lawful employment on his own behalf, or to hire it out in the service of others. This is one of the first and highest of civil rights.\u201d Cooley, Torts (2d ed.), p. 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">One of the most instructive cases upon the subject is the late one of <em>In re Morgan, </em>26 Colo. 415 (58 Pac. 1071, 47 L. R. A. 52), wherein the authorities are collated and the subject very exhaustively treated. See, also, <em>Low v. Rees Printing Co., </em>41 Neb. 127 (59 N. W. 362, 24 L. R. A. 702, 43 Am. St. Rep. 670), and <em>Ex Parte Kuback, </em>85 Cal. 274 (24 Pac. 737, 9 L. R. A. 482, 20 Am. St. Rep. 226).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">The judgment of the superior court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
