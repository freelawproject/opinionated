Williams brought suit against Oilly, <em>Noble </em>and <em>Befler, </em>whom he described as directors of school district No. 6, in Whitewater township. He declared in case against <em>\u201cthe directors of school district No. </em>5,\u201d <em>&amp;c., </em>without describing them by name, that the district was duly organized, and that one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Noble kept a common school there five months; that the plaintiff was a citizen and resident householder of the district, for five years, had property taxable for schools, had five white children over four years old which he sent to said school, who were refused admission, by the direction of the defendants. \u2014 Plea, not guilty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b607-4\">It was proven on the trial that the plaintiff was one-quarter negro, and his wife, the mother of his children, a white woman; and that the plaintiff had paid taxes for schools in 1831. All the other allegations in the declaration were admitted to be true. Upon which the court below gave it as their opinion that the plaintiff could not sustain his action, and the jury without retiring found for the defendants, on which finding judgment was rendered. The plea, verdict and judgment, were for and against school directors <em>JVo. </em>5, without name. The bill of exceptions describes the proceedings as relating to district <em>No. </em>6. The writ of error, &amp;c., is for No. 6.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b607-5\"><em>Strait </em>and <em>Hawes </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b607-6\"><em>Van Matre </em>and <em>N. </em>Wright, contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AguQ\">contend that the school fund is raised for <em>white children </em>only \u2014 the law used to prohibit black and mulatto persons \u2014 it is now changed and admits white persons only to participate in the school fund.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b607-7\">But if not so, this record shows a proceeding so defective that the plaintiff had no right to recover: (29 <em>O.

L. </em>422.) The real question we' are asked to decide is, whether the children of a <em>white </em>mother, and a <em>father </em>three-quarters <em>white </em>are <em>white children </em>within the meaning of the law? This Court in Bank, in <em>Gray v. Ohio, </em>(4 <em>O. </em>354), determined, that persons nearer white than a mulatto, or half blood were entitled to the privileges of whites. The color of the party does not sufficiently mark the distinction between the two races of people. In this case Mr. <em>Van Matre </em>and Mr. <em>N. Wright, </em>insist that we resort to the <em>color </em>or <em>complexion </em>to determine who are <em>white persons </em>and do not inquire of the blood. <em>It is obvious to us, </em>that a resort to <em>color </em>would be unsatisfactory, and might operate to exclude many [580 children not intended to be excluded by the legislature. We think the term white as used in the law, describes <em>blood, </em>and not <em>complexion, </em>and are satisfied with the construction heretofore given. The plaintiff\u2019s children, therefore, are white within the meaning of the law, though the defendants have had the shabby meanness to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>ask from him his contribution of tax, and exclude his children from the benefits of the schools he helped to support. He might well sustain the action, and the Common Pleas erred in determining otherwise on that ground; yet our examination shows that these proceedings have been so negligently conducted for the plaintiff, as to present for him no right to judgment; although, therefore, we decide the main question for the plaintiff in error, we must affirm the judgment, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">[White means preponderance of white blood, approved and followed; <em>Jeffries v.
