The record here is not authenticated in either way. It is not attested and duly certified\u2014 nor is the deposition of the magistrate of an examined copy of his -docket; but of independent facts, corresponding in some particulars, with the transcript, and in others explanatory, as with respect to the <em>S. </em>for <em>Solomon </em>bnt there is no reference to the transcript, nor proof that there is any docket entry. This kind of proof is inadmissible of a judgment or record which must be inspected by the court on this issue. But if it were duly authenticated, it appears to be of a judgment rendered on the <em>nineteenth </em>of October, while that \"^declared ujmn is of a judgment rendered on the <em>twenty-third </em>[431 of October, and, as no such record is exhibited to our inspection as that in issue, we must find for' the defendant.
