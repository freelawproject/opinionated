The defendant pleaded several pleas ; the eighth of which was, that the defendant, in May, 1819, <em>informed the sheriff </em>(who had an execution against Wood on the original judgment) <em>of property of Wood </em>more than <em>sufficient to satisfy the judgment. </em>To this there Avas a general demurrer and joinder.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b41-9\"><em>JBrazee, </em>for the demurrant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aa7\">contended that showing property without a levy was no bar.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b41-10\"><em>T. </em>Scott, contra.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b41-11\">WRIGHT, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AC0\">delivered the opinion of the court. It is very clear that a security upon an appeal bond cannot exonerate himself from liability on the bond, by barely <em>informing </em>the officer having an execution upon the original judgment against the principal debtor, that the debtor has property. In this case the plea goes no further. It does not show that the plaintiff Avas advised of the property, or that <em>in fact there was any ; </em>but oulv relies upon the fact that the defendant <em>said to the officer that there was property.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b41-12\">Demurrer sustained.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
