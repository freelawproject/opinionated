The declaration sets forth as inducement to this action, that the plaintiff was a journeyman brewer in the employ of one Metcalf, and charged two sets of words :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-11\">1st. He has been guilty of adultery. 2d. He puts tobacco in the ale and porter manufactured by Metcalf.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-12\">Plea, not guilty.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b62-13\"><em>Woodward </em>testified,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALr\">that Renforth asked him if he knew what was in the beer, &amp;e., and on receiving a reply in the negative, said there is tobacco, and I was ordered to put it in by Scott.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b62-14\"><em>Metcalf </em>testified,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Akh8\">that the defendant told him to put in tobacco, but he did not.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b62-15\"><em>Reeves </em>says,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AV6\">the defendant once said to him he could prove that tobacco was put in by Scott\u2019s orders, and afterwards said he did not put it in.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b62-16\">By other witnesses it was proven that the defendant said he had put some damned nasty stuff in by Scott\u2019s order, and if the people knew it, they would not drink it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b62-17\"><em>Winder </em>swore the defendant said,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZK\">Scott went to see Christy\u2019s wife, and went for nothing but to have connection with her.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b62-18\"><em>Reeves </em>swore,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4o\">he said Scott had connection with Christy\u2019s wife, and that he had know\u2019d her.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b62-19\"><em>N.

The proof here does not satisfy either requisition. It is, that Scott told the defendant to put in the tobacco, and he did not. This will not support the allegation in the declaration. We are of opinion that neither set of words are proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">A juror was withdrawn by consent and leave given to amend.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
