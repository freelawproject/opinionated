This case is between the same parties as the last. The bill sets up the same material facts as the last, and in addition, describes certain real estate, of which the testator died seized, and prays for an order to sell it.

The proceedings are had in the common pleas <em>as a probate court. </em>They are more summary and convenient than the proceedings in chancery, and so far as we can see, are adequate to effect the end. If found otherwise, and the ground of inadequacy is shown and relied upon, as a reason for coming into chancery, it is probable this court would take cognizance of the case; but without such disclosure, there is no occasion for coming into chancery.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">The bill is dismissed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
