Breach, damage to the books in their transit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b708-10\">It appeared in evidence that the plaintiff shipped eleven boxes of books in New York, in the Eekford line of tow-boats, and took a bill of lading to deliver in Cleveland, the dangers of the lake excepted, &amp;c., signed by the agent of Meech <em>&amp; </em>Co., on which was endorsed, <em>Smith &amp; Macy, </em>agents, Buffalo; that the books arrived in Cleveland in the schooner Columbus, which had been out several days from Buffalo in a gale, and were wet and injured by estimate $212. 96: that the defendant was one of the house of Smith &amp; Macy, Buffalo, who were extensively engaged as carriers, having twelve- or fifteen vessels on the lake, and the Columbus showed <em>their </em>flag,. 675] *and by reputation was owned by them: that there were several lines of tow, canal, steam and other vessels engaged in forwarding goods from New York west, generally owned by different persons, though connected in the line; some owned stock in several boats, others less. That Smith <em>&amp; </em>Macy were the forwarding agents-of Meech &amp; Co. in Buffalo: that the Eekford line was of tow-boats from New York to Albany only.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b708-11\"><em>S.

Because the contract declared upon was to carry, from New York to Buffalo, by the defendant, and the proof is of a contract with the Eekford line, to deliver at Cleveland, care of Smith <em>&amp; </em>Macy, Buffalo, and there is no evidence that the defendant is in any way connected in that line.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b708-13\">2. If the defendant would be liable as owner of the Columbus, he could only be made so on a declaration upon a sptecial contract-to carry <em>from </em>New York or from Buffalo.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b708-14\"><em>Willey, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANLR\">insisted the proof was of the same contract, only extending it a little.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b709-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>BY THE COURT.</author>\n<p id=\"AYQ\">The declaration is upon a contract to carry from New York to Cleveland. The proof is of a contract made with the Eekford line, not the defendant, and there is no proof from which it can be inferred the defendant is a partner in that company, but the reverse \u2014 no case, therefore, is made against the defendant. The case might be different if there was a count in the declaration against the defendant as common carrier, and the plaintiff relied upon the receipt of the goods by the defendant into the Golumbus, and the injury there, but that is not the case before us; there is no such count.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">Non suit ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
