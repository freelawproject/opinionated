Wood made oath before a justice that Humphrey was justly indebted to him an amount under $100, and that he was not a resident of the county. On this, a writ ;of attachment issued, which was returned, attached four cords of wood. Wood declared for work and labor. Another Mr. Wood then filed his claim before the justice <em>\u201c in due form of law </em>\u201d for more than $100. 'The justice made out a transcript from the docket, certifying these facts, which was filed in the Common Pleas <em>as an appeal. </em>Notice Was given by publication in the Gazette. After the third default, \u2022the court assessed the plaintiff\u2019s damages at $5.75, and gave him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>judgment for that sum with costs. The other Mr. Wood declared, on a special contract, by which he sold one hundred and sixty acres, of land in Athens county to Humphrey, to be paid for in wood in Cincinnati. As to this'claim, succeeding the third default, is the-following entry: \u201cWhereupon it is, upon inquiry by the court, <em>considered, </em>that the plaintiff recover $575 damages and $13.12 costs.\u201d' 567] *To reverse these judgments, Humphrey has procured a-writ of error, given bond to, and served citation on, both of the-Woods, who appear. The record returned, is an entire one, presenting the case as above.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b594-5\"><em>King </em>and <em>Walker, </em>for the plaintiff in error, made the following: points, to wit:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-6\">1.

L. </em>203) provides for issuing the writ upon oath \u201cthat the debtor <em>absconds </em>to the injury of his creditor,\u201d' or \u201cis not a resident of the county,\u201d which the constable is to-execute where he can find property in the presence of at least two credible witnesses, and with the assistance of two freeholders under oath, inventory the goods attached, have them appraised, and the appraisement signed by them and the constable returned with the-writ, &amp;c. It requires the constable to return the time and manner-of service, and declares that where a writ is so served, it shall bind <em>thqproperty </em>attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-12\">The twenty-second section of the act (p. 208) provides, that if on the return of the attachment against an <em>absconding </em>debtor, it shall be made appear to the justice there were <em>no goods to attach, </em>or <em>not sufficient, </em>the justice shall certify the proceedings to the next Court of Common Pleas, whereupon an attachment shall be issued by the court and be executed by the plaintiff, on the <em>lands of the-defendant </em>in the county, and the proceedings thereon shall <em>thenceforth </em>be as if the attachment had been originally commenced in the-Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-13\">The original attachment in this case was not against an <em>absconding debtor, </em>though it is probable, the parties supposed they were-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>pursuing the last clause of the act referred to. The writ was not \u00a1served in the presence of two witnesses, nor was there an inventory and appraisement returned according to the law. These proceedings are ex parte and in rem the statute must be strictly pursued, or no right is acquired under it. If, then, it appeared, that the property attached, was <em>insufficient, </em>the transcript was entered \u00a1\u00a1as an <em>appeal </em>which was without authority. The case was not one *to be certified up, because it was not against an absconding [568 \u25a0debtor; but if it could have been certified, no attachment was issued in the Common Pleas as required by law in such cases. The <em>appeal </em>was entered at March term, and <em>no default </em>was then taken. The three defaults were entered before judgment, but at subsequent terms. On the third default, the court assessed the original plaintiff\u2019s damages and gave him judgment. As to the other creditor, the inquiry \u25a0of damages, if any, is so mingled up with the judgment that it is difficult to see whether the' damages were assessed and the judgment thereon rendered, or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">The record is full of errors \u2014 and the judgments are reversed. The whole proceedings since their removal from the justice are void, \u25a0and before the justice there was no judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">[Attachment not to be executed beyond letter of statute; Win<em>chester v.
