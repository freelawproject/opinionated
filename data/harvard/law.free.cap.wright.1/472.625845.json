The note endorsed, and the clock, were delivered to Neill, as a stakeholder, to deliver to the winner. Barrett and Wheeler afterwards agreed not to run, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>and to withdraw the bet. The defendant, without authority, had cashed the note, and on being notified of the abandonment of the bet, refused to deliver the note or the cash, and the plaintiff brought suit. On the trial in the Common Pleas, the plaintiff offered evidence of these facts, which being objected to, was ruled out by the court, and judgment as of non suit rendered. To reverse which judgment, this writ of error is brought.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b495-4\"><em>*S. W.

Therefore this matter cannot be reversed on error, because the discretion of the Common Pleas was not that of this court. If otherwise, however, the contract here was illegal, and cannot be enforced; 1 <em>Car. &amp; P. </em>613; 3 <em>Car. &amp; P. </em>376; 1 <em>Halls N. Y. S. C.

Our statute makes void all agreements where any part of the consideration is for a horse-race, or for money, or other thing lost or won, laid, staked or betted, upon a horse-race, or for money <em>borrowed </em>to <em>bet, </em>and authorizes the loser, and if he neglect, any other person, to sue for and recover the loss. We think with <em>C. J. Abbott, </em>1 <em>Car. &amp; P. </em>13, that the time of the court is not to be taken up in trying which dog or man wins a battle or a race. But this case does not involve that inquiry; no race has been run. An improper agreement was made to run, and the parties becoming satisfied of its impropriety, abandoned it. It seems to us such agreements ought all to be abandoned, not kept, and it would be iniquitous to allow a depositary, under such circumstances, to plunder the repenting and retracting parties. Our statute expressly authorizes the loser to sue for and recover back the loss; 29 <em>O. L. </em>443. Will you then say there shall be no rescission of the contract, drive on the race, and give an action, when you will not allow a recovery before ? The late case in England, 3 <em>Car. &amp; P. </em>371, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>be sure, holds that you can recover, if the event bet upon does not happen. The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">[Rescission of illegal contract should be encouraged. Locus pcenitentiae; <em>Hooker v. DePalos, </em>2 <em>C. S. C. R. </em>369, 378.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
