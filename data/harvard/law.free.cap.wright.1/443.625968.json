The facts of the case are these: Cook contacted vith one Beam, who held under contract with Smith, for one hundred and twenty acres of land, at about $1,320, in payments, went into possession of the land, and paid on his contract about $350. He then entered into a contract with the comjilainant, Carter, by which he agreed to sell the land to him, on payments, and put him into possession. Cook was unthrifty, and under judgment for the purchase which Carter refused to pay or to secure, and finding it difficult to keep along with his family or secure the land, applied to McGiffin to assist him, and to save something for the family. Mc-Giffin at first refused, knowing Cook\u2019s habits; but finally agreed, 444] *in order to secure the benefit of the contract with Carter, or the land for the support of Mrs. Cook and her children, that he would make advances, pay for the land, and take a title absolutely to himself, clear of any claim of Cook in law or equitjn McGiffin notified Carter, that his object in purchasing, .was, to compel him to complete his bargain with Cook, in good faith, for the benefit of the wife and children, or to secure to them the land for a home, and that he would allow no more payments made to Cook ; Carter then refused to fulfil the agreement, or to surrender. There was then clue Smith, who held the title of the land, about $200, the payment of which he was pressing; Carter refused to pay, and McGiffin paid and took the title to himself. Shortly after this, as Carter had been in possession of the farm for about eight years, and had several times refused to complete his contract, McGiffin brought ejectment and recovered ; and then Carter took a lease from him. He then agreed with Cook to rescind the contract for the land. After this, the possession was surrendered by Carter to Cook, without consulting McGiffin, or giving him any notice, until all was done. Cook and Carter disagreed about the compensation Carter should receive, upon the rescission of the contract, and arbitrated the matter. An award was made in favor of Carter for $477.11, on which he obtained judgment against Cook, took out execution and sold all his personal property. There is still a part of the judgment unpaid, and Cook <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>Is insolvent. There is no proof of the exact contract between Carter and Cook.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b465-5\"><em>H.

The allegation of fraud in McGiffin, either in fact, or in law, is not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b465-9\">WRIGHT, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWz\">1. Had Carter any lien on the land for his payments \u2022on account of the purchase ? If there was a valid contract between Carter and Cook, he undoubtedly had a lien for the money paid upon *the purchase before the transfer to McGiffin. McGiffin comes [445 Into the title while Carter was in possession claiming right, and is \u2022ehargeable with notice to the extent of his equity \u2014 no farther. What was that equity? It could, in the nature of things, only be a right to.a conveyance according to the contract. What the contract really was, is not disclosed to us. Did he comply, or show a \u25a0disposition to comply ? Both before and after McGiffin took the title, he refused to pay for the land or discharge the claim of Smith, \u25a0so that Smith was threatening to sell the land to make the money. McGiffin saved the property from sale. Did Carter then comply \u25a0with his contract? No, he still refused; and McGiffin resorted to an ejectment as the best mode of compelling payment. Carter then became McGiffin\u2019s tenant, and took from him a lease. After this, without regard to his landlord\u2019s interest, and against a positive notice not to deal farther with Cook in the premises, he surrendered the contract to Cook, and took his personal responsibility for the advances. If before that time the land was responsible to him when he completed his contract, or was liable for his advances against a person coming into the title with notice of his equity, did that responsibility continue after be voluntarily surrendered it to Cook, and took his personal liability in its stead? We think not. His <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>claim now is not to enforce the original\u2019 contract as a lien on the-land, but to enforce his new contract with Cook, made after Mc-Giffin\u2019s right attached, with full notice of McGiffin\u2019s rights, and in opposition to them. The award is not attached as a charge upon the land, in any view we take of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">2. Did a trust result from this purchase by McGiffin to Cook ?' As a general rule where one pays for land, and the title is taken to another, a trust results to him who paid the money. If Cook paid the money, a trust resulted to <em>him. </em>His interest was passed to McGiffin before the award. McGiffin is willing to complete the contract, and in a condition to do so if Carter will make it known and perform his part; but Carter refuses, and asks this court to make the new contract of Cook to pay him money of subsequent date to McGiffin\u2019s rights, a charge upon the land. This we are not disposed to do. If he seeks equity, he must show a disposition to do equity himself. We cannot aid him in any combination with. Cook, to defraud McGiffin. The,utmost he can claim is to be let in to perform his original contract \u2014 that he does not ask.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">3. Is the transaction between McGiffin and Cook fraudulent as. against creditors ? McGiffin\u2019s object appears to be to secure a home, for his sister and her children, against the <em>future </em>improvidences of 446] *the husband and father. It did not contemplate cutting off any one then a creditor of Cook, or the protection of the property from his existing creditors; it had no object of injury to any one, and intended no fraud in law or fact. Why, then, was it not lawful ? McGiffin was ready to perform Cook\u2019s agreement, but Carter refused, and stood out until the land was about to become forfeit,, and then, and not before, did McGiffin take the title to prevent a forfeiture. After this he was willing to comply with the contract,, but Carter still refused. He then transferred his interest to Cook,, relinquished to him, and took his responsibility for the consideration of the surrender. For this claim upon Cook, originating long after McGiffin acquired his right to the land, and got up in direct opposition to his interest, he asks a court of equity to charge upon the land; and to let in this equitable claim, he prays us to regard McGiffin\u2019s purchase fraudulent. Whatever claim might result in favor of one who had been deceived into a credit of Cook by the appearance of ownership in the land resulting from mere occupancy by the family, even that pretext is not found to favor the complainant. Mc-Giffin\u2019s purchase was not made to defraud creditors generally or Carter in particular. One of its objects was to fulfil Carter\u2019s contract, which he refused to execute. The lien he had,, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>be first'refused to assert, and then voluntarily surrendered. Even if McGiffin were held a mortgagee, and Carter claimed to be let in to redeem, he would be required to pay him what he advanced, or if refused, to have brought it into court. That he has not chosen to do, nor even expressed a willingness to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The bill is dismissed with costs to the defendant McGiffin.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">[Constructive notice; <em>Brooks v. </em>Lange, 2 <em>W.
