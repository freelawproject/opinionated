This suit was brought in behalf of the daughter of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>the plaintiffs in the last suit, against the same defendant. The plaintiff counted upon the following words: \u201cStevens keeps a whore house, and Phebe is a whore \u2014 Ida has gone to Stevens\u2019, and Stevens keeps a damned whore house; and Debby and Phebe were not able to stand the three tanyard blackguards; and Stevens\u2019 wife, and all the Delanys are whores.\u201d Plea, not guilty, and issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b134-5\">The plaintiff proved by <em>Eliza Rittenhouse, </em>that the defendant said Stevens kepi a damned whore house, and Phebe and Debby had taken on a new mode of making money by their arses. Phebe and Debby are not able to stand the three tanyard blackguards, and took Ida to stand John Lisle, and if it had not been for the fever sore on Phebe\u2019s leg, she would have had the other leg broke long before this time.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b134-6\">By <em>David Rittenhouse, </em>the same thing.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b134-7\">By <em>Margaret Riggs,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEl\">that the defendant said Phebe Stevens and Debby Delaney had got a great many fine things in a curious way, and kept blackguards\u2019 company, &amp;c.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b134-8\">By <em>Mary Graham,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AVL\">that he said if Phebe\u2019s leg had not been sore, she would have had the other leg broke; and also, that they had taken Ida in to help Debby and Phebe stand the tanyard fellows.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b134-9\">It was also proven, on cross-examination, that the defendant respected tbe plaintiff, whose character was good, and that he had named a child for her; that Ida was a servant of the defendant\u2019s, and had left him and gone to Stevens\u2019; and the defendant was talking about her leaving when he uttered the slander.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b134-10\">124] *A motion was made for a non suit, because the words were not proved.

If the words are proven, or so much of either set is proven, as imputes the crime of being a whore, the action is sustained. It is not necessary to prove the <em>identical </em>words; proof of the substance is sufficient. The innuendo is.to give application to words; it cannot extend their meaning beyond their ordinary acceptation. Words not laid in the declaration, which were spoken at the same time with those charged, and explain their sense, may be considered, and will excuse the defendant if they show the other words to have been spoken in an innocent meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-14\">Verdict for the plaintiff, $163.50, and judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
