The defendant claims title under a sheriff\u2019s deed and sale upon execution.

The statute of February, 1824, 22 <em>O.

In this case there has been a judgment, levy, appz-aisement, sale, order of confizunation, and deed; but a defect in the appraisement has been discovered, which escaped the notice of counsel before, and the court in confirming the sale. This court has decided heretofore, .that the purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale relies upon the judgment, the levy, sale, and deed; and that all other questions as to the regularity of the proceedings, are between the parties to the judgment and the officer; 3 <em>O. </em>191; 4 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number><em>Wheat. </em>503; 16 <em>John. </em>537; 3 <em>Bibb, </em>217.
