Plea \u2014 Non assumpsit. On trial it was proven that Forsyth and Dobbin, of Wheeling, sold goods to the defendants and charged them, but never delivered the goods ; afterwards the defendants procured F. <em>&amp; </em>D. to charge them to the *plaintiff, upon which they sued the plaintiff in Wheeling, [93 Virginia, and recovered. To recover back the money so paid on said judgment, this suit is brought.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b101-9\"><em>S. W.

This case was brought up by appeal from the Court of Common Pleas by the defendants, and the recovery here is for a greater sum than was recovered in the court below. The 111th section of the practice act, 29 <em>O. L. </em>78, provides that when a case is appealed by the defendant, and the plaintiff shall re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>cover the same or a larger sum than was recovered in the Court of Common Pleas, then the Supreme Court shall render judgment for the sum so recovered, with costs. That there was no judgment in the lower court for costs does not affect the question. We are required to render judgment in this class of cases for the whole costs, including those expended in both courts.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
