Mathis, the tenant of McCord, brought quare clausum fregit on the rented land, and treading down grass by McCord\u2019s cattle. Plea, not guilty, with a notice of accord, and satisfaction. On trial, the plaintiff offered evidence and claimed to have proven that McCord agreed to keep the fences in repair\u2014 that it was the common custom of landlords to keep up the fences; that McCord\u2019s cattle voluntarily entered through and over the fence into the field. On this, the court below charged the jury, that the plaintiff must prove that the defendant wilfully caused the cattle to enter the fields, or he could not. recover; and if the proof was that they entered without his agency, then, under our law, the injured party must call on the fence-viewers and have the damages assessed on view. There was a verdict for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b679-10\"><em>*Bayles </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b679-11\"><em>James, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1i\">cited 12 <em>Mod. </em>335; <em>Ham.

If he relied upon the <em>custom, </em>or the injury resulted indirectly from the defendant\u2019s acts, it was consequential, and he should have brought a special action on the <em>case. </em>In either event he could not recover in trespass. Was the proof as set forth in the bill of exceptions <em>all </em>that was given? This does not appear. Did the cattle do any injury? Was the accord made out? We cannot answer these questions from the record. If other proof were offered, the error, if any, may have occasioned no injury to the plaintiff. If the record shows all the proof, the judgment was rightly for the defendant, for assumpsit or case was the proper remedy, not trespass \u2014 if all the evidence is not set out, the charge of the court may have been erroneous, but the record does not show the error, and we cannot presume that the court erred. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
