This case was originally brought by Payne before a justice of the peace, for a fine of $10.25, assessed ^against the defendant as a militia officer. At the trial, the [370 plaintiff produced a certified list from the court of appeals, showing a fine annexed to Knight\u2019s name of $10.25. The defendant then offered evidence to show that he was not liable to fine, which the justice refused, and gave judgment for the plaintiff. The proceedings were removed to the Common Pleas by certiorari and affirmed. It is now assigned for error, that the court should have reversed the justice\u2019s proceedings.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number><em>Perkins, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Alc\">cited the twenty-eighth section of the-militia law of 1820, and the thirty-ninth section of the act of 1831; 3 <em>Cranch, </em>331; <em>Com.

There is no right of action, if the list has not been advertised the time required. The paymaster should have proven the notice, and the omission to do so left him with no right to a judgment. The judgment is reversed with costs, and remanded to the Court of Common Pleas, with instructions to reverse the judgment-of the justice, and set the cause for hearing under the statute.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
