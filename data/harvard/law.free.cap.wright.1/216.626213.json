The case in 3 <em>Peters, </em>44, creates an exception to this rule ; but the case on trial is not within that exception. In that case, there had been a disclaimer of the landlord\u2019s title, and an adverse possession. The right to sell by the representative of the personalty, is not an <em>adverse </em>title to that of the intestate, but the same title. The testimony is excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-15\">Verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-16\">Motion for a new trial overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
