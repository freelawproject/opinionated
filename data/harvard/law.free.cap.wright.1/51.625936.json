He then offered an exemplification of a judgment [52 in the seventh Circuit Court of the United States, of the 8th September, 1822, in favor of the Batik of the United States <em>v. </em>Edward White, for $29,798.43 damages, and $119.88 costs. Also, a <em>ft. fa. </em>issued from the same court, in a case between the same parties, returned with a levy on sec. 1, &amp;c., which remained unsold for want of bidders. He then produced an exemplification of <em>\u2022&amp;, vend\u00ed exponas, </em>certified by the clerk of that court to have issued upon the same judgment, on which was endorsed a sale to the plaintiffs, by the <em>marshal.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b59-4\"><em>E.

It is necessary to prove a judgment, as well as an execution. No one will pretend to make title through a <em>vend\u00ed, </em>without a jndgment and levy. The original executions are competent evidence, and exemplified copies, under the seal of the court, are received, not because they are <em>records, </em>for the execution and proceedings on them form no part of the final record in the cause, as they are issued and returned, after the record is completed ; but because they are papers belonging to the clerk\u2019s office, papers which the public is interested in preserving in a known place, stationary, in the public office. What appears on the face of the execution or return, the clerk may certify under the seal of the court, and it will be admitted. What the clerk so certifies in this ease shows <em>prima facie </em>that this <em>vend\u00ed </em>issued upon a different judgment than the one relied upon. His certificate, that this execution was, as a matter of fact, within his own knowledge, issued upon this same judgment, is not of any matter of record, or copy of any paper filed in his office. We know no law or usage, making the written statement of the clerk of any court, under the seal of the court, evidence of <em>facts </em>within the knowledge of the clerk. If <em>his </em>knowledge is to be made evidence, he should be sworn, and testify as other witnesses do. It is com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>petent to prove as a matter of fact, by competent evidence, that this 53] execution was *issued upon the judgment in question, but without sucli evidence the <em>vendi </em>must be rejected. The clerk\u2019s certificate is not competent to prove that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">The plaintiff having no other evidence, submitted to a non suit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
