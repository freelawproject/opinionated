Palmer sued Harper in assumpsit upon a note, payable in cattle. A trial was had on the plea of non assumpsit, and notice that by a subsequent agreement, the time for the delivery of the cattle was extended, and a tender -and refusal within the extended time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-13\">The clerk of the Court of Common Pleas certifies to this court,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AF4O\">1. That the court instructed the jury to seal up and deliver their verdict to their foreman, or the court would receive it at chambers without seal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-14\">\u25a0 The jury found for the defendant the agreement and tender as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>set forth in the notice. The verdict was given to a judge at hi\u00bb' chambers. At the opening of the court in the morning, before the verdict was entered on the minutes or published in open court,' the plaintiff gave notice that he should not answer when called, but suffer a voluntary non suit. The verdict was entered and judgment rendered upon it, notwithstanding the notice.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b402-4\"><em>Giddings </em>and <em>Wade, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aye5\">objected to these proceedings\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b402-5\">1. That the plaintiff should have been called and non suited. At common law he was demandable every day, and if he failed to appear he was non suited. If he did not like the verdict when demanded, he had a right to become non suited. 4 <em>Jac. L. Dict. </em>406; 402; 3 <em>Blk. C. </em>376; 5 <em>Mod. </em>208; 12 <em>Petersdf. </em>766.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b402-6\">BY THE COURT.</author>\n<p id=\"A4LU\">The mode of receiving a verdict and of permitting non suits, is mere matter of practice, for our own courts to-establish; in this they are not necessarily governed by the practice in other states or countries. Here there was no offer to enter a non suit, nor asking for leave, but a mere giving of notice by the plaintiff, that if called he should not answer, but submit to a non 384] *suit. He was not called or non suited, and be now complain\u00bb that he was not. The right to demand daily, and to enforce a non-suit for non aj&gt;pearance, does not seem to us to bear much upon the-question; but this matter is not before us. It is presented only on the certificate of the clerk of the Common Pleas, instead of being placed on the record by bill of exception. We do not see anything, illegal in the receipt, or entry of the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The omission to find the value of the property tendered, we will advise ujjon.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">The cause was taken under advisement to Medina county, and there decided by Judges Wright and Wood.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">BY THE COURT. The finding of the jury is for the defendant that he tendered, as in the notice. The law, 29 <em>O. L. </em>121, provides that if the jury in such cases find <em>that the defendant did tender, they shall assess the value of the property tendered, </em>upon which judgment shall be rendered for the amount against the defendant, without interest or costs, unless the defendant forthwith perform his contract,, or satisfy the court that he will perform as it may order, and if that is done there shall be judgment for the defendant. The judgment here was for -the defendant for costs, y'et he has .the property ten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>dered, without delivery, or order, or the value found. We think the judgment erroneous, and it is reversed and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
