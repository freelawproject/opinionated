Gardiner was sued on a note, payable to Wright, or order, endorsed to M\u2019Dowell in his lifetime.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b800-17\">The original writ was to answer <em>in a plea of assumpsit, </em>without stating any damages. The endorsement on the writ described the note declared on. The defendant appeared at the return of the writ, and was discharged on common bail, but no technical <em>appear</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number><em>\u25a0anee </em>was entered. Thefe was no rule for a plea, but at the second term the defendant was called, defaulted, the damages assessed, And judgment rendered for the damages and costs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b801-4\"><em>O.

The want \u25a0of an ad damnum in the writ, if of any importance, is cured. The endorsement on the writ shows what the suit is for; the defendant <em>appeared </em>in court and obtained his discharge on common bail, and should then have raised the objection to the form of the writ. \u25a0Omitting to do so then, he waives the objection, and the plaintiff claiming damages in his declaration, supplies the defect. The ^omission to enter a technical <em>appearance </em>in our practice is of [763 no consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">The judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">[Summons \u2014 how waived; <em>Whitehead v.
