Bowers laid out the \"town of Montgomery. Morris, a supervisor of highways, pulled \u00abdown Morris\u2019s fences across the streets and alleys of the town, and \u2022opened them for public use. Bowers brought suit against him for the trespass in breaking his close \u2014 not guilty was pleaded with notice of the special matter to be given in evidence. On trial, 'Bowers proved his occupancy of the land, and that Morris entered .and pulled down his fences. The defendant then offered to proVe \u25a0the laying out of the town by the plaintiff, and that he sold the lots; that the defendant was a supervisor of highways, the town was in his district, and that he only removed the fences from the /streets and alleys of the town, so as to open them for use, which was objected to and ruled out by the court. Morris then offered a \u2022copy of the plat of the town duly recorded, but not acknowledged, with a deed to himself of one of the lots, and also a copy of a second and later plat, duly acknowledged and recorded, varying the plat, which was also objected to, and ruled out by the court. It is assigned for error, that the court below erred in ruling out this \u25a0evidence.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b787-7\"><em>Galdivell </em>and Inin, for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABLg\">insisted the evidence /should have been admitted.

The [750 plat was good without acknowledgment to vest the use of the /streets in the town, though an acknowledgment was necessary to pass the fee to the county.

It would be manifestly unjust -to do so. Th-e.plat is \u00a1made, recorded, and lots sold, bounded -o.ia streets, &amp;c.; \u00a1the grantor should not make his own act void, as a consequence of his .own laches. The law does not so intend.
