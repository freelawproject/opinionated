Cause, adultery with one Danforth, and wilful absence, It appeared the parties were married five years since in Guernsey, and lived more than a year together. She had a full grown child about five months after the marriage. She left her husband, and went to live at Danforth\u2019s, where she continued some time. What occasioned the separation is not explained; nor does it appear that he went for her to return, or that she refused to return. There is proof, that while living at Danforth\u2019s, in a cabin with one room and two beds, Danforth, with his wife and child, and Mrs, Scott, lay altogether, though not undressed, one night, on one bed, the other remaining unoccupied. Mrs. Scott had a child in .about two years after she left her husband. They lived but a few miles apart. His character was good.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b491-12\"><em>W. B.

It can hardly be supposed that Danforth com- [470 mitted adultery with this woman, while his wife and child were lying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>beside Mm. As to the child, it may be the petitioner\u2019s; they lived within a few mile.s of each other, and may-have had intercourse; there should be some proof more than we have, that he did not see her. The absence of the wife may have been by the procurement of the husband; at any rate, there is no evidence it was wilful on her part, or against his will; but there is no evidence from which it may be inferred, the absence was by his procurement. Bill dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
