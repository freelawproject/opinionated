The 1st count on a note, dated 26th April, 1831, for $1,647.30, in assorted castings and pig iron, on demand; 2d, on a receipt of the same date and tenor; 3d, on a special assumpsit; 4th, the common counts.

They then proved a demand of payment and a refusal, until Wheeler discharged a mortgage, which the defendant claimed was a lien on the purchase, but which Wheeler denied had existence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b382-12\">The defendant objected that the suit should have been brought pn the <em>original </em>contract, and not on the receipt, referring to it. A verdict was taken for the plaintiff for $1,857.69, subject to the opinion of the court on the objection raised.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b383-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number><em>Giddings, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Apxa\">now moved to set aside the verdict, and for a non suit. He contended that the receipt does not support the suit, as it only ascertains the value, leaving the payment to be judged by the contract, and fails to explain the terms of the contract. That the contract was between different persons, and is variant from the proof and suit. He cited 3 <em>Stark.

It referred to the contracts to ascertain \u25a0what articles the defendant was bound to receive. It showed they were bound to receive all the coal and ore on hand, not over one hundred thousand pounds of the former, and seven hundred tons of the latter, and to pay in pig iron, castings, and those good and assorted, not exceeding sixty tons pig and sixteen tons castings, at wholesale prices. The receipts were for what had been received. There is nothing in the contract about the mortgage, though that is the ground of refusal to pay.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b383-5\">BY THE COURT.</author>\n<p id=\"AHK\">The paper called a receipt establishes the amount of goods received, and stipulates to pay under the contract.
