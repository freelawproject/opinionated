Under this contract, no suit can be brought for the $4,000, until all is due, as the contract does not determine the \u25a0amount of the annual payments. The four years have not expired.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b609-14\">BY THE COURT.</author>\n<p id=\"AVdq\">The real question is, whether after the expiration of a year from the date of the contract, the first $1,000 being paid, anything can be recovered on this contract? We understand the legal effect of the contract to be, to pay in four equal annual instalments, and the plaintiff can therefore recover the $1,000 with interest. Judgment accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
