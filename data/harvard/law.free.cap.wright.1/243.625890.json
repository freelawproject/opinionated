Cause, wilful absence more than three years. The defendant in her answer denied that she left the complainant\u2019s house, but alleged that she attended to her duties, until at his request she left him, in order that he might get a wife more suited to his character.

Wolf left of her own accord. She spent one-night, or perhaps two\u2022 nights with her husband <em>alone. </em>Sometimes she was at meeting, and sometimes she was elsewhere. They did not enjoy life well. He-did not like her going to meeting, and spoke to her about it. She-said she would come and go when she pleased. She did not attend to the domestic concerns. They were married in a few weeks after their first acquaintance. She went to Mrs. James\u2019, her relative, and. has been there ever since.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b258-7\"><em>Mrs. Huston </em>was sent to the defendant by the plaintiff to tell her-that he wanted an interview, that he wanted to see her.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_V\">She said: he was an old Wolf, and might stay in his den \u2014 he was an old rascal \u2014she said she did not love him when she married him, but did not know but she might, and she would have nothing to do with him..

The conduct of the parties, the withdrawal of the answer, the matter-stated in it, the manner of the separation, and the subsequent acts 244] and declara-*tions, excite suspicion. It is incredible that the-relation of man and wife should have been broken up, for the only reason disclosed in evidence. There must be something kept back by collusion, or otherwise. In this state of the case, the plaintiff' may dismiss his bill, without prejudice, or continue it, as he shall be advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">The cause was continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-11\">At May term, 1834, the cause was again brought to hearing,, and further evidence heard.
