In Chancery. The complainant\u2019s, intestate, in his life time, purchased a tract of land and paid for it, and afterwards took a conveyance to his wife.

The other assets being exhausted, this bill is filed against the widow and heirs to sell the land conveyed to the wife, which is still held by her, to pay the debts of the intestate.

A prima facie exception to this rule is found, where the father pays the consideration, and the conveyance is to the child, which is held an advancement of the child unless it expressly appear the father did not intend it as such. If that appear, the child holds in trust; 2 <em>Mad. Ch. </em>112; 2 <em>John. Ch. </em>51; 11 <em>John. </em>107; 5 <em>O. </em>256.
