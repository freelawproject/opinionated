Cuyler declared below in assumpsit, in four counts \u2014 the three first, special, on a note drawn by one Sheldon, payable to Crandall or <em>bearer, </em>and endorsed by Crandall to the plaintiff; and the fourth the common money counts. Plea, non assumpsit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b396-16\">At the trial the note was offered <em>endorsed </em>in blank, and the attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>ney for the plaintiff at the bar, without the knowledge or consent of Crandall, wrote over his name these words: <em>u I guaranty the payment of the within note.\u201d </em>The note and endorsement, though objected to, was admitted by the court. The plaintiff then offered to prove that in 1827, the note was given to him in payment of a pair of horses, and when it fell due the maker was notoriously insolvent, but he offered no evidence of a demand of the maker, or excuse for the omission, or that he had tried to collect the money of him. He then proved that Sheldon died insolvent after the note fell due, and that after his death the defendant promised to pay it, and in 1830 offered *to work for the horses \u2014 but he offered no evidence that at [379 these times the defendant knew of the neglect to demand payment of the maker or of any other guarantee on the note, than that of a common endorser. At this stage of the trial the plaintiff abandoned his special counts, and rested. The defendant then prayed the court to withdraw the note from the jury, but the court refused, and instructed the jury to disregard it, to lay it out of view as the basis of the plaintiff\u2019s recovery, but if the note was delivered to the plaintiff for horses, they ought to find for the defendant. There was a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff, and a motion for a new trial, which was overruled.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b397-4\"><em>Wilder, </em>for a plaintiffs in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6I4\">claims to reverse this judgment, because the court erred in permitting the note to go to the jury, and instructing them as it did. He cited 10 <em>John. </em>418.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b397-5\">WRIGHT, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARb\">The case cited from the 10th <em>John. </em>418, decided merely a question of variance; the declaration in that case described the note as containing the words, for value received, while the note offered did not contain the words. We do not see its application to the case before us. If the note was not negotiable, it is not within the law merchant, and if there be a special endorsement of a guarantee upon it, the party having so elected to make it, must abide by the contract, as he has made it. He cannot abandon a <em>subsisting </em>contract, and resort to the common counts. When the note was admitted to the jury, it was competent evidence, applicable to some of the counts. That it was not afterwards withdrawn, is not, as we perceive, injurious to the defendant, as the jury were instructed not to regard it as a ground of the plaintiff\u2019s recovery. What other evidence was given to warrant the jury in finding on the money counts, for the plaintiff, is not shown by the record, nor is it complained of that the court refused a new trial. It is not our province now to inquire whether the jury found right. If there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>was error, as there <em>probably </em>was, yet on the case disclosed in this record the error is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
