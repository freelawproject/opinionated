The process was served on the other three, and judgment and execution was had against them. A levy was made on goods which were replevied and a replevy bond given, with the present plaintiff as security, and that the defendant had been made liable to execution on the replevin bond.

B. and C., who were jointly liable for a sum of money to a stranger. There is no privity between the plaintiff and this defendant. Bail may resort to his principal for indemnity; but not to another person, merely because that other person was liable for the same original debt, and <em>might </em>be liable over to the principal of the <em>bail, </em>if he were \u2019\u2022\u2018compelledto pay. The case in 8 <em>T. R. </em>308 is not analogous\u2014 [218 that in the 3 <em>O. </em>42, seems exactly in point, and against the plaintiff\u2019s claim.
