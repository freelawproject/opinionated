The testimony is voluminous and contradictory. We feel indisposed to try such a question, and the more so, as in such inquiries, depending on matters of opinion, it is important to <em>see </em>the witnesses, in order to form a judgment of their competency and skill, to form an accurate opinion upon the question of sanity. An issue must be made up, and sent to a jury.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
