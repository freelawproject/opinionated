It is by law made the duty of the justice, if he recognizes a party to answer to the complaint, to return the recognizance, with a transcript of his proceedings, to. the clerk of the Court of Common Pleas, or to the attorney for the state in the county, <em>without unnecessary delay, </em>29 <em>O. L. </em>197. After the justice, acting as an examining magistrate, has recognized a party, he has expended his entire power over the case, and can no more interfere with it, and if he do so, as in the case before us, his acts are <em>null and void. </em>The notice to the complaining party, and his neglect to prosecute, does' not make the justice\u2019s discharge valid. The party accused, however, can, if he choose, obtain his discharge, by application to the Court of Common Pleas, and when that is done, may sue, the prosecution being then at an end.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">The demurrer is sustained.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
