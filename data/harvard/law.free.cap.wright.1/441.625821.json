The suit below was trover for a horse. Ritchy, the plaintiff, claimed the horse as a gift from Post, his father in-law. Martin, the defendant, claimed under a purchase from the administrators of Post. On the trial, the plaintiff, amongst other evidence of the gift to him, offered to prove the declarations 442] *of Post, that the horse had been so given to Ritchy, and was his property, which was objected to and ruled out by the court, as the declaration of a third person, a stranger to the transaction. The single question raised is, whether this testimony was admissible.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b462-9\"><em>Stewart, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXRs\">cited 1 <em>Taunt. </em>141.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b462-10\">WRIGHT, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3Sx\">The deceased, Post, was the common source of title to the horse. The plaintiff claimed as the donee of Post, and the defendant as the vendee of Post\u2019s administrators, the same interest. It would seem hardly to admit of doubt that Post\u2019s declarations were evidence against his own title, and that the defendant, who claimed only to have afterwards come in to his right, could not object to it. We think the evidence competent. .The judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
