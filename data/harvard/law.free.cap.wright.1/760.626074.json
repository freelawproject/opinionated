Charge, that he was a mere pretende!-, Hartfoi-d convention federalist, demagogue, traitor. He welcomed the British during the last war into Oastine and condemned the war as unjust. -He was the tool of the notorious scoundrel Samuel Upton, and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>close connection with him, as cashier of the Bank of Castine, when they swindled the people out of their money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b799-4\">Plea, not guilty, with notice that the whole matter of the libel was true.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b799-5\">The libel was read, and it was admitted the .defendant was the publisher of the paper, and the plaintiff rested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b799-6\">*The defendant then introduced sundry depositions to prove [761 that Brooks was a federalist, voted for Caleb Strong for governor, and the party called the tory party, and thought the embargo and the late war unjust, and did much to bring the democratic party into disrepute. It appeared also that he was cashier of the Castine bank, which had failed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b799-7\">In rebutting, it was proved, that Brooks was honest, upright, and patriotic; commanded a volunteer company during the war; illuminated his house when the British evacuated Castine; had voted for General Jackson, and, until lately, been his supporter.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b799-8\"><em>O. Parish </em>then asked the court to permit him to be a little irregular in this cause. He proposed to show,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b799-9\">1. That Brooks was a political gladiator, engaged in the political battle, to establish the defendant\u2019s right to retaliate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b799-10\">2.

The declaration is for writing and publishing. The English judges say, if it appear that the libel was written by others, the action is not supported: 13 <em>East </em>354.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b799-14\">\n<em>G.

The case in <em>East </em>is one of variance, and has no application to the question be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>fore us. Giving the author is matter of justification, resorted to-where slander is promulgated alone on the authority of another. Evidence of that kind cannot be given without special plea or notice \u2014not under the issue in this case. The evidence is inadmissible.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b800-4\"><em>Gilbert, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p id=\"AsM\">then offered to prove that he demanded the author, and proposed to sue him if given up, which was refused.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b800-5\"><em>Parish </em>objected.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ABTh\">* <em>Gilbert </em>and <em>Swan </em>argued to the jury for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p id=\"ADqN\">and <em>O.

He proposed for himself and colleague to give up their fees, and that judgment should be entered for $50, the expense of taking the depositions, and costs, and the residue of the verdict; which being agreed <em>to, </em>was done accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
