The plaintiff claimed title under Susan Cutter, one of the heirs of *Seth Cutter, deceased. A deed was produced executed and [232 acknowledged in Kentucky, the signature of the grantor proved.

He then read the deed, and record, and rested.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b246-8\">On the part of the defence a deed from Susan Foster to Mr. Hargrave was offered in evidence.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b246-9\"><em>V.

Where a party attempts to establish the execution of a deed solely by the certificate of acknowledgment, we are more particular than we are in cases where the execution is proved independent of the acknowledgment as in this case. There is proof that this deed was in fact executed by the grantor, and it appears to have been duly acknowledged and recorded. We incline to think the execution prima facie established, and to admit the deed in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The plaintiff then offered a deed from Foster and wife (late Susan Cutter) with a record of the Court of Common Pleas of a partition amongst the heirs of Seth Cutter, in which lot No. V was set apart to Susan.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">LANE, J. By the statute, a married woman may unite with her husband in a deed, and in that way convey her interest in land. At common law a woman cannot make a deed. We think she cannot do so in this state except in the way pointed out by the legislature. The deed is excluded \u2014 you can raise the point again hereafter if you desire to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">Verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-13\">233] *Motion for a new trial, because Mrs. Foster\u2019s deed was excluded, was submitted and overruled.
