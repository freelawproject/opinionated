C. &amp; </em>S. Austin \u2014 June 23, 1818 \u2014 personally appeared C. Austin, jr., and S. Austin, and jointly and sev*erally acknowledged themselves indebted to Messrs. T. &amp; C.

The transcript before us shows no judgment. It is ostensibly an acknowledgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>of a debt of record, as upon a recognizance \u2014 there is nothing from which we can conjecture a judgment, except the entry, \u201cbail for stay of execution.\u201d Without the agency of both parties, the amount-is beyond the jurisdiction of the justice, and his acts would be void.. In acting for such an amount, the justice exercises a special jurisdiction, and is bound to show his authority on the face of his proceedings. This transcript only shows the action of the Austins\u2014 it nowhere shows the plaintiff acting in any way \u2014 no amicable suit, is entered, and there is no appearance of or for the plaintiffs. From the sixteen years delay, it would seem they had just discovered the-justice\u2019s entry, and now would avail themselves of it to avoid the. statute of limitation. They cannot now make the judgment valid if not so when it was entered. At any rate the plaintiffs count upon a judgment, and none is shown. We concur in the authorities, cited by the plaintiff, but consider them inapplicable, because there is no judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Whether resort can be had to the note, or the original cause of action, we now give no opinion. We find for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">The plaintiff asked and obtained leave to amend his declaration,, on paying all the costs since filing, <em>&amp;o.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">[Presumptions in favor of jurisdiction; <em>Wilson v.
