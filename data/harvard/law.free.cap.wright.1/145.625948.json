Bill for injunction and relief. The ease made is this: The complainant, executor of one Johnston, being unable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>settle his accounts within the allowed time by law, owing to difficulties in the estate, the defendant recovered a judgment against *him before a justice of the peace, which was removed to the [146 Court of Common Pleas, by writ of certiorari. To effect this removal, the complainant gave bond, with Parker as security. The judgment of the justice was affirmed, and the complainant having .no assets to pay the judgment, suit has been commenced upon the certiorari bond, and a judgment recovered against him. While the latter suit was pending, the complainant settled with the probate court, when a balance of personal assets was found in his favor. He then filed a petition, for leave to sell real estate, in order to raise funds to pay the debts. That this petition is still pending in that court, yet the defendants threaten execution, and to levy upon the complainant\u2019s own goods.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-4\">This bill is demurred to for want of equity.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b157-5\"><em>James, </em>for the complainant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-7\">contended that as the complainant was compelled to give the certiorari bond to obtain justice, although the judgment on that bond makes him individually liable, yet as it was really a fiduciary transaction, he should not be held liable beyond his assets; 1 <em>Rand. </em>421, 431. And the court decided in the suit upon the bond, that the executor had no remedy at law, and, <em>of course, he has remedy in chancery.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b157-6\"><em>Stillwell, </em>contra, was stopped.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b157-7\">BY THE COURT.</author>\n<p id=\"AO0\">There is no case made here for the interference of chancery. The liability of the complainant has not devolved upon him, <em>as executor, </em>but has resulted from his own act, in entering into the certiorari bond. The ease in 1 <em>Rand. </em>431, if good law, does not apply to this case. There, an executor, while he had assets in his hands, supposed to be amply sufficient to pay all the debts of his testator, made himself personally liable for a debt due by the estate. These assets were afterwards recovered from him by paramount title, so as to leave a deficiency of assets to pay debts. Under such circumstances he was relieved from paying to the extent of the deficient assets. Johnston\u2019s estate is not insolvent; there is no danger of ultimate loss. The assets unadministered are real, and it only requires the action of the complainant, in the proper court, to convert the reality into money to pay the debts. If he has neglected to take the proper steps, and preferred to oblige himself personally, we do not know why we should interfere.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">The demurrer is allowed, and the bill dismissed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
