The suit in the court below was \u25a0assumpsit, and on trial upon non assumpsit the plaintiff gave in evidence two-receipts for wheat, and offered other evidence to prove the residue of his case. The defendant proved that after the receipt of the wheat into the mill, it (the mill) was rented to one Meley, who, at the request of the plaintiff, and by direction of the defendants, delivered to the plaintiff thirty-eight barrels of flour on \u2019 account of the wheat. To rebut this, the plaintiff offered to prove that while the mill was occupied by Meley, he delivered several hundred bushels of wheat to be floured, and that he and Meley had a settlement, at which the plaintiff offered the defendant\u2019s receipts for wheat for credit, but Meley refused to allow them. This was objected and ruled out. The jury returned a verdict for the defendant in writing, and the plaintiff demanded that they should be polled, which the court refused. It is assigned for error, that the court erred in ruling out the evidence offered by the plaintiff, and refusing leave to poll the jury.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b692-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number><em>Gushing </em>and <em>Anthony, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWJt\">cited 6 <em>John. </em>68; 1 <em>Stark.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7Jn\">The record in this case does not show all the evidence, nor perhaps the true state of the case before the jury,, when the evidence was ruled out. It appears that the defendant had proven, in satisfaction of his wheat receipts to the plaintiff, the-delivery of flour by the miller. The plaintiff sought to disprove-this by showing that he had other dealings with the miller which he settled with him, and then offered the disputed receipts to him for allowance in that settlement, which he refused. This the court-below properly rejected \u2014 if the flour was delivered for the defendants, it constituted no part of the account then settling, and were properly disallowed. But at any rate, it was only an offer to prove-the declarations of the miller and of the plaintiff, instead of the-facts of the transactions, and so were incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">660] *As to the refusal to poll the jury, we do not recognize any right in a party in a civil case to poll a jury \u2014 though we sometimes-allow it, if the verdict is delivered under circumstances of suspicion. It is, we think, mere matter of practice, for each court to-regulate for itself. It is perfectly respectful for counsel to ask leave to have a' jury polled, and it is no disrespect in the court to-refuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
