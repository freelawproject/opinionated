On the \u25a0examination of the daughter as a witness, she was asked if the defendant prevailed over her by promise of marriage. This was objected to, but admitted by the court reserving the point. Another witness was called and asked by the plaintiff, as to the standing of the plaintiff\u2019s family.

If the plaintiff\u2019s character is so low, that conduct of this kind would not affect it, the \u25a0damages would be lessened. Would they not be enhanced, if the \u25a0character prove to be good ? The evidence is admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Verdict for the plaintiff for five hundred and eighty-five dollars damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">LANE, J. The defendant will take nothing by his motion. He inquired, on cross-examination, about the daughter\u2019s familiarity with him, as affecting the transaction. After that, we think the plaintiff had a right to inquire if the defendant addressed her in an honorable way, or under promise of marriage, to negative the pretence that the plaintiff improperly connived at the prostitution of his daughter. 3 <em>Camp. </em>519; 3 <em>Stark.
