The bill claims the foreclosure and sale of twenty-five acres of land held by mortgage, and for the conveyance and sale of twenty-five and a half acres of land, of which Johnson held only the title bond of Glaze; both tracts were mortgaged to secure the payment to the complainants of certain notes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-9\">Johnson has not answered. Glaze answers, and disclaims all knowledge of, or interest in the twenty-five acres; but as to the twenty-five and a half acres, asserts a lien on it for a debt due him by Johnson, for which he pledged the land with him after the date of the mortgage. He admitted that at the time of the pledge of the bond with him, he knew of the mortgage.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b521-10\"><em>Clough, </em>for the complainants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ASm0\">claimed an order of sale of the twenty-five acres, of which Johnson had the fee, and that Glaze should convey to the complainants the other twenty-five and a half acres.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b521-11\">S. <em>M. Tracy, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A8Zb\">insisted that no case was made to charge Glaze; nor was there any proof of what sum was due to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b521-12\">COLLETT, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9nR\">The question of notice has little to do with this controversy. Glaze only claims to assert his prior lien on the twenty-five and a half acres, the title bond for which he gave, and afterwards received the same in pledge for advances. Those who deal with equities can only take what the holder has to convey, and must notice the extent of the interest at his peril.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-13\">But there is no proof of anything due to the complainants. Where are the notes? If unpaid, why are they not produced? If paid or transferred, the complainant cannot proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>\u25a0 \u25a0 It is a well-settled rule, that where two have a lien on one piece of property, and one of them'has a separate lien on another piece, he shall first exhaust that on which he has an exclusive lien, and charge the property <em>jointly held </em>only for the residue. Apply that rule here, and the twenty-five acres must be first sold. The case is referred to a master to take an account of what is due the complainants, the value of the several tracts, &amp;c., and is continued for report.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
