The bond was executed in time, and handed to the clerk. He laid it away without opening till after the 30 days had expired. We think this not very material. The law requires the clerk to approve the securities, not that the bond shall be executed before him ; he did approve the security in this cause. Motion overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
