Leavitt brought assumpsit in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>court below upon a written lease without seal. Issue was taken on non assumpsit, with a notice of setoff. On trial, the plaintiff read the lease in evidence, which was for a piece of ground <em>estimated to contain </em>ten acres at $50, and proved that the defendant entered into the premises and enjoyed them. The defendant then offered to prove that the quantity of land in the tract was less than ten acres. To this evidence the plaintiff objected, and the court being equally *divided in opinion, it was admitted, and judgment given for [708 the defendant. It is alleged for error, that the evidence ought to have been excluded.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b743-4\"><em>Knapp </em>and Whittlesey, for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHT\">cited 2 <em>Cranch, </em>10, 29; 9 <em>Wheat. </em>819.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b743-5\"><em>Giddings </em>and <em>Wade </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b743-6\">BY THE COURT.</author>\n<p id=\"ATI\">The parties in this case reduced their contract to writing, and by that they are bound, unless there was fraud- \u25a0or mistake \u2014 there is no pretence of either. The contract shows that the parties did not know exactly the quantity of land \u2014 they \u25a0estimated the quantity and agreed upon a certain rent in gross, not by the acre. It was incompetent for the defendant to prove there was a less quantity of land, without showing also an agreement to deduct, if that was found to be the case. The evidence, therefore, \u25a0should have been rejected. The judgment and proceedings since the issue are reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
