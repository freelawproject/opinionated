The statute of limitations is a bar, and within the express provision of the statute. The evidence will be received.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-13\">In arguing the case before the jury, <em>Whittlesey, </em>for the defendant, contended, that to take the case out of the statute of limitations, there must be an <em>express </em>promise to pay; and also, that if the special contract was not complied with in terms, the plaintiff could not recover. 1 <em>Pet. </em>351; 11 <em>Wheat, </em>13 <em>John. </em>94, were cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-15\">COLLETT, J. An acknowledgment to take a ease out of the statute of limitations, must be that the debt is a subsisting one. If a promise be relied upon, it must be an express promise to pay, or it will be unavailing. Such promise must be shown to the jury by the circumstances; 29 <em>O. L. </em>215. Abare acknowledgment that the debt did once exist is not sufficient. The law will not, upon that <em>alone, </em>raise an implied promise to pay, to do away the statute. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>In general, when services have been rendered for another on a special contract, though not strictly according to its terms, the plaintiff may recover what the services are'worth, on the common counts. When the labor is upon land, and done upon a special contract, it would almost seem that it must be for the benefit of the *employer. There may be a difference, in case the contract pro- [85 vides that he is not to recover, unless the work is done according to the terms of the contract. On that point we are unable to agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">The jury not being able to agree upon a verdict were discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
