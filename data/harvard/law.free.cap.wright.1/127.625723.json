The president of the Court of Common Pleas has no authority to attest a justice\u2019s judgment. But this court has long been in the habit of receiving the prothonotary\u2019s or clerk\u2019s certificate as evidence of the justice\u2019s official character. We think the same rule should obtain as to these certificates, and admit the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">[A justice\u2019s court is not a court of record; <em>Wilson v.
