White\u2019s administrators sued Pike in the court below on the following contract:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b797-4\">*\u201cMr. James S. White, [759</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b797-5\">\u201c Sir \u2014 I will be accountable to you for $100, for or towards the repair of the coach of Messrs. Fowler &amp; Root.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b797-6\">\u201c Jarvis Pike.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b797-7\">At the trial upon the general issue, the plaintiff read the letter in \u2022evidence, and rested. The defendant moved for anon suit, because no evidence was given of a legal liability to pay. The motionwas overruled. The parties submitted to the jury without other evidence. The defendant asked the court to instruct the jury, that unless they had evidence that the coach was repaired,, the plaintiff could not recover. The court refused the instruction,, which was \u25a0excepted to, and a verdict and judgment taken for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b797-8\"><em>O. Parish </em>and <em>Swayne, </em>for the plaintiff in error, insisted,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6Ls\">the court erred, both in refusing the non suit and the instruction to-the &gt;ry.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b797-9\"><em>G.

The evidence tended to prove the issue. But no writ of error lies to such refusal, if we should have ordered differently\u2014 the motion is addressed to the discretion of the court, and if refused, the applicant goes to the jury, not to the court of errors. But in refusing to instruct the jury, that without they were satisfied by proof the work was done, they should not find for the plaintiff, to make the defendant pay for it, the court erred; and for that error we reverse the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
