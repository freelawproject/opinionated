The plaintiff counted, 1st. upon the words: \u201cYou stole cloth arid sold a waistcoat off it to Doctor Rathbone.\u201d \u201cYou stole my cloth and took a waistcoat off it, and sold it to Doctor Rathbone.\u201d 2d. For the following words, spoken of him as a tailor: \u201cYou have secreted customers\u2019 cloth, and sold waistcoats made up out of it to Dr. Rathbone: You have taken a waistcoat off my cloth, and sold it to Dr. Rathbone.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-10\">Plea, not guilty, with a notice that the plaintiff did secrete and steal a waistcoat pattern of the defendant\u2019s cloth, made it up, and sold it to Dr. Rathbone.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-11\">It was proven by several witnesses, that the defendant had charged the plaintiff with taking, or stealing his cloth, enough for a waistcoat pattern, &amp;c., and on plaintiff\u2019s asking him if he intended to charge him with stealing, he repeated it, and when told by the plaintiff that he would sue him, replied he did not know whether it was <em>stealing, </em>or <em>cabbaging, </em>or <em>breach of trust. </em>On one occasion he said to a witness, \u201c You know Dougherty has <em>stole </em>my cloth,\u201d &amp;e. No evidence was offered for the defence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-12\">Verdict for the plaintiff on thefirst count, for two dollars and fifty cents,' and upon the second count, that the defendant is not guilty.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b43-13\"><em>Brazee, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOt\">moved for a new trial, because the verdict was contrary to evidence.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b43-14\"><em>T.

The evidence submitted to the jury tended to prove both these points. It was competent for the jury to deduce from that evidence proof of both points, and having done so, we cannot disturb the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>37] *The statute 29 <em>O.

The judgment in this case is therefore without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
