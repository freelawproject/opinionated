In 2d <em>East. </em>426, the libel was the repeating what one Guy had before said of the plaintiff. The declaration there sets forth that Guy and the plaintiff had dealing, and the plaintiff had sent him an account, on which he rashly accused the plaintiff of swindling. Of the error of which charge of swindling he became satisfied; yet, the defendant, knowing that fact, maliciously spoke and repeated the words. It was held that the repetition was no justification under such circumstances. When special damage is claimed, \u00cd incline to think the contract claimed to have been broken up by the slander should be set <em>out. </em>\u2014 Beporter.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
