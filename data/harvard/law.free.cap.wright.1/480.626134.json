The order of the evidence is of little consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-12\">The plaintiff then read an entry in the books of the commissioner of insolvents, on the application of the defendant, Snyder, to be discharged from arrest, in which the note in contest is described [481 in the schedule of the debts due from <em>Kensell &amp; Co., </em>\u201cof which I am a partner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-16\">BY THE COURT.

The witness is incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>THE COURT, to the jury. It is urged that you must have strict proof that <em>the plaintiffs </em>are the endorsers of the note, the <em>same </em>Clark and Cook named in the endorsement. A note to the case in the 3 <em>Camp. </em>239, is relied upon as authority for this assumption. The case decides that an endorsement in blank, authorizes any who unite in the suit to recover. The note asserts that where the endorsement is <em>special </em>to a firm, proof is required that' the firm consists of the persons who sue. This does not change the common rule; a jury is to be satisfied by the proof of the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover, and no more <em>strict proof </em>is required of the partnership of the plaintiffs than of any other essential fact. The possession of the note, when endorsed to them by name, with slight circumstances, will be sufficient prima facie.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Verdict and judgment for the plaintiffs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
