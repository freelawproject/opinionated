SLEMONS.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b135-3\">Slander \u2014 the tale of another \u2014 current report \u2014 words of concern \u2014 habit of slandering \u2014 damages.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b135-4\">It is no justification to the slanderer, that another told him what he published, unless at the time of publication lie gave his author. In such case he must plead it specially.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b135-5\"><em>A </em>current report of the truth of the matter spoken of, occasioned by facts connected with the plaintiff, may be shown to satisfy the jui'y that the .words were spoken in regret, or of idle curiosity referring to the rumor, and will mitigate the damages.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b135-6\">It is not competent for a slanderer to rely upon his own notorious habit of slandering people, in mitigation of damages.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-7\">Slander. The declaration set forth a variety of words; the principal ones were, \u201cDinah Young is a whore \u2014 she has slunk a young one \u2014 she has had a young one \u2014 if my wife was ever in that way, she is.\u201d Plea, not guilty, and issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-8\"><em>James </em>Hibbs-testified that he was going to Young\u2019s to buy a cow, and was talking with the defendant about it. He said Young had no cow; but had a heifer. Witness reckoned that was Dinah, for she was like for a calf. Defendant said he had heard she was like to have one; but it was slunk \u2014 she had lost it, and would have to take the bull again.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-9\"><em>'William Bryant. </em>\u2014 Defendant said it was talked of that Dinah was like to have a child, but had lost it, and that the women ought to inquire into it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-10\"><em>Charles MeFadclen. </em>\u2014 Defendant said Dinah was not with child, nor would she be before she went to bull again. If she would request *him, he would give her a jump; as he thought himself a sure [125 foal-getter; but he would not unless she requested it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-11\"><em>James Huston. </em>\u2014 Defendant, in March, 1831, said to me, he expected I would be at the grunting frolic to-night at Young\u2019s \u2014 he had heard from her lately and she was worse. If any woman ever was in that way, she was.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b135-12\"><em>Peter Spring. </em>\u2014 Heard defendant say <em>she was </em>so like to have one\u2014 was so as much as his wife was. He did not believe in having the dropsy, and getting over it in one night. Heard defendant talk about the cow to Hibbs. He said, Peter, she has slunk calf, and won\u2019t be with calf again, until she take the bull again. Hibbs asked, if Dinah? Defendant said, not talking about people, but cattle, and turned away. At another time, after they threatened to sue, the defendant said, if they did not let him alone, he would have it tore up from the foundation \u2014 he would have a jury of women, and they would have her to the state prison, and he would bet his colt against twenty dollars, she would go to the state prison. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>He would rather have a dozen young ones, and raise them, handsomely, than one and make away with it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-4\"><em>Polly Spring, </em>was at defendant\u2019s house, and they were talking about having a child at Young\u2019s house. Defendant said no such thing, for that the child had never seen daylight. He said, there were a number of old women at Young\u2019s, and one of us said a child had been heard to cry, and then he said no such thing, &amp;c., as above.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-5\">It was proven, also, that the plaintiff had taken cold in the fall, which affected her catamenial discharges. That she was swollen, and continued so, and unwell until spring, during which time the general report was that she was with child. A physician attended her, and prescribed for her, as having a cold. In the spring, she recovered suddenly, and the swelling went away.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b136-6\">It was admitted by the defendant\u2019s counsel, <em>that the plaintiff was not with child.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b136-7\"><em>Dewey </em>and <em>Cowan, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b136-8\"><em>Stokely </em>and <em>Beebe, </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Au4\">argued to the jury. They contended that the defendant only spoke of a report under a general misapprehension, and was, moreover, though not quite non compos, of a vulgar and inventive turn of mind, of general notoriety, so that his talk was no slander.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b136-9\">WRIGHT, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ap3d\">to the jury. There is no dispute with the counsel, but the proof establishes the fact of the speaking by the defendant of the plaintiff words which imputed to her want of chastity, as charged in the declaration, and the only question for you is the 126] ^amount of damages the plaintiff shall recover. It is no justification to the slanderer that another told him what he spoke, unless at the time of speaking he gave his author; and in such case, if the defendant would avail himself of that defence, he must plead it specially. There is no such plea in this ease. If you are satisfied, however, that it was currently reported in the'neighborhood of the plaintiff\u2019s residence, that she was with child, founded upon her sickness, and the appearance of her form; and that the defendant, in speaking of it, only alluded to the report as such, or as expressing regret; those circumstances will go far to negative the presumption of malice, and to reduce the damages. But if, on the other hand, the prevalence of the report was only seized up&gt;on by the defendant as the occasion for gratifying his malignant puiqpose against the plaintiff, it will aggravate the damages. You should scan the testimony with that view. The threats of punishment in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>penitentiary, &amp;c., are relied upon as showing the defendant actuated by malice, not by mere idle curiosity or concern for the morals of society; you should consider it. .</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">The reliance by the defendant\u2019s counsel, upon the vulgar habits and general reputation of their client, cannot avail him. It would burlesque judicial proceedings to establish the proposition, that a man, by commencing a vulgar, slandering habit of talking of his neighbors, and continuing in it until he becomes notorious, and until he has established a general reputation for such talk, should thereby acquire a legal right to slander others, and be exempt from liability for his slander. We think the case is one, either for compensatory or examplary damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">Verdict for the plaintiff $250, and judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
