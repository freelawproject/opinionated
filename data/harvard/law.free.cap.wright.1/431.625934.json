Beebe declared in the. \u25a0Common Pleas, that on the 9th of September, 1820, Miller and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>wife executed to him a mortgage (which had been lost), by which\u00bb they conveyed to him a tract of land upon condition, to be void if Miller paid, on or before the 1st of April, 1822, to Rowland Craig, $192.07, to Thomas Bingham $138.04, and to J. G. Gross $198.26,, in which he covenanted with Beebe to pay said sums. It was assigned for breach the non payment of either of said sums. To-this there was a general demurrer, which was overruled by the court, and a final judgment given for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b452-4\"><em>Goffinherry </em>and <em>Bartlett,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ahqe\">for the plaintiff in error, claim that the court erred in overruling the demurrer, and cited 1 <em>Ch.

They go to show in what cases one for whose benefit another covenants with a third person <em>may </em>sue directly in his own name. If this were a suit by Craig, Bingham, or Gross, for the money due them, possibly they 432] *would apply. This covenant was made by Miller with Beebe, to pay Craig, &amp;c., and he now claims that his covenant,, though in fact made with Beebe, by operation of law was made with <em>Craig, </em>&amp;c., either jointly or severally, and they alone can sue. The-general rule is that he <em>alone </em>with whom express contracts are madelias the legal interest in them, and alone can sue. Suits in the name of the endorsee of negotiable contracts, result from the statute; and the other cases where suits may be brought by the person beneficially interested, do not establish any new rule; they form exceptions from the old one. Beebe here has the legal interest and can sue; 8 <em>Mass. </em>103; 5 <em>O. </em>71.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
