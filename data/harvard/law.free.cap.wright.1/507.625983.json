The plaintiff proved the possession of one Masterton, before that of the defendant, and a deed of conveyance from him to the lessor of the plaintiff, and then called Masterton to prove <em>to the court </em>the destruction of a title bond <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>given by him to Pindall, which was assigned to the plaintiff's lessor \u2022and under which he gave the deed to Woods.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b531-4\">M. <em>Marshall </em>objected, that the witness was interested, being the grantor and warrantor of the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b531-8\"><em>Marshall </em>moved for a non suit,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AnUP\">on the ground that there was no \u2022evidence to sustain the plaintiff\u2019s right, or showing an uninterrupted \u25a0possession, nor a clear paper title.

He gave it to a boy to write upon as waste paper .and it was destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">It was proven that Pindall said he&gt;held under Masterton, and was .-still in possession, and there the plaintiff rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">WRIGHT, J. The evidence conduces to prove the plaintiff\u2019s title, and must go to the <em>jury.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">The defendant then offered evidence to pi\u2019ove his own general habit of intoxication. The plaintiff objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">*WRIGHT, J. You may prove fraiid in obtaining the deed, [508 ;as that would make it void. The general habit of intoxication, \u25a0unless it is expected to connect it with the plaintiff\u2019s lessor, will not -avail. We suppose the plaintiff will admit the defendant generally drunk, if desired, as that will save time, and then, if there be \u2022evidence that he was made so by the lessor of the plaintiff, and \u2022executed the deed under such influence, it may avail. Unless it is proposed to do that, it will be useless to proceed, as we must in-struet the jury, that under other circumstances the drunkenness will \u25a0be of no avail.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-12\">A number of witnesses were then examined upon that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-13\">WRIGHT, J. to the jury. The defendant being in possession \u2022\u2022of the premises in dispute, has a legal right to remain, except a <em>better </em>legal right is shown in the lessor of the plaintiff to take the possession from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-14\">If the proof satisfy you that Pindall entered into the possession under a contract with Masterton (made when he was in possession), ^though he show no contract or title, he will be presumed Master-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>ton\u2019s tenant at will. A tenancy at will would be terminated by the-conveyance to Woods, which transferred to him the legal estate,, that would establish the plaintiff\u2019s right to your verdict, unless the evidence for the defendant shall establish such fraud in procuring the deed, as makes it void. It is sought to vitiate the deed upon, the ground that it was obtained upon an assignment of a man made drunk by the assignee, in order to obtain it. Should you find this, allegation proven, the deed is void; you will consider the case as if none had ever been made from Masterton; but if the proof only goes to satisfy you that Pindall was habitually a drunkard, without, being made so by Woods to procure the assignment, or if, in fact,, the assignment was not made by Pindall when drunk, the defencefails.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
