In this state, it has\u00bb been decided that a blank with a signature, seal, and authority to fill up, is void: (1 <em>O. </em>372). But mere money bonds, executed with-blanks, filled up before negotiated, and received in good faith, are to be treated as commercial or business paper, and the delivery in-blank to a party, as an authority to fill up: (5 <em>O. </em>222; 5 <em>Mass. </em>508). This bond is still in blank, not filled up, and the real question is,, can you enlarge the substance of it, by mere <em>innuendo? </em>We think you cannot. What- would be the <em>effect, </em>if the blank <em>-were filled up-</em>by permission of the Common Pleas, or otherwise, we leave untouched,, as the question is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">The demurrer is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">[Seal on commercial paper does not vary its characteristics; <em>Bain v.
