In the Court of Common Pleas, Lancaster filed a declaration, and obtained judgment. The Common Pleas had no authority to proceed to judgment in any other than the case brought before it by appeal. The record shows that cause <em>abandoned, </em>and another, by a <em>different </em>person, <em>substituted, </em>and a judgment taken by default. Upon the <em>new </em>case the defendant was not in court. This is erroneous, and the judgment is reversed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-12\">The interest of ah equitable holder of a note or bond not negotiable, may be protected in a court of law, but such holder acquires no legal right to sue in his own name, although the bond or note is assigned to him,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
