The second and third corners called for in the plaintiff\u2019s deed was <em>a p&gt;ost. </em>It was in proof that a survey was made of the ground before the deed was executed, and the corner posts fixed. The respective parties had possessed the ground, and improved on each side up to a line drawn from these corner posts. The lessor of the plaintiff had acknowledged that line to be his boundary, and the places where the posts stood to be the corners of his tract. But the lessor of the plaintiff, after several years\u2019 occupancy, finding that he had a less number of acres within his lines than he supposed, and that lines near the <em>courses and distances </em>called for in his deed would extend beyond the place where the \u00a1\u00edosts were fixed and give him a greater quantity of land, commenced this suit. He now claims that the calls <em>for posts </em>were <em>immaterial </em>and <em>void </em>calls, and to recover up to a line run the courses and distances called for in his deed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b182-13\"><em>Green </em>and <em>Olds, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AsL\">cited 3 <em>Pet. </em>96; 9 <em>Cranch, </em>369, 70; 2 <em>Bibb, </em>369; 1 <em>John.

The case in 3 <em>Pet. </em>96, and that in 2 Bibb, 390, proceed on this priucipleto determine that a call for <em>a beech </em>or a <em>hickory tree, in a forest of like </em>trees, without more particular description were <em>immaterial </em>and <em>void </em>for uncertainty. The same certainty and strictness is not required when surveys are made in an improved and settled country.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">We are not satisfied of the analogy between a call for a beech or hickory tree in a forest of like trees, as in cases reported in <em>Peters and Bibb, </em>and the calls for corner posts in the plaintiff\u2019s deed. <em>Posts </em>were not common objects, undistinguishable from each other, on the land conveyed to the lessor of the plaintiff, as a forest of trees of the same genus, where there are thousands alike. Where lands arecon*veyed <em>by metes </em>and bounds, the presumption is that they [172 have been surveyed, and the lines run and corners called for in the deed fixed, the object of which was to convey the land so previously marked out and agreed tobe conveyed; 9 <em>Cranch, </em>178. If disputes arise after the conveyance where the land lies, the inquiry is, where were the lines run and the objects called for in the deed, fixed at the survey. If the objects called for remain, they afford the safest rule to answer the question, being fixed. If gone, and it is known where they were, the establishment of that fact attains to the same certainty as if they remained. If after actual survey, the corners and lines cannot be ascertained, resort is had to the <em>courses </em>and <em>distances </em>of lines described in the conveyance, which are run out by surveyors on the land. The law holds the courses and distances called for in the lines of the deed, as less to be relied upon than fixed monuments, or actual lines, and therefore only to be resorted to, to ascertain the land conveyed, where the other and better evidence cannot be had. Where the objects called for in the deed are found, or the place where they stood is found, they will control the <em>course </em>and <em>distance </em>of the lines described, and the lines will be run from object to object to close the survey, though they vary both in the course and in the distance from the call for them in the conveyance. A <em>post, </em>a <em>stake, </em>a <em>stake </em>and <em>stones, </em>a <em>stone, </em>are objects frequently called for in surveys between adjoining individual proprietors, in an improved country. Where such calls are found, they have legal efficacy, and will control the course and distance as much as if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>object called for was larger, or a more showy and costly monument of wood or stone. We are not prepared to vitiate surveys calling for such monuments, or to vary rules of practice \u2014 the cases cited do not, in our opinion, conflict with our own views.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">If the evidence satisfies the jury where the posts called for as corners were placed, and that a line from one to the other bounds the defendant\u2019s possession, he is entitled to a verdict. Evidence to show where the j&gt;osts were, is not received to <em>contradict </em>the deed, as for such purpose it cannot be received, but to ascertain at what place on the ground the line runs, or the corner stands that is called for, and fixes the call, and applies the conveyance upon the ground. The objection which is urged to the reception of the evidence is without legal foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Yerdict and judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">[Another report of this case in <em>Alshire v.
