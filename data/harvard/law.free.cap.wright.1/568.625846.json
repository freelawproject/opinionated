Orange recovered a judgment before a justice in trover against Price on the 16th November, 1831. Price gave notice of an appeal, and entered bail on the '20th. The next term of the Court of Common Pleas commenced &lt;the 21st of February, 1832, and continued till the 1st of April. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>On the 24th of March, the appellant presented to the court a transcript of the justice\u2019s judgment, with an affidavit of the justice,, that during the two first weeks of the termhis office was \u201cinundated, submersed, and full of water to the depth of seven or eight feet, which prevented his doing business therein,\u201d also his own affidavit, that the action is unjust, and that he has got a good defence to it; that for several days before and after the beginning of the term, the justice\u2019s office was under water, so that he could not occupy it, and that the appellant did not know where to find him. Fi'om the mid-569] *dle until about the last of February, 1832, the whole bottom part of the city was under water, a brewery of the applicant much exposed, and he was compelled, day and night, for more than two weeks, commencing a week before the beginning of the court, to-use great exertions to preserve it. It could not be safely left before the second week of the court, or he would have filed the transcript at the beginning of the term. On these affidavits, the appellant moved the court to docket the appeal, which was refused, and-the parties then agreed to stay proceedings until the decision of this court could be had</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b596-5\">To reverse the order refusing the entry of the appeal, Price brings-this writ.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b596-6\"><em>Van Matre, </em>for plaintiff in error, contended:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b596-7\">1.

L. </em>177) the justice when a case is appealed, is required to make out a transcript of the case, including the recognizance of bail on the appeal, and give it to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>appellant on demand. The act requires the appellant to enter the appeal on or before the second day of the next term. If he fail, the appellee is authorized to enter it during the term, and have a judgment like that before the justice, or to have the appeal dismissed and remanded to the justice for execution. If neither party enter <em>within the time limited, </em>the law declares the appeal <em>vacated, </em>and requires the justice to proceed on the judgment before him.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">The case in the 6 <em>O. </em>34, decided that an appeal could not be entered after the next term following, but intimates that perhaps the party might be permitted to <em>enter during the term,if </em>prevented from entering the two first days by accident, because for some purposes the term is but <em>one </em>day. This appeal was taken three [570 months before the court, and no excuse whatever is offered for neglecting it till a week before the court. Under such circumstances, we think the application was solely to the <em>discretion </em>of the Common Pleas, which this court cannot control.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">The case in this court in 1827, is not analogous. The act under which that appeal was entered (22 <em>O. L. 73), </em>authorized the court after the first day, even on the application of the appellee, to docket the appeal and try the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">[Error does not lie to decision on submitted facts by court acting as jury; <em>Bissell v. Couchaine, </em>15 <em>O. S. </em>58, 63.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
