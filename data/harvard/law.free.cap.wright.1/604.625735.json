The bill seeks to sell in satisfaction of a judgment at law against Ennis, lot No. 126, in Cincinnati, which has been levied upon, but will not be sold, because the title is in Sandige, though he holds it in trust for Ennis, who is insolvent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-11\">Ennis, in his answer, admits the judgment, levy, and his insolvency. He insists that some years since, before he contracted the debt to the plaintiff, he had received a piece of land and much other property from his wife\u2019s father as her portion of his estate, ' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>and finding himself in sinking circumstances conveyed the land to Sandige in <em>trust for his </em>(Ennis\u2019s) <em>viije and children. </em>Afterwards by agreement of all concerned, the land was sold, and the proceeds invested in lot 125; after which, his wife died, and Sandige, to rid himself of the trust, conveyed to Ennis in trust for Mrs. Ennis\u2019s four children. This investment was made before the debt to the complainant was contracted. He alleges that he holds only in trust, and <em>denies </em>all fraud. To this there is a general replication,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b635-4\"><em>Storer, </em>for the complainant, and</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b635-5\"><em>Hammond, </em>for the respondents,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"p\" id=\"AEh\">relied on 8 <em>Wheat. </em>229.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b635-6\">WRIGHT, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9Qe\">A post nuptial <em>voluntary </em>settlement, made by a debtor for his wife and children, is void as to previous creditors, but as to subsequent ones, is valid, the consideration being held good and valuable. But if a conveyance is made for that purpose with a fraudulent design, then it is void as to subsequent creditors also.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">A trust created in land for the wife and her children, vests in the children at her death. A conveyance by the trustee of the trust property to their father, in trust for them, is not per se fraudulent, though he is in debt. Nor is such conveyance made in honest execution of a trust, to be avoided by proof that the father when he took the trust was indebted and insolvent. If the trust estate is valid at its inception, no act of the trustee can affect the intei\u2019est of the cestui que trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">The complainant then agreed that the bill be dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
