Buchanan sued Anderson for a malicious prosecution, and upon not guilty, recovered a judgment 726] *for $300. The charge alleged in the declaration to have been maliciously preferred, was of perjury by Buchanan in deposing before Justice Truesdale, \u201cthat he met Anderson at the head of his lane, which could be no other time than the 24th of December, 1826, and that he could not and would not answer the proposals of the session of Mount Jackson to him, and that he neither read nor beard read the said Anderson\u2019s answer to said proposals, that we yet consider Anderson a member of our church.\u201d This statement Anderson made affidavit, he believed false, and thereupon obtained process, &amp;c.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b762-8\"><em>Giddings </em>and <em>Wade, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6Cq\">claim to reverse the judgment, for the following causes, viz.:</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b762-9\">' 1.

He commenced and carried on the criminal charge in his \u25a0own way, and when defeated, would avoid responsibility by alleging his own mistakes! A convenient method of escaping responsibility, which secures a malicious man the opportunity of wreaking his vengeance with impunity, because he so shaped his proceedings that the law would adjudge them insufficient, if objected to. In no view can it be a defence to this action, that the proceedings in the criminal malicious prosecution were erroneous. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>If no crime was committed, why did Anderson prosecute Buchanan,, or if the oath taken was no purjury, why prosecute him for perjury? If crime were committed, that would <em>be probable </em>cause and justify the prosecution, notwithstanding the acquittal. He cannot set up his own irregular acts of oppression to screen himself from liability, much less require of the plaintiff in this action to set them out: (2 <em>Wils. </em>307.)</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">*The fifth error assigned, presents the simple question, [72? whether in case one be maliciously prosecuted by another for a crime without any cause, he can have redress by action on the case ? To sustain an action on the case for a malicious prosecution, malice and the want of probable cause must concur, and the prosecution be at an end. This must be alleged, and is so in this case. The injury was consequential upon the prosecution, and is so alleged \u2014that lays a proper ground for case.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
