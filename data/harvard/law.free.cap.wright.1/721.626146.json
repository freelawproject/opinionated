For value received I promise to pay to D. L. Morly, or his order, the sum of two hundred dollars and interest, in thirty days from date. The condition of this note is such, that if I am not to be found in the bounds of two hundred miles of this place, the above note is not to be sued for the term of five years from date, it bearing interest from date, and afler five years it shall be valid anywhere within the United States. <em>Wm.

It is a note to pay |200 with interest in thirty days for value received. But there is annexed to it a conditional stipulation, that if the maker should not be found within two hundred miles of Warren, heshould not be sued short of five years. We are not told why this stipulation vitiates the contract, but are asked to take it so on the face of it. Why? Is it against law or good morals for a man to stipulate with his creditor, that in case he should be two hundred miles away from home, or the place of payment, he shall not be embarrassed by suit, but left free for five years. We do not see the \u2022 '^immorality or unlawfulness of such an'agreement. It does [722 not even restrict trade \u2014 on the contrary, it encourages it, by leaving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>the defendant free to trade in distant parts without molestation, though it subjects him to pay, when he returns home, or after five years, at all events. If this is an unlawful agreement, the defendant can show it to be so \u2014 at present, its unlawfulness is not manifest.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
