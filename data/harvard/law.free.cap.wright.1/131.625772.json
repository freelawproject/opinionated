The act referred to, on certain kinds of paper, may possibly enlarge the <em>time </em>for a demand of the drawer, and dispense with a prosecution of the drawer to insolvency. So far, the act may settle what shall be due diligence; but the act is silent as 132] *to the notice; because, as we suppose, it was not intended to alter the law merchant in that particular. The defendant is entitled to a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-13\">Verdict accordingly, and judgment for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
