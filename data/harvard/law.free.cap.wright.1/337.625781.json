The only <em>conversion </em>laid in the declaration, was a <em>general refusal </em>to deliver, like a general refusal to pay in assumpsit. To the plea of not guilty, was annexed-a notice, -that the property in the oxen was in one Andrews, who had the jwssession, and .the. taking by the defendant was on an execution against Andrews.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-7\">On the trial it appeared, that the plaintiff being a constable, .and having an execution against Andz-ews, levied on the oxen. One Mason took them and gave the constable a forthcoming receipt for them. They wei-e afterwards in the possession of Andrews, and used by him, were levied upon on an execution against him, and sold to Webb, and by Webb to the defendant, Baker.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b354-8\">Upon this evidence the defendant moved -for a non suit, which -was ordered, but.the plaintiff refusing to submit the court instructed 338] *the jury to find for the defendant, which was- done. On .this, there was judgmezzt; to reverse which, this writ is brought.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b354-9\"><em>IS. </em>Andrews, for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADMH\">cited 29 <em>O.

L. </em>184), to leave it in the possession of the defendant, taking secuz-ity for his-own indemnity. The receipt or bail is his security; he is the sole judge of it. He does not continue to hold the possession, nor can-he retake the property and sell, unless returned to him. There is no continued <em>constructive </em>possession. His remedy is on the receipt. In this, the plaintiff made no case to recover. Thei\u2019e was no evidence,, either, of an actual conversion; for the time Andrews had a right to use, they were his oxen; they might never'again be in a situation for the constable to possess them. If his possession, then, were held construc- , tively to continue, Baker was under no obligation to take the cattle to him, and he should have proven at least a demand and refusal to show a conversion. The court below, in our opinion, were right in ordering a non suit; but they erred in yielding to the refusal of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>plaintiff to submit to the order, and then instructing the jury to find for the defendant, instead of submitting the cause to them on the evidence. The declaration is bad, as it alleges no conversion. The judgment is, therefore, reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">[Constable parting with property on a forthcoming bond cannot sue for conversion on the ground of 'want of demand and notice; <em>Pugh v. Calloway, </em>10 <em>O. S. </em>488, 491.]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
