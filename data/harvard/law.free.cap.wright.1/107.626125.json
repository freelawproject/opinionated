The question is one of publication; if published, it is sufficient. In England, it has been held, that if the words are spoken in Welsh i\u00f1 a Welsh county, no averment is required that they are understood. The-court will intend they were understood in such case; <em>Stark. on </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number><em>Slander, </em>85. If that is good law, the rule seems equally applicable to German words, spoken in a German county, like this. We hold the question one of publication. After verdict, it will be intended that words spoken in a <em>discourse </em>with divers people, concerning another, with a malicious intent, were uttered in a language understood by those he addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">The judgment is affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
