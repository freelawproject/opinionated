There is nothing technical in it. The case cited in the 1 <em>O. </em>340, does not confine us to sustain the construction contended for by the defendants. The case in 5 <em>O. </em>492, and in 10 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number><em>John. </em>205, sustains us in saying, that \u201c the good sense and meaning of the contract\u201d will determine whether the covenants are \u25a0dependent or independent, and where the terms of the contract provided that a certain part of the consideration shall he paid on the completion of a certain part of the service, the payment for <em>that part of the service </em>is pro tanto a condition precedent, not the performance of the whole. Mechanics may need advances from time \u25a0to time to enable them to proceed with their work \u2014 the interest of both is promoted by payments as the work progresses \u2014 the employer is secured by the work actually done, and the portion of \u25a0compensation retained until the whole is finished. It is the duty of \u25a0courts so to construe contracts as to give effect to the intentions of \u2022\u2018\u2018\u2018the contracting parties, provided they are lawful. In this [475 case, we think the true construction of the contract is to pay the \u25a0amount of this work at the stipulated price, on or before the completion of the work, in instalments, as the work progresses, as the \u2022engineers estimate the work for the original contracto)-, and that \u25a0upon the payment of the instalments on the estimates, depends the Tight of the employers to enforce the performance of the entire work. The plaintiff, therefore, on showing that he has performed a rateable proportion of the work, the estimate of the engineer, the notice and the refusal by the defendants to pay, may recover for the work done, and abandon.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">After this opinion the case was settled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
