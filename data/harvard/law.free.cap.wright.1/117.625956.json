One Holmes, in 1797, purchased lot No. 16, in Steubenville, of Wells, the proprietor of the town, and took a certificate of purchase. He afterwards sold his interest in the lot to Thomas Gray, put him into possession, and gave him an order on Wells for a deed, which he never presented. Thomas Gray sunk a well on the lot, and continued in possession till 1809. In 1805, he made a <em>voluntary conveyance </em>to his father, William Gray, then living in his family. Thomas Gray, at the time of this conveyance, was in embarrassed circumstances, occasioned by having become security for others. Gray died in 1806, having devised the property conveyed to him by the son to <em>the children </em>of the son, who are the complainants. In 1809 the lot was sold by the sheriff, on an execution against T. Gray, to O. Jennings, who afterwards sold to Tappan, to whom Wells conveyed. This bill is brought to declare Tappan the trustee of the complainants, and to compel a conveyance to them.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b127-10\"><em>J. </em>and <em>D.

T. Gray, embarrassed for the debts of others, conveyed the lot to his father, a member of his family, and insolvent, and continued himself in the use and possession as before, until the property was sold upon an execution against him. That sale passed the possession to the purchaser, and the judgment debtor cannot gainsay the title so acquired; 18. <em>John. </em>94.

This court will not interfere where the right is founded in fraud, nor in favor of, or against <em>mere </em>volunteers, or where the claim is unconscientious. 1 <em>Mad.
