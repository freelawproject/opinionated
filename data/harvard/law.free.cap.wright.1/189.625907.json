The plaintiff purchased the steamboat Mexico, but found her subject to a lien for advances; and to release her, had to give his own note for $555.50, the amount of the advances, which he subsequently paid. He now claims to oblige the defendant with the sum so advanced, as one of the owners of the boat at the time the debt, which he was compelled to discharge, was contracted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-14\">The deposition of Millikin, clerk of the boat, was offered, which went on to relate the contents of a letter not produced or accounted for. This was objected to by the defendant, and the objection was sustained by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-15\">Robert Armstrong was offered as a witness.0 It appeared that he was formerly owner of the boat, and had conveyed her to create a trust for himself and family. He was objected to by the plaintiff, but having executed a release of his interest, was permitted to be sworn.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-16\">He testified that the plaintiff was only part owner of the boat. The defendant owned nine-twentieths of her. The plaintiff told him about the time he discharged the lien upon the boat, that there was profit enough to pay the debt out of the defendant\u2019s interest; and then showed the boat\u2019s books, and said he had paid it out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>the earnings of the boat. The boat was subsequently in a losing business, and was finally lost.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b202-4\">190] <em>*Fox </em>objected to this evidence of the off-set, because the transaction was between different parties.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b202-5\"><em>V. Worthington, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMm\">said it was not a question of off-set, but of payment; 12 <em>Mass. </em>173. In all cases where an agent contracts, he must show to make the principal liable; 13 <em>Mass. </em>33, 178.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b202-6\"><em>Storer, </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"As_\">thought the real question was whether there was any original liability on the part of the defendant.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b202-7\">LANE, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AF9L\">to the jury. If the boat was liable for debts, and about to be attached, the plaintiff had a right to relieve her from the lien, and look to her owners for pay. Such payment is not a mere voluntary one, but such as a person interested in discharging a lien from a boat may make and charge the owners with. If the payment in this case was so made, the plaintiff will have a right to recover, if he has not been paid. But if so made, and the defendant by subsequent agreement with the plaintiff, authorizes him to apply his portion of the boat\u2019s earnings to satisfy the debt, and they were so applied, the debt was extinguished by the payment, notwithstanding a dividend of the boat\u2019s earnings had not been then declared, and notwithstanding the boat afterwards became subject to other liabilities and losses which swallowed up all her earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Terdiot and judgment for the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
