He also showed that the statute of limitations would bar the action, if the plaintiff were driven to a new suit. He claimed that his motion should be allowed without costs.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b522-14\">BY THE COURT.</author>\n<p id=\"ACLq\">This application is addressed to our discretion. The absence of the witness was known before the trial, and was good ground for a continuance, if one had been applied for. If it were not for the statute of limitations, we should leave the party to his new suit; as it is, the non suit is opened up; the plaintiff to pay all the costs which have accrued until the making up of the issue, and the cause is continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-15\">The witness whose non attendance occasioned the non suit, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>brought in on an attachment, and being interrogated, said he had been subpoenaed, and intended to come to court. Had hired a horse last night, but could not get started this morning in season to get to court, fourteen miles, until eleven o\u2019clock.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">BY THE COURT. The business of the court cannot proceed unless its process is obeyed; no execuse is offered <em>here: </em>the party only moved so dilatorily that he failed to arrive until after the cause was sacrificed. He is ordered to pay a fine of two dollars and costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
