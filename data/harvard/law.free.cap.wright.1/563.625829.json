Hays and another, endorsers of a promissory note; it was returned, served <em>personally </em>on St. Clair, and upon the others <em>by copies left with their clerics at their stores, they being </em>[564 <em>absent.\" </em>The declaration describes Hays as \u201cthe said <em>Roswell, </em>sued by the name of <em>Ralph,\" &amp;c. </em>There was no appearance, and judgment was had by default.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b591-5\"><em>Gaines, </em>for plaintiff in error, made two points.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b591-6\">1.

L. </em>117) requires a summons lobe served either personally, or \u201cby <em>copyleft at the defendant's usual place of abode.\" </em>The leaving a copy of the writ at <em>the store </em>of a defendant, is not a compliance with the law. In this case, there has been no appearance to cure the defect of service. We cannot notice the other error complained of, the record presents the writ as against Roswell, and a declaration following it; the words, sued by the name of <em>Ralph, </em>must be rejected as surplusage. If there be error in reference to this, it is not apparent on the record but of fact <em>dehors, </em>which cannot be assigned with an error in law. The first error requires of us to reverse the judgment with costs, as it regards the endorsers.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
