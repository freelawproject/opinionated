In <em>Atkinson &amp; Rawlins v. Jordan, Ellis &amp; Co. </em>(5 <em>O. </em>363), it was decided, after a full examination of the authorities, that an assignment by failing debtors of their effects, with a provision, prohibiting from participating in its benefits, creditors who did not execute a release of their whole debt upon a mere possi' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>bility of receiving a portion of the proceeds, was an attempt to place the assignor\u2019s effects beyond the reach of legal process, in order to coerce a relinquishment without a consideration, and therefore void as against creditors refusing to come in. The case before us seems, in principle, precisely within that decision. The reflection we have bestowed upon the decision since it was made, has rather strengthened our confidence in its correctness. The demurrer is overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
