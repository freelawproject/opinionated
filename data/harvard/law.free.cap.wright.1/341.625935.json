That the contract was made in New Hampshire, and accrued to th\u00e9 plaintiff in that: state six years before the 29th June, 1825, and is barred by the act of that state of 15th January, 1791.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-5\">2. Setting forth the New Hampshire act of 30th June, 1825, barring such demands in six years, avers a demand of the note six years before suit, and so the contract which was made in Ohio, viz.: in New Hampshire, where the parties resided, accured six years before the suit was brought.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-6\">3. The same as'the last, omitting the <em>demand.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-7\">4.

Non assumpsit within six years, before 30th May, 1824.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-9\">6. That there was a demand of payment the 10th May, 1818, and the suit was not brought within six years thereafter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-10\">7. Actio non accrevit within six years next before the 24th May, 1830, and that the action accrued before that time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-11\">' 8. That the debt Was demanded 30th May, 1824, and did not accrue six years before.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-12\">\u2018 Replication to the second and third pleas: That, by the law of New Hampshire, of the 30th June, 1825, if the debtor reside or is out of the state, without leaving property liable to attachment, the creditor may recover within six years, exclusive of the time the debtor was out of the state without property within, and avers that defendant removed from New Hampshire to Ohio, on the-19th October, 1819, leaving no property subject to attachment, and has ever since resided out of the state.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-14\">General demurrer to the first, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and- eighth pleas, and joinder.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-15\">342] ^Rejoinder, that defendant did own and leave property in New Hampshire, subject to attachment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-16\">. Special demurrer to the rejoinder. 1. Because it does not show the property with certainty. 2. Because it does not describe the property.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b358-17\">The Court of Common Pleas sustained these demurrers, and rendered a final judgment on the plea of <em>nil debet. </em>In this it is claimed they erred.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b358-18\">BY THE COURT.</author>\n<p id=\"AFX\">This contract was made in 1818, and so far ,as it is affected by the general acts of limitation in Ohio, is within \"the act of 1810; 8 <em>O. L. </em>62. By'that law, <em>debt upon simple contract, 'except for rentj is not barred at all. '\u25a0 </em>Debt on .specialty is barred in fifteen years. That act was wholly repealed in 1824 (22 <em>O. L. </em>326), except as to actioris'barred under it. It \u2018was revived andmade <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>bperative as to 'causes existing within its tim\u00e9, the 8th February, 1826. The demurrer, therefore, to the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, ' and eighth pleas, was well taken, and the court did not err in so. deciding. The first plea is also bad, because it sets ,up the statute of a'foreign state without disclosing its terms, so that the court, can be advised of its provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">The second plea is no bar to the action, because the demand averred to have been made six years before the suit was brought, appears to have been made before the passage of the act relied upon \u2022to bar the suit. The act of assembly of the 22d February, 1830 (28 <em>O. L. </em>34; and 29 <em>O. L. </em>215), enacts, for the first time in this state, that actions founded on contracts, made by non residents, and barred by the laws of the country where made, shall continue barred when sued in this state. The limitation relied upon, is <em>six years, </em>and the plea avers a demand six years before suit brought. The suit-was brought in March, 1831, six years before which would carry the demand back to a period before the passage of the law, and throw the cause upon the statute of New Hampshire of 1791; which is defectively set out; or, make the act of June, 1825, retroactive. The third plea is still worse, omitting to aver a demand on the note payable on demand, and therefore, showing that no cause of action had accrued. As these pleas are bad, it is unnecessary to inquire whether the rejoinders are good. We look to the first fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">[Demurrer searches the record; <em>Railroad Co. v. Monatt, </em>35 <em>O.
