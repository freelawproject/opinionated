The parties are competent to contract, and the condition is not against law or good morals, but given in furtherance of both. A recognizance would have been more regular, and in compliance with the statute. But the bond is not void. These questions, however, are not before us. The bill of exceptions is a nullity. It is not signed and sealed by a majority, or 136] quo-*rum of the judges, but is signed <em>J. Wiley, pro tern. </em>Whether Wiley was a judge, or what he was, does not appear, and there is no other signature.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-13\">The judgment is affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-14\">[Defective undertaking sustained as a good common law bond; <em>Duckwall v.
