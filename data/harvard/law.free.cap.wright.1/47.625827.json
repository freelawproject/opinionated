The declaration contains two counts. The</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-6\">1st. For publishing in the Ohio Sun a libel upon the plaintiff and his <em>occupancy </em>of the jail of the county, as follows: \u201cBut Mr. New*braugh became an applicant, and on being told that he was [48 in low circumstances, and, as I then thought, honest, I admitted him to occupy the jail.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-7\">2d. For publishing in the same paper of the plaintiff, and of the renting of the jail by the defendant to the plaintiff: \u201cHe has put the seal of reprobation upon his own character for truth and veracity, and I have been told he is not to be believed even under oath.\u201d To this declaration the defendant demurred generally.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b55-8\"><em>T. Morris, </em>for the demurrant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AP3\">insisted that there was no difference between written and oral slander; the charge in each, to sustain an action, must be a specific one of some infamous offence.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b55-9\"><em>Joliffe </em>and <em>Fishback, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4U\">cited <em>Starkie on Slander, </em>132, 3, 4-6, and 1 <em>Ch.

The words declared upon are doubtless of that character. But it is said one of the counts is bad, and so the demurrer must be sustained. The rule is, that where there are several counts, and any one is good, a general demurrer to the whole will be overruled. 1 <em>Ch. Pl. 577.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b55-11\">We think one of the counts substantially good, and need give no opinion as to the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-12\">The demurrer is overruled. Leave was afterwards given to withdraw the demurrer and plead.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
