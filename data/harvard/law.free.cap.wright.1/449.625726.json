Under our law you cannot give evidence in the present state of pleadings, to show that the note was not duly executed. Non est factum, <em>without affidavit </em>of its truth, is no notice to the plaintiff to prepare for such a defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">WOOD, J.

The witness is competent \u2014 he has no interest in the event of the suit. The <em>motive </em>which induced him to divest himself of his interest, if given to the jury, may affect his credit, but it does not touch his competency, inasmuch as the transfer is unconditional.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
