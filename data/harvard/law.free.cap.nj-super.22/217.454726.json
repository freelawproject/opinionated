J. 8. 3A </em>:13-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>The complaint alleges that legal services were rendered by the plaintiff to the defendant prior to May 19, 1951 \u201cand on that date the plaintiff rendered his final bill therelor to the defendant\u201d; and \u201cthe plaintiff has caused a true copy of his bill for fees, charges and disbursements to be served upon the defendant.\u201d The defendant filed a specification of defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><em>Rule </em>7:5-4 adopted January 1, 1952 requires a defendant to defend either by entering an appearance or by filing an answer. The complaint in this action was filed February 25, 1952, so that <em>Rule </em>7:5-4 applies. No answer was filed, but certainly whatever defenses the defendant had were set up in his specifications of defenses. <em>Rule </em>3 :8-4 provides that \u201caverments in a complaint * * * are admitted when not denied in the answer thereto,\u201d and by <em>Rule </em>7:5-5 applies to proceedings in the county district court. The defendant\u2019s specification of defenses failed to deny, \u201cspecifically and with particularity\u201d as required by <em>Rule </em>3:9\u20142, the performance of a condition precedent, compliance with the provisions of <em>N. J. S. 2A </em>:13-6 with regard to proof of service of a copy of the bill for fees and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\"> The plaintiff testified on cross-examination that at least three bills had been sent to the defendant in the ordinary course of business, and that his brother-in-law served a copy of the bill upon Mr. Collins personally. The defendant made no objection to this testimony until he moved for judgment on the ground that the plaintiff did not personally mail his bills, nor have personal knowledge that his brother-in-law served the defendant. <em>Rules 3 </em>:46, 5 :2\u20141 and 7 :l-3. However, what if any probative value the plaintiff\u2019s testimony should carry is of no moment, for the receipt of the bills is not denied and the specification of defenses does Tiot include the charge that the plaintiff failed to comply with the provisions of <em>N. J. 8. </em>2A :13-6. <em>Rule </em>3:8-3. The new rules, though liberalized to promote substantial justice, nevertheless require that adverse parties be apprised of claims to be met. <em>Grobart v.
