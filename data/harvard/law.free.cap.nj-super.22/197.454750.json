Hence, the part of the order discharging Myron Jeek from the then current grand jury no longer has any efficacy, and the question of its propriety is now moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The attorney for the respondent conceded, and we agree, that striking Jeck\u2019s name from any future list of grand jurors was without legal warrant. Under <em>N. J. S. 2A </em>:70-2, the qualifications of jurors are determined by appropriate reviewing officers in advance of the opening of each stated court session. Accordingly, should Jeck\u2019s name-appear on a future list of grand jurors, his fitness for jury service may then be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">The order appealed from will be modified accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
