J. Super. </em>472 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">The concurring findings of the two independent tribunals below are supported by adequate evidence. In the light thereof we have little difficulty in accepting the conclusion that petitioner was entitled to an award under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. <em>Mills v. Monte Christi Corp., </em>10 <em>N. J. Super. </em>162, 165 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950), certif. denied 6 <em>N. J. </em>315 (1951); <em>Fox v. City of Plainfield, </em>10 <em>N. J. Super. </em>464, 468 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">The doctrine of <em>Lohndorf v. Peper Bros. Paint Co., </em>134 <em>N. J. L. </em>156 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1946), affirmed 135 <em>N. J. L. </em>352 <em>(E. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number><em>&amp; A. </em>1947), and the cases following it, which require proof of unusual strain or exertion, is limited to heart cases. <em>Fox v. City of Plainfield, </em>above. It may be noted that the doctrine has not escaped criticism. See the concurring opinions of Justice Heher in <em>Temple v. Storch Trucking Co., </em>3 <em>N. J. </em>42, 46 (1949), and in the <em>Lohndorf </em>case, 135 <em>N. J. L., </em>at <em>page </em>353.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">In <em>Neylon v. Ford Motor Co., </em>8 <em>N. J. </em>586 (1952), the majority of the Supreme Court sought to extend the \u201cunusual strain or exertion\u201d doctrine of the <em>Lohndorf </em>case to non-heart cases. Justice Ileher dissented, Chief Justice Vanderbilt concurring in the dissent. Reiterating the view voiced in his concurrences in the <em>Lohndorf </em>and <em>Temple </em>cases, above, Justice Heher said that \u201cthis doctrine [of the <em>Lohndorf </em>case] has introduced into judicial administration an arbitrary classification that is not to be found in the statute,\u201d and held that the sacroiliac sprain suffered by Neylon in the usual course of his employment was an injury</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">\u201cwithin the mischief to which the remedy was directed. The legislative purpose was 1o provide for the hazard of accident within the scope of the employee\u2019s work. The question is whether there was an accident, in the sense of an unlooked-for mishap or untoward event not expected or designed, imputable to a risk reasonably incident to the doing of the master\u2019s work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">The <em>Neylon </em>case was reargued September 8, 1952, one week before the argument in this case. We withheld decision pending the determination of that reargument. 10 <em>N. J. </em>325. The Supreme Court decision has just come down and resulted in an equal division of the court, thereby affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, Appellate Division, reported in 13 <em>N. J. Super. </em>56 (1951). Justice Jacobs, in an independent opinion joined in by Justice Heher, said that he considered the argument that Neylon suffered no injury by accident since the sacroiliac sprain resulted from a strain or exertion which was not an unusual one, was without merit; it was a contention that he had expressly rejected in <em>Mills v. Monte Christi Corp., </em>above, and <em>Ptak v. General Electric </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Co., 16 <em>N. J. Super. </em>573 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951). He accepted the views expressed by Justice Heher in his concurring opinions in the <em>Lohndorf </em>and <em>Temple </em>cases, and in his dissenting opinion in the <em>Neylon </em>case (8 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>page </em>594), stating that \u201cthey find support not only in reason and the underlying beneficent purposes of the act but also in occasional decisions by our court of last resort * * * and in numerous decisions elsewhere in the country,\u201d citing cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Chief Justice Vanderbilt also filed an independent opinion on the reargument of the <em>Neylon </em>case, concurring in the opinion of Justice Jacobs, \u201cbut only to the extent that it applies to cases of the type here involved and not to the extent that by dictum it deals with heart cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">It is, therefore, clear that the \u201cunusual strain or exertion\u201d doctrine has not been extended to other than heart cases by our court of last resort. It has no application in this case, involving the bursting of a lung cyst or bleb due to a strain associated with his employment, and which resulted in the collapse of the lung with attendant physical manifestations.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Appellant seeks to avoid payment of the medical bills upon a ground that was not set up in its answer, nor urged at the trial level. In its answer to respondent\u2019s claim petition in the Division of Workmen\u2019s Compensation it said, in answer-'to the questions \u201cWas medical aid required?\u201d, \u201cWere you requested to supply the necessary medical services required by law ?\u201d and \u201cDid you furnish this service ?\u201d, that \u201cRespondent has no knowledge that the petitioner sustained an accident arising out of, and in the course of, his employment with the respondent.\u201d The answer was disingenuous in the light of the record. Reference to the answer will show that appellant conceded nothing and, in effect, denied everything. Although appellant is not entitled to raise the question of medical expenses for the first time upon this appeal, it will be disposed of on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">The present argument is. that respondent did not request appellant to furnish medical service and, in any event, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>the medical service was not an emergency requirement. Both the county court and the deputy director resolved this factual question against appellant, the deputy director finding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-5\">\u201csuch treatment was of a necessary nature, and 1hat the respondent had early and repeated occasion to render same, but failed to do so. I make note, also, that the respondent evidently obtained an examination of the petitioner by Dr. Orecca during the pendency of an informal hearing, yet despite the nature of the doctor\u2019s report, the respondent failed to render the surgery indicated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">A situation similar to the present one was dealt with in <em>Bobertz v. Hillside </em>Township, 126 <em>N. J. L. </em>416 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1941). The court held that the medical expenses there assumed by the employee were justified under the statute, and referred to <em>'ll. S. </em>34:15-15, authorizing the assessment of medical expense against a respondent when \u201cthe circumstances are so peculiar as shall justify, in the opinion of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Bureau, the expenditure assumed by the employee.\u201d The court found there was sufficient in the case to warrant a finding of the kind of circumstances envisioned in the statute to justify the expense for the medical and hospital services. It further noted that \u201cappellant\u2019s conduct does not appear to have been that of a party uninformed, but rather it inferred an awareness and recognition of respondent\u2019s condition.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
