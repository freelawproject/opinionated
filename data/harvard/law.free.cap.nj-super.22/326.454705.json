Defendant\u2019s answer denied the cruelty and the case came on for trial. Part of the testimony was taken and the case was continued to January 7, 1952. On December 27, 1951 the defendant served notice of a motion to file a counterclaim in the cause, charging plaintiff with adultery committed on December 21, 1951 and on certain other dates. On January 7, 1952 plaintiff\u2019s counsel informed the court that the plaintiff had advised him that she wished to abandon the prosecution of her suit for absolute divorce against the defendant on the ground of extreme cruelty. The plaintiff then took the stand and under questioning by her counsel testified that she concluded, of her own volition, to abandon her divorce action against the defendant. The court then questioned the plaintiff as to whether any promises or threats had been made, or consideration offered, to get her to reach the conclusion to drop the suit against her husband, and she answered that she did it all of her own volition. Defendant\u2019s counsel stated to the court that he understood the order that would be entered would \u201cbring an end to any suit of the plaintiff for divorce against the defendant on the ground of extreme cruelty in that it would be discontinued with prejudice,\u201d and asked that the motion which was pending for permission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>to file a counterclaim be continued for a few weeks. The court then stated: \u201cIn view of the wishes of Mrs. Sheehan, it will be dismissed with prejudice in two weeks, if the doctor hasn\u2019t made up his mind.\u201d Another hearing was held on January 28, 1952, at which the counsel for defendant insisted that an order should be entered dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s divorce suit with prejirdice. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel made no objection to the dismissal of the plaintiff\u2019s divorce suit with prejudice, insofar as the bringing of any further action for divorce against the defendant on the grounds set forth in the complaint were concerned, but argued that the dismissal should be without prejudice to the urging by the plaintiff of the same grounds set forth in the dismissed complaint to prove recrimination in any suit brought by the defendant against the plaintiff on the ground of the alleged adultery.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s statement to the court that she desired to abandon the prosecution of her suit for absolute divorce against the defendant on the ground of extreme cruelty, occurring as it did after the trial had started and testimony had been taken, justified the action of the court in entering judgment dismissing her divorce action with prejudice to the institution of any action for divorce against the defendant in this court on the grounds set forth in the complaint filed by her. If the plaintiff knew that the husband could prove his charge o\u00a3 adultery against her, it is easy to understand why she decided to discontinue her suit for divorce against her husband on the ground of cruelty, because proof of her adultery would be a complete bar to her action for divorce on the ground of her husband\u2019s cruelty, even though she proved her cause of action. But proof of the same acts of cruelty as were alleged in her complaint would, under a defense of recrimination, be a bar to the granting of the divorce to the husband on the ground of adultery. <em>Cummings v. Cummings, </em>109 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>637 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1932); 11 <em>New Jersey Practice (Herr, Marriage, Divorce and </em>Separation), \u00a7 791.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>Under the circumstances, the trial court was well within its power in entering judgment which reserved to the wife the right to plead the alleged acts of cruelty as a defense by way of recrimination. <em>Dowling v. Dowling, </em>93 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>159 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1921) is not to the contrary. The action taken by the trial court has strong support in our cases such as <em>Feickert v. Feickert, </em>98 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>444, 448 <em>(Ch. </em>1926) and <em>Zweig v. Zweig, </em>12 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>761, 768 <em>(Ch. </em>1934), affirmed 116 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>589 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1934), which set forth the principle that the State is a party to every suit for divorce and nullity of marriage, and it is the policy of the law that all proper defenses be made or compelled-Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
