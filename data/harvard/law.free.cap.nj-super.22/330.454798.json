ROBERTS, INDIVIDUALLY AND AS ADMINISTRATRIX OF THE ESTATE OF EMILIE SCHUBERT, DECEASED, DEFENDANTS-APPELLANTS.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b346-5\">Superior Court of New Jersey Appellate Division</court>\n<otherdate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b346-6\">Argued October 20, 1952</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A2h\">Decided October 28, 1952.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b347-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>Before Judges Jayne, Proctor and Soiiettino.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b347-11\"><em>Mr. Nathan 0.

J. Super. </em>48 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950), certif. denied, 5 <em>N. J. </em>177 (1950). Its object was to obtain a judicial construction of the decedent\u2019s will and a determination of the interests, if any, of the plaintiffs, as decedent\u2019s next of kin, in certain assets of the estate. 19 <em>N. J..Super. </em>1 <em>(Ch. Div. </em>1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>The construction ascribed to the will by the court resulted in the entry of a judgment awarding to the plaintiffs and payable by the defendant, individually and as administratrix, the sum of $3,254.27.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">We conclude from our review of the record that the defenses of laches and <em>res adjudicate/, </em>were in the circumstances untenable. While we do not express our approval of the admission of certain testimony in view of the stipulation that by reason of the incurable and critical condition of the defendant the trial should be conducted as if the defendant were deceased, yet there was sufficient competent evidence adduced to justify the determination rendered by the trial judge. <em>Buies </em>1:2-20(&amp;); 4:2-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
