In an action against a railroad company to recover damages for personal injuries and for injuries to a one-horse buggy sustained by a collision with a train at a public highway grade crossing, a nonsuit is properly entered, where the evidence for plaintiff shows that in broad daylight he approached from the east the crossing where there were two tracks; that he was familiar with the crossing; that he stopped at a point about twenty feet from the first track where a box-ear standing on a siding to the north <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>somewhat obscured his view in that direction; that a freight train was passing on the first or northbound track; that he stopped and waited until this train had gone by, and then started, and without doing anything else, drove on to the crossing; that his buggy was, struck almost immediately on entering the second or southbound! track by a locomotive hauling a train of 35 freight cars; that the train which caused the accident was running at the rate of 25 to 30 miles an hour, could have been heard 1,100 feet from the crossing, and seen, according to plaintiff\u2019s testimony 340 feet from where he stopped, and according to another witness 440 feet; that the noise of the train which had previously passed \u201cwas gone\u201d before the accident happened; and that the usual stopping place was at a point 70 feet from the crossing, where one could see clearly for a distance of 340 feet to the north.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b520-4\">Argued February 16, 1920.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AVm\">Appeal, No. 134, Jan.

In other words, Gasser does not attempt to say that the noise of the first train prevented him from hearing the second, nor that he was confused or hurried in any manner in making the crossing, but rather relies entirely upon his statement that he looked and listened just before entering the southbound track and neither saw nor heard the approaching train.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-3\">In Provost v. Director General of Railroads, 265 Pa. 589, we said recently: \u201cOne approaching a railroad is not only required to stop, look and listen, but to keep a due observation, from the stopping point on, till the crossing is made. Gilsan [plaintiff\u2019s driver], having two tracks to cross, was obliged to look not only to the north, but also to the south, and, as stated by the trial judge, he could not make both observations at one time, but the head can be turned in the fraction of a second, and, as before stated, it is true beyond doubt that the merest glance, with attention, toward the north, would have shown Gilsan the approach of the train which subsequently struck his motor\u201d; and this is appropriate here. Again, in Smith v. Director General of Railroads, 266 Pa. 328, we more recently said: \u201cIt is vain for anyone to assert a driver looked and listened, if, in spite of what his eyes and ears must have told him, he drove directly in front of a moving locomotive,\u201d citing authorities. Finally, what we said in Siever v. Pittsburgh, C., C. &amp; St. L. Ry. Co., 252 Pa. 1, 8, is also applicable here: \u201cWhen a driver stops at a place where he cannot get a good view of the railroad, he is about to cross, from the vehicle in which he is riding, he must get out and walk to a spot where he can secure such a view, and his failure so to do constitutes contributory negligence in law, for stopping where an approaching train cannot be seen is not an observance of the duty to stop, look and listen; but when he comes to a standstill at a usual stopping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>place, -where he can. get some view of the tracks [which the present plaintiff did not do], whether he should go forward to a better place to look, is a question for the jury to determine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">As stated by the trial judge, in directing the nonsuit, \u201cthe conclusion is irresistible that, if plaintiff had looked, or if he had listened, he could have told the train was coming......His own witness......said he heard this train \u20181100 feet away, heard it coming.\u2019 It is a pure case of a person saying, \u2018I looked and listened and saw nothing and heard nothing,\u2019 and yet getting [almost immediately] hit by a railroad train of 35 cars.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">We are not convinced of error; hence the assignments are overruled and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
