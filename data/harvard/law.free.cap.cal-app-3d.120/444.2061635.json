Defendant and Berline Kizzie, the victim herein, had lived together for several months. Upon their separation, Berline saw defendant quite frequently but the relationship was not friendly and defendant had on two occasions threatened Berline, the last threat being \u201cI\u2019m going to get you, and I\u2019m going to fix you where won\u2019t nobody have you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">On November 4, 1978, Berline attended a party at the Hideaway Club in Marysville. She arrived about 2 a.m. and had a drink.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">Defendant testified on his own behalf; there is a wide variance between his testimony and that of Berline, he stating she called him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>names all evening,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and she testifying they did not speak until he prepared to leave at which time defendant began swearing at her and calling her bad names. When he persisted in such conduct after she told him to leave her alone, she became angry and either dropped her drink glass or threw it at defendant. Defendant then grabbed her by the hair and turned her around. When she put her hand to her face, she found she had been cut.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">She was treated at the emergency hospital for a three-inch laceration with a maximum depth of one-half inch on the left side of her face. The injury, caused by a slash from a sharp object (the evidence indicates defendant\u2019s fingernail file), severed a small portion of one of the salivary glands. A doctor testified the wound required double layer suturing and was likely to leave a scar because of the victim\u2019s Negroid skin.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">We consider initially the contention that the head is not a member of the body.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Defendant asserts the issue of whether the head is a \u201cmember\u201d of the body within the meaning of section 203 is unsettled. As we explain, we find the head is a member of the body within the meaning of the mayhem statute and thereby settle the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Section 203 provides: \u201cEvery person who unlawfully and maliciously deprives a human being of a member of his body, or disables, disfigures, or renders it useless, or cuts or disables the tongue, or puts out an eye, or slits the nose, ear, or lip, is guilty of mayhem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">In <em>Goodman </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 84 Cal.App.3d 621 [148 Cal.Rptr. 799], the court inferentially concluded the head is a \u201cmember\u201d of the body within the meaning of section 203 by holding a facial scar of four to five inches long, extending from above the eyebrow to the cheek and with no functional impairment could reasonably be found by the trier of fact to be mayhem within section 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\"><em>Goodman, supra, </em>involved a pretrial writ. In denying the defendant\u2019s petition for mandamus to declare as a matter of law that the injury involved did not constitute mayhem, the court acknowledged the absence of any California case law \u201cdirectly holding that a scarring wound to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>member of the body, which, unlike the eyes, ears, nose, lips or tongue, has no distinctly separate function, constitutes mayhem.\u201d (At p. 625.)</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">However, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Page </em>(1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 569 [163 Cal.Rptr. 839] defendants were found to have committed mayhem by forcibly tattooing \u201cthe letters \u2018M.F.F.M.\u2019 (representing a club slogan, Misfits Forever, Forever Misfits) over an area measuring four by two and one-half inches on [the female victim\u2019s] left breast. They then tattooed \u2018Property of G.P.\u2019 (Gordon Page) over an area one inch by eight to ten inches on her abdomen, and [the codefendant] tattooed the words \u2018Mine Too,\u2019 with an arrow, on her left thigh.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 572.) A plastic surgeon testified that the tattoos on the victim\u2019s breast and abdomen were permanent, that an attempt to remove the tattoos would \u201cleave permanent scarring for life.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 578.)</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Defendant urged that tattooing of a woman\u2019s abdomen or breast could not constitute mayhem since the torso is not a member of the body within the meaning of section 203. Finding the argument \u201cingenuous but not persuasive,\u201d the court explained, \u201c[t]he term \u2018member\u2019 is variously defined as \u2018A part or organ of the animal body, especially a limb\u2019 (Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard College Diet. (1974)); as a \u2018general term applied to any integral part or vital organ of an organized animal body,, or, more widely, to any integral or distinguishable constituent part of a whole which is considered as organic . .. \u2019 (The Random House Diet, of the English Language (1966)); and as \u2018a bodily part or organ ... <em>specif, </em>a part (as a limb) that projects from the main mass of the body\u2019 (Webster\u2019s Third New Internal. Diet. (1965)).\u201d The court concluded that there might be a question about the abdomen qualifying, but clearly a female breast was a body member by any definition, dictionary, common or legal.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">While the court in <em>Page </em>did not elaborate on the criteria employed in arriving at this conclusion, we submit the head, the uppermost extremity of the body, certainly projects from the mass of the body (Webster\u2019s Third New Internal. Diet. (1965)) and well qualifies as a member of the body.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">Defendant urges the statutory delineation of types of injury to specific parts of the head demonstrates a legislative intent that unenumerated parts of the head were not meant to be included within the scope of mayhem. Further, that under the maxim of <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>the enumeration of things coming within the operation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>statute necessarily involves the exclusion of things not expressly enumerated. Since the statute specifically sets forth eyes, ears, tongue, nose and lips, other parts of the head are excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">However, <em>\u201cexpressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>is no magical incantation, nor does it refer to an immutable rule.\u201d <em>(Estate of Banerjee </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 527, 539 [147 Cal.Rptr. 157, 580 P.2d 657].) \u201cIn <em>People </em>v. <em>Hacker Emporium, Inc. </em>(1971) 15 Cal.App.3d 474, <em>477 </em>[93 Cal.Rptr. 132], we find the following pertinent statements: \u2018Like other rules of construction, the maxim <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>gives way where it would operate contrary to the legislative intent to which it is subordinate or where its application would nullify the essence of the statute. [Citations.] Likewise the rule is inapplicable where no reason exists why persons or things other than those enumerated should not be included, and manifest injustice would follow by not including them. [Citation.] .. . The rule as expressed in the maxim also fails if such interpretation leads to absurd and undesirable consequences.\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rojas </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 540, 551 [125 Cal.Rptr. 357, 542 P.2d 229, 92 A.L.R.3d 1127].)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">The phraseology of section 203 should be viewed in reference to its progenitors as we presume under settled principles of statutory construction that in enacting section 203 \u201cthe Legislature was familiar with the common law concept of mayhem, and that, when it couched its enactment in common law language, it intended to carry over such rules as were part of the common law crime into statutory form.\u201d <em>(Goodman </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.3d at p. 623.)</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The origin of the crime of mayhem is briefly described in the following account:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">\u201cTo cut off, or permanently to cripple, a man\u2019s hand or finger, or to strike out his eye or foretooth, were all mayhems at common law, if done maliciously, because any such harm rendered the person less efficient as a fighting man (for the king\u2019s army). But an injury such as cutting off his ear or nose did not constitute mayhem, according to the English common law, because it did not result in permanent disablement, but merely disfigured the victim. This was corrected by an early English statute. It seems that an assault was made upon Sir John Coventry on the street by persons who waylaid him and slit his nose in revenge for obnoxious words uttered by him in Parliament. This emphasized the weakness of the law of mayhem, and the so-called \u2018Coventry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Act\u2019 was passed. This provided the penalty of death for any one who should, with malice aforethought, \u2018cut out or disable the tongue, put out an eye, slit the nose, cut off a nose or lip, or cut off or disable any limb or member of any subject; with the intention in so doing to maim or disfigure him.\u2019 This statute did not displace the English common law of mayhem (malicious maiming) but provided an increased penalty for <em>intentional </em>maiming and for the first time extended the crime to include disfigurement (if intentional). Hence a true definition of the crime according to the English law must be in some such form as this: <em>Mayhem is malicious maiming or maliciously and intentionally disfiguring another.\u201d </em>(Perkins on Criminal Law (2d ed. 1969) ch. 2, \u00a7 8, pp. 185-186; original italics; fns. omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Although it is apparent section 203 contains verbal vestiges of English Common law and the Coventry Act, \u201cthe modern rationale of the crime may be said to be the preservation of the natural completeness and normal appearance of the human face and body, and not, as originally, the preservation of the sovereign\u2019s right to the effective military assistance of his subjects.\u201d (LaFave &amp; Scott, Criminal Law (1972) ch. 7, \u00a7 83, pp. 614-615.)</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">In light of the stated rationale of the crime of mayhem we conclude there is no tenable reason for distinguishing prominent facial wounds to a nose, ear or lip, from comparable wounds which happen to miss one of those areas of the head specifically mentioned in section 203. The opposite conclusion would lead to a result which is undesirable, if not absurd.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">We hold that the head is \u201cmember\u201d of the body within the meaning of section 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">Also without merit is defendant\u2019s contention the term \u201cdisfigures\u201d is unconstitutionally vague; that its common definition is necessarily subjective and therefore the statute provides insufficient notice of the proscribed conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>In <em>Solander </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1975) 45 Cal.App.3d 664, at page 667 [119 Cal.Rptr. 609], we stated:  \u201cIt is well settled that as a part of procedural due process, a criminal statute must be so definite and certain that it gives fair warning, not necessarily with mathematical exactitude, but sufficient, to inform a person of ordinary or average intelligence, of what acts or omissions it declares to be prohibited and punishable. <em>(People </em>v. <em>McCaughan, </em>supra, 49 Cal.2d 409, 414 [317 P.2d 974]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Barksdale </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 320, 327 [105 Cal.Rptr. 1, 503 P.2d 257]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hallner </em>(1954) 43 Cal.2d 715 [277 P.2d 393]; <em>In re Joseph G. </em>(1970) 7 Cal.App.3d 695, 702 [87 Cal.Rptr. 25]; <em>Tip Top Foods, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lyng </em>(1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 533, 547 [104 Cal.Rptr. 718].)</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">\u201cReasonable certainty, in view of the conditions, is all that is required, and liberal effect is always to be given to the legislative intent when possible. <em>(In re Newbern </em>(1960) 53 Cal.2d 786, 792 [3 Cal.Rptr. 364, 350 P.2d 116]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ali </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 277, 280 [57 Cal.Rptr. 348, 424 P.2d 932].) A statute will not be declared void as indefinite if it contains a reasonably adequate disclosure of the legislative intent regarding an evil to be combated in language giving fair notice of the practices to be avoided. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hallner, supra, </em>43 Cal.2d 715; <em>Tip Top Foods, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lyng, supra, </em>28 Cal.App.3d 533.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The word \u201cdisfigure\u201d is defined as: \u201cto make less complete, perfect, or beautiful in appearance or character.\u201d (Webster\u2019s Third New Internat. Diet. (1971) p. 649.)</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The courts in <em>Goodman </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>84 Cal.App.3d 621, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Page, supra, </em>104 Cal.App.3d 569, considered the concepts of disfigurement within section 203. In <em>Goodman, </em>the court examined cases under statutes similar to our own and found that mere disfigurement constitutes mayhem \u201conly where the injury is permanent. Thus, the cutting of a lip requiring several stitches but which would heal without serious scarring was not mayhem. <em>(State </em>v. <em>Raulie </em>(1936) 40 N.M. 318 ....)\u201d (84 Cal.App.3d at p. 624, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Page, supra, </em>104 Cal.App.3d at page 578, the court in considering the purpose of the mayhem statute and the concept of disfigurement stated: \u201cThe law of mayhem as it has developed protects the integrity of the victim\u2019s person. [Citation.] Whether or not it would be a defense to the crime of mayhem that an injury is totally remediable by modern techniques of plastic surgery [citations], an injury which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>leaves permanent scarring of that [the victim\u2019s] sort is clearly \u2018disfigurement\u2019 within the meaning of the statute [citation], and the jury could hardly have reached any different conclusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">We conclude the meaning of \u201cdisfigure\u201d in the context of section 203 is sufficiently definite and certain to inform a person of ordinary intelligence what acts are prohibited. As to defendant, section 203 is sufficiently certain to put him on notice that slashing the victim\u2019s face with a sharp instrument so as to leave a permanent three-inch scar could reasonably be found to be disfigurement.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Defendant contends it is still uncertain \u201cwhat degree of disfigurement <em>is </em>sufficient to support a conviction for mayhem.\u201d He notes the statement by the court in <em>Goodman </em>that \u201cnot every visible scarring wound can be said to constitute the felony crime of mayhem.\u201d (84 Cal.App.3d at p. 625.) We concur in this analysis, but, like the <em>Goodman </em>court find the trier of fact could reasonably have concluded that under section 203 mayhem had been committed by defendant and we decline to disturb that factual finding and determine as a matter of law that a three-inch permanent facial scar is not disfigurement within the meaning of section 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">Puglia, P. J., and Blease, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b349-12\"> Defendant waived his right to a jury trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b349-13\">References are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b349-14\">The court found him not guilty of the charged assault with a deadly weapon (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b350-11\">Technically it was early morning, but one tends to think of parties as evening events.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b353-10\">Thc fact that various parts of the head are mentioned in section 203 is probably attributable more to historical happenstance than to a current legislative intent to exclude from the purview of mayhem areas of the head not specifically mentioned. If Sir John Coventry had been injured as the victim in the instant case was injured, it is possible the issue under discussion would not have arisen in the context of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
