J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-g\">Respondent Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (WCAB) has found that respondent Duncan Haylock (hereinafter also applicant) has sustained injury to his psyche arising out of and occurring in the course of his employment for petitioner Rockwell International (hereinafter Rockwell) as a consequence of disciplinary action taken by Rockwell against applicant. The discipline was imposed for alleged misconduct by applicant while on the employment premises. Rockwell challenges the WCAB\u2019s finding of compensability under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act on the reasoning that since the conduct for which applicant was disciplined was outside the course of applicant\u2019s employment then the resulting psychiatric problems as a consequence of such discipline cannot be held compensable. For the reasons stated herein, we annul the decision of the WCAB and remand the matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The pertinent facts and the analysis of the WCAB are set forth in WCAB\u2019s opinion and order granting reconsideration in pertinent part as follows: \u201cOn February 1, 1980, applicant petitioned for reconsideration of the Findings and Order of January 11, 1980, wherein it was found [by the workers\u2019 compensation judge] that applicant Haylock, a 30-year old custodian, did not sustain industrial injury to his nervous system during the period July 9, 1976 to November 20, 1976. .. . [Applicant] contends, in substance, that the workers\u2019 compensation judge erred and is not supported by substantial evidence ... in failing to find that the injury herein arose out of and occurred in the course of applicant\u2019s employment. ...</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\">\u201cThe injury alleged herein consists of a psychiatric reaction to certain discipline imposed by the employer. The workers\u2019 compensation judge found this discipline to be justified, and any resultant disability noncompensable, as such discipline was imposed for certain conduct of applicant on July 9, 1976, which was not in the course of his employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-7\">\u201cIn his Report on Petition for Reconsideration, the worker\u2019s compensation judge summarized the relevant facts as follows: <em>\u2018Applicant contends </em>that on [July 9, 1976] he was a passenger in a company pickup truck being driven by Juarez, an employee with whom he was assigned to work, and that they were on company property on their way to a break area for an authorized coffee break when, to applicant\u2019s surprise, Juarez unaccountably accelerated the truck to a very high speed, was chased and ultimately stopped at a security gate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">\u201c\u2018After being questioned by the security officer, applicant was reprimanded, given 95 demerits, and suspended for five days by his supervisor, Roy Lavender. In his testimony as well as in his statement to the security officer, applicant maintained that he had nothing to do with Juarez\u2019 conduct, that he knew nothing about any beer or liquor, that he was simply an innocent bystander, and that he remained in the truck at all times and did not climb from the passenger compartment into the truck bed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-9\"><em>\u201c\u2018James Kervin testified </em>substantially as follows on August 4, 1978: He was working in the employer\u2019s security department on July 9, 1976, and was assigned to observe employees suspected of having a mop buck<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>et filled with ice and beer. He saw Juarez and applicant stop at an area where maintenance supplies were kept. He saw Juarez carry out a mop bucket and a plastic trash container which was put over the bucket (presumably in the truck bed). He then followed the truck, and the chase began at speeds of over 55 to 60 miles an hour. During the course of the chase, he saw applicant climb from the cab of the truck into the truck bed while the truck was going at an excessive speed. It then became too dangerous to follow the truck closely, the road being dusty and curvy, and he lost sight of the truck until he saw it again when it was stopped at the security gate. He did not see applicant throw anything from the truck. At the gate he observed that the mop bucket was no longer in the truck. ... He then went back to the area where he had seen applicant climb into the bed of the truck and found \u201cthe\u201d mop bucket and a can of beer in the bushes... . \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-4\">\u201cAfter considering the foregoing and the testimony of other employees of [Rockwell] the workers\u2019 compensation judge noted in his report as follows: \u2018It is concluded as a matter of fact that applicant did climb into the truck bed and dispose, temporarily, of the mop bucket and beer which was later found by Kervin and Manning... [B]ased upon Kervin\u2019s statement that the mop bucket was no longer in the truck when it was stopped at the gate and on his statements that he saw Juarez put the bucket in the truck and saw applicant climb into the truck [bed] during the chase, it is concluded that applicant did in fact do so and that he threw the bucket from the truck, the same bucket Kervin later found in the area where he had seen applicant get into the back of the truck. It is further concluded that there was beer in the bucket. There otherwise would have been no reason to throw it out (unless other liquor was present).\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\">\u201cIn support of his finding that the discipline was justifiable the workers\u2019 compensation judge noted as follows: \u2018. .. [R]isking life and limb by climbing from the passenger\u2019s seat into the bed of a fastmoving truck is clearly an unreasonable act which is outside the course of employment, no matter what the purpose (barring very extraordinary circumstances). In this case the purpose of the act was clearly to dispose of evidence which could have linked applicant with drinking on the job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-6\">\u201c\u2018Applicant\u2019s conduct was unequivocally far outside the course of his employment. Said conduct caused him to be disciplined by the employer. Consequently any emotional reaction to the discipline was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>unmistakably non-industrial. Workers\u2019 Compensation is a no fault system. However, before employees who are at fault can recover for injuries occasioned by their fault, they must be acting in the course of their employment. Applicant\u2019s fault in this case took him far beyond the course of his employment. Accordingly, liability for the resultant psychiatric injury cannot reasonably be imposed upon [Rockwell]...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">\u201cWe shall afford the workers\u2019 compensation judge\u2019s determination of credibility matters the \u2018great weight\u2019 to which they are entitled. (See <em>Garza </em>v. <em>WCAB </em>(1970) [3 Cal. 3d 312] 35 CCC 500.) The discipline imposed by the employer <em>may </em>have been for acts done by applicant outside the course of his employment on. July 9, 1976, and thus was justified. However, based on our review of the medical records, we are persuaded that an industrial injury to applicant\u2019s psyche was incurred which may or may not have resulted in permanent disability. Both Drs. Koenig and Wayman noted applicant\u2019s belief to the effect that he was unjustly disciplined: Dr. Wayman noting that applicant believed \u2018he wasn\u2019t at fault\u2019 (see report of April 26, 1977), Dr. Koenig noting that applicant \u2018claimed to have been the victim of circumstantial evidence\u2019 (see report of January 10, 1978). [(Italics added.)]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-6\">\u201cWhether or not the discipline was justified, it caused disability....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">\u201c.... It is thus possible to find psychiatric injury, even though applicant may have acted improperly on July 9, 1976. Accordingly, reconsideration shall be granted to find an industrial injury to applicant\u2019s psyche, with this matter returned to the trial level for further proceedings and decision on the remaining issues</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">The question presented herein is what impact on the compensability of applicant\u2019s claimed industrial injury is there whether or not the conduct for which applicant was disciplined was outside the course of applicant\u2019s employment. The WCAB has concluded that, even assuming the conduct for which applicant was disciplined was outside the course of his employment, applicant\u2019s psychiatric injury is covered under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act since such discipline arose out of the employment relationship. We, however, conclude to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">Recently in <em>Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1980) 112 Cal.App.3d 241 [169 Cal.Rptr. 285], we were called upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>to decide the compensability under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act of a psychiatric injury sustained by an advertising salesperson as the result of both the stress from an accusation by his employer (Pacific Telephone) that he had forged customer signatures on advertising contracts and the stress from the subsequent investigation by the employer of that accusation and the termination of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">\u201cWe deem[ed] it beyond dispute that if [the employee] had not forged any signatures that any injury to his emotional state would be compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. This would be true even assuming Pacific Telephone had acted reasonably and properly in its accusation, investigation and discharge of [the employee]; the resulting psychiatric conditions would be concerned with [the employee\u2019s] underlying legitimate conduct (entering into advertising contracts with customers) which, in fact, had been in the course of his employment. Negligence by the employer is not a condition of compensability under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3600, subd. (c).)\u201d <em>(Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd., supra, </em>112 Cal.App.3d at p. 245.)</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">We could not, however, \u201cconceive of a realistic argument that [the employee] would be directly or indirectly serving his employer by the forging of contract signatures. Accordingly, [we held that any] injury sustained during the actual furtherance of the criminal activity of forgery would not be compensable.\u201d <em>(Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., supra, </em>112 Cal.App.3d at p. 246.) Noting that there \u201cthe claimed industrial injury was not sustained directly during the course of the alleged criminal activity but sustained as a consequence of the accusation, investigation and termination of [the employee],\u201d we further held that if the employee \u201cin fact engaged in the criminal act of forgery, his injury [as a consequence of the employer\u2019s accusation, investigation and discharge of him] cannot be held compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, as his injury would not be a consequence of his employment but incidental to his criminal conduct.\u201d <em>(Pac. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., supra, </em>112 Cal.App.3d at pp. 246-247.)</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">The obvious difference between the present matter and <em>Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>is that here the conduct for which applicant was disciplined by the employer is noncriminal in nature. We do not, however, view this as a critical distinction in applying the reasoning of <em>Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>to the present matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>It is clear that in <em>Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>the employee\u2019s conduct of forging signatures on contracts (if indeed he did so) would be outside the course of employment. No rational distinction can be made between the treatment as to compensability under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act of criminal conduct and of noncriminal conduct which is also outside the course of employment. To hold otherwise would lead to some inconsistent results under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Labor Code section 3600 excludes certain types of injuries from compensability under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act: an injury sustained as a proximate result of the employee\u2019s intoxication (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3600, subd. (d)); intentionally self-inflicted injuries (subd. (e)); and, injuries arising \u201cout of an altercation in which the injured employee is the initial physical aggressor\u201d (subd. (g)). Thus, if for example the employer disciplines the employee for being the initial physical aggressor in an altercation at work, any stress-caused injury due to the employer\u2019s disciplinary action should be no more compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act than any injury sustained by the employee as a direct result of such altercation. Similarly, if an employee is disciplined by the employer for engaging in \u201chorseplay\u201d while at work (see <em>Hodges </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1978) 82 Cal.App.3d 894 [147 Cal.Rptr. 546]; <em>Argonaut Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1967) 247 Cal.App.2d 669 [55 Cal.Rptr. 810]), stress-related injury as a consequence of such discipline should be no more compensable under the act than any injury sustained directly during the course of such horseplay.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Accordingly, we hold that if applicant were disciplined for conduct <em>outside the course of his employment, </em>any injury sustained as a consequence of such discipline is not compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Since the WCAB found it unnecessary to closely review the workers\u2019 compensation judge\u2019s finding on whether the conduct for which applicant was disciplined was outside the course of his employment, the matter will be remanded to the WCAB for a specific finding on that point. <em>(Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., supra, </em>112 Cal.App.3d at p. 247.) In this regard, we observe that even the workers\u2019 compensation judge noted that there were many unanswered questions concerning the circumstances surrounding the incident for which applicant was disciplined.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">On remand, Rockwell, by its special defense, has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence, that the conduct for which applicant was disciplined was outside the course of applicant\u2019s employment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number> All reasonable doubts, however are to be resolved in favor of applicant. <em>(Pacific Tel. &amp; Tel.
