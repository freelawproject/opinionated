Code, \u00a7 1026) may be extended pursuant to Penal Code section 1026.5 by proceedings initiated by a petition filed <em>after </em>the expiration of the existing term. We hold that it may not and reverse the trial court\u2019s order extending the commitment of defendant Joe Pacini.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b694-10\">Joe Pacini, now 74 years of age, was committed to Atascadero State Hospital on January 6, 1976, after having been found not guilty by reason of insanity of voluntary manslaughter. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 192, subd. 1, 1026.) On June 28, 1979, in accordance with the mandate of <em>In re Moye </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 457 [149 Cal.Rptr. 491, 584 P.2d 1097], the Community Release Board (now Board of Prison Terms) set a maximum commitment date of March 11, 1980, for Pacini.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>On October 29, 1979, the Director of Forensic Services of the Department of Mental Health wrote to the San Joaquin County District Attorney requesting that he file a petition to extend Pacini\u2019s commitment. The letter was either lost or never received. When the district attorney failed to respond by February 21, 1980, the Medical Director of Atascadero telephoned the district attorney and advised one of the deputies that Pacini soon would be returned to Stockton to be released.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">The district attorney took no action until March 10, the day before Pacini was to be released. He then obtained, without benefit of statutory authority and without filing a Penal Code section 1026.5 petition, an order from the San Joaquin Superior Court directing that Pacini be returned to court \u201cso that further legal proceedings may be had\u201d relating to Penal Code section 1026.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">On the same day, he initiated civil commitment proceedings under the Lanterman-Petris-Short (LPS) Act by securing a 72-hour hold. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 5150.) When that expired he obtained a certification that Pacini undergo 14 days of involuntary treatment at Atascadero. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 5250.) Thereupon, the San Joaquin Superior Court suspended its order for further section 1026 proceedings and had Pacini transferred to Atascadero for LPS treatment. There, in the San Luis Obispo Superior Court, postcertification proceedings under LPS were initiated. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 5303.)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">After a hearing on April 10, 1980, the LPS petition was denied based on the finding that Pacini had not \u201cthreatened, attempted, or inflicted physical harm upon the person of another after having been taken into custody\u201d pursuant to the LPS proceedings. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 5300, subd. (a).) Notwithstanding this decision, the court remanded Pacini to Atascadero \u201cfor its determination as to whether there are any other grounds requiring it to hold him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-8\">One day earlier, April 9, the San Joaquin County District Attorney obtained another order for the return of Pacini, conditioned on the denial of the LPS petition in San Luis Obispo County. Pacini was delivered to Stockton State Hospital. On April 14, Pacini was certified for another 14 days of LPS treatment. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 5250.)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">On April 17, 1980, over five weeks after the expiration of Pacini\u2019s maximum commitment date, the San Joaquin County District Attorney filed a petition to extend his commitment pursuant to Penal Code sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>tion 1026.5. The next day, the superior court upheld the late filing of the petition on the ground that the statutory time limits in section 1026.5 were not \u201cjurisdictional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">On May 21, 1980, after a trial that lasted several days, the jury returned special verdicts against defendant, finding that (1) he had a \u201cmental disease, defect, or disorder\u201d; (2) by reason thereof, he \u201crepresented] a substantial danger of physical harm to others\u201d; and (3) he could be \u201cbenefitted from [jzc] psychiatric treatment in a state mental hospital.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1026.5, subd. (b)(1).) Pacini was then recommitted to Atascadero State Hospital for a two-year extended term. He appeals from the order of commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Pacini contends that the district attorney\u2019s failure to timely file the petition required by Penal Code section 1026.5 deprived the trial court of jurisdiction to extend his commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">At the outset, the People urge us not to consider this contention on the ground that it has been resolved against Pacini by the Fifth District Court of Appeal which summarily denied his petition for a writ of habeas corpus by an order issued (July 18, 1980) <em>after </em>the notice of appeal was filed in this case (June 23, 1980). They claim it establishes the law of the case. At the People\u2019s request, we take judicial notice of Pacini\u2019s petition, the Attorney General\u2019s opposition and the minute order denial of the writ. (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 452, subd. (d), 459, subd. (a); <em>People </em>v. <em>Preslie </em>(1977) 70 Cal.App.3d 486, 492-495 [138 Cal.Rptr. 828].) Although the one-sentence denial of the petition recites that it is \u201cupon [the] merits\u201d of Pacini\u2019s petition, we reject the People\u2019s argument that it must be treated as the law of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">The People argue, by implied analogy to cases involving the prerogative writs of mandate and prohibition, that the decision of the Fifth District is binding upon us because the issue here considered was presented to and determined by the court <em>(People </em>v. <em>Shuey </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 835, 842 [120 Cal.Rptr. 83, 533 P.2d 211]) by a written opinion <em>(Price </em>v. <em>Civil Service Com. </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 257, 267, fn. 5 [161 Cal.Rptr. 475, 604 P.2d 1365].)</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">\u201cNormally the doctrine of the law of the case requires adherence to an appellate court\u2019s statement <em>in its opinion on appeal </em>of a rule of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>law necessary to its decision. <em>(Tally </em>v. <em>Ganahl </em>(1907) 151 Cal. 418, 421 [90 P. 1049].) The doctrine has been extended to opinions of an appellate court in original proceedings which are equivalent to an intermediate appeal. <em>(Guardianship of Walters </em>(1947) 81 Cal.App.2d 684, 685 [184 P.2d 684]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Vega </em>[(1970]) 12 Cal.App.3d 970, 972 [91 Cal.Rptr. 167].) The doctrine has also been applied to a minute order denial of a motion to dismiss an appeal when the sole question presented by the motion was the appealability of the judgment. <em>(Pigeon Point Ranch, Inc. </em>v. <em>Perot </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 227, 231 [28 Cal.Rptr. 865, 379 P.2d 321].)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Medina </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 484, 491, fn. 7 [99 Cal.Rptr. 630, 492 P.2d 686].) \u201cApplication of the rule is now subject to the qualifications that \u2018the point of law involved must have been necessary to the prior decision, that the matter must have been actually presented and determined by the court, and that application of the doctrine will not result in an unjust decision.\u2019 <em>(Pigeon Point Ranch, Inc. </em>v. <em>Perot </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 227, 231 [28 Cal.Rptr. 865, 379 P.2d 321]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Medina </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 484, 491, fn. 7 [99 Cal.Rptr. 630, 492 P.2d 686].)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Shuey, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d at p. 842.)</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Critical to the application of the doctrine is the procedure by which the determination of the issue of law is made. On this point, the unique procedures of habeas corpus proceedings come into play.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Habeas corpus proceedings differ procedurally from prerogative writ proceedings. Issues are joined by the issuance of the writ or order to show cause and the return to the writ or order. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1484; Witkin, Cal. Criminal Procedure (1963) \u00a7 825, pp. 790-791; <em>In re Lewallen </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 274, 277-278 [152 Cal.Rptr. 528, 590 P.2d 383]; <em>In re Saunders </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 1033, 1047 [88 Cal.Rptr. 633, 472 P.2d 921].) The petition serves two principal purposes. First, it is an application for a writ. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1474.) \u201cThe function of the petition is to secure the issuance of the writ, and when the writ is issued, the petition has accomplished its purpose.\u201d <em>(In re Collins </em>(1907) 151 Cal. 340, 342 [90 P. 827, 91 P. 397].)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Second, it establishes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>\u201cgrounds of //legality.\u201d (Italics added.) The return must be \u201cresponsive to the grounds actually presented in the petition.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 1, 43, fn. 28 [164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468], relying on <em>In re Connor </em>(1940) 16 Cal.2d 701, 711 [108 P.2d 10].)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But, the <em>return </em>to the writ or order to show cause functions analogously \u201c\u2018to a complaint in a civil proceeding\u2019\u201d in asserting grounds of legality and \u201cas to any factual allegations it makes.\u201d <em>(Green, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 43, fn. 28.) The petition functions as an answer to the return \u201cwhere by stipulation or acquiescence it is treated as a traverse [citation] <em>(In re Saunders, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at p. 1047.) The issuance of the writ or order to show cause \u201cis not equivalent to a final appellate court decision of questions of law in favor, of petitioner under the doctrine of law of the case. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re Hochberg </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 870, 876, fn. 4 [87 Cal.Rptr. 681, 471 P.2d 1]; see also <em>In re Orosco </em>(1978) 82 Cal.App.3d 924, 927 [147 Cal.Rptr. 463].)</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The petition for a writ of habeas corpus is thus preliminary in nature. Unlike the petition for a prerogative writ, there is no formal procedure by which it may be contested. (Cf. Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1107.) Its grant does not establish the law of the case. Nor should its denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The procedure by which issues are formally joined in a habeas corpus proceeding results, in the appellate courts, in the creation of cause triggering the state constitutional requirement that it be resolved \u201cin writing with reasons stated.\u201d \u201cOnce an order to show cause or alternative writ issues, ... the matter becomes a \u2018cause,\u2019 pursuant to the California Constitution (art. VI, \u00a7 14) and requires a written opinion.\u201d <em>(In re Mazoros </em>(1977) 76 Cal.App.3d 50, 52-53 [142 Cal.Rptr. 609].) The creation of the cause also gives the People a right to reply to the petition by a return and to otherwise participate in the decision-making process. As the court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Getty </em>(1975) 50 Cal.App.3d 101, 111 [123 Cal.Rptr. 704], observed: \u201cIn the instant case, the procedural requirements concerning writs of habeas corpus were not met. No writ was actually issued, and the People were deprived of their right to be heard by way of a return to any writ granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">The importance of a written opinion as a prerequisite to a decision sufficiently matured to determine a law of the case has been emphasized in both prerogative and habeas corpus writ cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>In <em>People </em>v. <em>Medina, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d 484, the court said that the summary denial of a petition for a prerogative writ is not a \u201cdetermination of a \u2018cause\u2019 requiring oral argument and a written opinion.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 489-490; see Pen. Code, \u00a7 1254; Cal. Rules of Court, rules 22, 30 [right to present oral argument]; Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 14 [\u201cDecisions of the Supreme Court and courts of appeal that determine causes shall be in writing with reasons stated.\u201d].) It expressed concern that an application of the law of the case doctrine to a summary denial would permit appellate courts to \u201cevade the state constitutional requirement of written opinions\u201d and discourage \u201cwell-advised\u201d defendants from seeking relief by writ for fear of losing these \u201c[\u00a1Important incidents of the right to appeal .. . .\u201d <em>(Medina, </em>6 Cal.3d at pp. 489-490; see also <em>Price </em>v. <em>Civil Service Com., supra, 26 </em>Cal.3d at p. 267, fn. 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Getty, supra, </em>50 Cal.App.3d at pages 106-107, footnote 3, and <em>Rosato </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 190, 230-231, these concerns led courts to refuse to consider summary denials of writs as establishing the law of the case, even though they were accompanied by brief explanatory comments which went beyond mere recitations that the denials were on the merits, because the explanations did not amount to formal opinions and the \u201cimportant\u201d right to present oral argument was not afforded the petitioners. (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Brigham </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 283, 287 [157 Cal.Rptr. 905, 599 P.2d 100] [citing the above cases with apparent approval in connection with holding that criminal defendants have a right to oral argument on appeal].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The importance of formally joining issues and thus creating a \u201ccause\u201d can be seen in this case. In his petition, Pacini challenged his continued confinement at Atascadero as without legal authority, claiming a violation of the 90-day and 30-day petition and hearing provisions of the mentally disordered sex offender law (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 6316.2, subds. (b) and (d)) which <em>Moye </em>said (22 Cal.3d at p. 467) must be used to constitutionally sustain an extended commitment pursuant to Penal Code section 1026. In the petition Pacini said that he intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number><em>appeal </em>from any order of extended commitment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The People filed an informal, though extensive, opposition to the petition, alleging factual matters and attaching court and hospital documents. The opposition said that Pacini\u2019s reliance on <em>Moye </em>was misplaced because <em>Moye </em>has been replaced by Penal Code section 1026.5. It argued further that the petition ought not to be granted on procedural (e.g., appeal as an adequate remedy) and substantive grounds essentially identical to those presented here on appeal. If the opposition had been a return to a writ, it would have tendered new grounds for the legality of the Pacini commitment to be controverted by a traverse. Pacini did not respond to the informal opposition (there was no formal procedure by which to do so) and so never joined issue with the People on the section 1026.5 claims. Moreover, the opposition did not address the specific language of 1026.5, subdivision (b), which we find dispositive of the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">Without an opinion it is not possible to determine what merits were resolved by the Fifth District decision. If the court resolved the legal issue tendered in the petition, the only document formally before it, its decision was limited to whether Pacini was entitled to relief pursuant to <em>Moye. </em>(See <em>People </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 43, fn. 28.) That issue is resolved against Pacini \u201cupon [the] merits\u201d solely on the ground that <em>Moye </em>had been supplanted by Penal Code section 1026.5, without reaching the further ground, whether section 1026.5 itself precluded extended commitment.  \u201cThe doctrine of the law of the case does not extend to points of law which might have been but were not presented <em>and determined </em>on a prior appeal. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(DiGenova </em>v. <em>State Board of Education </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 167, 179 [18 Cal.Rptr. 369, 367 P.2d 865].)</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">If the law of the case precludes our reaching the merits of Pacini\u2019s contention that Penal Code section 1026.5 bars an extension of his commitment, the issue will have been concluded against him without affording him the rights to respond to the People\u2019s claims and to oral argument and a written opinion incident to an appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And we would be deprived of an opinion by which to evaluate the court\u2019s reasoning \u201cupon [the] merits.\u201d (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 242, 246-247 [128 Cal.Rptr. 39, 546 P.2d 327].)</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>The doctrine of the law of the case is also conditioned by equitable considerations. \u201cIn determining whether the law of the case will control the decision on the subsequent appeal, ... the appellate court should keep in mind that \u2018the doctrine of the law of the case, which is merely a rule of procedure and does not go to the power of the court, has been recognized as being harsh, and it will not be adhered to where its application will result in an unjust decision.\u2019 <em>(DiGenova </em>v. <em>State Board of Education </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 167, 179 . . . .)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Medina, supra, 6 </em>Cal.3d at p. 492.) It would work a harsh and unjust result to deprive Pacini of an opinion of the merits of his contentions by application of the law of the case to the summary and cryptic denial of his habeas corpus petition. On another occasion it would work an equally harsh result in precluding the right of the People to respond to a petition. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Getty, supra, </em>50 Cal.App.3d 101.)</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">From these pleading and policy considerations we conclude that the summary denial of a writ of habeas corpus petition by an appellate court, without the issuance of a writ or order to show cause and the consequent creation of a \u201ccause\u201d (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 14), is not a decision which can determine the law of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">The People admit that the San Joaquin County District Attorney utterly failed in this case to comply with the procedure and time limits for filing a petition to extend a commitment under Penal Code section 1026.5.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n                   They maintain, however, that this failure did not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction to entertain the extended commitment proceeding, since the statutory \u201ctime limits\u201d are merely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>\u201cdirectory.\u201d They rely on the rule that \u201cgenerally, requirements relating to the time within which an act must be done are directory rather than mandatory or jurisdictional, unless a contrary intent is clearly expressed.\u201d <em>(Edwards </em>v. <em>Steele </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 406, 410 [158 Cal.Rptr. 662, 599 P.2d 1365].) And they argue that, far from evincing a \u201ccontrary intent,\u201d the Legislature expressly provided in section 1026.5 that \u201c[t]he time limits of this section are not jurisdictional.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1026.5, subd. (a)(2).)</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">The question whether a statutory provision is mandatory or directory tenders an issue concerning the consequences which follow upon the violation of the provision. \u201c[T]he terms mandatory and directory ... are only descriptive of the effect that it has been decided should be given to a statutory provision .... \u201d (2A Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th ed.) \u00a7 57.01, pp. 412-413.) The terms relate to the law of remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">As with all issues of statutory construction, first resort must be had to a close analysis of the language of the statute. \u201cWhether a mandatory or directory construction should be given to a statutory provision may often be determined by an expression in the statute of the result that shall follow noncompliance with the provision.\u201d (2A Sutherland, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 57.08, p. 423.) \u201cThe rule in California and the majority of United States jurisdictions is that when a consequence is enunciated for failing to comply with an act on a given date, that date is deemed to be jurisdictionally mandatory, not directory <em>(Thomas </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>42 Cal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>App.2d 23, 27 [108 P.2d 43]; <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>Randall, </em>15 Cal. 384).\u201d <em>(Ward </em>v. <em>Fremont Unified Sch. Dist. </em>(1969) 276 Cal.App.2d 313, 322 [80 Cal.Rptr. 815].) In <em>Ward </em>the statute directed that a teacher not given a notice of layoff by a date certain must be reemployed. Here, as will be shown, the statute permits extended commitment \u201conly\u201d upon the filing of a petition prior to the date certain, i.e., the date of expiration of the existing commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Penal Code section 1026.5 is a legislative response to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>In re Moye, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d 457, which held on equal protection grounds that a person committed to state hospitals following his acquittal of criminal charges on the ground of insanity cannot be retained beyond the maximum term of imprisonment prescribed for the underlying offenses, except, \u201c\u2018[t]o the extent practicable, and in the absence of further legislation,\u2019\u201d by following the extended commitment procedures provided for mentally disordered sex offenders under Welfare and Institutions Code section 6316.2. The <em>Moye </em>decision \u201ccarefully selected a structure to protect both individual and public rights.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Balderas </em>(1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 942, 946, 947 [164 Cal.Rptr. 275].)</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Section 1026.5, subdivision (b)(1), provides that \u201c[a] person may be committed beyond the term prescribed by subdivision (a) <em>only </em>under the <em>procedure </em>set forth in this subdivision ... (Italics added.) It is clear that whatever \u201cprocedure\u201d refers to, it is mandatory in the sense that without compliance with the \u201cprocedure\u201d no \u201cperson may be committed beyond the [existing] term.\u201d An inspection of the section shows two references for \u201cprocedure.\u201d The first is the general \u201cprocedure\u201d which includes the filing of a petition <em>\u201cbefore </em>the expiration of the original commitment.\u201d (Italics added.) (Subd. (b)(2).) The centrality of this procedural requirement is emphasized in the case of a subsequent recommitment which may be instituted only by the filing of a petition \u201c[p]rior to termination of a commitment under this subdivision ... . \u201d (Subd. (b)(8).)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The second \u201cprocedure\u201d is the \u201ctime limits\u201d specified for the filing of the petition and the initiation of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>The People rely upon the provisions of subdivision (a)(2) which provides that \u201c[t]he time limits of <em>this section </em>are not jurisdictional.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Italics added.) In effect, the People claim that this provision encompasses both of the above senses of \u201cprocedure.\u201d This claim has the impermissible result, however, of completely nullifying the mandatory direction that the \u201cprocedure\u201d be followed before expiration of the term.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">We must, of course, read the language of a statute, if possible, so as not to render some portion of it meaningless. That task can readily be accomplished here. The provision relied upon is in a subsection ((a)(2)) which contains time limits not here in issue. It directs the Board of Prison Terms to set a maximum term of commitment, for any person who had been committed under the prior indeterminate provision of Penal Code section 1026, \u201cwithin 90 days of the date the person is received by the state hospital, or of September 28, 1979, whichever is later . .. and inform various persons of the decision within 20 days. The immediate contextual reference of the language of (jurisdictional) limitation is to these provisions. Only by reading the term \u201csection\u201d as inclusive of subsection (b)(2) does the People\u2019s claim have any merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">But a contextual reading of \u201cthis section\u201d limits its application to the time limits of subsection (a)(2). We first observe that the term \u201csection\u201d in (a)(2) is unambiguously used to refer only to subsection (a)(2) in the sentence immediately following that under review.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Second, the natural reference of the words of jurisdictional limitation is to the immediate context in subsection (a)(2) which contains \u201ctime limits.\u201d We conclude that \u201cthis section\u201d refers to subsection (a)(2) and does not affect subsection (b)(2).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>Accordingly, there is no express jurisdictional limitation upon the \u201cprocedure\u201d which is made mandatory by subsection (b)(2). Because, on either ground considered above, this case must be decided in favor of Pacini, we need not resolve whether or under what conditions a violation of the \u201ctime limits\u201d of (b)(2) is jurisdictional.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">As an alternative ground of resolution, assuming that the word \u201csection,\u201d as used in subsection (a)(2), encompasses subsection (b)(2), we are still compelled to reconcile the mandatory \u201cprocedure\u201d of (b)(2) with the jurisdictional limitation on \u201ctime limits\u201d in (a)(2). That can be done by limiting the jurisdictional language of (a)(2) to its precise reference, that is, to \u201ctime limits,\u201d and hence to limit the term \u201cprocedure\u201d to its first sense as discussed above. That leaves the first sense of \u201cprocedure\u201d in (b)(2), that is, the requirement that the petition be filed before expiration of the term of commitment, in (b)(2), with its full jurisdictional effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The time limits in subsection (b)(2) ar\u00e9 unquestionably intended to afford a patient notice of and an opportunity to prepare for a trial to be completed before expiration of the existing term of commitment. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1026.5, subd. (b)(4).) Compliance with these provisions spares patients a possibly painful choice between seeking an expeditious trial and presenting a complete defense. If a patient is successful in this defense, he is also spared a commitment longer than his existing term. Obviously, not every failure to comply with the \u201ctime limits\u201d would compromise the patient\u2019s liberty interest. But we need not reach the issue whether the precise \u201ctime limits.\u201d of subsection (b)(2) are within the term \u201cprocedure\u201d and hence are jurisdictional.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">In the present case the petition was not filed -until over five weeks <em>after </em>the expiration of Pacini\u2019s previous commitment and he was kept confined thereafter by a combination of orders for unspecified \u201cfurther proceedings,\u201d a series of civil commitments and, finally, custodial orders issued under the aegis of Penal Code section 1026.5.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> There was consequently a failure to comply with the requirement that the petition be filed before expiration of the commitment. We hold that the term \u201cprocedure\u201d in subdivision (b)(2) encompasses at least that requirement and that the failure to comply is jurisdictional.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>We are compelled by statute to hold that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to accept the belated petition and to extend Pacini\u2019s commitment under Penal Code section 1026.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Puglia, P.

Thus, <em>In re Johnson </em>(1980) 107 Cal.App.3d 780, 784-786 [166 Cal.Rptr. 84], held that the requirement of Penal Code section 1170.2 that a prisoner be afforded a serious offender hearing within 120 days of his receipt by the Department of Corrections was mandatory, and not merely directory. The court found inapposite <em>In re Caudillo </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 623 [164 Cal.Rptr. 692, 610 P.2d 1021], which held that the Board of Prison Terms is reinvested with jurisdiction to conduct a serious offender hearing where a judgment entered pursuant to the former Indeterminate Sentence Law has been substantially modified. (Johnson, 107 Cal.App.3d at pp. 786-787.) Similarly, <em>Caudillo, </em>which is relied on by the People, has no application here. This is not a case where the petition came too late because the defendant\u2019s term of commitment was modified so that he suddenly became entitled to release; this is a case, rather, where the district attorney simply failed to file a petition before expiration of the term of commitment. Since the legislative purpose behind the procedure required by Penal Code section 1026.5 is to benefit patients, the trial court was without jurisdiction to entertain the late petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
