J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ahd\">Petitioner and appellant Fogelson seeks a determination that section 1021.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> may, in a proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>case, be used to pay the attorney\u2019s fees incurred by a defendant in a criminal action. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The People, as the real party in interest, contend that petitioner chose the wrong remedy to test the correctness of his legal submission with which, in any event, they do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">In 1974 petitioner was named as the defendant in two criminal complaints containing a total of three counts which were eventually consolidated for trial. He prevailed on two counts which are not material to this proceeding, but was convicted on a third count which charged a violation of section 42.14.1 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code relating to solicitation on city property. The conviction was reversed by the appellate department of the superior court, but another division of this court transferred the case to itself under rule 62(a) and eventually affirmed. The Supreme Court granted a hearing and reversed in a decision filed April 26, <em>1978\u2014People </em>v. <em>Fogelson </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 158 [145 Cal.Rptr. 542, 577 P.2d 677].</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The municipal court dismissed the criminal proceeding on September 19, 1978. Petitioner then filed, in that court, a motion for attorney\u2019s fees and a memorandum of costs which included an item for $35,000 as a \u201creasonable and appropriate\u201d attorney\u2019s fee. The municipal court denied the motion on November 1, 1978. Petitioner appealed to the appellate department. That court, however, dismissed the appeal on March 22, 1979, holding that the order denying the motion for attorney\u2019s fees was not apppealable as an order after judgment affecting petitioner\u2019s substantial rights. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1466, subd. 2(b).) Nevertheless, acting under rule 63, it certified the matter to this court. Transfer was, however, denied on March 29, 1979 by yet another division.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">A little over two months later, on June 6, 1979, petitioner filed a petition for a \u201cwrit of mandate and/or certiorari\u201d in the superior court. The purpose of the proceeding was to obtain a ruling that section 1021.5 could apply to criminal cases and to secure an order directing the municipal court to determine whether, in this particular case, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>statutory criteria of section 1021.5 were met. After a hearing the superior court denied relief relying solely on a point of procedure: petitioner had an adequate legal remedy, namely \u201cthe filing of a proper claim for fees and, if the claim is denied,.... the bringing of an ordinary civil action for the recovery of such fees.\u201d It is this particular denial which petitioner seeks to review by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Since we are quite convinced that the Legislature never intended section 1021.5 to apply to attorney\u2019s fees incurred in the defense of a criminal prosecution, we shall not waste any time on the question of procedure, except to note that we have serious doubts concerning the basis on which the superior court denied relief: if section 1021.5 were applicable it clearly provides for a motion\u2014not a separate civil action \u2014and just as clearly states that if the fees are sought against a public entity \u201cno claim shall be required to be filed therefor.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">We turn to the merits: We have examined all available legislative materials and can assert with confidence that nothing so much as winks at the possibility that section 1021.5 might be applied to attorney\u2019s fees incurred in the defense of criminal cases. Nor have we found a single criminal case among those which apparently triggered the legislation. (E.g., <em>Alyeska Pipeline Co. </em>v. <em>Wilderness Society </em>(1975) 421 U.S. 240 [44 L.Ed.2d 141, 95 S.Ct. 1612]; <em>D\u2019Amico </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 1, 24-27 [112 Cal.Rptr. 786, 520 P.2d 10].) Finally a case to which section 1021.5 is much indebted as far as its precise language is <em>concerned\u2014La Raza Unida </em>v. <em>Volpe </em>(N.D.Cal. 1972) 57 F.R.D. 94\u2014is, of course, a civil case.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">In sum: nothing we have found supports petitioner on the basic question whether the Legislature intended section 1021.5 to apply to cases such as petitioner\u2019s. Petitioner emphasizes that there is nothing in section 1021.5 itself which expressly restricts its impact to civil actions: rather it speaks of \u201cany action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest\u201d and \u201cactions\u201d are described in section 24 of the Code of Civil Procedure as being either civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>or criminal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Petitioner, however, overlooks that just seven sections further down, section 31 provides that \u201c[t]he Penal Code defines and provides for the prosecution of a criminal action.\u201d While this is by no means conclusive on the issue whether the Penal Code provides for the payment of attorney\u2019s fees in certain cases, it does suggest that attorney fees provisions in the Code of Civil Procedure do not deal with criminal actions, unless the words or context compel a holding that they do.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Actually, of course, precisely the opposite is true. Section 1021.5 is part of title 14 of part 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which part is entitled \u201cof Civil Actions.\u201d More specifically it is to be found in chapter 6 dealing with the subject of costs and appears as a qualification to section 1021 which provides that, generally, attorney\u2019s fees are each litigant\u2019s own concern.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nothing could be clearer than that chapter 6 addresses only the question of costs and attorney\u2019s fees in civil actions. Were one to follow petitioner\u2019s suggestion and interpret the word \u201caction\u201d whenever it appears in chapter 6 to include criminal prosecutions, total chaos would result.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">In brief the context in which section 1021.5 appears would make it a highly imaginative exercise of judicial legislation to apply it to criminal cases. (See <em>Bruce </em>v. <em>Gregory </em>(1967) 65 Cal.2d 666, 674 [56 Cal.Rptr. 265, 423 P.2d 193]; <em>County of Orange </em>v. <em>Cory </em>(1979) 97 Cal.App.3d 760, 769 [159 Cal.Rptr. 78]; <em>Steilberg </em>v. <em>Lackner </em>(1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 780, 785 [138 Cal.Rptr. 378]; <em>Johnstone </em>v. <em>Richardson </em>(1951) 103 Cal.App.2d 41, 46 [229 P.2d 9].) The legislative intent being plain, we simply have no occasion to discuss the many considerations of public policy which petitioner advances in favor of legislation which would re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>imhurse his attorney. However desirable such legislation might be, section 1021.5 is not it.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">Finally petitioner points out that the same result\u2014invalidation of section 42.14.1 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code\u2014could have been obtained in a civil action for an injunction or, more probably, for a declaratory judgment. (Cf., <em>Zeitlin </em>v. <em>Arnebergh </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 901, 905 [31 Cal.Rptr. 800, 383 P.2d 152, 10 A.L.R.3d 707]; <em>Wollam </em>v. <em>City of Palm Springs </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 276 [29 Cal.Rptr. 1, 379 P.2d 481]; <em>Katzev </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1959) 52 Cal.2d 360 [341 P.2d 310].) In fact the petition filed below incorporates the complaint in one such action as an exhibit and asserts that \u201cthe results achieved ... in [petitioner\u2019s] criminal action ... are not cognizably different in terms of public benefit [than those] which could or would have been achieved in an affirmative civil action.... \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In addition petitioner points to several cases such as <em>International Soc. for Krishna, etc. </em>v. <em>Collins </em>(5th Cir. 1980) 609 F.2d 151 and <em>Intern. Soc. for Krishna Consc. </em>v. <em>Andersen </em>(8th Cir. 1978) 569 F.2d 1027 in which arguably similar results were achieved under the federal Civil Rights Act and attorney\u2019s fees were awarded under the aegis of 42 United States Code section 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">The short answer to these arguments is that petitioner did not obtain an injunction, a declaratory judgment or relief under the Civil Rights Act. He successfully defended a criminal prosecution at an alleged cost in attorney\u2019s fees of $35,000. The fact that petitioner might have reached the same result in some other type of action tells us nothing about the legal costs that would have been incurred in such an action. We simply cannot apply a statute designed to compensate parties for attorney\u2019s fees in certain limited situations to cases not within the statute on the theory of what might have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Stephens, J., and Ashby, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b673-14\">Section 1021.5: \u201cUpon motion, a court may award attorneys\u2019 fees to a successful party against one or more opposing parties in any action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest if: (a) a significant benefit, whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary, has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons, (b) the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement are such as to make the award appropriate, and (c) such fees should not in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>interest of justice be paid out of the recovery, if any. With respect to actions involving public entities, this section applies to allowances against, but not in favor of, public entities, and no claim shall be required to be filed therefor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b674-9\">The question of the criminal defendant\u2019s indigency is irrelevant. As a matter of fact, the issue is not likely to arise when the taxpayers foot the bill in the first place.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b675-8\">Section 1021.5 became effective on January 1, 1978, several months before the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>People </em>v. <em>Fogelson, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 158, was filed. Thus, since the <em>Fogelson </em>case was still pending on the effective date of the legislation, the time element is no problem. <em>(Woodland Hills Residents Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>City Council </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 917, 932 [154 Cal.Rptr. 503, 593 P.2d 200],</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b676-6\">All statutory references are, unless otherwise indicated, to the Co.ie of Civil Procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b676-7\">\u201cExcept .as attorney\u2019s fees are specifically provided for by statute, the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or implied, of the parties; but parties to actions or proceedings are entitled to costs and disbursements, as hereinafter provided.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b676-8\">Petitioner makes much of the fact that certain Code of Civil Procedure provisions concerning attorneys have been held to apply to criminal proceedings. The point is of no significance: first, the provisions in question, essentially sections 283 et seq.\u2014do not appear in part 2 \u201cof Civil Actions,\u201d but in part 1 \u201cof Courts of Justice;\u201d second, the seminal case which applied the sections to criminal actions appears to have been <em>People </em>v. <em>Bouchard </em>(1957) 49 Cal.2d 438 [317 P.2d 971], which relied heavily on the fact that section 284, as it read at the time, contained a special proviso for civil actions, indicating that the Legislature intended it otherwise to apply to all actions; third, since the Penal Code contains no analogous provisions with respect to the authority, appearance and substitution of attorneys, those found in the Code of Civil Procedure are applicable as a matter of necessity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b677-8\">We are not told why the action, filed in 1974, has apparently not been tried to a conclusion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
