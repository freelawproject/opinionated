The cases are consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">The primary issue we consider is whether taxes paid by the James C. Campbell trust, a Hawaii trust, to the State of Hawaii are \u201con or according to or measured by income or profits\u201d (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 17204, subd. (c)(2)),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which determines whether they may be deducted in computing the California income tax upon the trust. We conclude that as to some of its applications, the Hawaii tax is \u201con or measured by income or profits\u201d and as to other applications it is not, but that the taxpayers have failed to carry their burden of proving which of the taxes paid, if any, fall within the deductible applications of the Hawaii tax. We reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">The facts are essentially contained in a stipulation of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">The taxpayers are beneficiaries of a trust resulting from the estate of James C. Campbell, who died in Hawaii in 1906. The trust has approximately $400 million of assets and approximately 150 beneficiaries. The trust is quite active in the State of Hawaii, maintaining various business licenses and numerous employees, and is involved in industrial, agricultural and residential development. The trust has no real property, no personal property and no intangible property in the State of California.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The estate of James C. Campbell and the trust are located in Hawaii; all of the trustees of the trust are in Hawaii and all of the beneficiaries of the trust, with the exception of taxpayers, are outside the State of California.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">In connection with the operations of the trust in Hawaii, it paid a \u201cHawaii General Excise Tax\u201d to the State of Hawaii pursuant to the provisions of chapter 237, Hawaii Revised Statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">Taxpayers Wrigley reported the total sums actually received from the trust, as beneficiaries, for the calendar years 1969 through 1972. Taxpayers Robinson reported in a like manner for the calendar year 1972, as did taxpayers MacFarlane.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">The board determined that the taxpayers should have included as trust income, taxable in California, their proportional shares of the \u201cexcise\u201d taxes paid to Hawaii and assessed deficiencies and penalties which taxpayers paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">The trial court concluded that the Hawaii \u201cexcise\u201d tax, reviewed as a whole, is a gross receipts tax and that amounts paid as such a tax are deductible in computing the trust income which is taxable in California. We disagree with the court\u2019s analysis and reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b79-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b79-13\">We first consider taxpayers\u2019 argument that we need not reach the issue whether the Hawaii tax may be deducted from the trust in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>come in computing the taxable amount since the measure of the taxable income is the income <em>from </em>the trust <em>to </em>the taxpayer, which does not include the amounts of the taxes paid to Hawaii.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">They rely upon a board regulation (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 18, \u00a7\u00a7 17742-17745, subd. (a)(4)) which specifies the trust income to be taxed as \u201cthat portion of all net income ... which <em>eventually </em>is to be distributed\u201d to resident beneficiaries. (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Taxpayers\u2019 argument is based upon the implied premise that it is the beneficiary\u2019s income and not the trust\u2019s income which is the measure of the income to be taxed. They claim that only the income from the trust to the beneficiary is income subject to California taxes. Therefore, they say, \u201c[i]f the tax paid by the trust to the State of Hawaii never goes into income, it need not be deducted out of income .. . . \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The premise is incorrect. It is founded upon a misconception of the statutory method by which California taxes the income of a foreign trust. We read the administrative regulation in the light of its parent statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">\u201cCalifornia has evolved a comprehensive system for the taxation of trust income .. . which treats the trust as a separate economic entity.\u201d (Fn. omitted.) <em>(McCulloch </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 186, 191 [37 Cal.Rptr. 636, 390 P.2d 412].) \u201cAs to a trust which has contacts that are partly local and partly foreign, . .. the entire undistributed income becomes taxable by California \u2018if the <em>fiduciary or beneficiary </em>is a resident\u2019 of this state.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 192 [citing to what is now \u00a7 17742].)</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">Section 17745, subdivision (a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provides that when the <em>\u201cincome of a trust </em>... is taxable to the trust because the .. . beneficiary is a resident of this State\u201d and the taxes on the trust income are not paid, <em>Usuch income </em>shall be taxable to the beneficiary when distributable to him .... \u201d Plainly, the income to be taxed is <em>trust </em>income, but such income is not \u201ctaxable to the beneficiary\u201d until it is distributable to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>The trust income, when distributable, is \u201cincluded in the gross income of each beneficiary\u201d in an amount proportioned to the beneficiary\u2019s share of the entire distributable income of the trust. (\u00a7 17752, subd. (a).) But such distributable <em>income \u201cshall have the same character in the hands of the beneficiary as in the hands of the trust.\u201d </em>(\u00a7 17752, subd. (b).) We read the regulatory phrase \u201cincome which is to eventually be distributed\u201d as meaning the beneficiary\u2019s share of the distributable <em>trust </em>income.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">California law provides for the <em>collection </em>of unpaid trust taxes by inclusion in a resident beneficiary\u2019s gross income of the beneficiary\u2019s pro rata share of the distributable trust income. It is not what the beneficiary gets from the trust, but his distributable share of the income <em>to </em>the trust which measures the income upon which the California tax is levied. What the beneficiary gets or is entitled to get provides only a pool out of which the state ladles the unpaid taxes of the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">We next determine whether the Hawaii excise tax is a tax levied \u201con or according to or measured by income or profits\u201d (\u00a7 17204, subd. (c)(2)(B)* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>) which precludes its deduction from the trust income in computing the income taxable in California.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Taxpayers ask us to resolve the issue by a general analysis of the Hawaii tax law without regard to its specific applications to the income of the trust. They claim that the Hawaii law, judged as a whole, is a gross receipts tax and \u201ctherefore\u201d not \u201cmeasured by income.\u201d The board argues that the Hawaii tax must be judged by its application to different forms of income, that some of its applications constitute a tax \u201cmeasured by income\u201d and some do not, but that the taxpayers have failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>carry their burden of proof of showing which portions of the taxes paid, if any, are <em>not </em>measured by income. So presented, we resolve the case in favor of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\"><em>Beamer </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Board </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 467 [138 Cal.Rptr. 199, 563 P.2d 238] is controlling. It held that the term \u201c\u2018income\u2019\u201d in the statutory phrase \u201c\u2018taxes on or according to or measured by income,\u2019\u201d means gross income as defined \u201cunder general tax law as currently operating.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 479.) As general tax law, the court referred to federal and state tax law defining gross income as applied to the business activity taxed. <em>Beamer, </em>in apparent recognition of the Sixteenth Amendment origins of the federal income tax law,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> also generally excludes a return of capital from the meaning of gross income and thereby distinguishes gross income from gross receipts. \u201c\u2018The terms \u201cgross income\u201d and \u201cgross receipts\u201d are not synonymous. \u201cGross receipts\u201d is a broader term, including within it receipts which may constitute capital as well as income, and, as shown above, returns of capital may not be taxe[d].\u2019\u201d <em>(Beamer, supra, </em>at p. 477, citing to 1 Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation (1974) \u00a7 5.10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">The details of the <em>Beamer </em>case are instructive here and we excerpt them from the excellent summary in <em>MCA, Inc. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Board </em>(1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 185 [171 Cal.Rptr. 242].</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">\u201cThe California resident taxpayer in <em>Beamer </em>had paid a Texas \u2018\u201coccupation tax\u201d on the business of producing natural gas and crude petroleum\u2019 measured by the \u2018\u201cmarket value\u201d of the oil and gas \u201cas and when produced\u201d . ...\u2019 <em>([Beamer </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax </em>Board] 19 Cal.3d at p. 470.) In the case of oil sold for cash, the value was deemed to be the producer\u2019s gross cash receipts. The California taxpayer was deemed a producer under Texas law of his share of the oil produced and when it was sold his share of the value was the same as his gross royalty receipts. [1\u00cd] The court held that the Texas tax was deductible. The court reasoned as follows. The basic premise was the court\u2019s statement: \u2018[W]e read our statutory language, \u201ctaxes on or according to or measured by income,\u201d to use the term \u201cincome\u201d in the sense of gross income under general tax law as currently operating.\u2019 (19 Cal.3d at p. 479.) Then, because the taxpayer was required to be treated as in the business of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>mining, the court referred to existing state and federal tax regulations to define gross income of such businesses, saying in this respect <em>(id., </em>at p. 476): \u2018[R]elevant regulations of both the Franchise Tax Board (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 18, reg. 17071(c)) and the Internal Revenue Service (Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.61-3(a) (I960)) provide in part that \u201cIn a manufacturing, merchandising, or mining business, \u2018gross income\u2019 means the <em>total sales, less the cost of goods sold. </em>...\u201d\u2019 (Italics in original.) [1J] These regulations were characterized as a recognition of the fact that gross receipts of such businesses include \u2018\u201creceipts which may constitute capital as well as income\u201d\u2019 and \u2018\u201creturns of capital may not be taxe[d].\u201d\u2019 <em>(Id., </em>at p. 477.) As applied to a mining business, the court found these regulations meant that \u2018lifting costs\u2019 were required to be subtracted from the gross receipts in order to determine the gross income.\u201d <em>(MCA, Inc. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Board, supra, </em>115 Cal.App.3d at p. 193.)</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">Taxpayers make a number of claims about the application of <em>Beamer </em>to the Hawaii law, which we examine below. First, we look to the significant features of the Hawaii tax law.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The Hawaii statute (3a Hawaii Rev. Stats. (1976) ch. 237, \u00a7\u00a7 237-1\u2014237-49) imposes annual \u201cprivilege taxes against persons on account of their business and other activities in the State <em>measured by the application of rates against values of products, gross proceeds of sales, or gross income, whichever is specified </em>....\u201d (Italics added.) <em>(Id., </em>at \u00a7 237-13.) Trust estates and trusts are included in the definition of \u201cperson\u201d for tax purposes. <em>(Id., </em>at \u00a7 237-1.) Gross income<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> is defined as \u201cgross receipts ... received as compensation for personal services and the gross receipts .. . derived from trade, business, commerce, or sales ... and all receipts, actual or accrued ... by reason of the investment of the capital of the business engaged in, including interest, discount, rentals, royalties, .. . however designated and <em>without any deductions on account of the cost of property sold, the cost of materials used, labor cost, taxes, royalties, interest, or discount paid or any other expenses </em>whatsoever.\u201d (Italics added.) <em>(Id., </em>at \u00a7 237-3.) Gross proceeds of sale \u201cmeans the value actually proceeding from the sale of tangible personal property <em>without any deduction on account of the cost of property sold or expenses of any kind.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b84-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>As to manufacturing, the Hawaii tax is imposed on the <em>gross proceeds </em>derived from <em>sales </em>(Hawaii Rev. Stats., <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 237-13, subd. (1)(A)), gross proceeds is also the measure of taxes on <em>sales </em>of any tangible personal property. <em>(Id., </em>at \u00a7 237-13, subd. (2)(A).) Contractors, theater operators, sales representatives, service businesses, and professionals are taxed on <em>gross </em>income<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>(id., </em>at \u00a7 237-13, subds. (3)-(8)), as is every other person engaging in any business, trade, activity, occupations, or calling not included in other subdivisions. <em>(Id., </em>at \u00a7 237-13, subd. (10).) A business may be subject to two or more tax rates, depending upon which subdivision of section 237-13 applies to an activity. <em>(Id., </em>at \u00a7 237-14.)</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Taxpayers, following the decision of the trial court<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and relying upon language in the Hawaii law emphasized above, ask us to characterize the Hawaii tax, without reference to its specific applications, as a gross receipts tax, because, without regard to the nature of the business enterprise taxed, it measures the income to be taxed without deduction of costs or expenses. Taxpayers then argue that the general characterization controls without regard to whether the tax law, measured by its specific application, is also a gross income tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Taxpayers have stood the analysis on its head.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Beamer </em>directs us to determine from an analysis of the foreign tax law, measured by general tax law, whether the tax is a gross income tax. Since the general tax law defines gross income by the nature of the income (26 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>\u00a7 61;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 17071<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>), we are required to measure the tax by reference to the specific income activity taxed. In <em>Beamer, </em>the court was concerned with the mining business. As to the mining business \u201c\u2018gross income means the <em>total sales, less cost of goods sold (Beamer </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Board, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at p. 476.) But, as will be shown, such definition does not apply to other forms of gross income (e.g., rent and interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">An inspection of the Hawaii law shows its multifaceted applications. As applied to retail sales, it is a sales tax not measured by gross income. (See Internal Revenue Service, rev. rule 58-564; see also Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 6051; 11 Marshall, Cal. Practice, State and Local Taxation (1969) \u00a7 161, pp. 199-200.) As applied to mining activities, it is a gross receipts (and not a gross income) tax similar to that considered in <em>Beamer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">In our case, the state and federal income tax forms filed by the trust in 1969 through 1972 show its income was primarily derived from interest, real property rents and royalties. The royalties listed are from \u201crock sales.\u201d Taxes on trust activities were remitted to the state during each year and amounts paid for \u201crock sales\u201d and \u201cincome\u201d are listed separately as deductions under the heading \u201cHawaii Gross Income Tax\u201d on the tax forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>It appears that the bulk of the trust income is rental and interest income. These items are specifically listed as gross income in the California and federal statutes (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 17071, subds. (a)(4), (a)(5) [see <em>ante, </em>fn. 11]; 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 61(a), subds. (a)(4)-(a)(6) [see <em>ante, </em>fn. 10]; and see (former) Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 18, \u00a7 17071, subd. (g), and 26 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1.61-7, 1.61-8; <em>MCA, Inc. </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Board, supra, </em>115 Cal.App.3d at pp. 196-198.) Rent, for example, is <em>defined </em>to exclude a return of capital. (See Int. Rev. Code (1954) \u00a7 162(a)(3); Mertens (1974) vol. 1, \u00a7 6A.02; vol. 4a, \u00a7 25.108, \u201cThe term \u2018rentals\u2019 should be taken in its usual and ordinary sense, that is, \u2018as implying a fixed sum ... to be paid at stated times for the use of property ... and in that sense <em>does not include payments, </em>. .. <em>made for the cost of improvements </em>....\u2019\u201d (Italics added.)) <em>(Oesterreich </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue </em>(9th Cir. 1955) 226 F.2d 798; see also Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 17202, subd. (a)(3); former Cal. Admin. Code, tit, 18, \u00a7 17071, subd. (g) [\u201cThe following items are allowed as deductions: [If] (1) All the necessary expenses paid or incurred for the production of income or in carrying on any trade or business are deductible including: [11] (c) Rentals or other payments made to assure the continued use or possession of property used in business as long as the taxpayer has not taken and is not taking title or as long as he has no equity in it.\u201d (Fns. omitted.) (12 Marshall, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 573, subd. C(l)(c), p. 51.])</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Since the definition of rent excludes a return of capital or cost of goods sold, it is, of course, immaterial that the Hawaii law also does not permit a deduction of such items <em>from </em>rent. The Hawaii tax law apparently excludes return of capital from \u201cany proceeds that constitute or are in the nature of rent....\u201d (Hawaii Rev. Stats., <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 237-13, subd. (3)(D).) Accordingly, rent, as used in the Hawaii law, bears the same meaning as that in use in the controlling general tax law. Taxpayers may not deduct the taxes paid on such income.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">We note that part of the trust income was characterized as \u201croyalties\u201d from \u201crock sales.\u201d <em>If </em>the sales were a part of a manufacturing, merchandising, or mining business activity, the Hawaii tax is measured by gross proceeds under section 237-13, subdivisions (1) and (2), so defined as to <em>exclude </em>the costs of goods sold. California tax regulations in effect when the taxes were paid define \u201cgross income\u201d in these businesses as \u201cthe total sales, less the cost of goods sold.\u201d (Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 18, \u00a7 17071, subd. (c) [repealed]; see <em>Beamer, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at p. 476.) Such a Hawaii tax is deductible under California law. Howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>er, the taxpayers have placed all of their income in one basket. Consequently, they have failed to carry the burden of showing that the Hawaii tax, as applied to rock sales, falls within section 237-13 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes. <em>(Flying Tiger Line, Inc. </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Equal. </em>(1958) 157 Cal.App.2d 85, 95 [320 P.2d 552].)</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Puglia, P.

The Hawaii General Excise Tax definition of gross income specifically denies any deduction of the cost of goods sold, materials used, labor costs and the like, as quoted above. In other words, \u201cgross receipts.\u2019\u201d\u201d The trial court then concluded that the Hawaii tax is a tax measured by \u201cgross receipts.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b84-8\">Taxpayers correctly note that Beamer did not personally incur any lifting costs and that the income, as to him, was also gross income. <em>(Beamer </em>v. <em>Franchise Tax Board, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d at p. 480.) They draw from this that if receipts can be viewed as both gross income and gross receipts, the gross receipts characterization controls. Taxpayers misread <em>Beamer. </em>The issue there was whether Texas <em>law </em>permitted deduction of lifting costs, not whether Beamer had any and, consequently, whether the Texas <em>law, </em>measured by general tax law, was a tax on gross income.
