Code, \u00a7 13801 et seq.), of the Fremont Fire District. They appeal from a judgment in favor of respondent, following an order granting respondent\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissing the complaint. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">History</p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">The Fremont Fire District was established as a county fire protection district on June 25, 1928, pursuant to a resolution of the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors and state legislation enacted in 1923 (the 1923 Act) which authorized the formation of such districts in unincorporated territory of the county. (Stats. 1923, ch. 191.) Section 5 of the 1923 Act, as amended in 1925, provided: \u201cThe <em>board of supervisors </em>of any county wherein any county fire protection district is established shall be the <em>governing body </em>thereof and shall have power to make and enforce all rules and regulations necessary for the administration and government of such district and for the furnishing of fire protection thereto; to appoint agents and employees for such district sufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>maintain and operate the property acquired for the purposes of the district and to police the district; to acquire real or personal property needful for the purposes of said district and to dispose of the same when no longer needed; to construct any needed structures; and to perform all other acts necessary or proper to accomplish the purposes of this act. Such board shall have authority to purchase fire hydrants and connect them with the mains of a water distributing company upon terms mutually agreed upon. The board of supervisors may, by resolution or order spread upon its minutes, <em>appoint five commissioners </em>as its agents to manage the affairs of said district and exercise <em>any or all </em>of the powers herein specified. In such case said commissioners shall elect one of their number president and another secretary, and hold stated meetings periodically and as often as the business of the district may require. Said commissioners shall hold office <em>at the pleasure of </em>said board and shall serve without compensation.\u201d (Stats. 1923, ch. 191, \u00a7 5, as amended, Stats. 1925, ch. 370, \u00a7 2; italics added.) On the same day that the Fremont Fire District was established, the board of supervisors appointed \u201ca commission of five members ... to manage the affairs\u201d of the district \u201cwith all the powers relative thereto conferred upon the Board of Supervisors by the provisions of\u201d section 5 of the 1923 Act, as amended in 1925. The first commissioners were appointed to serve \u201cat the will and pleasure of\u201d the board of supervisors. Section 5 of the 1923 Act was amended in 1929, in 1931, in 1933, and in 1937; but throughout those amendments, the county board of supervisors remained the \u201cgoverning body\u201d of the county fire protection district. (Stats. 1929, ch. 614; Stats. 1931, ch. 762; Stats. 1933, ch. 212; Stats. 1937, ch. 335.)</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Comprehensive legislation establishing the Health and Safety Code was enacted in 1939. (Stats. 1939, ch. 60.) The fire district laws were codified in part 3 of division 12 of the code. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 14001 et seq.) The 1939 codification provided for four different types of fire districts: \u201cFire Protection Districts in Unincorporated Areas\u201d (pt. 3, ch. 1), \u201cMetropolitan Fire Protection Districts\u201d (pt. 3, ch. 1A), \u201cCounty Fire Protection Districts\u201d (pt. 3, ch. 2), and \u201cFire Protection Districts in One or More Counties\u201d (pt. 3, ch. 3). Chapter 2 of part 3 (Health &amp; Saf. Code, former \u00a7\u00a7 14400-14592), concerning county fire protection districts, derived from the 1923 Act. (Stats. 1939, Appen., p. 3363.)</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Former section 14404 of the Health and Safety Code provided from the date of its enactment until its repeal in 1967: \u201c\u2018Board,\u2019 as used in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>this chapter, means the board of supervisors of the county in which the district is situated.\u201d (Stats. 1939, ch. 60, \u00a7 14404.)</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">Former section 14440 provided from the date of its enactment until its repeal in 1967: \u201cThe board is the <em>governing body </em>of the district and may make and enforce all rules and regulations necessary for the administration and government of the district, for the furnishing of fire protection to, and for the elimination of fire hazards in, the district.\u201d (Stats. 1939, ch. 60, \u00a7 14440; italics added.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">The Fire Protection District Law of 1961 (the 1961 Law) now governs the four types of fire districts which had been authorized by part 3 of division 12 of the code. (Stats. 1961, ch. 565.) The 1961 legislation added the 1961 Law to the code as part 2.7 of division 12 (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 13801-13999) and left the existing legislation contained in part 3 (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 14001 et seq.) intact. (Stats. 1961, ch. 565, \u00a7 1.) A section was added, however, to each of the four chapters in part 3 which governed, respectively, the four types of fire districts authorized prior to 1961. (Stats. 1961, ch. 565, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3, 4, 5.) Each of those four sections contained the same language; and each of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>them\u2014including former section 14407, which was added to chapter 2 (concerning county fire protection districts) of part 3\u2014read as follows: \u201cNo district shall be created or organized pursuant to this chapter after the effective date of this section. At any time <em>within five years </em>after the effective date of this section, <em>any district </em>heretofore created or organized pursuant to this chapter <em>may elect </em>to come under the provisions of Part 2.7 (commencing with Section 13801), Division 12 of the Health and Safety Code <em>and shall by resolution of the governing body of a district with an elected board of directors, or by resolution of the supervising authority of a district with an appointed board of directors, </em>certify to the Secretary of State that the district has elected to conform to the provisions of that part. [U] Any district organized prior to the effective date of this section <em>which has not, within five years </em>after the effective date of this section, elected to come under the provisions of Part 2.7 (commencing with Section 13801), Division 12 of the Health and Safety Code <em>shall automatically be considered </em>as organized and operating under that part. <em>Upon the automatic reorganization of a district, the governing body of the former district shall be deemed to be the governing body of the reorganized district </em>and the assets and liabilities of the former district shall vest in the reorganized district.\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, former \u00a7\u00a7 14022, 14328, 14407, 14606; italics added.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">The parties in this case agree that \u201c [ r ]eorganization of the Fremont Fire District to conform to the provisions of the 1961 Law occurred during 1965.\u201d By a petition dated October 19, 1965, the Fremont Fire District Board of Commissioners asked the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors \u201cto institute such action as may be necessary to reorganize the Fremont Fire District under\u201d the 1961 Law. The petition provides in part, \u201cIt is the Fremont Fire District\u2019s desire that all phases of District operation remain as they now are.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">On November 1, 1965, the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors passed a resolution which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-6\">\u201cWhereas, Section 14407 of the Health and Safety Code provides that at any time within five years after the effective date of this section, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>any district organized as a County Fire Protection District may elect to come under the provisions of Part 2.7 (commencing with Section 13801), Division 12 of the Health and Safety Code and shall <em>by resolution of the supervising authority of a district with an appointed board of directors, </em>certify to the Secretary of State of the State of California, that the district has elected to conform to the provisions of that part; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-4\">\u201cWhereas, a fire protection district may voluntarily conform <em>as presently organized and constituted </em>to the Fire Protection District Law of 1961, and be considered as organized and operating under the provisions of that part.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">\u201cNow, Therefore, Be it Resolved by the Board of Supervisors of the County of Santa Clara, State of California, and it is ordered as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">\u201cThat the Fremont Fire District of Santa Clara County has voluntarily elected to conform <em>as presently organized and constituted </em>and is hereby deemed organized and constituted as a fire protection district pursuant to the provisions of Part 2.7 of Division 12, commencing with Section 13801 of the California Health and Safety Code, and acts amendatory thereof and supplementary thereto; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-7\">\u201cBe it Further Resolved that this order be certified to the Secretary of State of the State of California as provided by Section 14407 of the Health and Safety Code.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">The certificate of the Secretary of State, dated November 5, 1965, contains the following recital: \u201c[I]t appears that the <em>directors </em>of the district shall be appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the Board of Supervisors, <em>as </em>heretofore.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">In 1967, after the five-year period designated in Health and Safety Code section 14407 (and its identical sister sections) had elapsed, the Legislature repealed chapters 1, 1A, 2, and 3 of part 3 (division 12) of the code\u2014the chapters governing the four types of fire districts authorized prior to 1961. (Stats. 1967, ch. 540, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3, 4, 5.) As part of chapter 3, section 14407 was repealed along with the rest of chapter 3. (Stats. 1967, ch. 540, \u00a7 4.) The Fire Protection District Law of 1961 remained effective as part 2.7 of division 12. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 13801 et seq.) The 1961 Law contains the following provision: \u201cNo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>person shall be a candidate for or be appointed to or hold office on the district board unless he is a voter of the district or proposed district.\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 13894; added Stats. 1961, ch. 565, \u00a7 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">It appears from the record in this matter that at the time of trial, none of the members of the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors were voters of the Fremont Fire District. The parties agree that each member of the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors is required to be elected by the supervisorial district which he represents (see Gov. Code, \u00a7 25040) and that the Fremont Fire District is wholly contained within one of those supervisorial districts. Consequently, pursuant to the Government Code, there could never be more than one county supervisor who is also a voter of the Fremont Fire District.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Appellants contend that as a result of the 1965 reorganization,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the board of commissioners of which they are members is the \u201cdistrict board\u201d of the Fremont Fire District, within the meaning of the Fire Protection District Law of 1961. They agreed at the hearing of this matter in the superior court that their contention presents no questions of fact and that its validity depends upon statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">The 1961 Law, as amended in 1963, provides four alternative \u201cmethods of selecting the board of directors of\u201d a fire protection district: (a) the board of directors may be <em>composed of </em>the supervising authority; (b) the board of directors may be <em>appointed by </em>the supervising authority; (c) the board of directors may be appointed by and from the board of supervisors <em>and </em>by and from the city council's of the cities included within the district; or (d) the board of directors may be <em>directly elected, </em>pursuant to the election provisions contained in part 2.7 (division 12) of the Health and Safety Code. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 13831, subds. (a)-(d); Stats. 1961, ch. 565, \u00a7 1, as amended, Stats. 1963, ch. 1646, \u00a7 1.) The first two alternative methods of selection, set forth in subdivisions (a) and (b) of section 13831, are particularly relevant here. Those subdivisions provide: \u201cA petition or resolution which proposes the for<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>mation of a district shall specify one of the following methods of selecting the board of directors of the district: [11] (a) That the board of directors shall be <em>composed of </em>the supervising authority. [11] (b) That the board of directors shall have five members <em>appointed by </em>the supervising authority. [H] Where the members of the board of directors are appointed by the supervising authority, the board shall determine whether the members of the board of directors shall serve at the pleasure of the supervising authority, or for a term of four years subject to removal by the supervising authority for cause. If the members of the board of directors are appointed for four-year terms, the terms of members first appointed shall expire as follows: one member, one year from the effective date of his appointment; one member, two years from the effective date of his appointment; one member, three years from the effective date of his appointment; and two members, four years from the effective date of their appointments. The determination as to which members of the board of directors shall serve the one-, two-, three- and four-year terms shall be determined by the supervising authority by lot.\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 13831, subds. (a), (b); italics added.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">According to appellants, the Fremont Fire District is organized pursuant to subdivision (b) of section 13831, so that the former board of commissioners is now the board of directors. They argue that \u201cunder the provisions of Health and Safety Code Section 13894 [the \u2018voter of the district\u2019 requirement], a finding that a Board of Supervisors is the District Board would necessarily mean that there would be no one eligible to serve on that Board.\u201d Appellants\u2019 interpretation \u201climits that alternative [set forth in subd. (a) of \u00a7 13831] to situations in which the fire district is county-wide, thus insuring the representative governance which section 13894 was obviously intended to provide.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>Respondent submits that the district board is \u201ccomposed of\u201d the board of supervisors, pursuant to subdivision (a) of section 13831, primarily on the ground that former section 14407 (cited in the supervisors\u2019 resolution) \u201cdid not provide a mechanism for altering a district\u2019s governmental structure.\u201d According to respondent, Health and Safety Code section 13894 (the \u201cvoter of the district\u201d requirement) was not intended to apply to fire districts governed by boards of supervisors.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">The language of section 13894 is identical to the language of former section 14134, contained in former chapter 1 of part 3 (division 12) of the Health and Safety Code. Former chapter 1 concerned local fire districts. Under former chapter 1, members of the district board were directly elected. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, former \u00a7\u00a7 14051-14055.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Former chapter 3, concerning county fire protection districts such as the Fremont Fire District, contained no \u201cvoter of the district\u201d requirement. Section 13894 is presently contained in chapter 6 of part 2.7 (division 12) of the Health and Safety Code. Chapter 6 is entitled \u201cProvisions Relating to Elections.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Its present context and legislative history indicate that section 13894 does not apply to districts organized pursuant to subdivision (a) of section 13831.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Before 1965, statutory authority to govern the Fremont Fire District was vested in the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, former \u00a7\u00a7 14404, 14440 et seq.) The 1961 Law clearly did not contemplate that in order for the district to conform to its terms, the change in organizational structure propounded by appellants would necessarily have to occur. (See, e.g., Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 13814. )<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, we hold that statutory authority to govern the district is presently vested in the board of supervisors, pursuant to section 13831, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>subdivision (a), and section 13852 of the Health and Safety Code; and that respondent is the \u201cdistrict board\u201d of the Fremont Fire District within the meaning of the Fire Protection District Law of 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Racanelli, P. J., and Newsom, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Express authority for the appointment of commissioners was not included in the comprehensive legislation (Stats. 1939, ch. 60); but two different statutes were enacted in 1939, apart from the comprehensive measure, which supplied that express authority. The following provision was codified as section 14453: \u201cThe board may, by resolution or order entered upon its minutes, appoint five commissioners to act as its agents in managing the affairs of the district and in exercising any or all of the powers vested in it. Commissioners so appointed shall: [H] (a) Hold office at the pleasure of the board and serve without compensation. [H] (b) Elect one of their number president and another secretary. [11] (c) Hold meetings periodically and as often as the business of the district may require.\u201d (Stats. 1939, ch. 381.) Section 14453 was amended in 1953 by adding a provision authorizing the board to \u201ccall for the election of five commissioners\u201d as an alternative to appointing them. (Stats. 1953, ch. 643, \u00a7 1.) By separate enactment in 1939, and in addition to section 14453, article 4.5 (Health &amp; Saf. Code, former \u00a7 14455 et seq.), entitled \u201cCommissioners,\u201d was added to chapter 2 of part 3 (division 12) of the code\u2014the chapter concerning county fire protection districts. (Stats. 1939, ch. 218.) As originally enacted, the first four sections of article 4.5 were nearly identical to the provisions of section 14453. The article was amended from time to time until its repeal in 1967. (Stats. 1967, ch. 540, \u00a7 4.) Former section 14455.11, one of the post-1939 additions to article 4.5, provided: \u201cWhere the commissioners are appointed by the board, the board shall determine whether the commissioners shall serve at the pleasure of the board, or for a term of four years subject to removal by the board for cause. If the commissioners are appointed for four-year terms, the terms of members first appointed shall expire as follows: one member, one year from the effective date of his appointment; one member two years from the effective date of his appointment; one member three years from the effective date of his appointment; and two members four years from the effective date of their appointments. The determination as to which commissioners shall serve the one-, two-, three- and four-year terms shall be determined by the board by lot.\u201d (Added Stats. 1959, ch. 1966, \u00a7 2; operative Jan. 1, 1960.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b172-7\">The terms \u201csupervising authority\u201d and \u201cboard of directors\u201d were not contained in chapter 2 of part 3 until the addition in 1961 of former section 14407, quoted above; and those terms are not defined in that section. The 1961 Law\u2014part 2.7 of division 12 of the code\u2014defines terms used in <em>that </em>part. Except in circumstances not relevant here, the term \u201csupervising authority,\u201d as used in part 2.7, means the board of supervisors. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 13806.) \u201c\u2018District board,\u2019 as used in [part 2.7] means the board of directors of a district.\u201d (Health &amp; Saf.

(See, e.g., Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 13977 [specification of method of selecting board of directors], 13978 [publication], 13979 [hearing].)

According to respondent, the recitals are erroneous insofar as they imply that the \u201cdirectors\u201d hold office by appointment.
