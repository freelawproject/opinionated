Prior to the election, campaign signs supporting the candidacy of appellant and the reelection of another candidate, John Condon, were posted on public property within the city. On February 8, 1977, the city attorney sent a letter to all candidates, including Sussli, informing them that sign posting on public property was prohibited by local ordinance section 25.04.090, reproduced verbatim in the margin,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and requesting that all such campaign signs be removed no later than the following week under threat of summary removal by city officials. The letter also advised that under applicable ordinance provisions, sign posting on private property was permissible with the consent of the owner of the property. A copy of the ordinance regulating the time, manner and placement of an \u201celection sign\u201d was included with the written notification.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b24-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>When the candidates refused to comply with the written request, city personnel undertook removal of the offending signs, resulting in the institution of suit for injunctive and declaratory relief. At the conclusion of the hearing the trial court made its decision upholding the ordinance prohibiting the posting of campaign signs on all public property with its attendant sanction of summary removal. Following the adoption of written findings and conclusion and entry of formal judgment, candidate Sussli instituted this appeal.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">The principal theory of the complaint is that the challenged ordinance constitutes an impermissible abridgement of the right of free speech guaranteed under the provisions of the federal and state Constitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Respondents denied the charging allegations and affirmatively alleged that the ordinance was justified on the grounds of overriding governmental interests.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">On appeal, while conceding that the right to erect or post signs on public property is subject to reasonable regulations for legitimate governmental purposes, Sussli asserts that the absolute ban imposed by the ordinance of a protected First Amendment interest is constitutionally defective on its face. Moreover, he argues, the governmental interests advanced cannot justify what amounts to an overbroad restriction on the right of free speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">Respondents counter that the uniform imposition of the prohibition against sign posting on any public property does not represent an un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>lawful intrusion into traditional forums for protectible First Amendment activities. Alternatively, with heavy reliance placed upon the relevant criteria announced in <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Redwood City </em>(9th Cir. 1976) 540 F.2d 1360, they argue that the governmental interests promoted by the ordinance as found below justify any incidental restriction imposed on the exercise of First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\">The precise question presented\u2014characterized by the parties as whether a city may totally prohibit the posting of political signs on public property within the city\u2014is apparently one of first impression.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The significance of that central issue is underscored in amici\u2019s brief on behalf of 48 California cities who had ordinances similar to the ordinance under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">Sussli\u2019s initial attack on the facial validity of the ordinance focuses upon the mode of expression as a form of protected speech which cannot be entirely banned from a traditional forum for the exercise of First Amendment rights. Thus, the argument continues, once First Amendment protection is extended to the means of communication such as sign posting, any legislative attempt to ban outright such protected medium of speech from the public forum is unconstitutional per se.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">In fact the courts have repeatedly recognized that virtually all modes of communication used to disseminate ideas and protected expression on the public streets fall within the protective umbrella of the First Amendment. <em>(Kash Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 294, 301-302 [138 Cal.Rptr. 53, 562 P.2d 1302] [news racks]; <em>Police Department of Chicago </em>v. <em>Mosley </em>(1972) 408 U.S. 92 [33 L.

Constitutional analysis in First Amendment areas has consistently followed a balancing rather than a classifying approach <em>(Baldwin </em>v. <em>Redwood City, supra, </em>540 F.2d 1360, 1365), discounting any artificial distinction as to whether the restrictive legislation is termed regulatory or prohibitory. <em>(Goldblatt </em>v. <em>Hempstead </em>(1962) 369 U.S. 590, 592 [8 L.Ed.2d 130, 132-133, 82 S.Ct. 987]; <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Redwood City, supra, </em>at p. 1370, fn. 28; <em>Metromedia, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of San Diego </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 848, 863 [164 Cal.Rptr. 510, 610 P.2d 407], prob. jur. noted, 449 U.S. 897 [66 L.Ed.2d 127, 101 S.Ct. 265].) Viewing the matter from that perspective, courts have repeatedly upheld the exercise of the police power to <em>prohibit </em>the means or mode of communication in order to vindicate sufficiently important governmental interests, even though the prohibition impinges upon First Amendment freedoms. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien </em>(1968) 391 U.S. 367, 376 [20 L.Ed.2d 672, 679-680, 88 S.Ct. 1673]; <em>Metromedia, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of San Diego, supra, </em>at pp. 866-867; see also Tribe, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>at p. 599.) The principles distilled from the relevant decisions discussing this balancing approach have been well stated in the form of a general rule in <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Redwood City, supra </em>(involving local regulations governing political sign posting on private property) as follows: \u201cIncidental restrictions upon the exercise of the First Amendment rights may be imposed in furtherance of a legitimate governmental interest if that interest is unrelated to suppression of expression and is substantial in relation to the restrictions imposed, and if the restrictions are no greater than nec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>essary or essential to the protection of the governmental interests.\u201d (Id., at p. 1365.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">Thus, while section 25.04.090 establishes a blanket prohibition neutrally directed against all inanimate modes of expression on public property (within a regulatory scheme permitting placement of temporary election signs on private property (\u00a7 25.12.130)), the test to be applied in determining whether it survives a constitutional challenge necessarily requires a balancing of competing interests. <em>(Schneider </em>v. <em>State, supra, </em>308 U.S. at p. 161 [84 L.Ed. at pp. 164-165]; <em>Dulaney </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at pp. 84-85.)</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">In applying the correct constitutional standard, the trial court found that the content-neutral ordinance fostered significant governmental interests, which included traffic safety and aesthetic considerations, interests wholly unrelated to suppression of expression and rationally connected to the restrictions imposed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, supra, </em>391 U.S. at p. 377 [20 L.Ed.2d at p. 680]; <em>Metromedia, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of San Diego, supra, </em>26 Cal.3d 848, 858, 871.)</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">It is equally clear that the First Amendment interests involved in the display of political posters adjacent to public thoroughfares are substantial in nature. <em>(Baldwin </em>v. <em>Redwood City, supra, </em>540 F.2d 1360, 1368.) As one distinguished commentator in the field of constitutional law has observed: \u201cTwo variables have been important in structuring the balancing process, and in deciding how heavy a burden of justifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>tion\u2014and how large a sacrifice of other goals\u2014to impose on government. The first has been the degree to which any given inhibition on communicative activity falls unevenly upon various groups in the society.... [H] The second variable has been the degree to which the inhibition on communicative activity operates to shut down places that have traditionally been associated with the public exchange of views ... .\u201d (Tribe, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>at pp. 683-684.) In relation to the latter consideration, the City of San Mateo strenuously argues that not only has political sign posting on public property never been extended constitutional protection under the doctrine of traditional forums, but such a claimed right has been expressly rejected in the only relevant reported decision. (See <em>Brayton </em>v. <em>City of Anchorage, supra, </em>386 P.2d 832.) Moreover, the city asserts, the availability of private property-posting provides an adequate alternative forum for the exercise of the protected activity. (Cf. <em>Young </em>v. <em>American Mini Theaters </em>(1976) 427 U.S. 50 [49 L.Ed.2d 310, 96 S.Ct. 2440] [plurality opinion by Stevens, J.].)</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">Of course, it is settled law that within the context of the traditional public forum, abridgement of the freedom of expression may not be conditioned upon the existence of alternative channels of communication. <em>(Grayned </em>v. <em>City of Rockford </em>(1972) 408 U.S. 104, 118 [33 L.Ed.2d 222, 233-234, 92 S.Ct. 2294]; <em>Schneider </em>v. <em>State, supra, </em>308 U.S. 147, 163 [84 L.Ed. 155, 165-166]; <em>Wirta </em>v. <em>Alameda-Contra Costa Transit Dist., supra, </em>68 Cal.2d 51, 59; and cf. <em>Robins </em>v. <em>Pruneyard Shopping Center </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 899 [153 Cal.Rptr. 854, 592 P.2d 341] (overuling <em>Diamond </em>v. <em>Bland </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 331 [91 Cal.Rptr. 501, <em>477 </em>P.2d 733]); see also Tribe, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>p. 684.) Yet it is a factor to be considered in attempting to strike the proper balance between the right of free expression and legitimate governmental interests. <em>(Baldwin </em>v. <em>Redwood City, supra, </em>540 F.2d 1360, 1368; cf., <em>Metromedia, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of San Diego, supra, </em>26 Cal.3d 848, 868.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">Certainly, the fact that \u201cmeans of political communication are not entirely fungible; [and] political posters have unique advantages\u201d <em>(Baldwin </em>v. <em>Redwood City, supra, </em>540 F.2d 1360, 1368) should likewise be considered in the balancing process. As the state Supreme Court has noted in another context, \u201c[ajbsent the presence of some con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>flicting interest that could be protected in no other way, petitioners have the right to choose their own forum.\u201d <em>(In re Hoffman </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 845, 852, fn. 7 [leafletting in public railroad station].)</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">Thus, although the governmental purpose be legitimate and substantial, such purpose may not be achieved \u201cby means that broadly stifle fundamental personal liberties when the end can be more narrowly achieved. [Fn. omitted.]\u201d <em>(Shelton </em>v. <em>Tucker </em>(1960) 364 U.S. 479, 488 [5 L.Ed.2d 231, 237, 815 S.Ct. 247]; <em>Dulaney </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d 77, 84.) In balancing the competing interests shown to exist \u201cprecision of regulation must be the touchstone .... \u201d <em>(N. A. A. C. P. </em>v. <em>Button </em>(1963) 371 U.S. 415, 438 [9 L.Ed.2d 405, 421, 83 S.Ct. 328]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fogelson </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 158, 166 [145 Cal.Rptr. 542, 577 P.2d 677].) Regulations affecting protected First Amendment activities must be justified by something more than \u201cmere legislative preferences or beliefs respecting matters of public convenience\u201d <em>(Schneider v. State, supra, </em>308 U.S. 147, 161 [84 L.Ed. 155, 165]) and are constitutionally permissible \u201conly if they are clearly and narrowly drawn to avoid arbitrary and unnecessary curtailment of freedom of speech . . . .\u201d <em>(Kash Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d 294, 303.)  The burden of establishing whether the regulation in question is sufficiently narrowly drawn in serving a compelling state interest is placed upon the government seeking to impose the regulation. <em>(Verrilli </em>v. <em>City of Concord </em>(9th Cir. 1977) 548 F.2d 262, 265; <em>Talley </em>v. <em>California </em>(1960) 362 U.S. 60, 66-67 [4 L.Ed.2d 559, 563-564, 80 S.Ct. 536] (cone, opn.); Tribe, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>at p. 722, fn. 3.) Moreover, when First Amendment rights are at issue, a reviewing court must make an independent examination of the whole record in order to determine whether that burden has been satisfactorily met. <em>(Zeitlin </em>v. <em>Arnebergh </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 901, 909 [31 Cal.Rptr. 800, 383 P.2d 152, 10 A.L.R.3d 707].)  And, when the facts underlying a curtailment of First Amendment rights are uncontradicted, as here, the validity of the restriction presents a question of law. <em>(L. A. Teachers Union </em>v. <em>L. A. City Bd. of Ed. </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 551, 556 [78 Cal.Rptr. 723, 455 P.2d 827].)</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">As earlier stated, the resolution of this legal question requires a balancing process. In weighing the competing interests at stake, we attach special significance to the compelling interest of the public in maintaining some semblance of visual harmony in the areas where they live. Thousands of tattered derelict signs from past elections testify to the difficulty of protecting public property from unsightly signs even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>where laws forbid public posting. Without such laws one foresees an absolute end to the already eroded aesthetic integrity of public places in a tidal wave of publicly sponsored graffiti.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">We find it difficult to understand how the legitimate purpose of preventing this inundation could be more \u201cnarrowly achieved\u201d\u2014how local government can keep election placards from public poles on public property except by an ordinance prohibiting them.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">It may well be that, in circumstances not easily imagined, such an ordinance will, because of overbreadth, have the effect of contravening First Amendment rights. But that overbreadth, if it exists, has imposed no prejudice that we are able to discern upon the appellant Sussli, whose injury seems entirely hypothetical. It is a well-settled principle of constitutional law that \u201cone will not be heard to attack a statute on grounds that are not shown to be applicable to himself, and that a court will not consider every conceivable situation which might arise under the language of the statute and will not consider the question of constitutionality with reference to hypothetical situations.\u201d <em>(In re Cregler </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 308, 313 [14 Cal.Rptr. 289, 363 P.2d 305]; and cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Raines </em>(1960) 362 U.S. 17, 21-22 [4 L.Ed.2d 524, 529-530, 80 S.Ct. 519]; <em>Rubio </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 93, 103 [154 Cal.Rptr. 734, 593 P.2d 595]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Maugh </em>(1969) 1 Cal.App.3d 856, 862 [82 Cal.Rptr. 147].)</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">A <em>sometimes </em>exception to this rule will obtain \u201cwhere a provision restricting free speech and the free dissemination of ideas is involved,\u201d in which case a court, in considering overbreadth or vagueness, \u201cmay take into account the operation of the provision as to factual situations other than the one at bar.\u201d <em>(Fort </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commission </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 331, 339 [38 Cal.Rptr. 625, 392 P.2d 385].) No constitutional <em>duty, </em>however, mandates invoking this exception where it is contrary to the express desire of the people of the cities of California to control the proliferation of urban clutter.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>In arriving at this conclusion, we would stress that those who follow in Sussli\u2019s footsteps will, like him, have available to them innumerable modes of political expression in both private and public forums, including the unchallengable right to use public places for traditional speech. To say that this is insufficient merely because it is incomplete, and that every man has at all times an unabridgible right to use every possible means of expression irrespective of any legitimate counteravailing public interest, seems to us erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">For these reasons we conclude that the trial court correctly concluded that the ordinance at issue is constitutionally permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">Elkington, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b23-9\">Section 25.04.090 reads as follows: \u201cPOSTING ON PUBLIC PROPERTY PROHIBITED.

In a closely analogous factual setting, one California court has suggested by way of dictum that total prohibition may be justified upon proof of legitimate governmental interests. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Katz </em>(1977) 70 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1, 8 [138 Cal.Rptr. 868]; cf. <em>Brayton </em>v. <em>City of Anchorage </em>(Alaska 1963) 386 P.2d 832.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b27-7\">Where, as here, the regulatory provision is content-neutral requiring a case by case balancing approach, the use of the term \u201cincidental\u201d is to be considered as describing a resulting purpose and effect. That is to say, the causal effect\u2014of whatever magnitude \u2014on the protected activity must be merely incidental to the legislative purpose as distinguished from \u201cinsubstantial.\u201d (Cf., e.g., <em>Fair Political Practices Com. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 33, 47-48 [157 Cal.Rptr. 855, 599 P.2d 46]; see also Tribe, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>at pp. 602-603.) While we recognize that the scope of restrictions on free speech is an important factor to be considered in the weighing process (cf. <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Redwood City, supra, </em>540 F.2d at pp. 1372-1373), a pivotal inquiry remains as to whether the governmental interests advanced are substantial in relation to the restrictions imposed since, as previously noted, every regulation in a sense amounts to a prohibition. Consequently, Sussli\u2019s insistent claim of total prohibition rather than incidental restriction is wide of the mark, especially when the ordinance does not purport to apply to temporary election signs posted on private property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b27-8\">Amici suggest other compelling interests involving potential liability exposure for negligently posted signs (see generally Gov.

If the subject ordinance falls, it is difficult to rationalize a valid basis for prohibiting the public posting of signs ranging from \u201cQuestion Authority\u201d to \u201cSave the Red Brigade\u201d or \u201cDown with the Shah.\u201d It is, indeed, probable that the county could then be required to provide public space for any noncommercial message, such as \u201cRoommate Desired\u201d or \u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b31-7\">RACANELLI, P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Au\">I respectfully dissent:</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">Under the broad prohibition imposed by the ordinance, sign posting of any nature on public property \u201cexcept as may be required or permitted by ordinance or law\u201d (\u00a7 25.04.090)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is wholly forbidden. The sweeping provisions would extend to posters and signs of <em>any </em>nature, whether temporary or otherwise, placed upon <em>any </em>public property including streets, sidewalks and parks. Such overinclusive language would condemn even the use of privately mounted temporary political placards or notices inoffensively placed upon a public sidewalk either with the consent of or by the occupier of abutting business premises. Certainly such time-honored means of political expression should be afforded the same level of reasonable access as extended to the dissemination of other protected materials. (Cf., e.g., <em>Remer </em>v. <em>City of El Cajon </em>(1975) 52 Cal.App.3d 441 [125 Cal.Rptr. 116]; <em>California Newspaper Publishers Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Burbank </em>(1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 50 [123 Cal.Rptr. 880] [newsracks].) The city\u2019s attempt to rely on other decisions concerning billboard restrictions (see e.g., <em>John Donnelly &amp; Sons </em>v. Mallar, (D.Me. 1978) 453 F.Supp. 1272; <em>Suffolk Outdoor Advertising Co. </em>v. <em>Hulse </em>(1977) 43 N.Y. 2d 483 [402 N.Y.S.2d 368, 373 N.E.2d 263]) manifestly is unjustified since the protection of commercial speech involved in such cases has always occupied a lesser position in the hierarchy of protected First Amendment activities. (Cf. <em>Bates </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number><em>State Bar of Arizona </em>(1976) 433 U.S. 350 [53 L.Ed.2d 510, 97 S.Ct. 2691]; <em>Va. Pharmacy Bd. </em>v. <em>Va. Consumer Council </em>(1976) 425 U.S. 748 [48 L.Ed.2d 346, 96 S.Ct. 1817]; <em>Metromedia, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of San Diego </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 848 [164 Cal.Rptr. 510, 610 P.2d 407].)</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">While considerations of public safety undoubtedly warrant the imposition of reasonable restrictions, the city could easily achieve such an objective by a more narrowly drawn ordinance relating to public placement of temporary political signs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nor will aesthetic considerations alone justify unrestricted intrusion into constitutionally protected areas. (See <em>Van Nuys Pub. Co. </em>v. <em>City of Thousand Oaks </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 817, 822 [97 Cal.Rptr. <em>777, </em>489 P.2d 809].) Any offensive blare and bombardment of political propaganda may be readily muted simply by looking away. (See <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>California </em>(1971) 403 U.S. 15, 21 [29 L.Ed.2d 284, 291-292, 91 S.Ct. 1780].) Further, the administrative burdens associated with the supervision of public sign posting and removal of offending signs may be accomplished by alternate and substantially less restrictive means which\u2014even if not entirely successful \u2014would impose a minimal burden at best <em>(Baldwin </em>v. <em>Redwood City </em>(9th Cir. 1976) 540 F.2d 1360, 1370) and but \u201ca small price to pay for preservation of .. . [a] ... most cherished right.\u201d <em>(Wirta </em>v. <em>Alameda-Contra Costa Transit Dist. </em>(1967) 68 Cal.2d 51, 62 [64 Cal.Rptr. 430, 434 P.2d 982].) Thus, although the nature of the interests advanced may justify suitable restrictions on the time, place and manner of political expression, nonetheless such objectives must be achieved in a less broadly restrictive fashion. The challenged provisions fail to comply with that basic limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">In a democratic society the right of free expression occupies a most preferred position (see <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 684, 690-691 [68 Cal.Rptr. 721, 441 P.2d 281]), secure from overreaching governmental regulations. Free expression of political thought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>and political choice should always be worth more to a free society than its costs. Contrary to the dismal scenario set in the majority opinion, it is much more rational to believe that carefully crafted regulations accomodating basic constitutional rights can be implemented to ward off the specter of environmental blight and the sea of scribblings graphically predicted in that gloomy forecast.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">In its effort to balance the competing interests involved, the majority strikes a devastating blow to a long established method of political expression utilizing a medium which often\u2014as Marshall McLuhan admonishes\u2014is the message itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Since the critical language of the ordinance herein purports to totally circumscribe the exercise of a fundamental individual liberty within traditional public forums whose use for purposes of free expression has been entrusted from time immemorial <em>(Hague </em>v. <em>C. I. O. </em>(1939) 307 U.S. 496, 515 [83 L.Ed. 1423, 1436-1437, 59 S.Ct. 954]), it is facially overbroad and constitutionally defective. <em>(Renter </em>v. <em>City of El Cajon, supra, 52 </em>Cal.App.3d 441, 444.) Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied June 12, 1981. Racanelli, P. J., was of the opinion that the petition should be granted. Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied July 8, 1981.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b31-9\">During oral argument the city conceded that no exceptions had thus far been ordained.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b32-6\">For example, section 25.12.130, subdivision (4), provides in pertinent part that election signs may not be placed \u201cin such manner as to pose a visibility hazard to pedestrian and motor vehicle traffic along the public highway, sidewalks or at street corners.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A2C\">It must be emphasized that no claim is or could be made that local government may not enact regulations designed to prevent damage or defacement of publicly owned structures as provided in the last full sentence of section 25.04.090. (See <em>National Delivery Systems, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Inglewood </em>(1974) 43 Cal.App.3d 573, 579 [117 Cal.Rptr. 791].) If the ordinance were redrafted, that provision could be included intact as a valid exercise of the city\u2019s inherent police powers.
