The record belies the claim. While <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>a trial court is not required to indicate its reasons for rejecting a mitigating factor <em>(People </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1980) 103 Cal.App.3d 270, 281 [163 Cal.Rptr. 22]), the sentencing court here indicated that though some mitigating circumstances may have been demonstrated, they were clearly outweighed by the fact that defendant was on parole when he committed the present offense. .</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Moreover, in stating its reasons for denying probation (factors which may also be properly considered as circumstances in aggravation) (see <em>People </em>v. <em>West </em>(1980) 107 Cal.App.3d 987, 995 [165 Cal.Rptr. 24]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Butler </em>(1980) 107 Cal.App.3d 251, 254-255 [165 Cal.Rptr. 709]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ramos </em>(1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 591, 600 [165 Cal.Rptr. 179]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Eades </em>(1979) 95 Cal.App.3d 688, 691 [157 Cal.Rptr. 223]; and see Cal. Rules of Court, rule 441(a)), the sentencing court noted (a) that defendant constitutes a danger to the community, (b) the degree of planning and sophistication regarding the present offense, (c) that defendant\u2019s criminal record includes 4 prison commitments within the last 23 years, and (d) that defendant\u2019s prior performances on probation and parole were unsatisfactory. Neither in the trial court nor on appeal has defendant disputed the validity of these factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">Counsel for defendant cited two factors in mitigation, defendant\u2019s early admission of guilt and his relative lack of involvement in the crime vis-\u00e1-vis his codefendant Elliot Coulston. Closely analyzed, neither factor is inspiring. In support of the assertion that defendant was not as \u201cinvolved\u201d as his codefendant, counsel argued: \u201cThe house was Mr. Coulston\u2019s house, the various items referred to by the Probation Department, such as scales and packaging material, were in that house six months previously when the police were called to the house on a burglary charge. At that time, Mr. Burg was not even a resident of that house.\u201d Whether defendant was a resident of the house at the time the narcotics paraphernalia was first brought into it is irrelevant. The fact remains that there was apparently a sufficient nexus between defendant and the house at the time of arrest to warrant a plea of guilty. Nothing more is required. Moreover, this defendant\u2019s early admission of guilt may not be considered a mitigating circumstance. Defendant admitted guilt for one reason only\u2014the dismissal of two other felony charges and five alleged prior felony convictions. The Judicial Council did not have a plea bargain in mind when it proposed as a circumstance in mitigation a defendant\u2019s early admission of guilt. By way of the very plea bargain, defendant received the full benefit of the admission. To there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>after consider said fact a circumstance in mitigation is analogous to the prohibited \u201cdual use\u201d of circumstances to both aggravate and enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 441(c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The record fully supports imposition of the upper term. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">Puglia, P. J., and Blease, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b271-12\">Defendant was originally charged with possession for sale of cocaine (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11351), possession of cocaine (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11350), and being an ex-felon in possession of a firearm. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12021.) The latter two charges were dismissed, as were allegations that defendant had suffered five previous felony convictions, in return for the plea to possession for sale of cocaine.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
