J.</author>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Appellants Cameron Shuts and Gary Sterling represent a putative class of former and current residents of 16 separately licensed skilled nursing facilities that are in the business of providing long-term, 24-hour care for the elderly and disabled (hereafter plaintiffs).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Respondents are interrelated business entities that own and operate the skilled nursing facilities (hereafter collectively referred to as Covenant).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiffs sued Covenant alleging, among other things, that it consistently and intentionally failed to provide adequate nursing staff for its elderly and disabled residents, and that Covenant misrepresented its staffing levels to residents and to the consuming public. Plaintiffs alleged three causes of action in their first amended complaint (FAC): (1) violation of a skilled nursing resident\u2019s right to reside in an adequately staffed facility (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 1430, subd. (b));<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (2) violation of California\u2019s unfair competition law (UCL) (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.); and (3) violation of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1750 et seq.).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">Plaintiffs alleged that the inadequacy of the staffing levels at Covenant\u2019s facilities was demonstrated by its noncompliance with the statutory mandate that a skilled nursing facility maintain a minimum numeric ratio of 3.2 nursing hours per patient per day (NHPPD). (See \u00a7 1276.5, subd. (a).) Covenant filed a demurrer, urging the court to dismiss this dispute because a skilled nursing facility\u2019s obligation to provide its residents care at a level of 3.2 NHPPD is not enforceable by a private right of action. It argued that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>because section 1276.5 is a regulatory statute, it can only be enforced by the State Department of Public Health (CDPH). In addition, Covenant warned that litigating the case would necessarily involve the court in a \u201cregulatory \u2018thicket\u2019 of nursing home staffing regulation^]\u201d that is best left to administrative expertise. Covenant urged the court to dismiss based on the abstention doctrine. The trial court agreed with both arguments, and dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">In the published portion of this opinion we first conclude that while section 1276.5, subdivision (a), may not create a private right of action, section 1430, subdivision (b) does, thereby allowing plaintiffs to sue under this latter statute for a violation of section 1276.5, subdivision (a). As to the court\u2019s invocation of the abstention doctrine, at this stage of the proceedings, it is not clear that adjudicating plaintiffs\u2019 claims \u201cwould require a trial court to assume the functions of an administrative agency, or to interfere with the functions of an administrative agency. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Alvarado v. Selma Convalescent Hospital </em>(2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1292, 1298 [64 Cal.Rptr.3d 250] <em>(Alvarado).) </em>Even if otherwise appropriate, the FAC contained nonequitable claims for relief, including damages, that are not subject to dismissal under the doctrine of equitable abstention. Therefore, we reverse the demurrer as to plaintiffs\u2019 first cause of action seeking relief under section 1430, subdivision (b). In the nonpublished portion of this opinion we likewise reverse the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the UCL and CLRA causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">The crux of plaintiffs\u2019 FAC was their allegation that Covenant had a \u201cduty under California law to provide sufficient nursing staff and related services.\u201d Notwithstanding this duty, plaintiffs claimed that Covenant \u201cpersisted in [its] practice of understaffing their skilled nursing facilities throughout the Class Period,\u201d which plaintiffs defined as December 15, 2006, through December 16, 2010. Plaintiffs alleged that Covenant\u2019s \u201cpattern and practice of systematically understaffing their facilities violates California law . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">As noted, plaintiffs asserted three causes of action. The first cause of action was based on section 1430, subdivision (b), which authorizes a \u201ccurrent or former resident or patient of a skilled nursing facility\u201d to \u201cbring a civil action against the licensee of a facility who violates any rights of the resident or patient as set forth in the Patients Bill of Rights ... or any other right provided for by federal or state law or regulation.\u201d Section 1430, subdivision (b) authorizes statutory damages, attorney fees, and injunctive relief. It provides that \u201c[t]he licensee shall be liable for up to five hundred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>dollars ($500), and for costs and attorney fees, and may be enjoined from permitting the violation to continue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 section 1430, subdivision (b) claim is based on Covenant\u2019s alleged violation of several provisions of state law, including the violation of plaintiffs\u2019 right to reside in a facility that employs an \u201cadequate number of qualified personnel,\u201d as provided in the \u201cSkilled Nursing and Immediate Care Facility Patient\u2019s Bill of Rights\u201d (\u00a7 1599.1, subd. (a); see Cal. Code Regs., tit. 22, \u00a7 72527, subd. (a)(25)) (Patient\u2019s Bill of Rights). Plaintiffs assert that in order to satisfy this obligation, Covenant must provide at least 3.2 NHPPD, the <em>minimum </em>number of actual nursing hours per patient required in a skilled nursing facility.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (\u00a7 1276.5, subd. (a).) Implementing regulations go on to explain that \u201c[s]killed nursing facilities shall employ and schedule additional staff as needed to ensure quality resident care based on the needs of individual residents to ensure compliance with all relevant state and federal staffing requirements.\u201d (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 22, \u00a7 72329.1, subd. (a).) The FAC alleged that Covenant failed to \u201cmeet the minimum staffing requirements\u201d of 3.2 NHPPD on 35 percent or more days of the purported class period.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The allegations of the first cause of action also supported plaintiffs\u2019 second and third causes of action based on violations of the UCL (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.) and the CLRA (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1750 et seq.). As part of these two additional causes of action, plaintiffs claimed that the understaffing was systematically concealed and misrepresented to members of the general public, including plaintiffs and their families.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Plaintiffs purported to bring these claims on behalf of themselves and a putative class comprised of all persons who resided in one of Covenant\u2019s facilities for \u201cat least one day during which the respective facility did not provide at least 3.2 hours of direct nursing care per patient day.\u201d Plaintiffs sought injunctive relief as well as statutory damages, restitution, and attorney fees. The FAC expressly disclaimed any intention to \u201cseek damages for personal injuries, wrongful death or other resident-specific harm that may have been caused by inadequate staff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Covenant filed a demurrer. Covenant argued that each cause of action alleged in plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit was premised on a theory of noncompliance with the 3.2 NHPPD standard set out in section 1276.5, subdivision (a)\u2014a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>\u201cregulatory statute,\u201d which is interpreted, implemented, and enforced solely by the CDPH, and which does not provide a cause of action for aggrieved residents of skilled nursing facilities. (See <em>Lu v. Hawaiian Gardens Casino, Inc. </em>(2010) 50 Cal.4th 592, 601 [113 Cal.Rptr.3d 498, 236 P.3d 346] <em>(Lu).) </em>Alternatively, Covenant urged the court to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit in its entirety based on the doctrine of equitable abstention. This doctrine allows a court to abstain from adjudicating a suit that seeks equitable remedies if \u201cgranting the requested relief would require a trial court to assume the functions of an administrative agency, or to interfere with the functions of an administrative agency. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Alvarado, supra, </em>153 Cal.App.4th at p. 1298.) Abstention may be appropriate if \u201cthe lawsuit involves determining complex economic policy, which is best handled by the Legislature or an administrative agency,\u201d or if \u201cgranting injunctive relief would be unnecessarily burdensome for the trial court to monitor and enforce given the availability of more effective means 'of redress. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Covenant contended that plaintiffs were \u201casking the Court to step into the shoes of a regulatory agency that already is doing its job conducting surveys, issuing deficiencies and remedying them when appropriate . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">The trial court agreed with Covenant\u2019s arguments and dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 entire case without leave to amend on both grounds. The court\u2019s judgment of dismissal was filed on June 13, 2011. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">As this division held in <em>Paragon Real Estate Group of San Francisco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hansen </em>(2009) 178 Cal.App.4th <em>177 </em>[100 Cal.Rptr.3d 234]: \u201c \u2018On appeal from a judgment dismissing an action after sustaining a demurrer without leave to amend, the standard of review is well settled. The reviewing court gives the complaint a reasonable interpretation, and treats the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded. [Citations.] The court does not, however, assume the truth of contentions, deductions or conclusions of law. [Citation.] The judgment must be affirmed \u201cif any one of the several grounds of demurrer is well taken. [Citations.]\u201d [Citation.] However, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>error for a trial court to sustain a demurrer when the plaintiff has stated a cause of action under any possible legal theory. [Citation.] And it is an abuse of discretion to sustain a demurrer without leave to amend if the plaintiff shows there is a reasonable possibility any defect identified by the defendant can be cured by amendment. [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 181-182.)</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Plaintiffs suggest that this court should apply a de novo standard of review to the superior court\u2019s discretionary dismissal under the equitable abstention doctrine. Normally, this court reviews a trial court\u2019s exercise of its discretion to abstain from deciding a plaintiffs\u2019 claims only for abuse of that discretion. <em>(Klein </em>v. <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. </em>(2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 1342, 1361 [137 Cal.Rptr.3d 293] <em>(Klein); Alvarado, supra, </em>153 Cal.App.4th at p. 1297; <em>Arce v. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. </em>(2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 471, 482 [104 Cal.Rptr.3d 545] <em>(Arce).) </em>But, a trial court\u2019s decision that rests on an error of law is itself an abuse of discretion. (See <em>Knapp </em>v. <em>AT&amp;T Wireless Services, Inc. </em>(2011) 195 Cal.App.4th 932, 939 [124 Cal.Rptr.3d 565]; <em>Klein, supra, </em>202 Cal.App.4th at p. 1361.) In determining whether the court made an error of law, we apply the de novo standard of review. <em>(Blickman Turkus, LP v. MF Downtown Sunnyvale, LLC (2008) 162 </em>Cal.App.4th 858, 894 [76 Cal.Rptr.3d 325]; <em>Gai v. City of Selma </em>(1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 213, 219 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 910].)</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">We emphasize the limited scope of the issues before us on appeal. Based on arguments made by Covenant in its demurrer, the trial court dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit without leave to amend based on two independent grounds: (1) no private right of action was created by section 1276.5, subdivision (a), to enforce the statute\u2019s 3.2 NHPPD minimum staffing requirements and (2) the court found it \u201cproper to exercise its discretion and abstain from adjudicating this alleged controversy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Given the bases for the court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 FAC, we emphasize at the outset that we do not intend to decide whether the complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action for reasons that were not raised in Covenant\u2019s demurrer or decided by the trial court. (See <em>City of Industry v. City of Fillmore </em>(2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 191, 205 [129 Cal.Rptr.3d 433] <em>(City of Industry) </em>[\u201cwe need not decide whether the complaint fails to allege facts sufficient to state a cause of action for reasons that were not raised in the demurrer\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">B. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 First Cause of Action Under Section 1430, Subdivision (b)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">In support of its demurrer to plaintiffs\u2019 first cause of action, Covenant relied heavily on <em>Alvarado, supra, </em>153 Cal.App.4th 1292. The plaintiff in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number><em>Alvarado </em>brought a class action against a skilled nursing facility and 23 of its affiliates under California\u2019s UCL (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.). (153 Cal.App.4th at p. 1297.) As in this case, the plaintiff in <em>Alvarado </em>claimed that \u201cdefendants engaged in a pervasive and intentional failure to provide sufficient direct nursing care for the residents of the skilled nursing facilities.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1296.) The lawsuit sought restitution and injunctive relief to require the skilled nursing facilities to comply with the 3.2 NHPPD minimum staffing levels set out in section 1276.5, subdivision (a). (153 Cal.App.4th at p. 1297.) The trial court abstained from adjudicating the case and dismissed the action without leave to amend. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1296.) The appellate court affirmed. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1295.)</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">On appeal, the <em>Alvarado </em>court generally held that courts have the discretion to abstain from providing equitable relief, such as restitution and injunctions, in cases requiring them to assume or interfere with an administrative agency\u2019s function or to take on an unnecessary burden in monitoring or enforcing injunctive relief, where other, more effective remedies exist. <em>(Alvarado, supra, </em>153 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1297-1298.) Thus, in <em>Alvarado, </em>the trial court acted within its discretion in abstaining from adjudicating the case because CDPH\u2019s predecessor agency \u201chas the power, expertise and statutory mandate to regulate and enforce\u201d the 3.2 NHPPD staffing requirement set out in section 1276.5, subdivision (a). (153 Cal.App.4th at p. 1306.) The court reasoned that granting the requested relief would require the court to \u201cassume general regulatory powers over the health care industry through the guise of enforcing the UCL, a task for which the courts are not well equipped. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Alvarado, </em>at pp. 1303-1304.) Because regulatory enforcement of the 3.2 NHPPD mandate provided an \u201calternative and more effective means of ensuring compliance,\u201d the trial court was within its discretion in invoking the abstention doctrine. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1306.)</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The trial court in this case acknowledged \u201cthat section 1430(b) creates a private right of action and that Plaintiffs have alleged statutory damages in connection with this claim.\u201d However, the court indicated it was \u201cnot persuaded that Plaintiffs state[d] such a claim because the claim is still, as acknowledged by Plaintiffs, based in part on [the 3.2 NHPPD requirement imposed by] Health and Safety Code section 1276.5. In looking at the statute, it seems clear that the Legislature did not intend to create a private cause of action under section 1276.5. . . .\u201d The court concluded that \u201cdespite Plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to frame their claim under section 1430(b), the Court finds this claim fails because Plaintiffs cannot allege a private right of action based on a statute for which the Legislature did not intend to create one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>Also, relying on <em>Alvarado, supra, </em>153 Cal.App.4th 1292, the trial court alternatively sustained Covenant\u2019s demurrer without leave to amend on the basis of the equitable abstention doctrine, finding that \u201cadjudicating this controversy would require the court to assume general regulatory powers over the health care industry, a task for which the courts are not well-equipped.\u201d The trial court found that plaintiffs\u2019 remedy in the courts should be limited to a writ of mandate compelling CDPH to enforce section 1276.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">In arguing that the court erred in sustaining Covenant\u2019s demurrer, plaintiffs emphasize that their first cause of action was based on the private right of action created by section 1430, subdivision (b), a statute which was never invoked by the plaintiffs in <em>Alvarado </em>nor discussed in that opinion. Plaintiffs point out that by enacting section 1430, subdivision (b), the Legislature has specifically armed residents of skilled nursing facilities with a private right of action for violations of the Patient\u2019s Bill of Rights, including the right to reside in a facility that \u201cemploy[s] an adequate number of qualified personnel to carry out all of the functions of the facility.\u201d (\u00a7 1599.1, subd. (a); see Cal. Code Regs., tit. 22, \u00a7 72527, subd. (a)(25).) Consequently, plaintiffs argue <em>Alvarado </em>is not dispositive of the issues on appeal, and does not deserve the great weight that the trial court placed upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">On this point we find <em>Wehlage v. EmpRes Healthcare, Inc. </em>(N.D.Cal. 2011) 791 F.Supp.2d 774 <em>(Wehlage), </em>to be persuasive authority.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Wehlage </em>also involved a plaintiff suing various healthcare corporations for the alleged failure to provide sufficient staffing at affiliated skilled nursing facilities. Like the instant case, and unlike <em>Alvarado, </em>the lawsuit in <em>Wehlage </em>alleged a cause of action under section 1430, subdivision (b) on behalf of all similarly situated residents.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">The <em>Wehlage </em>court rejected the argument (made by Covenant in this case and found persuasive by the trial court) \u201cthat Plaintiff\u2019s section 1430(b) claim ... to the extent it is based on allegations that [the skilled nursing facilities] violated section 1276.5(a)\u2019s minimum staffing requirement, should be dismissed\u201d because section 1276.5, subdivision (a) \u201cdoes not provide a right of action under state law . . . .\u201d <em>(Wehlage, supra, </em>791 F.Supp.2d at p. 787.) The <em>Wehlage </em>court explained, \u201cPlaintiff asserts a cause of action under section 1430(b) to enforce a right she claims to exist under section 1276.5[, subdivision ](a); she does not bring a cause of action under section 1276.5[, subdivision ](a).\u201d <em>(Wehlage, </em>at p. 787.) The <em>Wehlage </em>court emphasized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>that section 1430, subdivision (b) is not a regulatory statute like section 1276.5, but rather confers a private right of action with a specific monetary entitlement for the violation of the rights of a resident of a skilled nursing facility as set forth in the Patient\u2019s Bill of Rights. One of the rights conferred on residents of a skilled nursing facility is the right to reside in a facility with an adequate number of qualified personnel to carry out all of the functions of the facility. (\u00a7 1599.1, subd. (a); <em>Wehlage, </em>at p. 788.) Section 1276.5, subdivision (a) requires a minimum staffing level of at least 3.2 NHPPD, \u201cproviding] an objective measure of what constitutes \u2018adequate.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Wehlage, </em>at p. 788; accord, <em>Walsh v. Kindred Healthcare </em>(2011) 798 F.Supp.2d 1073, 1088, fn. 8 [\u201cSection 1276.5[, subdivision ](a) may inform what the definition is of \u2018adequate\u2019 qualified personnel under Section 1599.1 with respect to nurses\u201d].) Consequently, the <em>Wehlage </em>court concluded, \u201csection 1276.5[, subdivision ](a) may be enforced through a civil action under section 1430[, subdivision ](b).\u201d <em>(Wehlage, </em>at p. 788.)</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">We agree with this analytical framework. As <em>Wehlage </em>makes clear, in order to bring a cause of action as provided by section 1430, subdivision (b), it is not necessary to demonstrate that the substantive statute or regulation being enforced\u2014in this case section 1276.5, subdivision (a)\u2014was <em>itself </em>intended to confer a private right of action; and the trial court erred in concluding otherwise. <em>(Klein, supra, </em>202 Cal.App.4th at p. 1361 [trial court\u2019s decision resting on an error of law is an abuse of discretion].) The Legislature has already determined that a private right of action exists for violations of the Patient\u2019s Bill of Rights, including the right to reside in an adequately staffed facility. (\u00a7 1599.1, subd. (a); Cal. Code Regs., tit. 22, \u00a7 72527, subd. (a)(25).) The 3.2 NHPPD standard set out in section 1276.5, subdivision (a) helps define this enforceable right.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Covenant argues that \u201cthe Legislature did not intend the nurse staffing m\u00ednimums set forth in [s]ection 1276.5[, subdivision ](a) to be among the rights enforceable under [s]ection 1430[, subdivision ](b)\u201d because section 1276.5, subdivision (a) has \u201can aggregate, facility-wide focus\u201d as opposed to an individual focus. This argument ignores the fact that section 1430, subdivision (b) authorizes plaintiffs to assert violations of rights conferred upon them by the Patient\u2019s Bill of Rights in a civil action, many of which are expressed as aggregate, facility-wide obligations. (See, e.g., \u00a7 1599.1, subds. (a) [facility shall employ adequate staff], (c) [facility shall provide appropriate food], (d) [facility shall provide activity program], (e) [facility shall be clean], (f) [facility shall provide operating nurses\u2019 call system].) Consequently, we are not concerned that the 3.2 NHPPD minimum staffing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>requirement in section 1276.5, subdivision (a) is phrased in terms of responsibilities imposed on a skilled nursing facility. The plain purpose of this provision is to help determine the minimum level of care that a person residing in a skilled nursing facility is entitled to receive. The 3.2 NHPPD standard is therefore germane to defining a resident\u2019s right to reside in an adequately staffed facility, which is clearly made privately enforceable by section 1430, subdivision (b). (See <em>Wehlage, supra, </em>791 F.Supp.2d at p. 789 [rejecting identical argument].)</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The <em>Wehlage </em>court also considered and rejected Covenant\u2019s alternate argument that abstention was appropriate because plaintiffs have asserted claims involving complex issues that only CDPH has the expertise to address. We agree with the assessment in <em>Wehlage, supra, </em>791 F.Supp.2d 774, that, at least at this very early stage of the proceedings where the critical issues are largely undefined, \u201c[a] judicial determination as to whether [a skilled nursing facility] satisfies its obligation under section 1276.5[, subdivision ](a)\u2019s staffing requirement does not appear to implicate technical or policy determinations usually reserved to an administrative agency.\u201d <em>(Wehlage, </em>at p. 787.) Nor do plaintiffs\u2019 claims \u201cpose any novel issues or suggest a need for the CDPH\u2019s expertise.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">To be sure, courts are hesitant to intervene in the absence of any legislative or regulatory guidance when a plaintiff essentially is asking the court to make an economic or policy judgment. (See, e.g., <em>California Grocers Assn. v. Bank of America </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 205, 218-219 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 396] [holding that, absent a legislative determination, a court could not declare that bank\u2019s service fee was too high without rendering an economic policy judgment].) However, a court should not abstain from deciding a case when the Legislature \u201calready has made the relevant policy determinations . . . .\u201d <em>(Arce, supra, </em>181 Cal.App.4th at p. 501.)</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Section 1276.5, subdivision (a) speaks in terms that are clearly mandatory, and states that notwithstanding \u201cany other provision of law, commencing January 1, 2000, the minimum number of actual nursing hours per patient required in a skilled nursing facility shall be 3.2 hours . . . .\u201d Consequently, the Legislature already has made the necessary policy judgment that is relevant to plaintiffs\u2019 claims; and a skilled nursing facility\u2019s obligation under section 1276.5, subdivision (a) is sufficiently specific for a court to competently determine whether such statutory guidance is being followed. <em>(McKell v. Washington Mutual, Inc. </em>(2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1457, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>1474 [49 Cal.Rptr.3d 227] [abstention inappropriate where legislative determination as to the propriety of defendant\u2019s actions already has been made through the enactment of the applicable laws]); accord, <em>Arce, supra, </em>181 Cal.App.4th at pp. 501-502; <em>Blue Cross of California, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(2009) 180 Cal.App.4th 1237, 1259 [102 Cal.Rptr.3d 615] <em>(Blue Cross).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">In upholding the use of the abstention doctrine, the <em>Alvarado </em>court concluded that compliance with the 3.2 NHPPD minimum staffing standard would require the court to make a series of factual findings that would be a \u201ctask better accomplished by an administrative agency than by trial courts.\u201d <em>(Alvarado, supra, </em>153 Cal.App.4th at p. 1306.) For example, the <em>Alvarado </em>court was concerned that calculating the NHPPD would be extremely burdensome and difficult because \u201csection 1276.5, subdivision (b) provides different formulas for calculating nursing hours in different skilled nursing facilities\" and \u201cthe court would have to determine on a classwide basis the size, configuration and licensing status of skilled nursing and intermediate care facilities.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Importantly, since <em>Alvarado </em>was decided in 2007, the CDPH has made significant progress in providing administrative guidance on the 3.2 NHPPD standard, and how it should be calculated.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The CDPH has recently published a series of detailed \u201cAll Facilities Letters,\u201d setting forth an elaborate state audit and penalty scheme for determining and enforcing compliance with the 3.2 NHPPD mandate proscribed by section 1276.5, subdivision (a). For example, in new guidelines provided to skilled nursing facilities on January 31, 2011, the CDPH noted that the 3.2 NHPPD staffing requirement \u201cdoes not assure that any given patient receives 3.2 hours of nursing care; it is the total number of nursing hours performed by direct caregivers per patient day divided by the average patient census.\u201d Furthermore, the mere fact that the CDPH <em>might </em>in the future adopt regulations that would shed additional light on the NHPPD standard does not mean that a court should abstain from adjudicating a presently justiciable controversy. (See <em>Arce, supra, </em>181 Cal.App.4th at p. 502.) In fact, appellate courts have found an abuse of discretion where the trial court abstained from hearing an action on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>ground that an administrative agency might regulate the subject matter in question at some future time. <em>(Ibid.; Klein, supra, </em>202 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1370-1371.)</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">We note this will not be the first time courts have been called upon to adjudicate whether skilled nursing facilities have violated applicable staffing standards. In <em>Conservatorship of Gregory </em>(2000) 80 Cal.App.4th 514 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 336], the court concluded that the regulation requiring a skilled nursing facility to \u201c \u2018employ an adequate number of qualified personnel to carry out all of the functions of the facility\u2019 \u201d was relevant to key issues in that case involving elder abuse. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 524.) The court stated; \u201cLike statutes, applicable regulations are a \u2018factor to be considered by the jury in determining the reasonableness of the conduct in question.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 523.) The court rejected the argument that the jury instructions given in that case, which were based on state and federal regulations \u201crelevant to government enforcement actions\u201d to protect the elderly and disabled, were \u201ctoo vague to provide meaningful guidance to the jury.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>In so holding, the court noted that common knowledge of members of a particular vocation may make a regulation specific, and that \u201cthe jury heard testimony describing how nursing home professionals construed and applied the federal and state regulatory standards regarding sufficient staff.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 524.) As <em>Conservatorship of Gregory </em>illustrates, litigation of plaintiffs\u2019 claims is not beyond the capacity of a court to understand or evaluate.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Here, the trial court clearly believed the proper recourse for residents of an understaffed skilled nursing facility was to seek \u201cappropriate writ relief ... to compel the Department of Health Services to enforce section 1276.5.\u201d Along these same lines, Covenant proposes that we stay plaintiffs\u2019 action under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction for the purpose of allowing CDPH to decide whether Covenant is meeting the 3.2 NHPPD standard; and if a violation is found, CDPH can impose administrative penalties. (See <em>Wolfe v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Ins. Co. </em>(1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 554, 558-559, fn. 5 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 878] [where a claim requires \u201cresolution of issues which . . . have been placed within the special competence of an administrative body,\u201d the primary jurisdiction doctrine permits courts to suspend \u201cjudicial process . . . pending referral of those issues to the administrative body for its view\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">However, by enacting section 1430, subdivision (b), the Legislature specifically authorized skilled nursing facility residents <em>themselves </em>to bring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>actions to remedy violations of their rights rather than forcing them to depend upon the CDPH to take action. (See <em>Wehlage, supra, 791 </em>F.Supp.2d at p. 789 [\u201cthat the CDPH may enforce section 1276.5(a) does not preclude residents from doing so\u201d].) The importance of this private right of action is demonstrated by the Legislature\u2019s expression that \u201cunder no circumstances may a patient or resident waive his or her right to sue . . .\u201d under section 1430, subdivision (b), \u201cfor violations of rights under the Patients Bill of Rights, or other federal and state laws and regulations . . . .\u201d <em>(Fitzhugh v. Granada Healthcare &amp; Rehabilitation Center, LLC </em>(2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 469, 476 [58 Cal.Rptr.3d 585] <em>(Fitzhugh).) </em>Therefore, it would frustrate the main purpose of section 1430, subdivision (b) to conclude that courts should abstain from adjudicating claims under this statute because CDPH may be more capable of enforcing the adequate staffing requirements imposed by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">We also find it significant that when the Legislature amended section 1430, subdivision (b) in 2004, it expanded rather than narrowed the scope of the legislation to allow a private right to sue for damages, not just for a violation of the Patient\u2019s Bill of Rights, but for a violation of \u201cany other right provided for by federal or state law or regulation.\u201d (Stats. 2004, ch. 270, \u00a7 2, pp. 3138-3139; see <em>Fitzhugh, supra, </em>150 Cal.App.4th at p. 473, fn. 2.) This amendment was due to the \u201cconcern that enforcement by CDPH would be constrained by financial and demographic pressures in the coming years.\u201d <em>(Wehlage, supra, 191 </em>F.Supp.2d at pp. 788-789.) Therefore, denying a private right of action on the grounds that statutory compliance is better achieved by turning the matter over to CDPH represents an unwarranted frustration of the Legislature\u2019s desire to supplement administrative action with private enforcement. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">Furthermore, because the Legislature has made the remedies prescribed by section 1430, subdivision (b) cumulative to \u201cany other remedy provided by law,\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd. (c)) the arguments made by Covenant forewarning of the problems created by parallel private and administrative enforcement of the law\u2014i.e., inconsistent rulings on calculating the 3.2 NHPPD standard and duplicative enforcement\u2014have obviously been considered and rejected by our state lawmakers.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">In any event, plaintiffs also note that unlike <em>Alvarado, </em>where the plaintiff solely sought equitable remedies under the UCL, their first cause of action seeks monetary damages and attorney fees, as well as equitable relief, as authorized by section 1430, subdivision (b).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (See <em>Alvarado, supra, </em>153 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>Cal.App.4th at p. 1297.) A court of equity\u2019s discretion to invoke the abstention doctrine has been limited to cases where the court has been asked only to award some type of equitable relief, as opposed to a damages award. (See, e.g., <em>Desert Healthcare Dist. v. PacifiCare FHP, Inc. </em>(2001) 94 Cal.App.4th 781, 795 [114 Cal.Rptr.2d 623].) Consequently, the abstention doctrine does not apply to plaintiffs\u2019 legal claims, and the court had no discretion to apply this doctrine in dismissing the first cause of action in its entirety. (See <em>Wehlage, supra, </em>791 F.Supp.2d at p. 786 [\u201cthe equitable abstention doctrine does not afford the Court discretion to abstain from hearing Plaintiff\u2019s claims for damages under section 1430[, subdivision ](b)\u201d]; <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Kindred Healthcare, supra, </em>798 F.Supp.2d at p. 1085 [courts have no discretion to abstain from adjudicating \u00a7 1430, subd. (b) claims to the extent damages are being requested].) Therefore, the trial court\u2019s reliance on the doctrine of equitable abstention to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 section 1430, subdivision (b) claim in its entirety was misplaced. (See, e.g., <em>Blue Cross, supra, </em>180 Cal.App.4th at p. 1259 [noting that trial court correctly declined to \u201cabstain[] from adjudicating the complaint in toto\u201d when \u201cseveral remedies,\u201d including civil penalties, were still available].)</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">In the end, given the \u201c \u2018 \u201cclear, understandable, unmistakable terms\u201d \u2019 \u201d of section 1430, subdivision (b) indicating an intent to create a private right of action for violation of a current or former resident\u2019s right to adequate staffing, our ultimate inquiry is simply one of reading and enforcing the statutory language. <em>(Lu, supra, </em>50 Cal.4th at p. 597.) Unless and until the Legislature itself reexamines the scope of the private right of action set out in section 1430, subdivision (b), California law clearly and unambiguously grants current and former residents of skilled nursing facilities an absolute right to have their claims for statutory damages and injunctive relief decided \u201cin a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d (\u00a7 1430, subd. (b).) Accordingly, the trial court erred in dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 first cause of action under section 1430, subdivision (b) after concluding that plaintiffs had no private right of action under <em>this </em>statute through which the minimum nursing standards of section 1276.5 can be judicially enforced, and alternatively in finding that equitable abstention was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">C. <em>Plaintiffs\u2019 Second and Third Causes of Action under the UCL and CLRA</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">The judgment dismissing this action without leave to amend is reversed.
