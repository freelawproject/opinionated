On June 12, 2018, Debtor filed his Chapter 13 plan (Doc. 9). After objections were raised by the Trustee (Docs. 19, 20), Debtor filed an Amended Plan (Doc. 23). After subsequent objections by both the Trustee (Doc. 27) and JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Creditor\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \") (Doc. 26), Debtor filed a second Amended Plan (Document No. 28). Creditor once again objected (Doc. 29) to confirmation of the Plan because it provided for an interest rate (6.75%) less than the contractual rate (9.25%) on Debtor's principal residence and the proposed interest rate is less than the presumptive rate contemplated by the Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Till v.

(Doc. No. 8). Debtor's loan is scheduled to mature on May 1, 2022, and the final payment under Debtor's sixty (60) month Plan is scheduled for May 1, 2023. (Doc. 32). As a result, it is undisputed that: (1) Creditor is the holder of over-secured claim because the value of the collateral far exceeds the amount of the debt; and (2) Debtor's last payment on the original payment schedule is due to Creditor before the due date of the last payment under the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Creditor objected to the confirmation of the Plan on two grounds. First, Creditor argued it is entitled to its contractual interest rate (9.25%) from the Petition Date through the confirmation date pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 506(b) of the Bankruptcy Code. Second, Creditor argued it is entitled to the\n   <em>\n    Till\n   </em>\n   interest rate as calculated on the confirmation date rather than the Petition Date. Importantly, Creditor did not challenge Debtor's \"prime plus\" formula used to calculate the\n   <em>\n    Till\n   </em>\n   rate (national prime rate plus 2%). Instead, with respect to the calculation of the\n   <em>\n    Till\n   </em>\n   rate, Creditor's sole objection was that Debtor used the wrong date. In this case, the date used for calculating the\n   <em>\n    Till\n   </em>\n   rate is significant because the prime rate increased after the Petition Date. Because the prime rate as of the Petition Date and the prime rate as of the confirmation date are different, the Court must determine which of these two dates to use-or whether to use some other date to calculate the cramdown interest rate under\n   <em>\n    Till\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, this Court holds: (i) pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 506(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, a secured creditor is entitled to the allowance of its contractual rate of interest from the Petition Date until the day before the confirmation date; and (ii) pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii) of the Bankruptcy Code, a debtor may modify a secured creditor's rights, including the\n   contractual interest rate, as of the date of the entry of the confirmation order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Anti-Modifications provisions of \u00a7 1322(b) do not apply in this case\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Ordinarily, a chapter 13 debtor may not modify the contractual interest rate on a home mortgage through a confirmed plan because the Bankruptcy Code provides that a debtor's plan may \"modify the rights of holders of secured claims, other than a claim secured only by a security interest in real property that is the debtor's principal residence.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201322\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2).

These are that the plan provide: (1) that the holder of a secured claim retain its lien until \"payment of the underlying debt ... or discharge under Section 1328,\" (2) that payment on the debt be made in \"equal monthly amounts,\" and (3) that the plan may be confirmed with respect to an allowed secured claim if \"the value, as of the effective date of the plan, of property to be distributed under the plan on account of such claim is not less than the allowed amount of such claim.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5)(B)(i)-(iii) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In this case, Debtor's Plan satisfies the first two requirements of \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B).

The Bankruptcy Code, however, does not define a plan's effective date. Likewise, the Chapter 13 uniform plan used in this District does not include or define the effective date.

This Court rejects Debtor's interpretation. The Court concludes that a plan must be confirmed before it can have an effective date. The plan is not \"effective\" until it is confirmed, as \u00a7 1327 \"Effect of Confirmation\" clearly implies. While confirmation and the \"effective date of the plan\" may not always be the same date (which is commonplace in a Chapter 11 Plan), confirmation must happen first. To choose the petition date as the \"effective date\" would be to give effect to the plan before it has been confirmed, something the Bankruptcy Code does not permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Interpretation of the Bankruptcy Code \"begins where all such inquiries must begin: with the language of the statute itself.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Prior to the effective date of the plan, \u00a7 506(b) requires that a debtor pay the contract rate of interest-thus the secured creditor gets the benefit of its bargain, because if the creditor did not receive its prepetition interest rate on an oversecured claim, it\n   would result in a windfall to a debtor holding the equity position. Upon the effective date of the plan, a new bargain is made through the cramdown provision of the Bankruptcy Code, and \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(C)(ii) requires that a creditor simply receive the \"present value\" of its secured claim for a cramdown confirmation to succeed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Pursuant to \u00a7 506(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, an oversecured creditor is entitled to the allowance of its contractual interest rate after the filing of the petition but prior to the date of the entry of the confirmation order (the pendency period).

For purposes of \u00a7 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii) of the Bankruptcy Code, the effective date of the plan means the date the confirmation order is entered. In this case,\n   <em>\n    Till\n   </em>\n   bars Debtor from obtaining confirmation of the Plan because the proposed cramdown rate of 6.75% relied on the prime rate as of the petition date instead of the date the confirmation order is entered.

Assuming the Court confirms a Plan, the effective date of the Plan will be the date of the entry of the confirmation order.
