On November 15, 2017, Betteroads filed its\n   <em>\n    Opposing Statement of Material Facts\n   </em>\n   and its\n   <em>\n    Initial Opposition to Premature Amended Motion for Summary Judgement by Sargeant\n   </em>\n   (Lead Case 17-04156, Docket Nos. 130 &amp; 131). Betteroads argues the following in its opposition to the premature amended motion for summary judgment: (i) Sargent wants to move forward with summary judgment before the alleged Debtor has the opportunity to access the documents, evidence and testimony to expose their intent. The alleged Debtor is in the process of gathering relevant documental evidence to put the court in the position to dismiss this petition due to the bad faith of the creditors; (ii) Sargeant seeks a competitive advantage in the local asphalt market. \"The alleged Debtor's demise will certainly grant this competitive advantage as the alleged debtor and Sargeant hold two out of three tank farm terminals/ports in Puerto Rico;\" (iii) \"[t]he petitioners in this case, did not join the petition to immerse the alleged debtor in this process with the other creditors best interest at heart. Simply, they were motivated either by competitive market advantages and a check to be written by the syndicate lenders;\" (iv) \"...it appears that the syndicate lender[s] were forced to make a promise of payment to those unsecured creditors which agreed to join as petitioners. By information and belie[f], this payment or distribution would be in addition to that which they would be entitled to within the statutory bankruptcy distribution structure of their corresponding potential class;\" (v) \"[a]s such, it appears that the other petitioners may be under the paycheck of the \"Syndicate Lenders\" seeking a distribution contrary to the orderly scheme of the bankruptcy code and in preference to any potential unsecured creditor in the same classification; and (vi) \"[f]rom the alleged [D]ebtor's perspective, the petitioners' interests became so intertwined that they have become and should be considered as a single entity for purposes of the proceedings\" (Docket No. 131).

The Lenders in their\n   <em>\n    Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n   contend the following: (i) the involuntary petitions satisfy the requirements under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20303\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), given that each involuntary petition is supported by at least three (3) petitioning creditors with claims that are not contingent or the object of a bona fide dispute as to liability or amount and the aggregate of their unsecured, noncontingent, undisputed claims aggregate more than the statutory threshold of $15,775; (ii) each of the Petitioning Creditors for both of the involuntary petitions holds a final and unappealable judgment that has not been contested by the Debtors; (iii) the alleged Debtors are not paying their debts as they become due in conformity with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20303\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h)(1). Moreover, the Debtors have failed to deny that they are generally not paying their debts as they become due; (iv) the record shows that since the filing of the Involuntary Petitions, additional unpaid claims as of the Petition Date have been filed against the alleged Debtors; (v) these additional proof of claims filed by\n   unpaid creditors, which claims are deemed allowed, evidence that Betteroads and Betterecycling owe at least $4,264,380.85 to creditors, without considering the claims of the Petitioning Creditors which exceed $90 million. Moreover, the proof of claims filed by the Internal Revenue Service evince that both of the Debtors' outstanding federal tax liabilities which amount to approximately $980,875.21 date back as far as the year 2015. There are also proof of claims filed by the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (\"PREPA\"), the Puerto Rico Telephone Company and real estate taxes filed owed to CRIM; (vi) Debtors have accumulated a substantial amount of litigation related to claims from suppliers and other entities; and (vii) the Aging Report ending on June 30, 2017 and produced by Betteroads discloses that at least 90.4% of Betteroads accounts payables are over 90 days old that amount to $10,073,646.65. The Aging Report ending on June 30, 2017 and produced by Betterecycling discloses that 98.66% of Betterecycling accounts payables are over 90 days old that amount to $16,957,259.71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On November 17, 2017, a status conference was held in which the parties gave an overview regarding the motion for appointment of trustee and also discussed the motion to dismiss the involuntary petition and the motions for summary judgment filed by Sargeant Marine/ Sargeant Trading and the petitioning creditors. The court stated that assuming the creditors in the syndicate lender facility are considered to be creditors subject to a bona fide dispute, there are at least three (3) other creditors. Counsel for the Debtors contested the validity of the three (3) creditor requirement based on a questionable agreement. Counsel for petitioning creditors stated that the creditors hold final judgments against the Debtors and that the agreement is presented as part of the bad faith defense, and that the agreement was not accepted, and was based on a carve-out proposition. Counsel for Banco Popular stated that it also has debts and claims which are not part of the syndicate lender facility. Counsel for Firstbank clarified that Firstbank has two claims, including a secured claim that is not part of the syndicate lender agreement. Counsel for the Involuntary Debtors challenged that Debtors are not paying debts as they become due. Counsel for the petitioning creditors replied by stating that the Debtors have not opposed in writing. Moreover, the Debtors have seventeen (17) debt collection actions, and 90% of their accounts payable are over 90 days old. The court stated that petitioning creditors have made a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing that debtors were not generally paying debts as they became due and that it behooves the debtors to oppose this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The court also stated the following: \"There is no statutory requirement that petitioning creditors commence an involuntary petition in good faith. The critical issue is whether bad faith is a valid ground to dismiss an involuntary petition. Bad faith is a fact intensive issue which generally relies on equitable principles. In view of the above, the court posed two questions: 1-why should the court apply equity under section 105(a) after the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Law v.

Moreover, all references to the mentioned award is made collectively without any distinction as to either entity. \"Finally, as per the alleged Confidential Agreement with the Syndicate Lenders, Sargeant Marine, Inc. and Sargeant Trading LTD, present their claim as one, jointly settle with Syndicate Lender on distribution ... without distinction of one another;\" and (iii) regarding the proof of claims that have been filed in both cases and as to the Aging Reports for the Debtors as of June 30, 2017 in which 90.4% of Betteroads' debts are over 90 days old and in the case of Betterecycling 98.66% of its debs are over 90 days old, the Debtors deny the same as drafted and state the following: \"[i]t is a fact that lender's intervened, controlled, authorized or deauthorized payments to creditors of the alleged debtors. Further, lender unwarrantedly extrajudicially foreclosure of over $45 million in accounts receivables and all cash equivalents of the alleged debtor provoking a default on certain debts. It is Lender['s] unwarranted and illegal actions which are subject to the State Court's adjudication which restitution may provide for the payments of the creditors' claims, which they themselves hindered.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The material facts that are in controversy and which the court will delve into are directly related with the requirements of the numerosity of creditors and whether the Debtors are not paying their debts as they become due the pursuant under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20303\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and (h)(1). Thus, these material facts in controversy are related to some of the legal controversies in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    Legal Issues\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   There is before the court a motion to dismiss filed by each alleged Debtor in each lead bankruptcy case. There is also before the court a motion for summary\n   judgment filed by the Lenders and the opposition filed by each alleged Debtor. In addition, there is a motion for summary judgment filed by petitioning creditors Sargeant Marine and Sargeant Trading in the Betteroads involuntary bankruptcy proceeding. The legal issues in the Debtors' motion to dismiss in the Betteroads and Betterecycling involuntary bankruptcy petition and the motions for summary judgment are all related and intertwined because they all gravitate around the same central issues which are namely: whether these involuntary bankruptcies satisfy the requirements of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20303\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) and 303(h). The other key legal issue is whether \"bad faith\" is a \"cause\" for dismissal in involuntary bankruptcy proceedings pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20303\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the other legal issue that the alleged Debtors bring forth in their motion to dismiss is whether the court should abstain from delving into these involuntary bankruptcy proceedings pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20305\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). For the sake of expediency and judicial economy, the court has combined both involuntary bankruptcy proceedings into one opinion and order given that the legal issues before the court are very similar. The court's analysis is in stages because whether it goes to the next stage is dependent upon the outcome of the prior stage. The court will start by delving into whether the Lenders and Petitioning Creditors satisfy the requirements of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20303\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and 303(h)(1) for the alleged Debtors. If these requirements are satisfied, then the court will consider whether \"bad faith\" is a \"cause\" for dismissal in involuntary bankruptcy proceedings. Lastly, the court will consider the alleged Debtors' request for discretionary abstention pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20305\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) is appropriate in these involuntary bankruptcy proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Legal Analysis &amp; Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Fed.

In the context of section 303(b), bona fide disputes disqualify specific entities from filing an involuntary petition. Section 303(h) provides that an order for relief may be entered upon an involuntary petition if the debtor is generally not paying its debts as they become due. The standard of section 303(h), however, contains an important qualification: The determination of 'generally not paying' excludes debts that are subject to a bona fide dispute as to liability or amount. It is possible that the petitioning creditor (whose claim is subject to a bona fide dispute under section 303(b) ) may be a creditor whose claim is excluded from the calculation of the 'generally not paying' standard under section 303(h), for example because of the existence of a counterclaim. Counterclaims may not make the petitioner's claim disputed for purposes of disqualifying the creditor as a petitioner, but it may render the claim disputed for section 303(h) purposes because the debtor argues that it does not owe the creditor anything.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    at \u00b6 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .11. To determine whether a claim is subject to a bona fide dispute as to liability or amount, most courts use the objective standard. Under the objective approach, if there are substantial factual or legal questions raised by the debtor, the debtor can preclude the creditor from being an eligible petitioning creditor. However, application of the objective standard by the courts has been considerably difficult.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 303.11[11]. \"In short, a bona fide dispute exists if there is an objective basis for either a factual or legal dispute as to the validity of the debt or the amount owed.

If this burden is satisfied, then the burden shifts to the alleged Debtors to demonstrate that a\n   <em>\n    bona fide dispute\n   </em>\n   exists as to liability or amount. The Lenders' position is that even if the court found that the Lenders' claims under the syndicated credit facility are subject to a bona fide dispute, such disputed facts are immaterial and irrelevant, given that the Petitioning Creditors have presented a prima facie case supported by at least three (3) petitioning creditors with claims that are not contingent or the subject of a bona fide dispute as to liability or amount. At this juncture, and as expressed below, it is not necessary for the court to delve into whether there is a\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   dispute as to liability or amount between the Lenders and each of the alleged Debtors because there are at least three (3) petitioning creditors with claims which have a final, firm and unappealable state court judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    Joint Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The issue of joint claims may be a determining factor because it may affect the number of petitioning creditors. \"Joint holders of one obligation, such as those debts owed to joint payees under a promissory note, are counted as one creditor and are not counted as separate creditors for the purposes of the number of petitioning creditors if payment on the obligation could only be enforced jointly. However, if each creditor holds a claim and can enforce the obligation, each is counted for the purposes of counting the number of petitioning creditors. The affiliation of the petitioning creditors does not preclude them from being counted as separate creditors if each one is a separate entity with a distinct claim and they were not formed for the purpose of subverting the three petitioner requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hon.

The first argument is that the Syndicate Lenders' claims are subject to a\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   dispute and subject to state court adjudication of the alleged debtors' counterclaims. Moreover, the simultaneous filing of the various state court actions reveals that all of these entities behave as one. However, this particular argument is moot given that the Lenders and Petitioning Creditors contend and have shown that they have the necessary three petitioning (3) creditors with claims that are not contingent or the subject of a bona fide dispute as to liability or amount for each bankruptcy petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The second argument is that the alleged Debtors are cognizant that the Petitioning Creditors' claims were adjudicated by a state court. However, the alleged Debtors argue that these petitioners should not be considered independent petitioners because they consolidated their interests prior\n   to filing these involuntary petitions in exchange for payment in preference of those creditors with the same unsecured classification. The consolidation of the Lenders and the Petitioning Creditors' interests was executed through various Carve Out and Settlement Agreements by which the Lenders and each creditor agreed that the former \"... [u]pon the occurrence of a Carve-Out Recovery Event, from the gross cash proceeds recovered therefrom (and, for the avoidance of doubt, actually received by the Lenders in cash, free and clear of any claims, counterclaims, liens, or encumbrances, pursuant to order of the Bankruptcy Court) (the 'Carve-Out Recovery Event Cash Proceeds')\" either a certain amount or a certain percentage of the Allowed Creditor Unsecured Claim, whichever is lower, shall be delivered by the Lenders to the creditor on account of the Allowed Creditor Unsecured Claim (Lead Case No. 17-04156, Docket No. 230, Lead Case no. 17-04157, Docket No. 186). The Lenders executed Carve Out and Settlement Agreements with the following Petitioning Creditors: (i) Champion Petroleum, Inc. (Betterecycling); (ii) St. James Security Services, LLC. (Betteroads); (iii) Facsimil Paper Connection Corp. (Betteroads); (iv) Control Force, Corp. (Betterecycling); (v) Sargeant Marine Inc. and Sargent Trading, LLC (Betteroads; and (vi) St. James Security Services, LLC (Betterecycling). Therefore, the Debtors' contend that these petitioning creditors in exchange for their assistance in achieving the liquidation of the corporations' assets obligated themselves to do the following: (i) litigate in unison; (ii) not to deviate from their common interest and strategy; (iii) they have settled to participate from the same distribution upon the sale and liquidation of the alleged debtor's assets and (iv) all in preference of those creditors with the same unsecured classification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The alleged Debtors argue that the petitioning creditors have become so entangled with the Syndicate Lenders that they should not be considered different and/or independent entities for purposes of the numerosity requirement of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20303\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

Iowa 1999). The court finds that the alleged Debtors' reliance in\n   <em>\n    In re Iowa Coal Min. Co., Inc\n   </em>\n   . is misplaced because in this particular case the bonding companies presented themselves to the court as one creditor with one claim based on the reclamation agreement. Moreover, the court concluded that for purposes of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20303\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) the bonding companies constituted one creditor with one claim because the relationships of the bonding companies and the coal companies were so intertwined and the petitioning creditors had been dealing with the debtors as one entity for an extended period of time. The court stated that the following factors taken together persuaded that the court that the bonding companies was basically one creditor with one claim: (i) all of the petitions for each of the coal mining companies filed by the bonding companies were virtually identical. The creditors' claims were evinced by the same documentary evidence. Nowhere in the petitions or exhibits do the bonding companies allocate the amount of debt owed to each one of them by the coal companies; (ii) in their petitions the bonding companies refer to the reclamation agreement and modifications to the same as the basis of their claim; (iii) the bonding companies alleged that certain indemnity agreements and subrogation rights serve as an added basis for their claims but they did not itemize the payments, or identify for which bond or company's benefit the payments were made; (iv) the coal companies executed a mortgage\n   and security interest based upon the reclamation agreement jointly to the three bonding companies. The court noted that based upon this particular fact; \"[i]t would appear that through the reclamation agreement and the subsequent mortgage and security agreement, the bonding companies have subordinated their individual rights to security for that group;\" and (v) as evidenced from the reclamation agreement, mortgage, correspondence and testimony, the bonding companies made a concerted effort to come together to protect the bonds.\n   <em>\n    In re Iowa Coal Min.

The court in this case determined that the bond companies' claims were based on a joint obligation which constituted a single claim and a single creditor entity for purposes of section 303(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In the instant case, each of the petitioning creditors' claims is based on a different and independent obligation which stems from a state court judgment. Therefore, the court finds that all of the petitioning creditors' claims do not constitute a single claim and thus a single creditor entity for purposes of section 303(b). The court clarifies that a different issue is whether these Carve-Out and Settlement Agreements between the Lenders and the Petitioning Creditors constitute bad faith and therefore \"cause\" to dismiss the involuntary petitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The issue of joint claims may be a determining factor under section 303(b) because it may have a direct effect on the number of petitioning creditors. However, the court concludes that it need not adjudicate the issue of whether two creditors; namely Sargeant Marine and Sargeant Trading's judgment constitutes a single claim or two independent (separate) claims. The court finds that that the Petitioning Creditors for involuntary petitions (Betteroads and Betterecycling) have met the threshold test of three (3) holders of claims against each Debtor whose claims are not contingent as to liability or the subject of a bona fide dispute, whose claims aggregate at least $15,775 of unsecured claims.

However, there is a general consensus amongst the courts that have been faced with this dilemma that the determination of the \"generally not paying\" standard is a multifactor test that cannot be employed in a rigid mechanical manner. \"It is a factual, as distinguished from legal, determination.

There is no fixed standard for determining whether a debtor is generally not paying its debts. Moreover, the First Circuit has not established a specific standard.

Therefore, 90.4% of Betteroads' accounts payables have been outstanding for more than sixty-seven (67) days given that the date of the bankruptcy petition was June 7, 2017 and the report is as of June 30, 2017. Moreover, the percentage of accounts payables as of June 7, 2017 would probably be higher because the current accounts payables amount to $826,333.96 and these were incurred from June 1- June 30, 2017. It is important to consider that the Accounts Payable Aging Report as of June 30, 2017 is divided into four main categories. The first category are the Trade Vendors accounts payables that as of June 30, 2017 the report reflects that there were a total of $6,163,679.44 of which $755,729.47 were current; $8,534.29 were 31-60 days old; $6,732.30 were 61-90 days old; and $5,389,117.64 were over 90 days old, meaning that approximately 87.43% of the trade vendors accounts payables were in the range of being over 90 days old. It is important to note that there was only $6,732.30 of accounts payables in the category of 61-90 days old. The following trade vendors are included in the current aging accounts payable category: (i) $500,647.71 to the law firm Nolla Palou &amp; Casellas LLC; (ii) $3,215.78 to Corretjer LLC; and (iii) $252,420.98 to Puerto Rico Asphalt LLC. The next category of accounts payables are the Utilities, Withholdings, Bank Cards and Taxes that as of June 30, 2017, the aging report discloses that there were a total of $1,970,304.52 of which $70,604.49 were current; $160,060.70 were 31-60 days old; $0 were 61-90 days old; and $1,739,639.33 were over 90 days old, meaning that approximately 88.29% of the utilities, withholdings, bank cards and taxes accounts payables were in the range of being over 90 days old. The third category of accounts payables are the Petty Cash &amp; Other Refunds accounts payables that as of June 30, 2017 the report details that its entire balance of $40,922.09 was over 90 days old for this particular category. Lastly, the Subcontract Payable category as of June 30, 2017, the aging report discloses that there were a total of $2,964,806.89 of which $2,903,967.59 were over 90 days old and $60,839.30 are in the hold/retn column,\n   meaning that 97.95% of the subcontract accounts payables were in the range of being over 90 days old (Lead Case 17-04156, Docket No. 121, Exhibit F).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The Lenders also argue that in the involuntary petition for Betteroads since the petition date, proof of claims have been filed that amount to over $2,736,010.45 for unpaid utilities, taxes and suppliers, among others. The court notes that pursuant to the claims register nineteen\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   claims have been filed and the total amount claimed for all the claims is $18,828,296.21 of which $13,781,226.85 is listed as secured; $503,419.43 is disclosed as being priority and the remaining $4,543,649.93 is disclosed as unassigned (unsecured) claims. The Lenders have not analyzed whether the proof of claims that were filed by the unsecured claimants match the accounts payables that are listed in the Aging Repot as of June 30, 2017 or whether the same are in addition to those accounts payables listed in the Aging Report or whether there are discrepancies. For example, under the Trade Vendors category in the Aging Report, Betteroads lists Total Petroleum as a vendor with a total accounts payable of $27,470.55 (over 90 days). However, Total Petroleum Puerto Rico, Corp. filed an amended unsecured proof of claim # 8-2 in the amount of $339,476.80 for goods sold. Another example, under the Trade Vendors category in the Aging Report, Betteroads disclosed that it has an account payable balance of $0 with Puma Energy Caribe LLC. However, Puma Energy Caribe, LLC filed an unsecured proof of claim # 13-1 in the amount of $2,566,884.21 for unpaid product. Puma Energy Caribe, LLC filed the same proof of claim (proof of claim # 10-1) in the case of Betterecycling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The Lenders further argue that as of the petition date, a considerable number of lawsuits have been commenced against Betteroads before the Puerto Rico Court of First Instance as well as before the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico collection actions against Betteroads (Lead Case 17-04156, Docket No. 121, Exhibit G). The Lenders did not attach a list of the cases that have been filed against Betteroads before the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. Moreover, the court notes that from the list submitted of the state court cases that have been filed there appears (3) different types of entities; namely Betteroads Asphalt Corporation; Betteroads Asphalt, Inc.; and Betteroads Asphalt LLC. The court also notes that in the Involuntary Petition filed against Betteroads Asphalt, LLC, on line item # 3, the petitioning creditors stated that the involuntary debtor has used for the last eight (8) years the following names: Betteroads Asphalt Corporation and Betteroads Asphalt II, LLC. The court notes that the majority of lawsuits that have been filed against Betteroads from the years 2015 and 2017 are collection of monies actions. Creditors' actions in the collection of debts through lawsuits and unsatisfied judgements are indicators that the debtor is not paying its debts as they become due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Moreover, in the instant case, the Internal Revenue Center filed proof of claim # 4-1 in the amount of $668,599.40 and disclosed that the claim was secured in the amount of $439,324.59 and the unsecured portion of its claim was in the amount of $229,274.81. The municipal revenue collection center or CRIM (Centro de Recaudaciones de Ingresos Municipales) filed proof of claim 14-1 in the amount of $24,849.32\n   and listed the same as unsecured. CRIM also filed proof of claim # 15-1 in the amount of $446,587.28 of which $409,637.81 is secured by a statutory lien and the remaining $36,949.47 is unsecured. The Puerto Rico Department of Treasury filed proof of claim # 16-1 in the amount of $377,118.96 of which it listed the amount of $277,417.77 as a priority pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20507\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Betteroads denies all of the Petitioning Creditors' allegations regarding the issue of whether the debtor is paying its debts as they become due. The alleged involuntary Debtor contends that: (i) \"...the lender's intervened, controlled, authorized or deauthorized payments to creditors of the alleged debtor. Further, lender unwarrantedly extrajudicial foreclosure of over $45 million in accounts receivables and all cash equivalents of the alleged debtor provoking a default on certain debts. It is [the] Lender['s] unwarranted and illegal actions which are subject to the State Court's adjudication which restitution may provide for the payments of the creditors' claims, which they themselves hindered;\" and (ii) \"Lenders took possession of funds destined for suppliers, taxing authorities, ongoing projects and employees' salaries, etc.\" (Lead Case 17-04156, Docket No. 168). The Debtor's defense is in essence that they have defaulted on their debts because the Lenders' seized $45 million of its accounts receivables and also foreclosed on its bank account that had a balance of $2 million. The Debtor did not offer evidence that it was paying its debts as they became due such as its track record in paying debts, the records of its financial accounts, its ordinary course of business as to payment of its debts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Petitioning Creditors also contend that Betterecycling is not generally paying the debts as such debts become due excluding debts that are subject to bona fide disputes as to liability or amount based upon the following: (i) Betterecycling' Aging Report of accounts payables as of June 30, 2017 discloses that there were a total of $17,186,901.39 of which $118,942.73 were current; $171,691.36 were 31-60 days old; $4,178.27 were 61-90 days old; and $16,957,259.71 of its accounts payables were over 90 days old. Therefore, 98.66% of Betterecycling' accounts payables have been outstanding for more than sixty-seven (67) days given that the date of the bankruptcy petition was June 7, 2017 and the report is as of June 30, 2017. The percentage of accounts payables as of June 7, 2017 would probably be higher because the current accounts payables amount to $118,942.73 and these were incurred from June 1- June 30, 2017. It is important to consider that the Accounts Payable Aging Report as of June 30, 2017 is divided into three main categories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The first category are the Trade Vendors accounts payables that as of June 30, 2017 the report reflects that there were a total of $14,236,152.28 of which $101,38.08 were current; ($775.29) were 31-60 days old; ($425.52) were 61-90 days old; $14,123,447.48 were over 90 days old, and $12,587.53 were classified as hold/retn, meaning that approximately 99.21% of the trade vendors accounts payables were in the range of being over 90 days old. It is important to note that there was a negative ($425.52) of accounts payables in the category of 61-90 days old. The following trade vendors are included in the current aging accounts payable category: (i) $1,994,503.81 to Puerto Rico Asphalt LLC; and (ii) $94,244.97 to the law firm of Nolla Palou &amp; Casellas LLC. The next category of accounts payables are the Utilities, Withholdings, Bank Cards and Taxes that as of June 30, 2017, the aging report discloses that there were a total of $1,726,532.48 of which $17,624.65 were current; $72,466.65 were 31-60 days old;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   $4,603.79 were 61-90 days old; and $1,631,837.39 were over 90 days old, meaning that approximately 94.52% of the utilities, withholdings, bank cards and taxes accounts payables were in the range of being over 90 days old. The third category of accounts payables are the Subcontract Payable category as of June 30, 2017, the aging report discloses that there were a total of $1,224,216.63 of which $1,201,974.84 were over 90 days old and $22,241.79 are in the hold/retn column, meaning that 98.18% of the subcontract accounts payables were in the range of being over 90 days old (Lead Case 17-04157, Docket No. 121, Exhibit K).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The Lenders allege that in the involuntary petition for Betterecycling since the petition date, proof of claims have been filed that amount to $1,528,370.40 for unpaid utilities, taxes and suppliers, among others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The court notes that pursuant to the claims register fifteen (15) claims have been filed and the total amount claimed for all the claims is $17,321,397.75 of which $13,169,308.44 is listed as secured; $355,121.76 is disclosed as being priority and the remaining $3,796,967.55 is disclosed as unassigned (unsecured) claims. The Lenders have not analyzed whether the proof of claims that were filed by the unsecured claimants match the accounts payables that are listed in the Aging Report as of June 30, 2017 or whether the same are in addition to those accounts payables listed in the Aging Report or whether there are discrepancies amongst the accounts payables in the Aging Report and the proof of claims that have been filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   For example, under the Trade Vendors category in the Aging Report, Betterecycling lists Multiventas y Servicios Inc. as a vendor with a total accounts payable of $18,494.19 (over 90 days). However, Multiventas y Servicios PR, Inc. filed an amended unsecured proof of claim # 15-1 in the amount of $21,088.69 for goods sold. Another example, under the Trade Vendors category in the Aging Report is the vendor S &amp; S Import, Inc. which Betterecycling lists as a vendor with a total accounts payable of $8,589.85 (over 90 days old). However, S &amp; S Import Inc. filed an unsecured claim # 9-1 in the amount of $11,454.36 for goods sold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   The Lenders allege that as of the petition date, a considerable number of lawsuits have been commenced against Betterecycling before the Puerto Rico Court of First Instance as well as before the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico collection actions against Betterecycling (Lead Case 17-04157, Docket No. 88, Exhibit L). The Lenders did not attach a list of the cases that have been filed against Betterecycling before the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. The court notes that the lawsuits that have been filed against Betterecycling from the years 2016 and 2017 are collection of monies actions. Creditors' actions in the collection of debts through lawsuits and unsatisfied judgements are indicators that the debtor is not paying its debts as they become due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Moreover, in the instant case, the Internal Revenue Center filed proof of claim # 1-1 in the amount of $4,168.77 and disclosed that the claim was secured in the amount of $4,076.87 and the unsecured portion of its claim was in the amount of $91.90. The municipal revenue collection center or CRIM filed proof of claim 11-1 in the amount of $24,849.32 and listed the same as unsecured. CRIM also filed proof of claim # 12-1 in the amount of $215,054.09. CRIM disclosed that the claim was unsecured in its entirety. The Puerto Rico Department of Treasury filed proof of claim # 13-1 in the amount of $1,995,627.57\n   of which it listed the amount of $1,145,939.41 as a priority pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20507\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Betterecycling denies all of the Petitioning Creditors' allegations regarding the issue of whether the debtor is paying its debts as they become due. The alleged involuntary Debtor contends that: (i) \"...the lender's intervened, controlled, authorized or deauthorized payments to creditors of the alleged debtor. Further, lender unwarrantedly extrajudicial foreclosure of over $45 million in accounts receivables and all cash equivalents of the alleged debtor provoking a default on certain debts. It is [the] Lender['s] unwarranted and illegal actions which are subject to the State Court's adjudication which restitution may provide for the payments of the creditors' claims, which they themselves hindered;\" and (ii) \"Lenders took possession of funds destined for suppliers, taxing authorities, ongoing projects and employees' salaries, etc.\" (Lead Case 17-04157, Docket No. 124). The Debtor's defense is in essence that they have defaulted on their debts because the Lenders' seized $45 million of its accounts receivables and also foreclosed on its bank account that had a balance of $2 million. The Debtor did not offer evidence that it was paying its debts as they became due such as its track record in paying debts, the records of its financial accounts, its ordinary course of business as to payment of its debts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The court finds that Betteroads' Aging Report as of June 30, 2017, the proof of claims that have been filed as of the petition date, and the collection of monies legal actions all evince that the alleged Debtor is not paying its debts as they become due regardless of whether the debts or accounts payable were for trade vendors, utilities, withholdings, bank cards, taxes and subcontractors. Moreover, overdue taxes, tax liens, collection actions, commencement of lawsuits, unsatisfied judgments are indicators that the debtor is not paying its debts as they become due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The court finds that Betterecycling' Aging Report as of June 30, 2017, the proof of claims that have been filed as of the petition date, and the collection of monies legal actions all evince that the alleged Debtor is not paying a substantial percentage of its debts as they become due regardless of whether the debts or accounts payable were for trade vendors, utilities, withholdings, bank cards, taxes and subcontractors. Moreover, overdue taxes, tax liens, collection actions, commencement of lawsuits, unsatisfied judgments are indicators that the debtor is not paying its debts as they become due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Therefore, the court concludes that Petitioning Creditors have established that Betteroads and Betterecycling have not been paying their debts as they come due, thus they have established the required elements under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20303\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Accordingly, the court finds and concludes that the petitioning creditors have satisfied the three prong requirement for filing an involuntary petition, that is, there are three creditors whose claims are not contingent as to liability, or the subject of a bona fide dispute, the claims exceed $15,775, and the alleged debtors are not paying their debts as they become due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Notwithstanding the above, the court must address if \"bad faith,\" is grounds for the dismissal of an involuntary petition and, if so, if the facts demonstrate that the involuntary petition was filed in bad faith. In other words, does bad faith defeat invoking bankruptcy jurisdiction?\n   <em>\n    Is Bad Faith an Independent \"cause\" for Dismissal under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20303\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <em>\n    Debtors' arguments\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The alleged Debtors argue that\n   <em>\n    Law v.

The Debtors reference the decision of the Third Circuit in\n   <em>\n    In re Forever Green Athletic Fields, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355324,4356134\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/328/\">\n    804 F.3d 328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) to support their position that the ruling and findings in said opinion that resulted in the dismissal of an involuntary petition on bad faith grounds were based not only on equity but on a sound interpretation of the bankruptcy code provisions. The Debtors' argument, based on\n   <em>\n    In re Forever Green Athletic Fields, Inc\n   </em>\n   ., is that the better view is that by including an express reference to bad faith in \u00a7 303, Congress intended for bad faith to serve as a basis for both dismissal and damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The Debtors contend that\n   <em>\n    In re Forever Green Athletic Fields, Inc\n   </em>\n   ., is in harmony even with the most conservative reading of\n   <em>\n    Law v. Siegel\n   </em>\n   , which they reject, as its ruling is based on a sound interpretation of the code's provisions that support a court's statutory authority to dismiss a case for bad faith. In tune with the limited scope of\n   <em>\n    Law v. Siegel\n   </em>\n   , nothing in section 303, or elsewhere in the Bankruptcy Code, prohibits courts from using its equity power to dismiss an involuntary bankruptcy case due to the petitioning creditors' bad faith. Courts have a clear mandate to deter improper conduct as sections 303(e), (i), and (k) prohibit courts from using its equity powers to dismiss an involuntary bankruptcy case due to the petitioning creditors' bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Debtors allege that, a court may dismiss an involuntary case for bad faith using its equitable powers pursuant to section 105(a) if it is not expressly prohibited or in contradiction with other provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. The Debtors argue that the petitioning creditors' reasoning will lead to inconsistent results and threatens the integrity of the judicial system because the court cannot engage in bad faith inquiry under section 303 regarding the creditor's motivations for filing involuntary bankruptcies because they are irrelevant and, thus have no place in the analysis under section 303 as to whether an order of relief should be entered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The alleged Debtors contend that as to the good faith requirement there is no difference between filing a voluntary petition and an involuntary petition. It is the Debtors' contention that the good faith requirement provided by the code and case law are applicable to any party that invokes the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy courts, not just the debtors. A good faith requirement protects the jurisdictional integrity of the bankruptcy courts by rendering their powerful equitable weapons (i.e. avoidance of liens; discharge of debts, marshalling and turnover of assets) available only to those debtors and creditors with \"clean hands.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Little Creek Dev.

The Debtors argue that the rulings of\n   <em>\n    Law v. Siegel\n   </em>\n   and Marrama in which it has been upheld that debtor's bad faith conduct constitutes a \"cause\" for dismissal further support the legal position that section 303 should be statutorily read as allowing for the dismissal\n   of an involuntary petition upon the founding of bad faith from creditors. \" Section 303(b) does not require that an involuntary petition be filed in good faith, any more than section 301 requires that a voluntary petition be filed in good faith. Nevertheless, in the former situation (as well as in the latter), the courts have developed a requirement of good faith.\" 2\n   <em>\n    Collier on Bankruptcy\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 303.16 (16\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   ed. 2017).

Some courts for involuntary bankruptcies apply a three-part test for abstention under section 305(a)(1) which consists of the following factors: (i) the petition was filed by a few disgruntled creditors and most creditors oppose the bankruptcy proceeding; (ii) there is an out-of-court restructuring\n   in progress; and (iii) the debtor's interests are furthered by dismissal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Richard Levin &amp; Henry J. Sommer, 2\n   <em>\n    Collier on Bankruptcy\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 305.02[2][a] (16\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   ed. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   The alleged Debtors argue that the court should dismiss this involuntary proceeding based on the doctrine of abstention pursuant to section 305(a)(1) due to the following reasons: (i) \"[b]ringing this case into the bankruptcy court would only add an additional layer of expense to the resolution of the principal contested issue which is the litigation with the financial institutions and it would be inefficient and excessively costly to process this debt through this [c]ourt. None of the costs that will be incurred here are necessary, since there is no legitimate bankruptcy purpose to be served by this filing. Therefore, economy and efficiency favor dismissal; (ii) the Puerto Rico Court of First Instance is available for both parties to protect their interests and proceedings are pending before state court. Federal proceedings are not necessary because the primary claims are based on state law and the claims can be adequately determined in state court; (iii) Federal bankruptcy proceedings are unnecessary and improper because there is no legitimate bankruptcy purpose; (iv) \"[i]f there is no bankruptcy proceeding, the Company will be able to continue its ongoing litigation with the Petitioning financial institutions and move forward with its business plan, benefitting all other creditors and eventually the stockholders;\" (v) \"[t]his action was not filed in [the] best interests of creditors or stockholders, but rather in the interest of a narrow few who seek to facilitate the forced sale of the business assets so they or their allies can snap it up at a distressed price. The Company has had good relationships with the majority of its creditors, and is able to work with them is allowed without issue;\" and (vi) \"[c]urrently there is no non-federal insolvency proceeding, as the Company has maintained good working relationships with the majority of its creditors\" (Lead case 17-04156, Docket No. 46, pgs. 18-20, Lead case 17-04157, Docket No. 27, pgs. 16-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   The Debtors further argue that the court should dismiss this involuntary case based on the doctrine of abstention pursuant to section 305(a)(1) based upon the following: (i) \"[f]irst of all, in terms of what is the nature of this potential bankruptcy estate. It could be fairly stated that as it is relevant to all other potential creditors of the alleged Debtor in the event the Syndicate Lender succeed[s] on dismantling the alleged debtor's defenses/counterclaims in the [s]tate [c]ourt complaint or through the appointment of a trustee, the result will be that we will then be dealing with fully over encumbered estate in which the Syndicate Lender will control and resolve in their exclusive factor all assets of the company; (ii) the alleged debtor's assertion is that in the event that if the case is dismissed, the Syndicated Lenders will not suffer as they would retain their lien unaffected on the state court proceedings, which they themselves commenced and which retains the proper jurisdiction even to provide them with any ultimate or provisional remedy to which they may be entitled; (iii) \"...if they are allowed to continue with their ill-founded intent to seize Debtor's assets and remove the existing management through this unwarranted bankruptcy process, no benefit would be received by the debtor nor other parties in interest, aside from these secured lenders and the other petitioners which now participate with them in their winnings;\" (iv) \"... if the alleged debtor were allowed to pursue their counterclaims and prevail in [s]tate [c]ourt, they would be in a position even to satisfy other creditors in 100%;\" and (v) \"l]enders have to their avail a [c]ourt with jurisdiction\n   to grant any remedy to which they are entitled. However, alleged debtors, parties in interest and other creditor are undoubtedly to be affected if an order for relief was granted at this point as the lenders which, together with its competitors, will seek to transfer and liquidate the entities assets in a transaction controlled by them\" (Lead case 17-04156, Docket No. 169, pgs. 25-26, Lead case 17-04157, Docket No. 125, pgs. 25-26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   The Lenders argue that the Debtors' request for abstention should be denied based upon the following: (i) the Debtors fail to establish or even argue that the interests of their creditors would be better served by abstention rather than by allowing these involuntary proceedings to continue; (ii) the ongoing litigation in these involuntary cases, the number of petitioning creditors joining in the involuntary petitions, and the record of lawsuits that have been commenced against the Debtors during the past two (2) years clearly evince that abstention and dismissal of these involuntary proceedings would not be in the best interest of creditors; (iii) \"...the Debtors have been transferring their assets as described in the Motion to Appoint a Trustee, and creditor remedies to avoid these transfers are available only in bankruptcy;\" (iv) the involuntary petitions do not involve a two party dispute that the pending state court litigation could resolve. The involuntary petitions were filed by at least seven (7) creditors with different claims; (v) the Debtors have numerous creditors, some of which have filed collection actions against the Debtors. Numerous creditors have filed multimillion dollar proofs of claims; and (vi) the state court litigation would not resolve or avoid the substantial transfers that the Debtors have undertaken prior to the bankruptcy filing or provide an orderly process for all creditors to assert their claims (Lead case 17-04156, Docket No. 74, pgs. 18-20, Docket No. 182, pgs. 14-15; Lead case 17-04157, Docket No. 52, pgs. 18-20, Docket No. 137, pgs. 14-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   The Debtors argue that if the case is dismissed, the Syndicate Lenders will not suffer because they would retain their lien unaffected in the state court proceedings. They also argue that the only ones that would benefit from the involuntary bankruptcies would be the secured lenders and the other petitioning creditors and that no benefit would be derived by the Debtors or other parties in interest. The Debtors further allege that if they are allowed to pursue their counterclaims and prevail in the state court litigation, they would be in a position even to satisfy other creditors in 100%.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   This court finds that the Debtors' arguments are based upon unsupported and contradictory allegations that fail to establish how dismissal will benefit both the Debtors and its creditors. The secured lenders' liens will not suffer and will remain secured whether the Debtors are in bankruptcy or not. The only ones that would benefit from the state court litigation are the plaintiffs (syndicate lenders) that have commenced state court proceedings and have secured claims. Moreover, the court notes that the state court litigation in which the Syndicate Lenders were the plaintiffs was barely commencing, meaning a complaint, an answer to the complaint, a counter- claim were filed and the court's resolution by which it denied a motion for preventive garnishment filed by Banco Popular. To the court's knowledge no discovery had begun. The court notes that the other creditors that could benefit are the ones that already have Judgments and would need to race to the Property Registry in order for the Judgments to be secured by collateral. However, if the Debtors are in bankruptcy, piecemeal litigation would be halted and other unsecured\n   creditors could potentially receive dividends from the bankruptcy estate. The Debtors' argument that if they are allowed to pursue their counterclaims and prevail in state court litigation, they would be in a position to satisfy other creditors in 100% of their claims is unfounded and speculative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   The court finds that the Debtors have failed to show how dismissal would serve its interest and those of its creditors. Therefore, this court concludes that the Debtors' request for dismissal pursuant to section 305(a)(1) is unfounded and thus, should not be used as an alternative remedy for a motion to dismiss. Moreover, this court has held that bad faith in the filing of an involuntary petition are a \"cause\" for dismissal of the same. Thus, this court finds that the Debtors have failed to satisfy their burden of proof on this particular issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   In view of the foregoing, the court finds and concludes as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-182\">\n   (1) The Petitioning Creditors have satisfied the three-prong requirement for filing an involuntary petition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-183\">\n   (2) Bad faith is an independent cause for dismissal of an involuntary petition under section 303(b).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-184\">\n   (3) The alleged Debtors have failed to show that dismissal pursuant to section 305(a)(1) abstention is in the best interest of both the creditors and the debtor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   An evidentiary hearing will be scheduled to consider whether or not the involuntary petitions were filed in bad faith, that is, for an improper purpose that constitutes an abuse of the bankruptcy process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-189\">\n    Reversed and remanded on August 9, 2017,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206365433\">\n     2017 WL 6365433\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , on other grounds, and pending appeal before the U.S. Court of Appeals before the First Circuit.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-190\">\n    The court notes that the initial Petitioning Creditor is St. James Security Services, Inc.
