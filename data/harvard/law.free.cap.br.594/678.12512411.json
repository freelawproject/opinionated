This is a core proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As a part of a criminal conviction, the United States received an order of forfeiture against Debtor, Racing Services Inc. (\"RSI\"). In response to that forfeiture, Trustee, the United States, and PWE entered into a settlement agreement that included disposition of property. Later, RSI's conviction and the order of forfeiture were overturned. The United States then returned the money and property exchanged under the settlement agreement to the bankruptcy estate. The parties now dispute whether the agreement continues to be effective as between PWE and RSI's bankruptcy estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Bala filed this adversary seeking a declaratory judgment that the settlement agreement is void, making PWE's releases ineffective. PWE and Trustee argue that the agreement is still in effect between PWE and RSI's bankruptcy estate. PWE argues that Bala does not have standing to challenge the settlement and that the United States is a necessary party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Bala moves for summary judgment. She argues that this Court did not have jurisdiction to approve the settlement. She also argues that the United States and the Trustee voided or rescinded the settlement agreement after the reversal of the criminal conviction and forfeiture. PWE also moves for summary judgment arguing that the agreement was severable, that res judicata applies, that PWE was a good faith purchaser under section 363(m), and that the issue is moot. The Court finds that it did have jurisdiction and that the settlement agreement is severable. The agreement thus remains valid between PWE and RSI's bankruptcy estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND AND FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This adversary action is a small piece in a much larger puzzle. The main bankruptcy case has spanned over a decade and undergone many twists and turns. The parties to this action have a long history that the Court need not restate in its entirety here. The Debtor, RSI, was an off-track horse racing service provider. It took bets and managed betting pools for off-track horse race betting in North Dakota. Susan Bala is the sole owner of RSI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   PWE is an entity owned by Peter Wagner (\"Wagner\"), a high-volume professional gambler. PWE was one of RSI's biggest clients for many years. In the early 2000's Bala and Wagner, through RSI and PWE, started a new betting operation together in Mexico. When RSI filed for bankruptcy in 2004, it held some claims against PWE relating to the betting operation in Mexico.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2003, RSI was indicted on charges of illegal gambling. In 2005, the jury convicted RSI of these charges. The jury also reached a verdict on the corresponding forfeiture allegations. The jury found RSI did not have a valid license for a second betting location and issued a criminal forfeiture in the amount of wagers that passed through that location, $99,013,200. The jury also found that the statutory \"takeout\"-a percentage of the betting pool RSI took out to pay expenses and keep as profit-amounted to $19,719,186 and was subject to criminal forfeiture by Ms. Bala personally, as the sole owner of RSI. Accordingly, the United States District Court for the District of North Dakota entered a $99,013,200 order of forfeiture against RSI and a $19,719,186 order of forfeiture against Bala.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 2006, this Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving a settlement between PWE, Trustee, and the United States (the \"Settlement Agreement\") dealing with the forfeiture order. The Settlement Agreement provided, among other things, that: (1) RSI's bankruptcy estate would pay $132,500 to the United States and the Trustee would give the United States an assignment of certain assets; (2) the United States would release RSI, Trustee, and the bankruptcy estate from liability on the forfeiture; (3) PWE would pay $150,000 to RSI's bankruptcy estate; (4) RSI's estate would release PWE and PWE's affiliates of all claims arising out of, or related to, the business relationship between RSI and PWE and its affiliates. RSI likely would not have been able to fund a settlement payment to the United States without simultaneously settling its claims with PWE. PWE paid $150,000 to the RSI bankruptcy estate in exchange for releases. RSI paid $132,500 to the United States (along with other specified assets) in exchange for a release of the United States forfeiture rights against RSI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed RSI's conviction and the accompanying order of forfeiture.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Bala,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3485864\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/489/334/\">\n    489 F.3d 334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir. 2007). After this reversal, the United States returned the $132,500 it received to the RSI estate, along with the assignments it received under the Settlement Agreement. PWE did not return anything it received under the Settlement Agreement. The Bankruptcy Trustee and PWE have continued to operate as if the Settlement Agreement is still in force between them. Bala argues that the Settlement Agreement is void in its entirety. This is the dispute currently before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Bala filed this adversary seeking a declaratory judgment that the Settlement Agreement is void for two reasons. First, she argues the Bankruptcy Court lacked jurisdiction and constitutional authority to enter the Order approving the Settlement Agreement. Second, she argues the United States and Trustee voided the Settlement Agreement when the United States returned money and property transferred under the agreement and Trustee accepted the returned money and property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   PWE and Trustee argue that Bala does not have standing to bring this action, that the United States is an indispensable party, that this Court had jurisdiction to approve the Settlement Agreement and that, at most, the Agreement was rescinded only as between the United States and RSI. They argue that the agreement remains valid between PWE and RSI. The\n   Court will address the specific arguments and the facts underlying those specific arguments as needed in the next section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court has previously held hearings on this matter. At those hearings, the parties agreed that the dispute was a purely legal one. As a result, they agreed to submit this adversary for ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment. Nevertheless, along with the briefs in this case, they have submitted extensive requests for the Court to take judicial notice of many documents. It is unclear what, if any, factual dispute is at issue in this matter that would need to be resolved by resorting to those documents. The parties agree about what happened leading up to the Settlement Agreement, the terms of the Settlement Agreement, and what happened after RSI's conviction and forfeiture were reversed. These facts are set forth clearly in their pleadings and briefs and are sufficient for resolution of this purely legal dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court will first address PWE's Motion to Dismiss due to Bala's purported lack of standing and failure to join the United States. Next, the Court will address Bala's arguments that the Court did not have jurisdiction to approve the Settlement Agreement and that the actions of United States and the Bankruptcy Trustee acted to void the entire agreement under the doctrine of mutual mistake. Finally, the Court will address PWE's arguments that the provisions of the Settlement Agreement are severable, leaving the PWE portions of the agreement in full effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSIONS OF LAW AND ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    I. PWE and Trustee's Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Standing and Failure to Join a Necessary Party\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   PWE and Trustee argue that the Court should dismiss Bala's complaint because she does not have standing and she failed to join the United States as a party. \"In order for a court to decide the merits of a particular dispute, a party must have standing.

They argue that only PWE, the United States, or Trustee have standing to challenge the continued validity of the agreement. They rely on authority that discusses standing to bring an appeal for support.\n   <em>\n    In re Zahn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047504,3620298\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/526/1140/\">\n    526 F.3d 1140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1142 (8th Cir. 2008) (\"[I]n order to have standing to appeal the decision of the bankruptcy court, an appellant must be a person aggrieved.\"). Bala argues that these cases address standing to appeal, not standing to challenge a settlement, like she does here. Bala argues that, as a creditor of the Estate, she has standing to seek a declaratory judgment that will directly affect whether an asset is property of the bankruptcy estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"The question of standing generally challenges whether a party is the proper one to request an adjudication of a particular issue.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Patriot Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9065072\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/303/811/#p815\">\n    303 B.R. 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 815 (8th Cir.

N.D. Ill. 2010) (citations omitted) (collecting cases). For example, \"[t]ypically, a Debtor has no standing to object to claims or orders relating to them because the debtor does not have a\n   <strong>\n    pecuniary interest\n   </strong>\n   in the distribution of the assets of the estate.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Zumbach,\n   </em>\n   No. BR 12-00787,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201064612\">\n    2015 WL 1064612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (Bankr.

BAP 1998) ) (internal quotation marks omitted). Bala, however, is not the debtor in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Bala has standing to challenge the continued validity of the Settlement Agreement because she is a creditor and an equity shareholder seeking distribution from the bankruptcy estate. Simply stated, she has a financial stake in the validity of the Settlement Agreement and, thus, has standing. The fact that she was not a party to the agreement is irrelevant. She has a pecuniary interest in the outcome of this litigation. If the Court finds for her and declares that the agreement is no longer valid, RSI's bankruptcy estate will retain claims against PWE that were previously thought to be released. As a creditor and equity holder, Bala has a pecuniary interest in the bankruptcy estate's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   PWE also argues that the United States is a necessary party to this action. PWE argues that \"Bala should have included the United States in the complaint so that it can comment on whether it deems the entire agreement rescinded as to all parties.\" PWE seeks dismissal of the complaint because it fails to include a necessary party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \" Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(7) permits dismissal of a complaint for failure to join a party under Rule 19, although 'courts are generally reluctant to grant motions to dismiss of this type.' \"\n   <em>\n    Fort Yates Pub.

The United States has already removed itself from these matters by returning the funds it received under the Settlement Agreement. It will not be prejudiced if the\n    adversary continues without it. PWE's assertion that the United States is a necessary party so that it can \"comment on whether it deems the entire agreement rescinded\" is unpersuasive.

Federal Rule 19(a)(2) requires a court to order that a necessary party be joined in an action. Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a)(2). The Court could order the United States to be joined as a defendant under Bankruptcy Rule 7020 and Federal Rule 20(a)(2). Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7020 ; Fed. R. Civ. P. 20(a)(2).

This Court had jurisdiction to enter the Order approving the Settlement Agreement. The Court's finding that it had jurisdiction within the Order approving the Settlement Agreement is subject to res judicata. Bala's motion for declaratory judgment is an improper vehicle for her substantive challenge and even if she'd brought her challenge under the correct vehicle, Rule 60(b), she would fail.

Bala concludes that, when the forfeiture was later invalidated on appeal, it was revealed that the entire agreement was premised on a mutual mistake.

The United States returned $132,500 to RSI's bankruptcy estate along with the other property. Trustee accepted and disposed of the returned property without objection. Bala posits that these actions show a tacit acknowledgement by the United States and Trustee that the Settlement Agreement was based on a mutual mistake. She argues that the United States' act of returning the money and property and Trustee's act of accepting it,\n    were all that was required to void the contract under the doctrine of mutual mistake.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    The Court does not agree. The United States returning the money and property and Trustee accepting it does not sufficiently establish that the entire Settlement Agreement was premised on a mutual mistake and voided. Even if these actions alone were sufficient to satisfy the doctrine of mutual mistake, Bala would have shown, at most, that the agreement was voided between the United States and Trustee. Bala has made no showing that the Settlement Agreement was void between Trustee and PWE.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    <strong>\n     III. Severability\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    PWE points out that even if the Court finds that the Settlement Agreement was voided between the United States and Trustee, it remains in full force between PWE and Trustee because it is severable. Severability is a contract issue. \"The language of a contract is to govern its interpretation if the language is clear and explicit and does not involve an absurdity.\" N.D.C.C. \u00a7 9-07-02. \"A contract must receive such an interpretation as will make it lawful, operative, definite, reasonable, and capable of being carried into effect, if it can be done without violating the intention of the parties.\" N.D.C.C. \u00a7 9-07-08.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    The Settlement Agreement contains the following severability provision:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n    <em>\n     Partial Invalidity\n    </em>\n    . Any provision of this Agreement which is found to be invalid or unenforceable by any court in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability, and the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    PWE's Exhibit l at 4.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    The plain language of the severability clause makes clear that the Settlement Agreement is to remain effective even if a portion is invalidated. In the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary, the Court assumes that the unambiguous language of a contract reflects the parties' intentions. Here, the contract language is clear. PWE and Trustee both attest that they intended the severability clause to have its plain meaning at the time they entered into the Settlement Agreement. The severability clause makes clear that, regardless of the actions of the United States, the contract remains enforceable between Trustee and PWE.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Even if the Settlement Agreement did not contain a severability clause, the Court would not assume that acts of rescission by one or two parties to a multi-party contract invalidate the entire contract.

The actions of the parties also strongly indicate that they intended it to be severable. The United States returned the property to the bankruptcy estate over a decade ago.

The Court further finds that any action to void the agreement between Trustee and the United States has no impact on the continuing validity of the Settlement Agreement between Trustee and PWE.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    <strong>\n     IV. PWE's 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss and Motion for Summary Judgment.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    In addition to its motion to dismiss for lack of standing and failure to join a necessary party, addressed above, PWE filed a Motion to Dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). In the alternative, PWE moves for a motion for Summary Judgment. If the Court considers matters outside the pleadings in ruling on a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, it must treat it as a motion for summary judgement under Federal Rule 56. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d). In ruling on PWE's motion, the Court has considered matters outside the pleadings and thus treats the motion as one for summary judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Summary judgment is appropriate when \"the record, when viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, shows there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving parties are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n    <em>\n     Graning v. Sherburne Cnty.,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11628596\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/172/611/#p614\">\n     172 F.3d 611\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 614 (8th Cir. 1999). As stated in the background section above, the parties do not present any factual dispute; their dispute involves only how the law should be applied to the agreed upon facts.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Bala's complaint contains two counts: (1) the Settlement Agreement is void because this Court lacked jurisdiction to approve it, (2) the Settlement Agreement is void due to mutual mistake and was voided by the United States when it returned property to RSI's bankruptcy estate.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Both of these arguments are fully addressed above. Viewed in the light most favorable to Bala, the Court finds that she cannot prevail on count one because this Court had jurisdiction to approve the Settlement agreement and the Court's finding that it had jurisdiction is subject res judicata. Bala cannot succeed on count two because, even if the Settlement Agreement was voided between the United States and Trustee, the Court finds that the agreement is severable such that it is still effective between PWE and Trustee. Because Bala cannot succeed on either count of her complaint, PWE is entitled to judgement as a matter of law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    PWE's remaining arguments regarding\n    <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20363\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 363\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (m) and statutes of limitations are moot as the Court has determined it is entitled to summary judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    <strong>\n     WHEREFORE,\n    </strong>\n    PWE's Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Standing is DENIED.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    <strong>\n     FURTHER,\n    </strong>\n    PWE's Motion to Dismiss for Failure to Join a Necessary Party is DENIED.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    <strong>\n     FURTHER,\n    </strong>\n    Bala's Motion for Summary Judgment is DENIED.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    <strong>\n     FURTHER,\n    </strong>\n    PWE's Motion for Summary Judgement is GRANTED.\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
