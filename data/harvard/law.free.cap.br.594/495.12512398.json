JUNG, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter comes to the Court on Matthew Feshbach and Kathleen Feshbach's (collectively \"Appellants\") appeal of a bankruptcy court's ruling that their 2001 income tax liability is not dischargeable. Dkts. 1, 24. Department of Treasury, Internal Revenue Service (\"Appellee\") challenges the appeal and asks the Court to affirm the bankruptcy court's judgment. Dkt. 29. In accordance with its November 8, 2018 Order, Dkt. 34, the Court\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMS\n   </strong>\n   the bankruptcy court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Following a two-day trial, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Florida found that Appellants' 2001 tax liability is not dischargeable. Dkt. 1 at 89-90. In its ruling, the bankruptcy court outlined in great detail the events giving rise to this action. Dkt. 1 at 48-87.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In short, Mr. Feshbach worked as a financial manager and private investor. Dkt. 1 at 50. Thanks to an investment strategy known as \"short selling against the box,\" Appellants were able to delay the recognition of taxable income on shares they liquidated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51. By the 1990s, Appellants were able to spend $14 million on a new house near Silicon Valley.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 1999, Mr. Feshbach invested in a home improvement and remodeling company that shortly thereafter entered bankruptcy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52. This, coupled with recent changes in tax law, triggered 1999 income taxes for Appellants in the amount of $1,950,827.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In 2001, Mr. Feshbach liquidated\n   other securities to pay the 1999 taxes, but this again triggered income recognition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Appellants reported $8,601,748 in taxable income in 2001, resulting in $3,247,839 in tax liability.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53. Appellants professed their inability to pay and proposed to Appellee a plan to settle the outstanding taxes from 1999 and 2001 for less than the full amount, otherwise known as an offer-in-compromise (\"OIC\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   What follows is a series of OICs, some of which were denied because Appellee felt they were too low and Appellants were living \"way over allowable living expenses,\" and an interim agreement to pay $1,000 monthly.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54. Meanwhile, Mr. Feshbach created an investment fund company targeted at wealthy individuals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55. During this time frame, Appellants had neither sold their house in Belleair, Florida, nor appreciably reduced their standard of living.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A revenue officer on the case concluded \"the entire process was a delay by Mr. Feshbach.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Appellants eventually paid off the 1999 tax debt and entered a new agreement to pay $120,000 per quarter to satisfy the 2001 tax debt.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57. Over ten quarters from October 2005 to January 2008, Appellants paid a total $1.2 million while reporting an income of $10,459,762 for 2005-2007.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following the 2008 economic downturn and a final rejected OIC, Appellants defaulted on the installment plan and Appellee began collection procedures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57-58. Appellants' final payment was in May 2011, and in June of the same year they filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   All told, Appellants made $13,056,518 in the nine years prior to filing bankruptcy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59. Between the first quarters of 2001 and 2010, Appellants spent more than $8.5 million on personal and household expenses and charitable contributions, including $721,809 on personal travel, $503,607 on clothing, $370,856 on groceries, $124,226 on entertainment, and more than $233,000 on a rented house in Aspen.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59-60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The bankruptcy court entered its Memorandum Decision on Complaint to Determine Dischargeability of Debt for Taxes and to Set Aside Tax Liens on October 14, 2017, an amended version on October 17, and its final judgment denying discharge of the 2001 tax debt on November 1. Dkt. 1. Appellants filed a timely notice of appeal on October 30 and an amended notice on November 1. Dkt. 1 at 1-4. They argue the bankruptcy court erred in denying discharge and, in the alternative, that the court erred in finding partial discharge unavailable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction to hear this appeal under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20158\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A bankruptcy court's factual findings are reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard, and \"[w]hether or not a debtor willfully attempted to evade or defeat a tax is a question of fact reviewable for clear error.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Jacobs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573597,3476998\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/490/913/\">\n    490 F.3d 913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 921 (11th Cir. 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   To the extent the Court's analysis \"involves developing auxiliary legal principles of use in other cases,\" the Court employs a de novo standard.\n   <em>\n    U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n ex rel.
