In the Motion, Movant seeks, out of an abundance of caution, relief from the automatic stay of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) to proceed with a judgment levy against real property not owned by the Debtor referenced above (the \"\n   <em>\n    Debtor\n   </em>\n   \") or by his bankruptcy estate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, Movant asserts in the Motion that it is a judgment creditor of the Debtor by virtue of a judgment it obtained against the Debtor in the State Court of Fulton County, Georgia on June 28, 2011 (the \"\n   <em>\n    Judgment\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Movant contends that the current balance owing on the Judgment is $892,335.56.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Movant states in the Motion that, upon the recording of a writ of fieri facias regarding the Judgment (the \"\n   <em>\n    FiFa\n   </em>\n   \") on August 1, 2011 (the \"\n   <em>\n    Recording Date\n   </em>\n   \") on the General Execution Docket of the Clerk, Fulton County Superior Court,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   a lien attached to certain real property located at 3200 Downwood Circle, N.W., Unit 550, Atlanta, Georgia (the \"\n   <em>\n    Property\n   </em>\n   \"), which was owned by the Debtor on the Recording Date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Movant further contends that the Debtor transferred the Property by limited warranty deed to an entity called The Multiple Sclerosis Center of Georgia, Inc. (\"\n   <em>\n    MSCG\n   </em>\n   \") on December 21, 2016, (the \"\n   <em>\n    Transfer\n   </em>\n   \"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   after the Recording Date and prior to the date the Debtor filed this bankruptcy case on June 28, 2018 (the \"\n   <em>\n    Petition Date\n   </em>\n   \"). In the Motion, Movant seeks relief from the automatic stay to levy on the Property to satisfy the Judgment. Movant asserts that, because the Property is located in Fulton County, Georgia, it was subject to the lien created by the entry of the Judgment and the recording of the FiFa. Accordingly, Movant\n   contends that MSCG took the Property subject to that lien, such that the Judgment and FiFa constitute a valid and enforceable judgment lien against the Property, now owned by MSCG.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As to the effect of the automatic stay, Movant first argues that the automatic stay of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) does not apply to its levy on the Property because the Property is not property of the Debtor or property of the bankruptcy estate. Movant further contends that levying on the Property does not implicate a claim against the Debtor; rather such an action solely affects MSCG and the Property itself, neither of which is protected by the automatic stay in this case. Said differently, Movant asserts that because the Property is not owned by the Debtor, but was transferred to another entity more than eighteen (18) months prior to the Petition Date, the automatic stay does not operate to prevent a levy on the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   To the extent the automatic stay does apply to Movant's request to levy on the Property, Movant argues that relief from the automatic stay pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) is appropriate. First, Movant contends that, under Section 362(d)(2), the Debtor has no interest in the Property-and thus has no equity in the Property- and that the Property is not necessary for an effective organization because the Debtor does not own it. Further, Movant contends that \"cause\" exists pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) to lift the stay because the Debtor has no interest in the Property, such that continuation of the stay as to the Property serves no bankruptcy purpose. Thus, Movant contends that it is entitled to stay relief to levy on the Property under either Section 362(d)(1) or (2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A hearing was held on the Motion on September 24, 2018 (the \"\n   <em>\n    Hearing\n   </em>\n   \"). Counsel for Movant appeared at the Hearing in support of the Motion, and counsel for the Debtor appeared in opposition. An attorney also appeared for both MSCG and Signature Bank of Georgia\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   at the Hearing in opposition to the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the Hearing, Movant initially reiterated the facts of this case and those underlying the Judgment. Movant also noted that, pursuant to a proof of claim filed in this case on September 12, 2018, later amended on September 19, 2018, it holds a claim against the Debtor in the amount of $889,111.78 by virtue of the Judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Claims Register, Claim No. 6. Movant also renewed its arguments made in the Motion, specifically citing to\n   <em>\n    In re Everchanged, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11763874\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/230/891/\">\n    230 B.R. 891\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. S.D. Ga. 1999) for the proposition that the automatic stay does not apply to property that is neither property of the Debtor nor property of the bankruptcy estate. Movant argued at the Hearing that, because it seeks to pursue an\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   action against the Property and not an\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   action against the Debtor, and because the Property is not property of the estate, such\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   enforcement rights do not implicate the automatic stay of Section 362(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In the alternative, Movant asserted that even if the automatic stay applies to a levy on the Property, cause exists under Section 362(d) for lifting the stay to permit such action. For that proposition, Movant cited to\n   <em>\n    In re Ohuche\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%20937571\">\n    2013 WL 937571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. N.D. Ga. Feb. 5, 2013), stating that where a debtor has no interest in the property and such property is not property\n   of the estate, cause exists for lifting the stay under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Debtor, through his counsel, first explained at the Hearing the Debtor's connection to MSCG. Based on those undisputed representations, the Debtor is the founder of MSCG, and currently works for the non-profit entity as both a medical practitioner and director. The Debtor's counsel also explained that, at the time of the Transfer in December 2016, the title examiner overlooked the FiFa, which resulted in the Property being transferred to MSCG without satisfaction of the Judgment. Finally, the Debtor contends that he is solvent and has sufficient assets (exclusive of the Property) to satisfy the Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As to the relief sought in the Motion, the Debtor asserted that the automatic stay of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) applies to a levy on the Property. The Debtor acknowledged that the Property is not property of the Debtor or property of the bankruptcy estate. The Debtor contended, however, that a levy by Movant on the Property to satisfy the Judgment would violate\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), (2), and (6). In essence, the Debtor contended that the automatic stay applies to actions against the Debtor or actions to collect claims against the Debtor. As Movant's desire to levy on the Property constitutes an attempt to collect a prepetition Judgment against the Debtor, the Debtor asserted that the automatic stay of subsections 362(a)(1), (2), and (6) each applies to prevent such action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Debtor also explained that lifting the stay to permit a levy on the Property would result in significant and substantial harm not only to MSCG, but to the Debtor's employment with the entity and his ability to successfully reorganize in this case. The Debtor asserted that levying on the Property would a cause significant disruption to the operating medical practice conducted by MSCG on the Property. Further, the Debtor contended that, as his medical practice with MSCG constitutes a major source of his income, levying on the Property would jeopardize his ability to earn income and thus to reorganize.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Counsel for Signature Bank and MSCG then explained her efforts to negotiate a settlement with Movant, the title insurance company, and the Debtor regarding the lien arising from the Judgment and FiFa.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   She also outlined various consequences that would result if the stay were lifted to permit Movant to levy on the Property. First, she argued that the levying process Movant seeks to employ would not be permissible in these circumstances, but rather that a judicial foreclosure would be required. In such an action, she asserted, Movant would have to name the Debtor as a necessary party, which would in turn undoubtedly implicate the automatic stay of Section 362(a). She also contended that, if the parties were unable to reach a settlement and Movant levied upon the Property, more state court litigation would commence, including the filing of a breach of warranty action against the Debtor for his warranties contained in the deed to MSCG.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   She explained that such a claim could result in a significant judgment against the Debtor, which would in turn affect property of the bankruptcy estate and the successful administration of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Finally, counsel for Signature Bank and MSCG also explained the negative impact\n   stay relief would have on MSCG. She asserted that because the Property is only a portion of a larger medical facility, levy on the Property would disrupt day-to-day operations within MSCG's medical facility. She further contended that merely advertising a levy of the Property would significantly affect MSCG's donor base and its ability to fundraise. Finally, she stated that levying on the Property may cause the Property's mortgage lender to declare a default on the security deed, further impeding MSCG's operations at its facility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The threshold issue in this matter is whether a levy on the Property is prohibited by the automatic stay of 11 U.S.C. 362(a). If the stay does not apply to protect the Property from a levy, then Movant is free to pursue that remedy, and the Court need not address any of Movant's other arguments. If, however, the stay does apply to a levy on the Property, then Movant's request for stay relief must be addressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Upon the filing of a voluntary petition, Section 362(a) operates a stay as to certain collection activities, including,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (1) the commencement or continuation ... of ... [an] action or proceeding against the debtor that was or could have been commenced before the commencement of the case under this title, or to recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case under this title;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (2) the enforcement, against the debtor or against property of the estate, of a judgment obtained before the commencement of the case under this title; ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (6) any act to collect, assess, or recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case under this title;\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The automatic stay of Section 362 is one of the most fundamental protections offered by the Bankruptcy Code. It remains in effect through the pendency of a bankruptcy case, and \"afford[s] the debtor a breathing spell by stopping all collection efforts.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Harchar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3736233\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/393/160/#p167\">\n    393 B.R. 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 167 (Bankr. N.D. Ohio 2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The parties do not dispute that the Property is not property of the Debtor or property of the bankruptcy estate under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as the Property was sold by the Debtor to MSCG prior to the Petition Date.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, a dispute does exist as to whether, despite the fact that the Property is not property of the Debtor or of his bankruptcy estate, a levy on the Property to satisfy the Judgement is prohibited by the automatic stay of Section 362(a). As noted\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Movant contends that because the Property is not property of the estate or property of the Debtor, the automatic stay does not apply to prevent a levy on the Property. Conversely, the Debtor argues that even though the Property\n   is not his property or property of the estate, any action by Movant to execute on the prepetition Judgment violates subsections (a)(1), (2),\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   or (6) of Section 362.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As noted above, Section 362(a)(1) stays \"the commencement or continuation ... of a judicial, administrative, or other action or proceeding against the debtor ... or to recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case ...\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). Section 362(a)(6) stays \"any act to collect, assess, or recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case under this title.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The central issue in deciding whether the stay applies to the proposed levy is what the phrase \"against the debtor,\" used twice in Section 362(a)(1) and once in 362(a)(6), modifies. For example, in the first half of Section 362(a)(1), does the phrase \"against the debtor\" modify both \"commencement or continuation\" and \"judicial, administrative, or other action or proceeding,\" or does it modify only \"judicial, administrative, or other action or proceeding?\" If it is the former, then to violate the provision the action has to involve an action or proceeding that is against the Debtor, and has to involve the commencement or continuation of that action against the Debtor. If it is the latter, then any continuation of an action that is against the Debtor (even if only commenced or continued against others not in bankruptcy) would be stayed. Similarly, in Section 362(a)(6), does \"against the debtor\" modify both \"act to collect, assess or recover\" and \"claim,\" or does it just modify \"claim?\" If it is the former, then only an act against the Debtor to collect on a claim against the Debtor is stayed, where if it is only the latter, then any act to \"collect, assess or recover\" on a claim against the Debtor is stayed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   It is not at all apparent from the statutory language which of these readings was intended by Congress. This issue has, however, been addressed by other courts. In that regard, \"[t]he automatic stay of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) protects only the debtor, property of the debtor, and property of the estate.
