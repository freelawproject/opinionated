FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff, a transportation company, hired Defendant as a contract dispatcher. Plaintiff contacted Defendant when it needed a truck to deliver freight in and around Georgia. Defendant would then find a driver to complete the route. Plaintiff would invoice the customer for payment. Plaintiff alleges Defendant collected and kept payments from customers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   More specifically, Plaintiff alleges Defendant represented to customers that they were to pay her, rather than Plaintiff, and she would remit the payments to Plaintiff. Plaintiff alleges Defendant represented to a customer, Swift Logistics, that it was to pay her rather than Plaintiff, and Swift Logistics paid Defendant $551.82 on June 17, 2015 under false pretenses that she was accepting the payment on Plaintiff's behalf. Plaintiff alleges Defendant never submitted the funds to it. Plaintiff alleges Defendant received several other payments, in the amounts of $409.50, $409.50, $409.50, $461.10, $409.50, and $409.50, under similar pretenses and never submitted the payments to Plaintiff. Plaintiff states Defendant also intercepted a payment on February 23, 2015 for $343.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff filed a complaint in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania and obtained a judgment against Defendant in the amount of $78,488.62. Plaintiff domesticated the judgment in Georgia. Plaintiff filed a second action in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania and obtained a judgment against Defendant for $26,732.91; it was also domesticated in Georgia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant filed a petition under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code on March 20, 2018. Defendant stated on Schedule A/B she held checking and savings accounts with Navy Federal Credit Union and Delta Community Credit Union. On Schedule D, Defendant listed three vehicles subject to\n   secured claims: a 2016 BMW 740i, a 2008 Harley Davidson motorcycle, and a 2013 BMW X5; on Schedule G she listed a Harley Davidson Sportster subject to an auto lease. On her Statement of Financial Affairs, Official Form 107, Defendant stated she was not married. On Schedule I, Defendant stated she was employed by Gilco Trucking as a dispatcher for approximately six years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff filed a complaint on June 25, 2018 seeking a determination a debt owed to it by Defendant is nondischargeable pursuant to sections 523(a)(2) and 523(a)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code and to deny Defendant a discharge pursuant to section 727(a)(2) and 727(a)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code. Defendant answered and moved to dismiss the complaint. Plaintiff then filed an Amended Complaint. Thereafter, Defendant filed the Motion.
