In support of her Summary Judgment Motion, the Trustee filed a memorandum of law [ECF No. 210] and the declarations of Geoffrey Varga (the \"Varga Dec'l.\") [ECF No. 208] and Gerard DiConza (the \"DiConza Dec'l.\") [ECF No. 211]. In accordance with Local Bankruptcy Rule 7056-1(b), the Trustee's motion is supported by a statement of undisputed material facts, dated July 8, 2016 (\"Trustee's Stmt. of Facts\") [ECF No. 209]. Fletcher has not filed an opposition to the motion. The Trustee filed a reply memorandum of law in further support of the Summary Judgment Motion (the \"Reply Brief\") [ECF No. 213] to address the applicable legal standard in light of the absence of any opposition to the Motion. On September 20, 2018, the Court heard argument on the Summary Judgment Motion (the \"Summary Judgment Hearing\"). Fletcher did not appear at the Summary Judgment Hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Trustee seeks judgment as a matter of law on three claims for breach of fiduciary duty and two claims for fraudulent transfer, as well as summary judgment dismissing all of Fletcher's counterclaims. For the reasons stated below, the Trustee is entitled to judgment on her fiduciary breach and fraudulent transfer claims, as well as against Fletcher's counterclaims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Soundview Elite and its affiliated entities (collectively, the \"Soundview Funds\"),\n   open-ended investment companies registered in the Cayman Islands, filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy on September 24, 2013. In early 2014, this Court approved the appointment of Corinne Ball to serve as Chapter 11 Trustee for the jointly administered cases [Case No. 13-13098 (\"Main Case\"), ECF No. 160]. Later that year, a number of related investment funds incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (the \"BVI Funds\") were placed into liquidation and assigned joint liquidators, who filed cases in this Court under chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Code [Case No. 15-12273]. Pursuant to a Cross-Border Insolvency Protocol [Main Case, ECF No. 502], Ms. Ball is authorized to prosecute claims on behalf of both the Soundview Funds and the BVI Funds (together, the \"Richcourt Funds\" or the \"Funds\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 23, 2015, the Trustee filed her Complaint [ECF No. 1] commencing this Adversary Proceeding against several insiders of the Funds, including Alphonse Fletcher, Jr. Thereafter, the Trustee filed an Amended Complaint [ECF. No. 52]. The Amended Complaint asserted twenty-one causes of action, including claims for breaches of fiduciary duty, turnover, fraudulent transfers and disallowance of claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Trustee now moves, pursuant to Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure Rule 7056 and Federal Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 56, for summary judgment on five of those causes of action against Defendant Fletcher, three based on breaches of fiduciary duty (counts nos. 3, 5 and 8) and two for fraudulent transfers (counts nos. 15 and 18).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 326-358; 374-405; 421-438; 498-507; 522-530.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The breach of fiduciary duty claims are based on Fletcher's failure to timely and properly disclose to investors of the Funds his acquisition of the Richcourt Funds (count no. 3), on three instances of defalcation by Fletcher following his acquisition of the Richcourt Funds (count no. 5), and based on the so-called \"New Year's Eve Transaction\" and Related Agreements (count no. 8). The two fraudulent transfer claims each seek to avoid the same two transfers made to Fletcher, based on alternative theories, either under Section 548(a)(1)(B) of the Bankruptcy Code, which is applicable to transfers made at a time when a debtor is insolvent and within two years of bankruptcy filing (count no. 18), or alternatively pursuant to Section 544 of the Bankruptcy Code, which allows the Trustee to bring fraudulent transfer claims on behalf of the estate under state law, here pursuant to Sections 273, 274, 275, 278, and 279 of the New York Debtor and Creditor Law (count no. 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The relevant facts, as set forth in the Statement of Undisputed Facts are not disputed and therefore deemed true, to the extent that they are supported by competent evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

P. 56(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    The Richcourt Acquisition\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Prior to their bankruptcy, the Richcourt Funds carried on business as open-ended investment companies with each fund registered as a mutual fund in the Cayman Islands or British Virgin Islands.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DeConza Dec'l at Exh. 9 (Soundview July 2009 Investment Brochure). At their peak in June 2008, the Richcourt Funds had approximately $1.55 billion under management. DeConza Dec'l, Exh. 13 at 14:13-16; 15:14-23 (Fletcher Deposition from November 5, 2013). At that time, the Citco Group and its affiliates (\"Citco\") owned, managed and controlled the Richcourt Funds through Richcourt Holding Inc. (\"RHI\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DeConza Dec'l, Exh. 6 at \u00b6 96 (Direct Testimony/Affidavit of Fletcher on\n   Motions to Dismiss, Convert, or Appoint a Trustee).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In June 2008, persons affiliated with Citco asked Alphonse Fletcher, Jr. if he would be interested in bidding for the purchase of the management shares in the Richcourt Funds. DeConza Dec'l, Exh. 6 at \u00b6 96 (Fletcher's Direct Testimony/Affidavit). At the time, Fletcher, through his wholly-owned Fletcher Asset Management Inc. (\"FAM\"), managed a number of other investment funds, including: (a) Fletcher Income Arbitrage Fund, Ltd. (\"Arbitrage\"); (b) FIA Leveraged Fund Ltd. (\"Leveraged\"); (c) Fletcher Fixed Income Alpha Fund, Ltd. (\"Alpha\"); (d) Fletcher International Inc. (\"FII\"); and (e) Fletcher International, Ltd. (Bermuda) (\"FILB\") (collectively, the \"Fletcher Funds\"). Stmt. of Facts at \u00b6 5-6; Deconza Dec'l, Exh. 5 at 13-14 (FILB Trustee's Report and Disclosure Statement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Fletcher was interested in the offer for several reasons, including the potential to earn significant management fees of at least $5 million per year over the next five years. Deconza Dec'l, Exh. 6 at \u00b6 96). On June 20, 2008, Citco sold 85% of RHI to Fletcher,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   DeConza Dec'l at Exh. 10) (Share Purchase Agreement), giving Fletcher ownership of 85% of the management shares in the Richcourt Funds (the \"Richcourt Acquisition\"). Fletcher was appointed director and chairman of RHI.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DeConza Dec'l at Exh. 8 (Fletcher's Consent to Act as Director); DeConza Dec'l, Exh. 9 at 22 (Soundview July 2009 Investment Brochure).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Fletcher quickly installed a team of directors who were aligned with him. As of July 2009, RHI's directors were Fletcher, Ermanno Unternaehrer, Denis Kiely, Stewart Turner and Fletcher's brother, Todd Fletcher. Kiely and Turner previously had been employees of FAM.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DeConza Dec'l at Exh. 12 (Resolutions of Board of Directors). Kiely has described himself as Mr. Fletcher's \"right-hand man.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DeConza Dec'l, Exh. 5 at 44 (citing Kiely SEC Dep. 409:6-7, Apr. 17, 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Fletcher was personally responsible for managing the business affairs of the Richcourt Funds, including supervising the activities of the administrators and subadministrators and maintaining corporate records (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   DeConza Dec'l, Exh. 11 at 19 (Declaration of Fletcher Pursuant to Local Rule 1007-2) ), and was also a member of the Richcourt Funds' investment management team.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DeConza Dec'l, Exh. 22, Ladner Tr. at 132:22-133:8 (Ladner Deposition). On September 4, 2012, Fletcher was appointed director of each of the individual Richcourt Funds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DeConza Dec'l at Exh. 4 (Fletcher's Proof of Claim Against the Soundview Funds' Estates).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Failure to Disclose the Richcourt Acquisition\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Although Fletcher acquired the management shares of the Richcourt Funds from Citco in June 2008, he did not notify the Richcourt Fund investors for a number of months.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DeConza Dec'l, Exh. 13, Fletcher Tr. at 36:4-13 (Fletcher Deposition).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Soon after the Richcourt Acquisition, Lehman Brothers collapsed, and in September 2008 RHI's access to credit expired. Stmt. of Facts at \u00b6 35-36; DeConza Dec'l, Exh. 5 at 77. In November 2008, Fletcher began investing assets of the Richcourt Funds into Arbitrage, one of the Fletcher Funds. Stmt. of Facts at \u00b6 38; DeConza Dec'l, Exh. 5 at 223. Between November 2008 and March 2010, Fletcher removed $61.7 million of cash from the Richcourt Funds and invested it into various Fletcher funds. Stmt. of Facts at \u00b6 39; DeConza Dec'l, Exh. 5 at 223.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In a letter to investors dated December 30, 2008, the Richcourt Acquisition was described as an equity investment by FAM instead of a change in control. DeConza Dec'l at Exh. 15 (December 2008 Letter). The letter notified investors that they would be barred from cashing out their investments because the Board of Directors had decided, in light of the recent financial crisis, that they would not honor requests to redeem investments that were dated less than one month earlier.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In January 2009, the directors of the Richcourt Funds again wrote to investors to inform them that redemptions might soon resume.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DeConza Dec'l at Exh. 16 (January 2009 Letter). The January 2009 letter contained a \"Q and A\" section that discussed the Richcourt Acquisition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This section contained false information regarding the management of the Funds. For example, it read:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Q: Has management of the Richcourt Group changed?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   A: No, all executives of the Richcourt Group have been retained, certain former Richcourt Group executives have rejoined the firm, and Citco executive Ermanno Untemaehrer continues on Richcourt's board.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Contrary to these claims, the management structure of the Richcourt Funds had changed significantly following the Richcourt Acquisition. Kiely and Turner had become directors of the Funds, and ultimate decision-making authority had been transferred to Fletcher by way of his position as Director and Chairman of RHI.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DeConza Dec'l at Exhs. 8 and 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The December 2008 and January 2009 Letters also misrepresented the expiration of the Funds' lines of credit. In explaining the decision to suspend redemption requests, the December 2008 Letters referred only to the \"expiration of\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   credit facility\" (DeConza Dec'l at Exh. 15) and the January 2009 Letters mentioned \"\n   <em>\n    uncertainty\n   </em>\n   regarding the fund credit line (DeConza Dec'l at Exh. 16). This language belied the undeniable fact that the Funds' lines of credit had expired months earlier and was not renewed. Stmt. of Facts at \u00b6 35-36; DeConza Dec'l, Exh. 5 at 77.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    New Year's Eve Transaction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Three of the Fletcher Funds, Arbitrage, Alpha and Leveraged, were placed into liquidation proceedings in 2012 in the Cayman Islands. Stmt. of Facts at \u00b6 58; DeConza Dec'l, Exh. 5 at 107-08. In June 2012, another Fletcher Fund, FILB, filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in this Court. Stmt. of Facts at \u00b6 62; DeConza Dec'l, Exh. 5 at 108,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Case No. 12-12796 (MKV) (June 29, 2012). The Court appointed a Chapter 11 Trustee in the FILB case, who demanded that Fletcher unwind an April 22, 2012 transfer of $2.2 million in cash from FILB to FII, a non-debtor Fletcher Fund. Stmt. of Facts at \u00b6 64; DeConza Dec'l, Exh. 5 at 122-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On December 31, 2012, while negotiations were ongoing between Fletcher and the FILB Trustee, Fletcher executed documents that in effect transferred $4 million from Soundview Elite to FII in exchange for an equity interest in FILB (which, as noted, had filed for chapter 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DeConza Dec'l at Exh. 18 (December 31 Sales Agreement); Exh. 23 Saunders Tr. 36:3-22; 74:6-75:12; 83:22-84:6 (Floyd Saunders Deposition). At that time, Fletcher was a board member of both FII and Soundview Elite, as well as SCM and FAM, the investment advisors and managers of Soundview Elite and FII, respectively.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DeConza Dec'l, Exh. 23, Saunders Tr. at 83:25-84:18; 84:19- 85:4. Fletcher signed the sales agreement for both sides of the transaction, as director of both FII and Soundview Elite. DeConza Dec'l at Exh. 18. Gerti Muho, a co-defendant in this adversary proceeding, also signed the sales agreement as the second director of Soundview Elite.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   RF Services, a Fletcher affiliate, determined the price that Soundview Elite would pay for the equity stake in FILB, a bankrupt investment vehicle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DeConza Dec'l. Exh. 13, Fletcher Tr. at 75:14-75:17; 85:5-85:8. Fletcher did not seek an independent appraisal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Fletcher and RF Services had had conversations with the FILB Trustee, who had given no indication that FILB's equity holders would receive any distribution in the bankruptcy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 76:19-77:3; 76:14-18. Despite this and in the face of outstanding unpaid redemption requests from Soundview's investors (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 77:4-11), Fletcher caused Soundview Elite to pay $4 million to FII for an equity stake in FILB. DeConza Dec'l. Exh. 19 at 4 (FILB Administrative Expense Claim).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   FII used the money transferred from Soundview Elite to repay the FILB Trustee the $2.2 million and also to pay legal fees, including Fletcher's personal legal fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DeConza Dec'l, Exh. 13, Fletcher Tr. at 80:4-82:21. FII additionally used a portion of the $4 million to pay directors fees to Fletcher and other members of his team.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 82:23-83:8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Bankruptcy\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On September 24, 2013, each of the Soundview Funds commenced a voluntary chapter 11 in this Court. Fletcher filed a proof of claim in the bankruptcy for payment of post-petition director's fees in the amount of $10,070.65, which the Trustee later moved to subordinate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Main Case, ECF No. 1033. On May 20, 2016, this Court entered an order [Main Case, ECF No. 1099] granting the Trustee's motion to subordinate Fletcher's claim and other insider claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Trustee brought twenty-eight adversary proceedings in the bankruptcy, many of which were consensually resolved, with settlements approved by the Court pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 9019. In this adversary proceeding, the Citco defendants and certain related individual defendants (the \"Citco Defendants\") moved to dismiss the Complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction and failure to state a claim [ECF Nos. 57-59, 61]. After extensive briefing and several days of oral argument, the Trustee settled with all Citco Defendants while the motions to dismiss were pending. The Court approved the settlements [ECF No. 161] and dismissed all claims against the Citco Defendants [ECF No. 164].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On August 31, 2017, this Court confirmed the Chapter 11 Trustee's plan (\"the Plan\") [ECF No. 1509]. The Plan provided for Fletcher's claim as follows: \"Class 5 (Insider Claims) ... will not receive or retain any property on account of their Claims or Interests and such Holders are deemed to have rejected the Plan pursuant to section 1126(g).\" Plan at \u00a7 5.2(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Jurisdiction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As an initial matter, in his Answer to the Trustee's Complaint in this\n   case (the \"Answer\") [ECF No. 18], Fletcher expressly denies all allegation in the Complaint (other than two specific allegations) and denies all conclusions, including the Trustee's assertion that this Court has jurisdiction over this matter and her consent to entry of final judgment by this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint [ECF No. 1] at \u00b6 91. He also demands a jury trial. Answer at 8. Against this backdrop and under governing law, and notwithstanding Fletcher's default on this Motion and his proof of claim filed against the Debtor, the Court rejects the Trustee's contention that Fletcher has implicitly consented to this Court's authority to enter final judgment in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Stern v.

At a hearing dated March 19, 2014, the Court denied the applications without prejudice [Main Case, ECF No. 242 at 31:7-12]. Fletcher subsequently filed proof of claim 8-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Later in the bankruptcy, after the Trustee began investigating the mismanagement of the Debtor by the Insiders and after this adversary proceeding was initiated, the Trustee filed a Notice of Objection to Insider Claims and Subordination of Such Claims [Main Case, ECF No. 851]. Fletcher and others failed to oppose the Notice, and the Trustee then moved to subordinate the Insider Claims [Main Case, ECF No. 1033]. This Court entered an order subordinating the Insider Claims, including the claim filed by Fletcher seeking director's fees [Main Case, ECF No. 1099]. On August 31, 2017, the Debtor's Plan of Reorganization [Main Case, ECF No. 1509] was confirmed pursuant to Sections 1107(a) and 1108 of the Bankruptcy Code, and provided for Fletcher's claim as follows: \"Class 5 (Insider Claims) ... will not receive or retain any property on account of their Claims or Interests and such Holders are deemed to have rejected the Plan pursuant to section 1126(g).\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plan at \u00a7 5.2(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Fletcher's claim has effectively been disallowed.

Rather, the Trustee's theory of damages, supported by the declaration of its expert, Mr. Varga, is based on the aggregate losses suffered by the Richcourt Fund as a result of Fletcher's continued mismanagement of the Funds from the date of the Richcourt Acquisition in 2008 through the date of filing of bankruptcy in 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   First, by failing to inform investors of the change in the Fund's management following the Acquisition, Fletcher prevented investors from considering the option of withdrawing their investments, which they had knowingly entrusted to only Citco.

The Trustee's theory of damages, supported by the Varga affidavit, is that a prudent manager, facing mounting redemption requests from investors in late 2008 and early 2009 and insufficient credit to satisfy the redemptions, would have sought to liquidate the Funds to avoid further losses. Instead, in an effort to maintain the Funds and preserve his management fees Fletcher created a special purpose vehicle that effectively forced investors to accept periodic payments instead of the entire redemption request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stmt. of Facts at \u00b6 52-57; Varga Dec'l at \u00b6 8-9.
