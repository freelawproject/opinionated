Thereafter, he commenced this adversary proceeding seeking to discharge his student loan debt. Pursuant to the Court's individual practice rules, in advance of the trial, the Parties submitted a proposed Pre-Trial Order, which the Court entered on August 7, 2018. [ECF No. 26]. The Pre-Trial Order include,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the facts to which the parties stipulated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mr. Lozada stipulated pre-trial to facts that seriously called into question his ability to demonstrate undue hardship. Nevertheless, the Court accepted testimony and documentary evidence at trial to give Mr. Lozada the opportunity to supplement the seemingly conclusive stipulated facts. The Court conducted a trial on August 21, 2018, at which the Court received evidence and heard argument from the parties. Thereafter, the Parties submitted post-trial briefs. Def.'s Post-Trial Brief [ECF No. 30]; Pl.'s Post-Trial Brief [ECF No. 31].\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The relevant facts are, for the most part, stipulated and are not otherwise in significant dispute.

Fact \u00b6\u00b6 1-43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    EVIDENCE PRESENTED AT TRIAL\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   At trial, the Court heard the testimony of two witnesses and received 17 exhibits into evidence. Plaintiff testified at trial, but called no other fact witness and no expert witnesses. [Tr. 11:2-112:7].\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECMC cross-examined Plaintiff on all relevant topics. After Plaintiff rested, Education Credit Management Corporation called Jesse Ogren (\"\n   <em>\n    Ogren\n   </em>\n   \"), a vocational expert, to offer an opinion on Mr. Lozada's employment prospects. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 114:2-131:25].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   While the Court found Mr. Lozada earnest and credible, his testimony did not, in any significant measure, supplement the facts to which he had stipulated pre-trial, which were seemingly fatal to his claim of undue hardship. Plaintiff testified at trial regarding his educational background and employment history [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 12:23-13:14], his student loan debt [\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. 16:10-19:4], his finances [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 46:1-48:18], and his medical condition [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 57:13-59:6].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Mr. Lozada earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from City College. Pre-Trial Order. [Tr. 13:14-14:8];\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pre-Trial Order [ECF No. 26], Stip. Fact \u00b6 14. While working full time, when he was thirty-eight years-old, Mr. Lozada enrolled at Brooklyn Law School. [Tr. 14:22-15:6];\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pre-Trial Order Pre-Trial Order [ECF No. 26], Stip. Fact \u00b6 38. He aspired to be a lawyer because, growing up, he encountered \"a lot of injustices\" and \"saw a lot of people hurting because they either didn't understand the legal system or were unable to ... get a lawyer.\" [Tr. 14:10-21]. Mr. Lozada graduated from law school in 1989 [Tr. 17:12-14], but did not pass the bar exam on his first attempt. [Tr. 15:8-19]. He did not sit for the bar exam again, and as a result was not admitted to practice law. [Tr. 15:8-16:1]. Despite having a law degree, Mr. Lozado never sought employment in a law-related field or otherwise made professional use of his legal education.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Mr. Lozada has spent his career working in social services and in the not-for-profit sector. [\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Tr. 12:23-13:14]. Primarily, Mr. Lozada worked with the Central Board of Education to implement substance abuse prevention programs throughout the city. [Tr. 16:3-11]. He explained that he found it difficult to maintain steady employment because the funding for his employment projects would expire and not be renewed. [Tr. 18:21-23]. Mr. Lozada's most recent employment ended in December 2014 when, as a result of a change in leadership, Prison Ministries, the non-profit for which he worked, charted a \"new direction\" and determined that Mr. Lozada did not \"fit into what they were looking for.\" [Tr. 36:4-16].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Plaintiff also testified, in contradiction to what he stipulated pre-trial, that he searched for employment during most of 2015. [Tr. 96:8-17]. Plaintiff claims that he submitted his resume to at least 100 online job listings throughout 2015 [Tr. 96:8-17], but was unsuccessful in finding employment. [Tr. 96:8-17]. Somewhere around 2015, Mr. Lozada and his wife used their \"retirement fund of about $90,000\" in an unsuccessful attempt to \"start a daycare center.\" [Tr. 39:5-14]\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   So we started doing all the research and putting together a business plan and so forth and eventually we were able to submit an application to the city to start a daycare center and we took that money and put it into - into that business, trying to start that business. Daycare businesses in the city, as I came to know, a very complicated matter. And\n   what happened was, we had to actually rent the place, have the place set up for them to look and see if it met the requirement before they could - they would issue a permit so we could start the business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   They told me originally it would take three months. It took over a year. In the span of that year, we were paying rent because we had to get the place in order for even them to consider giving us a permit .... And what happened in the span of that time is that all the seed money that we had set aside for that got all eaten up.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   So, by the time they were ready to issue us a permit, we had no more money, so we couldn't proceed.... I mean, it was a nightmare dealing with that process. So, our expectation were if we get a business going, that will provide enough income not just to pay the student loan but for us to be able to live and, you know, have a future. And it just wasn't to be.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   [Tr. 39:15-40:15].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Mr. Lozada testified that he is no longer seeking employment, [Tr. 83:7-8], and now considers himself retired. [Tr. 83:23-24];\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Complaint [ECF No. 1], \u00b6\u00b6 15, 23 (retired as of 2014); Pre-Trial Order [ECF No. 26], Stip. Fact \u00b6 9. Mr. Lozada testified that despite working full time at the Board of Education while in law school, he could only afford tuition by taking out student loans. [Tr. 14:24-15:19]. When he graduated in 1989, Mr. Lozada owed about $40,000 in student loan debt. [Tr. 17:1-10]. Starting in 1990, Mr. Lozada paid $500 a month towards his student loan, and he continued to make payments \"to about 1994.\" [Tr. 17:10-24]. Over the course of the next twenty years, Mr. Lozada consolidated his loans several times, took out and consolidated a Parent Plus loan for his son to attend St. John's University, and continued to pay the loan intermittently when he was employed. [\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. 17:10-35:18].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   At trial, Mr. Lozada testified that he applied several times for an income-based repayment plan, but his loan servicer told him he did not qualify for such a plan \"and they told [Mr. Lozada] they were giving [him] - they were rolling it over, just rolling it over [as forbearances and deferments.]\" [\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. 91:1-91:24]. Mr. Lozada's loan servicer put the loans into forbearance for five years beginning in 1994. [Tr. 18:20-20:14]. Between April 2005 and May 2017, Mr. Lozada received either a deferment or a forbearance for his loans for a total of 80 months. Pre-Trial Order [ECF No. 26], Stip. Fact \u00b6\u00b6 25-27. Mr. Lozada has not made a payment on the loan since 2015. [Tr. 35:6-18].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Mr. Lozada stipulated that he is eligible to enter the William D. Ford Direct Loan Consolidation Program and that under this program his monthly payment under the Income Contingent Repayment Program would be $826.15 for 300 months. [Tr. 108:14-21];\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pre-Trial Order [ECF No. 26], Stip. Fact \u00b6\u00b6 39, 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Mr. Lozada's sole source of income is $1,296.00 in monthly benefits from Social Security. [Tr. 41:8-17]; [Rafael Lozada Social Security Benefit Statement, PX A].\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   His wife contributes $4,685 a month to the household's income. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX C and D]. Plaintiff and his wife have a combined monthly income of no less than $5,942 per month. [Tr. 101:4-16];\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pre-Trial Order [ECF No. 26], Stip. Fact \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Mr. Lozada's testimony demonstrated that he is a charitable man, who regularly\n   tithes, apportioning at least 10% of his income to his church. [\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr.47:23-48:9]. When he can give more, or when a community member is in need, he and his wife donate additional amounts. [Tr. 79:3-80:15]. In total, Mr. Lozada and his wife donated over $100,000 in the five years leading up to bankruptcy. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 79:3-80:1]; Pre-Trial Order [ECF No. 26], Stip. Fact \u00b6 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Mr. Lozada testified that his monthly household expenses amount to $4,499. [Tr. 99:7-100:16]. Approximately $100 of this amount is attributable to out-of-pocket medical expenses. [Tr. 47:8-12]. As Mr. Lozada explained, he suffers pain daily from doing routine activities, has undergone cataract surgery, and takes various medications. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 58:2-60:22]. Mr. Lozada alleges that his health issues are among the causes that prevent him from working. [Tr. 83:9-14]. He, did not, however, offer any admissible medical records or otherwise call any treating physicians or medical experts with respect to his condition, diagnosis, or his prognosis. [Tr. 60:13-61:5].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   ECMC called Ogren, a certified educational rehab counselor and licensed professional counselor, who opined that he believes Plaintiff should be able to find employment. Ogren testified that he was able to find job listings for which Mr. Lozada is qualified and which he may be able to attain. [Tr. 123:6-19]. These jobs offered a salary of about $40,000. [Tr. 123:6-19]. On cross examination Ogren acknowledged that he has never worked with someone with Mr. Lozada's unique work background, and he could not recall if he has ever successfully placed a job seeker who is 65 or older.

While the Court respects Mr. Lozada's commitment to charity, the reality is that when he elects to tithe rather than pay his nondischargeable debt, he is making donations using someone else's money. As such, the Court, in evaluating the first\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   prong will consider Mr. Lozada's charitable donations totaling over $100,000 in the five years preceding his bankruptcy,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Joint Pre-Trial Order [ECF No. 26], Stip. Fact \u00b6\u00b6 32, 33, in the context of his overall financial condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In addition to his charitable contributions, Mr. Lozada testified that he spends approximately $4,499 on monthly expenses. [Tr., 99:7-100:16]. Plaintiff approximated the breakdown of his expenses as following:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-100\">Rent $ 2500 Electric $ 130 Gas $ 40 Water $ 15 Cable $ 100 Cell phone $ 100 Food and Supplies $ 500 Clothing and Laundry $ 100 Personal care $ 100 Medical out of pocket $ 100 Transportation $ 200 Entertainment $ 100 Car Loan $ 314 Car Insurance $ 200</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   [Tr., 99:7-100-25].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   As stipulated pre-trial, Mr. Lozada's monthly household income is not less than $5,942. Pre-Trial Order [ECF No. 26], Stip. Fact \u00b6 38. This amount is predominately attributable to Mr. Lozada's wife who earns $3,466 from her pension and another $1,219 from social security. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Exs. C and D]. It is well established \"that total household income, including that of a non-debtor spouse, live-in companion, life partner and contributing co-habitant, must be considered in conducting this minimal standard of living analysis, as well as its relevance in generally determining undue hardship under the Bankruptcy Code.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <em>\n    In re Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1091017\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/373/241/#p248\">\n    373 B.R. 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 248 (W.D.N.Y. 2007) (collecting cases);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re French\n   </em>\n   , No. 04-03060,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%202583646\">\n    2006 WL 2583646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. Aug. 31, 2006). Accordingly, crediting Mr. Lozada's $4,499 estimation at trial of his expenses, Mr. Lozada has at least $1,400 a month in surplus income that he can apply towards paying his student loans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Moreover, the Court views some of Mr. Lozada's expenses as excessive in light of the sacrifice expected of an individual obligated to repay his student loan obligation. Specifically, Mr. Lozada's expenses with respect to rent, food, transportation, entertainment, and charitable donations are excessive under the circumstances. Earlier this year Mr. Lozada and his wife moved from an apartment in the Bronx to an apartment in Stamford, Connecticut. [Tr. 65:10-66:7]. Mr. Lozada's move significantly increased his expenses. While living in the Bronx he paid $867 a month for rent. [Tr. 66:22-24]. Now, however, he pays $2,500 a month for rent, [Tr. 99:8-11], tripling his rent obligations. The Court is sympathetic to the fact that, due to Mrs. Lozada's medical condition, Mr. Lozada and his wife had to relocate from the Bronx apartment to an apartment building with a reliable elevator. [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 67:1-12]. Nevertheless, to suggest that there were no suitable homes available at a lower rent strains credulity. Moreover, moving from the Bronx to Stamford, Connecticut, undoubtedly increased the need for Debtor to own (and use) a car, totaling $514 a month in expenses, in addition to the $200 he attributed to transportation during his testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Mr. and Mrs. Lozada spend approximately $500 a month on food because they frequently dine out. [Tr. 76:22-77:7]. A debtor is not required to abstain entirely from dining out to satisfy the first prong of the\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   test, but the Plaintiff's practice of frequently dining out is problematic. This is made clear by the fact that the government estimates that the average cost of food for a similarly situated family of two, in July 2018, was $366.10 under a Thrifty plan or $472.70 under a Low-cost plan. U.S. DEP'T OF AGRICULTURE. COST OF FOOD AT HOME AT FOUR LEVELS, U.S. AVERAGE, JULY 2018\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   https://www.cnpp.usda.gov/sites/default/files/CostofFoodJul2018.pdf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The $500 a month Mr. Lozada allocates towards food must be considered with Mr. Lozada's other expenses. Mr. Lozada estimated at trial that he spends $100 a month on \"entertainment,\" the same amount that he attributes to out of pocket medical expenses. As explained above, Mr. Lozada donates a significant amount to religious organizations and charities. Mr. Lozada gives his granddaughter a weekly allowance of between $25 and $30, Pre-Trial Order [ECF No. 26], Stip. Fact \u00b6 29, and he provides money to adult children even though they are not his dependents. Pre-Trial Order [ECF No. 26], Stip. Fact \u00b6 30. In 2016 he paid $1,100 a month to rent an apartment in Florida while he maintained a home in New York, [Tr. 71:9-19], he has taken multiple trips to Puerto Rico to visit his father, and in 2014 Mr. Lozada went on a family vacation to Virginia Beach. [Tr. 85:21-86:14].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In short, Mr. Lozada enjoys a sizable monthly surplus. His expenditures indicate that he lives a comfortable lifestyle and the record does not reveal any efforts to minimize discretionary expenses.

And yet, Mr. Lozada confirmed that he is not currently seeking employment. [Tr. 83:7-8].

While his decision to work in social services is laudable and the Court commends him for his sense of duty to serve, Mr. Lozada benefitted from his student loans and he is obligated to repay his debt. The unfortunate truth is that in the face of significant debt, Mr. Lozada limited his income and his prospects for finding work.

Mr. Lozada approached the entity holding his loans, explained his situation, and asked for options. [Tr. 19:12-16]. As a result, Mr. Lozada's obtained a forbearance. [Tr. 19:12-23].

If Mr. Lozada entered into the Ford Program, his monthly payment under the Income Contingent Repayment Program would be $826.15 for 300 months. Pre-Trial Order [ECF No. 26], Stip. Fact \u00b6 40.

A debtor's decision to forgo enrolling in an income-based repayment plan is not, in and of itself, fatal to a finding of good faith, but is one of many factors to be considered when evaluating the debtor's good faith.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    In re Benjumen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4094824\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/408/9/#p16\">\n    408 B.R. 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 24 (Bankr.

He testified that his understanding is that he can either pay the amount the company is requesting, and if he does not \"the recourse would be for them to, I guess, get a judgment against my Social Security check and take a certain percentage of that check.\" [Tr. 106:17-22]. Mr. Lozada provided sincere and emotional testimony at trial, explaining that he brought this case to go \"through a process [for] some kind of solution\" and that he did not \"ever want to give the impression that [he] just [does not] care or ....\" [Tr. 107:6-14].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   However, the Court cannot ignore that Mr. Lozada has received annual tax refunds of $2,676, $3,852, $5,037, and $4,609 for the years 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2016 respectively, Pre-Trial Order [ECF No. 26], Stip. Fact \u00b6 35, but did not use any of these funds to pay down his student loan debt. Pre-Trial Order [ECF No. 26], Stip. Fact \u00b6 36. Similarly, Mr. Lozada did not use any of the $30,000 he inherited in\n   2015 towards repaying his student loan debt. Pre-Trial Order [ECF No. 26], Stip. Fact \u00b6 37. And as discussed above, Mr. Lozada has contributed more than $100,000 to charity in recent years while neglecting his loan obligations. If Mr. Lozada had used the money from his tax refunds, his inheritance, and his charitable contributions\n   <em>\n    solely from the 5 years preceding his bankruptcy filing\n   </em>\n   , he could have paid down close to half of his $309,694.24 student loan debt as of the date he filed for bankruptcy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 1], Schedule E/F. This would have had a significant impact, particularly in light of the fact that the 8.25% annual interest on his loan compounds on a daily-basis. \"Where a debtor has had the opportunity to repay an amount, but did not; where '[n]o factors beyond [the] [d]ebtor's reasonable control precluding repayment have been suggested,' and where the debtor simply ignores his obligation, such conduct does not satisfy the third prong of the\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   test.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Hixson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3756748\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/450/9/#p22\">\n    450 B.R. 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 22-23 (Bankr.

The factual record clearly demonstrates that Mr. Lozada did not make an effort to maximize his income to repay his student loan debt. Similarly, the record reflects that he did not minimize his expenses or use his excess income to repay his student loan debt. Mr. Lozada's failure to consider enrolling in an income-based repayment plan since his retirement, particularly when viewed in the context of his lack of effort to seek employment or to minimize his expenses, weighs heavily against a finding of good faith.
