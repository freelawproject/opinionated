While attending Butler, Roth obtained a student loan in the amount of $32,800 from Defendant Sallie Mae Bank (\"Sallie Mae\"). Roth's promissory note with Sallie Mae contained an arbitration provision that allowed either party to elect to arbitrate any claim arising under the note, including \"the imposition or collection of principal, interest, attorneys' fees, collection costs or other fees or charges relating to this Note[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Roth filed a chapter 7 bankruptcy and scheduled a debt to Sallie Mae in the amount of $36,927.88. Roth received a discharge and his case was closed. Roth later moved to reopen his case and filed\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff Matthew Roth's Amended Complaint Regarding Dischargeability of \"Private\" Student Loans\n   </em>\n   (the \"Amended Complaint\"), seeking to discharge his student loan debt to Sallie Mae (among other lenders) pursuant to 11 U.S.C \u00a7 523(a)(8). Specifically, Roth alleges that his loan with Sallie Mae is not a \"qualified educational loan\" and, alternatively, that the loan debt should be discharged as its repayment constitutes an undue hardship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In lieu of an answer Sallie Mae filed its\n   <em>\n    Motion to Compel Arbitration and Dismiss or Stay Pending Arbitration\n   </em>\n   (the \"Motion to Compel\"). In the Motion to Compel, Sallie Mae argues that the Court should compel arbitration of the Amended Complaint in compliance with the Federal Arbitration Act (the \"FAA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 3, and dismiss the claims against Sallie Mae for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), made applicable to this proceeding pursuant to Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7012. Alternatively, Sallie Mae asks the Court to stay Roth's claims as to Sallie Mae to allow an arbitrator to decide the issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Roth counters by arguing that the promissory note's arbitration provisions are critically vague and unenforceable. Roth further argues that the Court should deny arbitration because the proceeding involves a core matter and that a debtor's discharge is a matter of paramount concern for the bankruptcy court. For the purposes of this opinion, the Court will assume that the promissory note's arbitration provision is clear and enforceable, focusing instead on the question of whether the Roth's claims against Sallie Mae should be subject to arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Roth and Sallie Mae contractually agreed to arbitrate issues regarding claims relating to the promissory note.

There, the Supreme Court was asked to determine if the Fair Labor Standards Act and the National Labor Relations Act overrode an arbitration agreement. When reviewing an alleged conflict between the FAA on the one hand and the FLSA and NLRA on the other, the Supreme Court noted that the party asserting a conflict \"bears a heaving burden\n   of showing \"a clearly expressed congressional intention' that such a result should follow\" and that there is a \" 'stron[g] presum[ption]' that repeals by implication are 'disfavored' and that 'Congress will specifically address' preexisting law when it wishes to suspend its normal operations in a later statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1624 (citations omitted).

Acknowledging that the FAA mandated the enforcement of arbitration agreements, the Supreme Court held that \"[l]ike any statutory directive, the Arbitration Act's mandate may be overridden by a contrary congressional command.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212026\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/220/#p226\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212026\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/220/#p226\">\n    at 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6212026\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/220/#p226\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

There, the debtor sought to avoid arbitration of claims under \u00a7\u00a7 523(a)(8) and 524(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code. The court enforced the arbitration provision at issue, reasoning that there was no inherent conflict with the Bankruptcy Code as: (1) the debtor had already received a discharge; (2) arbitration would not interfere or affect distribution of the estate or an ongoing reorganization; (3) there was no interference with the preservation of estate assets or the determination of the priority of claims; and (4) the debtor was asserting claims on behalf of a class action.\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272569\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/564/770/#p777\">\n    564 B.R. at 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Sallie Mae points out that Roth has received his discharge, that this is a chapter 7 liquidation with no reorganization, and that resolution of the claim will not affect estate assets. This, Sallie Mae posits, shows there is no conflict with the Bankruptcy Code and that the arbitration provision should be enforced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Roth counters by arguing that the Court should follow the reasoning employed in\n   <em>\n    Golden\n   </em>\n   and find an inherent conflict exists. Similar to\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , the court in\n   <em>\n    Golden\n   </em>\n   had to determine whether claims brought under \u00a7\u00a7 523(a)(8) and 524 of the Bankruptcy Code should be subject to arbitration. Unlike\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , the court in\n   <em>\n    Golden\n   </em>\n   found that arbitrating claims under those sections did create in inherent conflict with the Bankruptcy Code because: (1) the fundamental purpose of bankruptcy law was to give debtors a fresh start and that purpose was impeded by arbitrating potential violations of discharge; and (2) Congress specifically allowed bankruptcy courts the power to enforce their own orders and arbitrating violations of the discharge injunction impeded that goal.\n   <em>\n    Golden\n   </em>\n   , 587 B.R. at 427-28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court, having considered the issue, believes that\n   <em>\n    Golden\n   </em>\n   contains the sounder reasoning of the two cases put forth by the parties.

E.D.N.Y. 2014) (dischargeability of debt is an essential function of bankruptcy courts). Really it is more than inherent conflict. Allowing arbitration of dischargeability - the central purpose of the Bankruptcy Code according to\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   - would effectively allow parties to contractually overrule the application of federal bankruptcy law. Bankruptcy without the discharge is like a car without an engine; a useful tool rendered ineffective. The Court is unwilling to do that, and finds that the arbitration of dischargeability issues creates an inherent conflict with the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Another pillar of federal bankruptcy law is Congress' intention to centralize disputes about a debtor's legal obligations for prompt and efficient resolution in bankruptcy courts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moses\n   </em>\n   , 781 F.3d at 72\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    White Mountain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9014374,9019487\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/403/164/\">\n    403 F.3d at 169-170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Were Sallie Mae to prevail, Roth's claims against it would be decided by an arbitrator. However, Roth's claims against the other two defendants would be decided in this proceeding. Roth would have to argue undue hardship on the same set of facts in two forums, incur the cost of two separate proceedings, and face potentially different outcomes were the arbitrator and the Court to rule differently. This dual forum litigation would be inefficient, costly, and time consuming.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Court finds that enforcing the arbitration of the claims presented by Roth would be inconsistent with the Bankruptcy Code's purpose of centralizing litigation before a bankruptcy court for efficient resolution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2597245\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/354/591/#p600\">\n    354 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   603 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moses\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076021,4116429\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/63/\">\n    781 F.3d at 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding arbitration of a core claim is an inherent conflict with the purposes of the Bankruptcy Code).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court finds it has jurisdiction over Roth's claims against Sallie Mae. Furthermore, the Court declines to enforce the arbitration agreement between Sallie Mae and Roth or stay this proceeding to allow such arbitration to go forward. The Court does so because enforcement in this case would create an inherent conflict with the Bankruptcy Code's fundamental policies of affording debtors a fresh start and centralizing disputes about a debtor's obligations for efficient resolution. The Court therefore SUSTAINS Roth's objection and DENIES the Motion to Compel in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Having ruled on the Motion to Compel, the Court hereby dissolves the stay on all pending discovery imposed by the Court's Order dated September 7, 2018.
