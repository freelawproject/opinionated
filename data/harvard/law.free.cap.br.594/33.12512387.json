No. 457]\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (the \"Omnibus Motion\"), filed by the defendants listed on\n   <em>\n    Exhibit A\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   annexed hereto (collectively, the \"Defendants\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   seeking transfer of the adversary proceedings set forth on\n   <em>\n    Exhibit A\n   </em>\n   to the district courts specified therein. In addition to the Omnibus Motion, certain Defendants filed (i) individual motions to address issues unique to such Defendants (the \"Supplemental Motions\" and, together with the Omnibus Motion, the \"Motions\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (ii) an affidavit or declaration (the \"Individual Defendant Declarations\"), each as listed herein. On October 6, 2017, in opposition to the Motions, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (\"LBHI\") filed its Memorandum of Law of Plaintiff Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in Opposition to Certain Defendants' Motions to Transfer Venue [Dkt. No. 522] (the \"Opposition\"), together with the Declaration of John Baker [Dkt. No. 522-2] and the Declaration of Michael A. Rollin [Dkt. No. 522-3] (the \"Rollin Decl.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court assumes familiarity with the general background and history of the LBHI chapter 11 cases; this Decision will provide limited background facts pertinent to the Motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Prior to its bankruptcy, LBHI, directly or through its affiliates, including Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB (\"LBB\"), engaged in the purchase and sale of mortgage loans. LBHI arranged directly or through affiliates such as LBB to purchase mortgage loans from loan originators and other third parties (the \"Sellers\") including the Defendants; it then packaged such loans for securitization or sale to other third parties. In transactions involving the Defendants, the Defendants sold the mortgage loans to LBB (which thereafter assigned its rights\n   thereunder to LBHI)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   pursuant to agreements (the \"Agreements\") in which, among other things, the Defendants contractually agreed to indemnify LBB and hold it harmless from liabilities or losses it might incur (including liabilities to third parties) as a result of breaches of the representations and warranties in the Agreements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Federal National Mortgage Association (\"Fannie Mae\") and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\"Freddie Mac,\" and, together with Fannie Mae, the \"GSEs\") were two subsequent purchasers of mortgage loans from LBHI. On September 15, 2008, LBHI and certain of its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, the \"Debtors\") filed voluntary chapter 11 cases in this Court. In September 2009, both GSEs filed proofs of claim against LBHI (collectively, the \"GSE Claims\"), asserting breaches of representations, warranties, or covenants in numerous sale agreements for loans they had acquired from LBHI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The GSE Claims asserted claims for, among other things, \"alleged indemnity/reimbursement obligations\" and \"indemnity claims\" arising from the sale of mortgage loans to the GSEs, including mortgage loans originated by and purchased from the Defendants and ultimately sold to the GSEs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its review of the GSE Claims, LBHI determined that certain loans, including those brokered or sold by Defendants, contained various defects that violated the representations, warranties, and covenants under the Agreements. Lehman has alleged that the representations, warranties, and covenants in the sale agreements between the GSEs and LBHI were co-extensive with those in the Agreements between LBB and the Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, Lehman asserts that Defendants' breaches, acts, and omissions caused LBHI to incur liability to the GSEs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On December 6, 2011, this Court confirmed the Modified Third Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of LBHI and Its Affiliated Debtors (the \"Plan\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order Confirming Plan [Case No. 08-13555, Dkt. No. 23023] (the \"Confirmation Order\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In January 2014, LBHI settled its disputes with the GSEs regarding the allowance of the GSE Claims (the \"GSE Settlements\"). The Court approved the GSE Settlements by Orders dated January 31, 2014 and February 19, 2014 (the \"GSE Settlement Orders\") [Case No. 08-13555, Dkt. Nos. 42420, 42918]. Pursuant to the Fannie Settlement, Fannie Mae received an allowed claim for $2.15 billion in LBHI Class 7 under the Plan, and, pursuant to the Freddie Settlement, Freddie Mac received\n   a one-time cash payment of $767 million from LBHI, each in settlement of all claims and disputes between the parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Subsequently, the Plan Administrator identified over 11,000 loans and over 3,000 potential counterparties against which LBHI allegedly held third-party contractual claims for indemnification and/or reimbursement by virtue of the GSE Settlements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   To manage this volume of indemnification claims, the Court authorized the Plan Administrator to implement a pre-litigation mediation protocol with the Sellers from which it sought indemnification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Alternative Dispute Resolution Procedures Order for Indemnification Claims of The Debtors Against Mortgage Loan Sellers, dated June 24, 2014 [Case No. 08-13555, Dkt. No. 45277].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   To further facilitate its pursuit of recoveries from those Sellers with whom mediation was unsuccessful, the Plan Administrator initiated adversary proceedings in this Court, including those at issue here, against more than one hundred Sellers (including the Defendants) in tandem with six previously-filed adversary actions (collectively, the \"Adversary Proceedings\"). Pursuant to the CMO, the Adversary Proceedings have a central docket for court filings (Adv. Pro. No. 16-01019) and have been coordinated for administrative purposes, including scheduling motions and discovery procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   By the complaints filed in the Adversary Proceedings, the allegations of which are substantially identical across all Defendants (collectively, the \"Complaints\"), LBHI claims that each of the Defendants breached its obligations under the Agreements by selling or submitting defective mortgage loans into LBHI's loan sale and securitization channels, and, thus, LBHI has a third-party indemnification claim against each Defendant for LBHI's liability to the GSEs (collectively, the \"Indemnification Claims\"). Specifically, the Complaints allege that it was Defendants' breaches of the representations, warranties, and/or covenants under the Agreements that caused LBHI to have to compensate the GSEs pursuant to agreements between LBHI and the GSEs that contained representations, warranties, and/or covenants co-extensive with those contained in the Agreements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The CMO provides a time frame for (i) the filing of so-called threshold motions such as motions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b) based on venue, jurisdiction, and/or failure to state a claim and (ii) objections to such motions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   On\n   March 31, 2017, certain defendants in the Adversary Proceedings filed an omnibus motion to dismiss the Complaints filed against such defendants pursuant to (i) Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and (ii) Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(3) for improper venue [Dkt. No. 413] (the \"Motion to Dismiss\"). By Memorandum Decision and Order dated August 13, 2018 [Dkt. No. 606], this Court denied the Motion to Dismiss, finding that this Court has subject matter jurisdiction over each of the Adversary Proceedings and that venue in this Court is proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   By the Omnibus Motion seeking to transfer venue of the Adversary Proceedings against each of the Defendants listed on Exhibit A, Defendants assert that \"even if this Court finds that venue is proper, the Court should still exercise its discretion to transfer the cases filed against the ... Defendants to more appropriate venues.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The CMO provides a time frame for the filing of so-called threshold motions such as motions (i) under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b) based on lack of personal jurisdiction, improper process, and/or insufficient service of process and/or (ii) under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   seeking transfer of venue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   As permitted by the CMO, certain Defendants filed letters requesting a pre-motion conferences, and this Court held an omnibus conference on May 11, 2017 to address such letters. On June 6, 2017, the Court entered that certain Order Setting Briefing Schedule for Motions to Transfer Venue [Dkt. No. 451] setting forth the time and manner for briefing on motions to transfer venue, which order the parties have followed. The Court heard oral argument on the Motions on June 12, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     GENERAL DISCUSSION APPLICABLE TO ALL MOVING DEFENDANTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Applicable Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Section 1334(b) of title 28 of the United States Code provides that federal courts \"shall have original but not exclusive jurisdiction of all civil proceedings arising under title 11, or arising in or related to cases under title 11.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). The transfer of venue of a case or proceeding under title 11 is governed by section 1412 of title 28 of the United States Code, which provides that \"[a] district court may transfer a case or proceeding under title 11 to a district court for another district, in the interest of justice or for the convenience of the parties.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201412\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Most courts in this District have interpreted the terms of section 1412 to apply only to core bankruptcy proceedings because, unlike section 1334(b), the language of section 1412 notably does not reference proceedings \"related to\" title 11; accordingly, when evaluating whether a transfer of venue is appropriate for a non-core adversary proceeding \"related to\" a case under title 11, such courts have applied section 1404(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ICICI Bank Ltd. v.

Summary of the Parties' Positions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   By the Motions, Defendants seek to transfer the venue of each Adversary Proceeding listed on Exhibit A to the respective district court listed on Exhibit A.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants contend that the convenience of the parties is the single most important factor in determining whether to transfer venue, and that the convenience of the parties weighs heavily in their favor because, for each Adversary Proceeding at issue here, the majority of the parties, the non-party witnesses (who cannot be compelled to testify at trial in this District), and the documentary evidence to be utilized at trial is located outside of New York.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, the Defendants argue that the locus of operative facts in each of the Adversary Proceedings did not arise in the Southern District of New York because none of the significant events material to the asserted claims occurred in New York.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the Defendants assert that there is little material connection between the operative facts and this forum, Defendants assert that the plaintiff's choice of forum should be entitled to no deference here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants further submit that each individual Defendant's case is predicated on different facts and will require different witnesses at trial; thus, even though the Adversary Proceedings all relate to similar causes of action, each case must be brought separately; therefore, there is little benefit to coordination in the\n   same forum.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As more specifically discussed below, for the reasons set forth in the Supplemental Motions and in the supporting declarations filed by the Defendants, each Defendant argues that its circumstances are unique and that an equitable weighing of the Transfer Factors supports transferring venue of its respective Adversary Proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   By its Opposition, LBHI contends that the Transfer Factors weigh in favor of maintaining venue in this District because the interest of justice, which LBHI asserts is the most important consideration in determining whether to transfer venue, strongly favors adjudicating all of the Adversary Proceedings in one forum \"to avoid duplicative litigation, save time and expense for parties and witnesses, and avert inconsistent results.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   LBHI argues that this Court is \"intimately familiar\" with the approximately one hundred Adversary Proceedings asserting Indemnification Claims brought by LBHI in this Court, all of which involve common issues of fact and law. Since approximately two-thirds of the defendants in such Adversary Proceedings (approximately 67 proceedings) have not sought transfer, this Court will continue to preside over the majority of the Adversary Proceedings even if the Motions are granted. Accordingly, transferring one-third of the proceedings - the 32 Adversary Proceedings filed against the Defendant movants here - to approximately 20 different courts around the country would disrupt the efficiencies created by centralizing the proceedings in this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   LBHI further contends that the Defendants must overcome the presumption in favor of the plaintiff's choice of forum and the presumption in favor of the district where the bankruptcy is pending, and they have failed to do. Because the Defendants have not met their burden to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that transfer of any of the Adversary Proceedings is warranted, LBHI requests that the Motions be denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Here, the interest of justice weighs heavily in favor of denial of the Motions with respect to each Adversary Proceeding at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Were the Court to grant the Motions, the transfer of 32 Adversary Proceedings to approximately twenty different districts around the country would disrupt the efficiencies achieved by having centralized proceedings in this Court. Moreover, as noted by LBHI in its Opposition, defendants in approximately 67 of the approximately 100 Adversary Proceedings do not seek to transfer venue; therefore, this Court will continue to preside over the majority of LBHI's actions seeking indemnification from such Sellers even if it were to grant the Motions. Judicial economy would not be served by having twenty different courts adjudicating common issues of law. The ensuing litigations would be duplicative and would inevitably result in inconsistent rulings. Such a scenario would entail an enormous waste of judicial and party resources. This Court has previously emphasized during the initial stages of the Adversary Proceedings (in which numerous conferences and hearings have been held over the past few years) that consolidated proceedings are appropriate to conserve the resources of the Court and the parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   While the Court recognizes that each Adversary Proceeding entails distinct issues of fact, LBHI's allegations are substantially identical across Defendants. Most of the allegations of breach of representations and warranties contained in the Complaints stem from the same document, the Seller's Guide. Accordingly, common issues of law exist across the Adversary Proceedings, a factor which also weighs in favor of adjudication of all of the proceedings before one court. Resources on all sides would be wasted by requiring additional courts to tackle the learning curve required for these Adversary Proceedings. This Court, with its extensive familiarity with the Lehman chapter 11 cases and, specifically, the legal issues surrounding the Indemnification Claims asserted in each of the Adversary Proceedings, is in the best position to resolve matters in each of the Adversary Proceedings at this time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Significantly, numerous other federal courts facing litigation regarding the Indemnification Claims have observed that such litigation is best resolved in this Court. In each of these actions, a federal court outside New York was confronted with an action brought by one or more of the Sellers against LBHI seeking a declaratory judgment that the Indemnification Claims are barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Each of these courts dismissed the declaratory judgment action filed by such Sellers, acknowledging this Court's familiarity with LBHI's chapter\n   11 proceedings and emphasizing the judicial efficiencies which would be gained by centralizing litigation concerning the Indemnification Claims in this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    iFreedom Direct Corp. v.

The Adversary Proceedings have been pending before this Court since their inception, and, as one court has recognized explicitly, transfer of certain of these actions at this time would result in a waste of judicial resources by duplicating work that has already been done.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Court has approved the GSE Settlements, entered the ADR Order, and ruled on substantive motions to dismiss in certain of the Adversary Proceedings with respect to (i) the statute of limitations (including interpreting portions of the Agreements and the Seller's Guide); (ii) subject matter jurisdiction; and (iii) improper venue. It is already immersed in the common issues of law and fact central to the actions. In addition, this Court has held numerous conferences and hearings in the Adversary Proceedings and has established procedures for administrative coordination which will serve to streamline discovery and pretrial matters once these actions emerge from the motion to dismiss phase. Even if certain of the Adversary Proceedings eventually require a jury trial or cannot otherwise be finally adjudicated by this Court, judicial efficiency and economy would still be best achieved by having the pretrial stages of the proceedings coordinated in this Court. The District Court for the Southern District of New York has consistently and repeatedly found that judicial efficiency supports maintaining the reference in this Court in Lehman matters even in circumstances in which this Court lacked final adjudicative authority such that this Court's findings were subject to\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review if appealed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Certain defendants' assertions regarding their alleged entitlement to a jury trial also do not compel transfer from this Court at this time.

In\n   <em>\n    Enron\n   </em>\n   , the court concluded that withdrawal of the reference during the pretrial stage of the proceeding would be \"premature\" because the bankruptcy court was best equipped to handle discovery and other pretrial matters since it had presided over the case for almost one year and was already familiar with Enron's claims.

In venue transfer cases where key events occurred in both plaintiff's chosen forum and the movant's proposed forum, courts in this District have denied motions to transfer venue.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins.

Dec. 28, 2011) (holding that where the operative facts did not occur \"exclusively\" in the transferee court, considerations regarding the loci of operative facts \"weigh[ ] against transferring the case\"). Here, the Court concludes that the Defendants have not established by clear and convincing evidence that this Court lacks any material connection to the Indemnification Claims such that deference to the plaintiff's choice of forum should be disregarded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Convenience of the Witnesses and Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Defendants argue that the convenience of the witnesses, particularly third-party witnesses, is the most important consideration under section 1404.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   By their Individual Defendant Declarations, as further discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , the Defendants contend that they, and their material witnesses, would be severely inconvenienced were the trials on the Indemnification Claims to take place in New York. The Defendants list numerous individuals (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , appraisers, brokers, title officers, borrowers, and former employees of Defendants) who reside outside of New York whom they assert they intend to call to testify in support of their individual defenses against LBHI's claims. Because they assert that (i) each witness's testimony is material; (ii) it is inconvenient for the witnesses to travel\n   to New York to testify; and (iii) if such witnesses were to refuse to testify, the Court would be unable to compel non-party witnesses residing over 100 miles away to testify, the Defendants argue that the convenience of the witnesses weighs heavily in favor of transferring venue of their respective Adversary Proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   While the Defendants appear to recognize that, at trial,\n   <em>\n    LBHI\n   </em>\n   will have the burden to establish on a loan-by-loan basis that the borrower for each allegedly breaching mortgage loan made a material misrepresentation which caused a loss, the Defendants disregard this critical fact when making their arguments regarding the quantity and nature of the witness testimony which they will require for trial. First, this Court observes, based on its experience in trying cases similar to the Adversary Proceedings, that an appropriate trial regarding alleged breaches of the Agreements may not necessarily involve dozens of witnesses providing live testimony at trial. One reason for this is likely to be the passage of time; since the allegedly breaching loans were each issued over a decade ago, witness availability and/or ability to provide meaningful testimony based on recollections may be much more limited in the Adversary Proceedings than in a case in which allegedly breaching loans were originated more recently. In addition, the focus on live witness testimony ignores the central role that documentary evidence plays in cases such as these. The Court is skeptical that a trial in any one of the Adversary Proceedings will necessarily involve dozens of witnesses, as certain of the Defendants assert.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Second, even if each Defendant does determine to call a number of witnesses at trial, Defendants have failed to provide evidentiary support for the assertions in the Motions and in the Individual Defendant Declarations that certain witnesses would refuse to travel to New York to testify. As LBHI points out, not one Defendant has provided a single witness affidavit stating that such witness would be unwilling to testify in New York; instead the statements made to the Court simply appear to be inadmissible hearsay. While the Court recognizes that travel to New York may be inconvenient for some witnesses, in the absence of proof that such witnesses would refuse to testify, the Court cannot determine that this consideration weighs in favor of transfer of venue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    NBA Properties, Inc. v.

Mar. 27, 2000) (finding that the availability of process to compel attendance also does not weigh in favor of transfer where defendant fails to provide any affidavits from its witnesses stating that the witnesses will not voluntarily appear absent transfer).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Further, as discussed\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , certain Defendants have failed to demonstrate definitively that their witnesses are in fact all located in the forum to which their seek transfer, such that the convenience of the witnesses favors transfer to the requested forum.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , June 12, 2018 Hr'g Tr. 176:17-178:3 (attorney for Guaranteed Rate, Inc. admitting, in response to questions from the Court, that, while his client seeks transfer of its Adversary Proceeding to the Northern District\n   of Illinois, (i) only eight of the 22 allegedly defective loans at issue are \"associated with Illinois;\" (ii) he does not know whether Guaranteed Rate's material third-party witnesses are located in Illinois, as no investigation has been done as to where such persons reside; and (iii) he does not know whether the borrowers on the eight loans originated in Illinois still reside there). In fact, the witness lists in the Individual Defendant Declarations are replete with potential witnesses who reside outside the district to which transfer is sought or whose state of residence has not been confirmed with certainty at this time. Finally, many of the vague statements regarding witness inconvenience contained in the declarations (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , statements asserting that \"cost of travel, loss of time at work and family obligations\" make New York an \"extremely inconvenient\" forum) are also unsupported by statements of the witnesses themselves explaining how or why New York is any less convenient than any other forum. It is not sufficient for the moving party merely to shift the inconvenience to the other party, nor is it sufficient to demonstrate that the equities lean slightly in favor of the movant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Enron Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9444025\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/274/327/#p342\">\n    274 B.R. 327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 342-43 (Bankr.

It argues that such factors weigh in favor of transfer because (i) the majority of witnesses necessary for its defense are located in Colorado and it would be extremely inconvenient and costly for its witnesses to travel to New York; and (ii) most decisions related to the underwriting and sale of the loans at issue occurred in Colorado.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, because (a) the America's Mortgage entities are both defunct and have no resources and (b) LBHI allegedly has not satisfied its burden to demonstrate that transfer to Colorado would be financially burdensome to LBHI, America's Mortgage argues that the \"relative means of the parties\" factor also weighs in its favor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Court has considered each of America's Mortgage's arguments and finds that America's Mortgage has failed to meet its burden to show by clear and convincing evidence that Adversary Proceeding No. 16-01378 should be transferred to the Colorado District Court. The Court has determined that the interest of justice, which favors centralizing litigation of all of the Adversary Proceedings in one forum to avoid duplicative litigation, avert inconsistent results, preserve judicial and party resources, and provide for the efficient administration of the Adversary Proceedings, weighs heavily in favor of retaining venue of Adversary Proceeding No. 16-01378 in this Court. The common issues of law in the Adversary Proceedings, this Court's extensive experience with Lehman matters and with the Indemnification Claims in particular (as noted by multiple federal courts across the nation confronted with litigation regarding the Indemnification Claims), and the deference afforded to a plaintiff's choice of forum lend further support to this factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   America's Mortgage's stated concerns surrounding the convenience of witnesses, relative means of the parties, and locus of operative facts, when balanced against the foregoing considerations, are insufficiently substantial to outweigh them. Specifically, America's Mortgage (i) has provided no evidence to support its assertions regarding lack of financial means and (ii) has identified no witnesses unwilling to appear voluntarily at a trial in New York. In fact, its witnesses are unnamed, and it has provided no evidence as to whether such witnesses reside in Colorado at all or whether they would be unwilling or unable to travel. Finally, with respect to the locus of operative facts, America's Mortgage fails to acknowledge that, while certain decisions or activities relating to the loans at issue may have occurred in Colorado, other facts which gave rise to the Indemnification Claims occurred in New York, namely, that (i) LBHI is headquartered in, and had its business operations in, New York; (ii) the Agreements contain a New York choice of law provision; and (iii) the alleged liability to LBHI matured in New York upon approval of the GSE Settlements.

Additionally, Guaranteed Rate, Inc. argues that (i) all relevant documents are located in Chicago or in the states in which the properties are located; (ii) the locus of operative facts is determined by the location where the contract was negotiated and executed, and its employees negotiated, executed, and performed its loan purchase agreements with LBB in Illinois; and (iii) plaintiff's choice of forum should be entitled to little or no weight because the Southern District of New York has no connection to the claims and defenses at issue in its Adversary Proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   The Court has considered each of Guaranteed Rate, Inc.'s arguments and finds that Guaranteed Rate, Inc. has failed to meet its burden to show by clear and convincing evidence that Adversary Proceeding No. 16-01292 should be transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (or, in the alternative, to the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   The Court has determined that the interest of justice, which favors centralizing litigation of all of the Adversary Proceedings in one forum to avoid duplicative litigation, avert inconsistent results, preserve judicial and party resources, and provide for the efficient administration of the Adversary Proceedings, weighs heavily in favor of retaining venue of Adversary Proceeding No. 16-01292 in this Court. The common issues of law in the Adversary Proceedings, this Court's extensive experience with Lehman matters and with the Indemnification Claims in particular (as noted by multiple federal courts across the nation confronted with litigation regarding the Indemnification Claims), and the deference afforded to a plaintiff's choice of forum lend further support to this factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Moreover, Guaranteed Rate, Inc.'s stated concerns surrounding the convenience of witnesses, the locus of operative facts, and the location of documents, when balanced against the foregoing considerations, are insufficiently substantial to outweigh them.

Moreover, Guaranteed Rate, Inc. ignores LBHI's contention that hard copy documents located anywhere can be transmitted electronically or scanned for use at a trial in New York, regardless of their current location. Accordingly, Guaranteed Rate, Inc.'s argument that the location of the relevant documents supports transfer of its Adversary Proceeding carries little weight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Finally, regarding the locus of operative facts, Guaranteed Rate, Inc. fails to acknowledge that, while certain decisions or activities relating to the loans at issue may have occurred in Illinois, Colorado, and Delaware, other facts which gave rise to the Indemnification Claims occurred in New York, namely, that (i) LBHI is headquartered in, and had its business operations in, New York; (ii) the Agreements contain a New York choice of law provision; and (iii) the alleged liability to LBHI matured in New York upon approval of the GSE Settlements.

The Court has determined that the interest of justice, which favors centralizing litigation of all of the Adversary Proceedings in one forum to avoid duplicative litigation, avert inconsistent results, preserve judicial and party resources, and provide for the efficient administration of the Adversary Proceedings, weighs heavily in favor of retaining venue of Adversary Proceeding No. 17-01001 in this Court. The common issues of law in the Adversary Proceedings, this Court's extensive experience with Lehman matters and with the Indemnification Claims in particular (as noted by multiple federal courts across the nation confronted with litigation regarding the Indemnification Claims), and the deference afforded to a plaintiff's choice of forum lend further support to this factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   In addition, while the Court declines to determine at this time whether or not the forum selection clause contained in the Guild Brokerage Agreement covers the Liberty Loans, the Court finds that bifurcating this Adversary Proceeding into two litigations in two different fora would be contrary to judicial economy and the interest of justice. Moreover, the CMO does not contemplate a motion to sever being made in Phase I,\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Guild Mortgage Company did not file a letter request seeking to file\n   a supplemental brief regarding a motion to sever.

Although Guild Mortgage Company asserts that its witnesses live in various states in the western part of the United States, it provides no support for this assertion, nor for its conclusion that New York would be any less convenient than Washington or Arizona for those witnesses that reside in neither of those states.

In addition to joining the Omnibus Motion, Oaktree filed the AMLG Motion and the Declaration of Ray Scott [Dkt. No. 494] (the \"Scott Decl.\") in support thereof. By his declaration, Mr. Scott states that venue should be transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California or to the Colorado District Court because, among other reasons, (i) Oaktree is headquartered and has its principal place of business in San Bernardino County, California, which is where the company's employees \"performed\" the loan transactions; (ii) all of the documents that\n   support its defenses are located in California and Colorado; and (iii) it would be extremely inconvenient for Mr. Scott and the company's nine other witnesses (who, based on recent investigations, are all located in California and Colorado) to appear and give testimony in the Southern District of New York, particularly because Mr. Scott has stated that he has a heart condition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    86\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   The Court has considered each of Oaktree's arguments and finds that it has failed to meet its burden to show by clear and convincing evidence that Adversary Proceeding No. 16-01298 should be transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California or to the Colorado District Court. The Court has determined that the interest of justice, which favors centralizing litigation of all of the Adversary Proceedings in one forum to avoid duplicative litigation, avert inconsistent results, preserve judicial and party resources, and provide for the efficient administration of the Adversary Proceedings, weighs heavily in favor of retaining venue of Adversary Proceeding No. 16-01298 in this Court. The common issues of law in the Adversary Proceedings, this Court's extensive experience with Lehman matters and with the Indemnification Claims in particular (as noted by multiple federal courts across the nation confronted with litigation regarding the Indemnification Claims), and the deference afforded to a plaintiff's choice of forum lend further support to this factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   Oaktree's stated concerns surrounding the convenience of witnesses, the location of the operative documents, and the locus of operative facts, when balanced against the foregoing considerations, are insufficiently substantial to outweigh them. First, because Oaktree has requested transfer of venue to one of two different districts which are not in the same state, witness inconvenience will occur for some of its approximately ten witnesses regardless of forum. In addition, (i) with the exception of a statement regarding one witness's health concerns, Oaktree provides only vague, unsupported statements regarding witness inconvenience; (ii) Oaktree provides no evidence that its potential witnesses reside in California or Colorado; and (iii) Oaktree has identified no witnesses unwilling to appear voluntarily at a trial in New York. While the Court recognizes that travel to New York may be inconvenient for some witnesses, in the absence of proof that such witnesses would refuse to testify, the Court cannot determine that this consideration weighs in favor of transfer of venue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    NBA Properties, Inc. v.

Finally, with respect to the locus of operative facts, Oaktree fails to acknowledge that, while certain decisions or activities relating to the loans at issue may have occurred in California and Colorado, other facts which gave rise to the Indemnification Claims occurred in New York, namely, that (i) LBHI is headquartered in, and had its business operations in, New York; (ii) the Agreements contain a New York choice of law provision; and\n   (iii) the alleged liability to LBHI matured in New York upon approval of the GSE Settlements.

In addition to joining the Omnibus Motion, Suburban Mortgage, Inc. filed (i) its Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendant Suburban Mortgage, Inc.'s Motion to Transfer Venue [Dkt.

No. 463] (the \"Rupp Decl.\") in support thereof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   Suburban Mortgage, Inc. asserts that its Adversary Proceeding should be transferred to the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona, Phoenix Division, because, among other reasons, the convenience of witnesses weighs in its favor. Suburban Mortgage, Inc. submits that it has identified 37 non-party witnesses who could provide critical testimony regarding the 12 loans at issue and all of these potential witnesses reside in Arizona (with the exception of one who lives in Southern California).\n   <footnotemark>\n    99\n   </footnotemark>\n   Suburban Mortgage Inc. contends that (i) such non-party witnesses are not subject to subpoena in New York and will not voluntarily come to New York\n   <footnotemark>\n    100\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (ii) it would impose \"material economic hardship and/or life disruption\" on such potential witnesses if they had to travel to New York, particularly for those who are self-employed, the \"breadwinner\" of their household, \"recovering from a very serious illness,\" and compensated based on commission.\n   <footnotemark>\n    101\n   </footnotemark>\n   Suburban Mortgage, Inc. also argues that the location of relevant documents weighs in favor of transfer because all of its records and documents are located in Phoenix and only exist in paper form.\n   <footnotemark>\n    102\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   In addition, Suburban Mortgage, Inc. asserts that judicial economy and the interest of justice support transfer of venue because, among other reasons, (i) \"[t]his court has no familiarity with the underlying facts of this case;\" (ii) there is no advantage to coordinated discovery concerning loans involving other defendants since each loan file is unique; and (iii) due to the fact that Suburban Mortgage, Inc. will request a jury trial, if venue is not transferred from this Court, it will be inefficient because two judges will necessarily have to become familiar with the underlying facts of its case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    103\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-266\">\n   The Court has considered each of the arguments of Suburban Mortgage, Inc. and finds that it has failed to meet its burden to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that Adversary Proceeding No. 16-01295 should be transferred to the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona, Phoenix Division.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   The Court has determined that the interest of justice, which favors centralizing litigation of all of the Adversary Proceedings in one forum to avoid duplicative litigation, avert inconsistent results, preserve judicial and party resources, and provide for the efficient administration of the Adversary Proceedings, weighs heavily in favor of retaining venue of Adversary Proceeding No. 16-01295 in this Court. The common issues of law in the Adversary Proceedings, this Court's extensive experience with Lehman matters and with the Indemnification Claims in particular (as noted by multiple federal courts across the nation confronted with litigation regarding the Indemnification Claims), and the deference\n   afforded to a plaintiff's choice of forum lend further support to this factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   As stated\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the Adversary Proceedings have been pending before this Court since their inception, and transfer of certain of these actions at this time would result in a waste of judicial resources by duplicating work that has already been done. Contrary to the assertions of Suburban Mortgage, Inc., this Court is already immersed in the common issues of law and fact central to the actions. In addition, this Court has held numerous conferences and hearings in the Adversary Proceedings and has established procedures for administrative coordination which will serve to streamline discovery and pretrial matters once these actions emerge from the motion to dismiss phase. Even if, as Suburban Mortgage, Inc. argues, its Adversary Proceeding will eventually require a jury trial, judicial efficiency and economy would still be best achieved by having the pretrial stages of the proceedings coordinated in this Court. While Suburban Mortgage, Inc. submits that having two judges - a bankruptcy judge and a district court judge - become familiar with its Adversary Proceeding would be inefficient, the Court observes that it is highly likely that a transferee district court would refer pretrial matters to a magistrate judge; thus, the same pretrial/trial dichotomy would occur regardless of whether venue is transferred. Transfer of this Adversary Proceeding to a district court at this time would be premature, inefficient, and not in the interest of justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   Moreover, Suburban Mortgage, Inc.'s stated concerns surrounding the convenience of witnesses, the locus of operative facts, and the location of documents, when balanced against consideration regarding the interest of justice, are insufficiently substantial to outweigh them. While Suburban Mortgage, Inc. asserts that the location of the operative documents is in Arizona and this weighs in favor of transfer, it fails to address LBHI's contention that documents in paper form could be scanned and transmitted electronically for use at a trial in New York. With respect to Suburban Mortgage, Inc.'s claims that New York will be an inconvenient forum for the 41 witnesses (37 of which are non-party witnesses) that it intends to call at trial, the Court is skeptical that a trial in this Adversary Proceeding will necessarily involve dozens of witnesses. Suburban Mortgage, Inc. disregards the facts that (i) the plaintiff LBHI, not a defendant, bears the burden to establish on a loan-by-loan basis that the borrower for each allegedly breaching mortgage loan made a material misrepresentation which caused a loss; (ii) since the allegedly breaching loans were each issued over a decade ago, witnesses' ability to provide meaningful testimony based on recollections may be much more limited due to the passage of time; and (iii) documentary evidence may play a more central role than witness testimony at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   Many of the conclusory statements regarding witness inconvenience contained in the Rupp Declaration (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , statements asserting it would impose \"material economic hardship and/or life disruption\" on the potential witnesses if they had to travel to New York) are unsupported by statements of the witnesses themselves, as is Mr. Rupp's blanket assertion that every one of the 37 potential non-party witnesses would not voluntarily travel to New York to testify. While the Court recognizes that travel to New York may be inconvenient for some witnesses, in the absence of affidavits from such witnesses that they would refuse to testify, the Court cannot determine that this consideration weighs in favor of transfer of venue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    NBA Properties, Inc. v.

Wintrust Mortgage (Adv. Pro. No. 16-01369)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-288\">\n   Wintrust Mortgage, as successor by merger to SGB Corp., asserts that the convenience of the parties and the interest of justice strongly favor transferring venue of Adversary Proceeding No. 16-01369 to the Colorado District Court (or, in the alternative, to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois). In addition to joining the Omnibus Motion, Wintrust Mortgage filed (i) its Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendant Wintrust Mortgage's, as Successor by Merger to SGB Corp., Motion to Transfer Venue [Dkt. No. 474] (the \"Wintrust Motion\"); and (ii) the Declaration of David Hrobon [Dkt.

The Court has determined that the interest of justice, which favors centralizing litigation of all of\n   the Adversary Proceedings in one forum to avoid duplicative litigation, avert inconsistent results, preserve judicial and party resources, and provide for the efficient administration of the Adversary Proceedings, weighs heavily in favor of retaining venue of Adversary Proceeding No. 16-01369 in this Court. The common issues of law in the Adversary Proceedings, this Court's extensive experience with Lehman matters and with the Indemnification Claims in particular (as noted by multiple federal courts across the nation confronted with litigation regarding the Indemnification Claims), and the deference afforded to a plaintiff's choice of forum lend further support to this factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-291\">\n   Wintrust Mortgage's stated concerns surrounding the convenience of witnesses, the location of the operative documents, and the locus of operative facts, when balanced against the foregoing considerations, are insufficiently substantial to outweigh them. First, because Wintrust Mortgage has requested transfer of venue to one of two different districts which are not in the same state, witness inconvenience will occur for some of its approximately ten witnesses regardless of forum. In addition, (i) Wintrust Mortgage provides only vague, unsupported statements regarding witness inconvenience; (ii) it provides insufficient evidence regarding the state of residence of its potential witnesses; and (iii) it has identified no witnesses unwilling to appear voluntarily at a trial in New York. While the Court recognizes that travel to New York may be inconvenient for some witnesses, in the absence of proof that such witnesses would refuse to testify, the Court cannot determine that this consideration weighs in favor of transfer of venue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    NBA Properties, Inc. v.

Finally, with respect to the locus of operative facts, Wintrust Mortgage fails to acknowledge that, while certain decisions or activities relating to the loans at issue may have occurred in Colorado, other facts which gave rise to the Indemnification Claims occurred in New York, namely, that (i) LBHI is headquartered in, and had its business operations in, New York; (ii) the Agreements contain a New York choice of law provision; and (iii) the alleged liability to LBHI matured in New York upon approval of the GSE Settlements.

Contrary to Wintrust Mortgage's assertions, the recoveries achieved by LBHI in its chapter 11 cases are not a \"war chest\" that can be utilized for prosecuting litigation; LBHI's non-restricted cash is held for the benefit of its creditors who, as LBHI points out, will receive distributions but who will never be made whole on their claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    111\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-294\">\n   After balancing the Transfer Factors, this Court concludes that, for the foregoing reasons, the motion to transfer venue of Adversary Proceeding No. 16-01369 is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-295\">\n   <strong>\n    FF.

In addition to joining the Omnibus Motion, WR Starkey Mortgage, LLP filed the AMLG Motion and the Declaration of Todd Bergwall [Dkt. No. 501] (the \"Bergwall Decl.\") in support thereof. By his declaration, Mr. Bergwall states that venue should be transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Sherman Division, because, among other reasons, (i) the documents that support WR Starkey Mortgage, LLP's defense are located in Houston, Texas and are voluminous; (ii) WR Starkey Mortgage, LLP is headquartered and has its principal place of business in Texas, which is where the loan transactions were \"performed;\" and (iii) it would be extremely inconvenient for Mr. Bergwall and the company's witnesses (who, based on recent investigations, are all located in Texas or Colorado) to appear and give testimony in the Southern District of New York.\n   <footnotemark>\n    112\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   The Court has considered each of WR Starkey Mortgage, LLP's arguments and finds that WR Starkey Mortgage, LLP has failed to meet its burden to show by clear and convincing evidence that Adversary Proceeding No. 16-01326 should be transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Sherman Division.

WR Starkey Mortgage, LLP fails to cite to any evidence from the witnesses themselves explaining how or why New York would be any less convenient than Texas for such parties. The Court observes that witness inconvenience will occur for some of these potential witnesses regardless of forum. In addition, WR Starkey also has not identified any witnesses unwilling to appear voluntarily at a trial in New York.

The interest of justice, which favors centralizing litigation in one forum to (i) avoid duplicative litigation; (ii) save time and expense; and (iii) efficiently administer adversary proceedings based on similar claims weighs heavily here in favor of retaining venue of all of the Adversary Proceedings in this Court. It bears emphasis that multiple federal courts across the country, when confronted with litigation related to the Indemnification Claims, have agreed that this Court is the most appropriate forum to hear these Adversary Proceedings, given its extensive experience with Lehman matters and with the Indemnification Claims in particular. Defendants' stated concerns surrounding the convenience of witnesses, the location of operative documents, and the locus of operative facts, when balanced against this factor, are insufficiently substantial to outweigh it and the deference granted to the plaintiff's choice of forum. Each Defendant has failed to meet its burden to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that transfer of the Adversary Proceeding in which it is currently a Defendant to the venue(s) set forth on Exhibit A is warranted.
