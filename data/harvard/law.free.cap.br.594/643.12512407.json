Like the first claim in\n   <em>\n    CashCall\n   </em>\n   , Count II is constitutionally core because this issue involves the claim allowance process and the Debtor's objection to Allied's proof of claim. Count II concerns the validity of the very Credit Agreement that undergirds Allied's claim in the Bankruptcy Case. \"[R]esolution of [the Debtor's] claim that the Loan Agreement ... was illegal could directly impact claims against her estate and her plan for financial reorganization ....\"\n   <em>\n    CashCall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076021,4116429\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/63/\">\n    781 F.3d at 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 105-16. Like Count II, it also seeks to certify a class of claimants similarly situated to the Debtor under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076021,4116429\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/63/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Upon certification, the Debtor asks the Court for \"injunctive relief or declaratory relief with respect to the Usury Class as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 115.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Count III attacks the loans Allied made to the Debtor and to other similarly situated debtors as null and void under section 6.2-1541 of the Virginia Code, which would invalidate the contract Allied is using as the basis for its claims. Count III also asks the Court to find that \"Allied knowingly filed Proofs of Claim on null and void loans, attempting to collect debts that cannot be enforced against debtors in bankruptcy pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n    \u00b6 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Count III is readily distinguishable from the\n   <em>\n    CashCall\n   </em>\n   counterclaim. The\n   <em>\n    CashCall\n   </em>\n   counterclaim involved a completely separate cause of action arising out of the creditor's purported violation of applicable state consumer finance statute for improper collection efforts-over and above just filing the proof of claim. A determination on the first core count \"that the underlying Loan Agreement was illegal\" was not outcome determinative of whether CashCall's collection efforts \"inherently violate[d] the North Carolina Debt Collection Act.\"\n   <em>\n    CashCall\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076021,4116429\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/63/\">\n    781 F.3d at 70-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, the\n   <em>\n    CashCall\n   </em>\n   counterclaim \"regarding CashCall's conduct in trying to collect on the loan, other violations of the state statute, and damages like emotional distress ... [was] unrelated to the Defendant's proof of claim and [was] only related to the bankruptcy case in that if successful, the bankruptcy estate will recover any non-exempt funds and disburse them to claims in accordance with the bankruptcy code.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076021,4116429\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/63/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076021,4116429\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/63/\">\n    at 85-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Gregory, J., concurring) (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Unlike the counterclaim in\n   <em>\n    CashCall\n   </em>\n   , which the Fourth Circuit deemed to be\n   constitutionally non-core, Count III concerns \"whether an individual is owed money by a debtor - a classic core claim.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076021,4116429\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/63/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076021,4116429\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/781/63/\">\n    at 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, by Count III, the Court is to decide whether Allied has an allowable claim against the Debtor and similarly situated debtors, such that Allied is owed money by the Debtor. To the extent Allied does not have an allowable claim because the underlying loan agreement is void, Count III then asks for a declaratory judgment that Allied filed proofs of claim for unenforceable debts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Count III would necessarily be resolved by the Court in the claims allowance process when considering Allied's proofs of claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the one hand, if the Court concludes that the Credit Agreement is valid, then Allied's proof of claim would be allowed. On the other hand, if the Court concludes that the loan agreement Allied is using is void, then Allied was not entitled to collect the usurious interest that it charged and the proof of claim should be disallowed. The Court must make this determination in its consideration of the validity of Allied's proof of claim pursuant to its constitutionally mandated duties. Thus, it would conflict with Congress's vision of the bankruptcy process to refer Count III to arbitration under the terms of the Arbitration Provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Court also denied the Motion to Compel for a second reason. A court should not compel arbitration in scenarios where it would hinder the ability of an agency to pursue the relief it is statutorily charged with seeking. In light of the Court's decision to grant the Virginia Attorney General's Motion to Intervene in this Adversary Proceeding, referring Counts II and III to arbitration would violate the Supreme Court's explicit command in\n   <em>\n    EEOC v.
