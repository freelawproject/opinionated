The involuntary petition was filed by three holders of the two most senior classes of notes, Opportunities II Ltd., HH HoldCo Co-Investment Fund, L.P., and Real Estate Opps Ltd. (collectively, the \"\n   <em>\n    Petitioning Creditors\n   </em>\n   \"), and is opposed by Taberna, its collateral manager, and five holders of the junior classes of notes issued by Taberna. The movants seek a judgment that three Petitioning Creditors have failed to establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case that they meet one of the requirements, set forth in section 303(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, to qualify as petitioning creditors eligible to commence this involuntary case, and as such, dismissal of this involuntary petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Although the parties opposing the involuntary petition have raised a number of arguments,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   they now seek judgment that the Petitioning Creditors have not made out a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case with regard to only one of the eligibility requirements for filing an involuntary petition, namely, that Petitioning Creditors hold claims against the putative debtor, Taberna. The parties opposing the involuntary petition argue that the notes are nonrecourse, and accordingly, the Petitioning Creditors only hold claims against the collateral securing the notes;\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   they do not hold claims against Taberna.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Whether the Petitioning Creditors hold claims\n   <em>\n    against Taberna\n   </em>\n   on account of the notes turns in the first instance on whether the notes are nonrecourse and, if the notes are nonrecourse, on whether sections 1111(b) and 102(2) of the Bankruptcy Code eliminate any distinction between recourse and nonrecourse claims in bankruptcy for purposes of determining the eligibility of a petitioning creditor under section 303(b) such that, notwithstanding the nonrecourse nature of the claims, the Petitioning Creditors hold the requisite claims against Taberna.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This opinion constitutes the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law pursuant to Rule 52(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, made applicable here by Rule 7052 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   For reasons set forth\n   herein, the Court concludes that the Petitioning Creditors do not meet the requirements of section 303(b) of the Bankruptcy Code and are not eligible to commence an involuntary case against Taberna. Accordingly, judgment should be entered dismissing this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In addition, the Court finds that this involuntary case serves no legitimate bankruptcy purpose, Petitioning Creditors would not be prejudiced by dismissal, and it is in the best interest of the creditors and the estate that the case be dismissed. Accordingly, pursuant to sections 1112 and 105 of the Bankruptcy Code, in the exercise of the Court's discretion, the Court concludes that the case should be dismissed for cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   This Court has jurisdiction over this chapter 11 case pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1334 and the Amended Standing Order of Referral of Cases to Bankruptcy Judges of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (M-431), dated January 31, 2012 (Preska, C.J.).

Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In 2005, Taberna issued eleven classes of notes in the aggregate principal amount of $630,175,000, which descend in priority and have a stated maturity date of May 5, 2036 (collectively, the \"\n   <em>\n    Notes\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JPO \u00a7 III Stipulated Fact (\"Stip. Fact\") \u00b6\u00b6 4-6; JX1\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   at 55-56. The Notes are governed by an indenture dated December 23, 2005 (the \"\n   <em>\n    Indenture\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JPO \u00a7 III Stip. Fact \u00b6 3; Indenture \u00a7 14.9. The funds generated by the issuance of the Notes were used to purchase various types of securities that were intended to generate proceeds sufficient to repay the Notes and serve as collateral securing the Notes (collectively, the \"\n   <em>\n    Collateral\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Petitioning Creditors' Statement About the Involuntary Chapter 11 Petition Regarding Taberna Preferred Funding IV, Ltd.

The Collateral consists mostly of long-term securities issued by real estate investment trusts (\"\n   <em>\n    REITS\n   </em>\n   \") and other real estate entities,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   PC Stmt. \u00b6 10; JPO \u00a7 III Stip.

The Indenture defines\n   \"Secured Parties\" to include, among others, the Noteholders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   INDENTURE at 1, 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At all times, Taberna has paid Class A Noteholders pursuant to the terms of the Indenture.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JPO \u00a7 III Stip. Fact \u00b6\u00b6 12, 22. In August 2009, an event of default occurred under the Indenture due to Taberna's payment default on Class B Notes, notes junior to those now held by the Petitioning Creditors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JPO \u00a7 III Stip. Fact \u00b6 17. The Notes were accelerated the following month.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JPO \u00a7 III Stip. Fact \u00b6 18. Over six years later, on March 22, 2016, the Petitioning Creditors purchased a total of $135,525,044.37 of the most senior class of Notes (the \"\n   <em>\n    A-1 Notes\n   </em>\n   \") and a total of $16.9 million of the second most senior class of notes (the \"\n   <em>\n    A-2 Notes\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JPO \u00a7 III Stip. Fact \u00b6\u00b6 29, 30. By virtue of these purchases, at the time of filing, the Petitioning Creditors held 100% of the A-1 Notes and approximately 34% of the A-2 Notes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PC Stmt. \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As the Indenture does not permit the Petitioning Creditors unilaterally to liquidate the Collateral without the consent of other parties, prior to filing the involuntary petition, the Petitioning Creditors took a number of steps in a failed effort to liquidate the Collateral.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PC Stmt. \u00b6 6; JPO \u00a7 III Stip. Fact \u00b6\u00b6 35-40.

Fact \u00b6 35. In March 2017, Mr. Ghei, on behalf of Petitioning Creditors, and with the advice and assistance of their current bankruptcy counsel, launched a tender offer to purchase Notes from each class in amounts sufficient to allow them to direct the Trustee to auction the Collateral. 11/28/17 Tr. 183:17-184:1, Adv.

Through this document, each of the three Petitioning Creditors waived its right to benefit from security interests in any asset of the alleged debtor solely on account of its ownership interest in the Class A-2 Notes up to, but not to exceed, the amount of $5,259.00.

No. 17-01087 183:19-22, ECF No. 15. Prior to commencing this case, Petitioning Creditors coordinated with Anchorage, an investor that had previously put another CDO into bankruptcy involuntarily, to effectuate the Chapter 11 proposed plan, which Anchorage agreed to support so long as Anchorage was not \"on the front lines\". 11/29/17 Tr. 31:20- 35:1, Adv.

The day after filing the Involuntary Petition, Petitioning Creditors moved to terminate the alleged debtor's exclusivity period in which to file a chapter 11 plan to enable Petitioning Creditors to pursue their proposed plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Motion to Terminate the Debtor's Plan Exclusivity Periods [ECF No. 8].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Soon after filing the involuntary petition, the parties entered a stipulation, which the Court so ordered, establishing a schedule for expedited discovery including expert discovery and the briefing of any threshold legal issues. So Ordered Stipulation [ECF No. 45]. At the close of discovery, the Petitioning Creditors moved for partial summary judgment, seeking a ruling that, having filed waivers of the lien on the collateral,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   JPO \u00a7 III Stip. Fact \u00b6 57, they now held\n   <em>\n    unsecured\n   </em>\n   claims against Taberna, thereby satisfying one of the eligibility requirements in dispute under section 303(b) of the Bankruptcy Code (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   a different requirement than the one at issue on this motion).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Petitioning Creditors' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment [ECF No. 51].\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   TP Management LLP, as collateral manager (the \"\n   <em>\n    Collateral Manager\n   </em>\n   \"), and several holders of Notes junior to the A-1 and A-2 Notes (collectively, the \"\n   <em>\n    Junior Noteholders\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and together with the Collateral Manager, the \"\n   <em>\n    Objecting\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Parties\n   </em>\n   \") opposed the summary judgment motion, arguing that summary judgment should be denied because the Petitioning Creditors' Note claims are both oversecured and non-recourse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opposition to Petitioning Creditors' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment [ECF No. 65]. By decision dated November 27, 2017, the Court denied the Petitioning Creditors' summary judgment motion on the issue of whether they hold unsecured claims against Taberna on the grounds that they had failed to establish that there were no material issues of fact and that they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decision Denying Motion for Partial Summary Judgment [ECF No. 133] (the \"\n   <em>\n    Summary Judgment Decision\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Thereafter, a bench trial commenced on the disputed issue of the eligibility of Petitioning Creditors to maintain this case. After five days of trial, at which Vikaran Ghei (one of two Principals of the Petitioning Creditors) and two experts (who testified with respect to valuation issues not relevant on this motion) testified, excerpts of depositions were offered, and over 140 exhibits were received into evidence. At the close of the Petitioning Creditors' case in chief, the Objecting Parties moved pursuant to Rule 52(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for a judgment on partial findings (the \"\n   <em>\n    Motion\n   </em>\n   \" or \"\n   <em>\n    Mtn.\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   The Objecting Parties' Motion Under Rule 52(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for Judgment on Partial Findings [ECF No. 144].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In their Motion, the Objecting Parties seek a determination that the Petitioning Creditors' claims with respect to the Notes (the \"\n   <em>\n    PC Note Claims\n   </em>\n   \") are nonrecourse and, as holders of nonrecourse claims, the Petitioning Creditors are ineligible under section 303(b) of the Bankruptcy Code to file an involuntary petition. Taberna supports the Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Alleged Debtor's Joinder in The Objecting Parties' Motion Under Rule 52(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for Judgment on Partial Findings [ECF No. 145]. The parties submitted findings of fact and conclusions of law and thereafter the Court heard oral argument on the motion. ECF Nos. 144-152. The narrow issues before the Court on this Motion are (1) whether the PC Note Claims are nonrecourse, and (2) whether the Petitioning Creditors nonetheless meet the eligibility criteria of section 303(b) of the Bankruptcy Code requiring that they hold claims against Taberna.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   While the Rule 52 motion was pending, the Second Circuit issued a decision in\n   <em>\n    Wilk Auslander LLP v.

In light of\n   <em>\n    Murray\n   </em>\n   , the Court issued an order directing the parties to show cause with respect to whether this case should be dismissed for cause pursuant to section 1112(b) of the Bankruptcy Code. [ECF No. 153]. The parties submitted briefing on the issue [ECF Nos. 154-159], and on October 18, 2018, the Court heard oral argument on the section 1112 issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARDS WITH RESPECT TO MOTION FOR JUDGMENT ON PARTIAL FINDINGS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The first line of section 2.6(h) is unambiguous in stating that the Notes are nonrecourse: \"[t]he obligations of the Co-Issuers under the Notes and this Indenture are non-recourse obligations of the Co-Issuers payable solely from the Collateral ....\" JX 1, INDENTURE \u00a7 2.6(h). The Co-Issuers include Taberna, as Issuer, and Taberna Preferred Funding IV, Inc., as Co-Issuer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JX 1, INDENTURE, p. 1. The remainder of the first line of section 2.6(h) provides that once the Collateral (here, various types of long-term securities) has been fully liquidated, the Noteholders' claims shall be extinguished. JX 1, INDENTURE \u00a7 2.6(h). This is consistent with the nature of nonrecourse debt; as once the Collateral has been exhausted, the Noteholders cannot look to Taberna to recover any deficiency because payment on the Notes will be \"solely from the Collateral\" and not from Taberna. Similarly, the fourth line of section 2.6(h) provides that although Noteholders may name Taberna as a defendant in an action when exercising other remedies under the Indenture, they are prohibited from either seeking a deficiency judgment or any personal liability against Taberna. JX 1, INDENTURE \u00a7 2.6(h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Petitioning Creditors argue, that the third line of section 2.6(h) limits the first line of section 2.6(h) (each quoted above) by providing that the Notes do not become nonrecourse\n   <em>\n    until\n   </em>\n   the Collateral has been realized.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. \u00b6 42. Thus, according to the Petitioning Creditors, the Noteholders' claims are not presently limited to the Collateral because the Collateral has not been fully liquidated, and only when the Collateral eventually is fully liquidated, will the Noteholders' claims then be limited to the Collateral. In other words: The Noteholders' claims will not be limited to the Collateral until after the Collateral has been liquidated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Court disagrees with this construction of the third line of section 2.6(h), which is not supported by the plain meaning of the provision, any other provision of the Indenture, or common sense. This proposed construction is belied by the first\n   line of section 2.6(h), which contains an unqualified statement that the Notes\n   <em>\n    are\n   </em>\n   (as opposed to \"will be, once the Collateral is liquidated\") nonrecourse, as well as the fourth line of section 2.6(h), which prohibits Noteholders, with no temporal limitation, from seeking to hold Taberna personally liable on account of the Notes. The fourth line of section 2.6(h) does not qualify its prohibition on actions seeking a deficiency judgment against Taberna until after the Collateral has been liquidated. Moreover, the third line of section 2.6(h) is unambiguous. It does not provide that the Notes only become nonrecourse upon the occurrence of a subsequent event;\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   the liquidation of the Collateral. Instead, it simply explains that, notwithstanding the first and second lines of section 2.6(h), section 2.6(h) shall not be construed as either preventing recourse to the Collateral or affecting a \"waiver, release or discharge of any indebtedness or obligation evidenced by the Notes or secured by [the] Indenture until such Collateral has been realized.\" This is consistent with the first line of section 2.6(h), which provides that \"following realization of the Collateral and its reduction to zero\" the Noteholders' claims shall be extinguished. In this context, the claims are to be extinguished precisely because they are limited to the Collateral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Petitioning Creditors also point to several other provisions of the Indenture that contain generalized references to Taberna's payment obligations with respect to the Notes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. \u00b6 36 (referencing sections 2.4(a),\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   5.3(c),\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   7.1\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 14.12\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   ). While these sections reference a payment obligation of Taberna under the Indenture, they by no means give rise to any obligation to repay the Notes from any of its assets other than the Collateral. Nor do they provide that Taberna shall bear any personal liability on account of the Notes. Moreover, these provisions neither conflict with, nor give rise to any ambiguity concerning,\n   the plain language of section 2.6(h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The Objecting Parties, on the other hand, contend that section 1111(b) takes effect only after a bankruptcy case has been commenced and an estate comes into existence, and that it does not operate to render a party eligible to file an involuntary petition based on subsequent events that may or may not occur, particularly when that party otherwise would not meet the requirements of section 303(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   The Obj.

In his chapter 13 case, the\n   debtor sought to treat the mortgage holder's lien against the mortgaged property as a claim to be administered under his chapter 13 plan of reorganization, and the mortgage lender objected.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 80-81,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6507321,1107779\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/111/2150/\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The issue before the court was whether the mortgage lender's security interest in the borrower's mortgaged property constituted a claim that could be included in his chapter 13 plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 80,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6507321,1107779\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/111/2150/\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Noting that the mortgage lender had a right to payment in the form of the proceeds from a sale of the debtor's mortgaged property as well as a right to an equitable remedy (foreclosure), the Court concluded that the surviving mortgage interest constituted a claim against the debtor within the meaning of section 101(5).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 83-84,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6507321,1107779\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/111/2150/\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court also noted that since under section 102(2), a claim against a debtor includes a claim against a debtor's property, the mortgage interest constituted a claim against the debtor to be administered in the chapter 13 case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 85,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6507321,1107779\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/111/2150/\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

While\n   <em>\n    Midland Funding\n   </em>\n   may stand for the proposition that a disputed and ultimately unenforceable claim still constitutes a claim, section 303(b)(1) explicitly requires that a petitioning creditor hold a claim that is not subject to a\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   dispute.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20303\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

Not only have the Petitioning Creditors failed to establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case that they hold an undisputed claim against Taberna, they have failed even to identify any claim against Taberna. The Court is also not convinced by the cases cited by the Petitioning Creditors construing treatment of nonrecourse claims for tax purposes, as the rationale underlying those decisions reflects policies unique to the Internal Revenue Code, as opposed to the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. \u00b6 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    This Court's Prior Summary Judgment Decision Does Not Render Petitioning Creditors Eligible To File An Involuntary Case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The Petitioning Creditors' final argument is that this Court previously found, in connection with the denial of their Motion for Summary Judgment that the Petitioning Creditors do not hold the lien on the Collateral (under the Indenture, the lien is held by the Trustee\n   <em>\n    for the benefit of the Noteholders\n   </em>\n   ), and therefore the Petitioning Creditors hold unsecured claims for purposes of the eligibility requirements in section 303(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 52-62. Specifically, the Petitioning Creditors rely on the language in section 303(b)(1), which provides that the three petitioning creditors must hold claims that \"aggregate at least $15,775 more than the value of any lien on property of the debtor securing such claims\n   <em>\n    held by the holders of such claims\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20303\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) (emphasis added). Thus, the Petitioning Creditors argue that although they are the holders of the PC Note Claims, they are not the holders of the lien, and therefore the value of any lien they hold is zero. As such, they argue that because the PC Note Claims aggregate more than the value of any lien held by the holders of the PC Note Claims, the Petitioning Creditors meet the requirements of section 303(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The Court notes initially that the denial of summary judgment has no precedential effect.\n   <em>\n    Paquin v.

Such a reading would yield the absurd result of permitting secured nonrecourse parties to qualify as the petitioning creditors simply because their liens are held in trust by a third party such as the Indenture Trustee.

Furthermore, the fact that the Petitioning Creditors proposed a liquidating plan,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Notice of Filing of Certain Unredacted Exhibits to Affidavit of H. Peter Haveles, Jr. Pursuant to Order Amending Prior Order Granting Ex Parte Motion to File Documents Under Seal [ECF No. 82], Exh. D, strongly suggests that the Petitioning Creditors elected Chapter 11, rather than Chapter 7, solely in an attempt to obtain the benefits of Section 1111(b) which, in turn, allowed them to make a colorable (albeit incorrect and meritless) argument regarding their eligibility to commence an involuntary case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   There is, however, no need for bankruptcy protection here since the Taberna Indenture independently establishes the\n   parties' agreements as to liquidation. JX 1, INDENTURE \u00a7 11.1. The Petitioning Creditors' stated goal, which they were unable to achieve through a series of earlier initiatives, is to rewrite the terms of the Indenture agreement, thereby enabling Petitioning Creditors to alter Taberna's governance structure and increase its disclosures, with the ultimate goal of forcing an accelerated liquidation-not a reorganization. JX 111; JX 113, 2;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   11/30/18 Tr. 15:6-12, Adv. Pro. No. 17-01087 ECF No. 17. This is unnecessary (and indeed, inappropriate) since Taberna is a static pool investment vehicle, intended to exist for only a limited time. In contemplation of the possibility that Taberna would lack the funds necessary to pay timely interest or principal, all noteholders (including Petitioning Creditors) expressly agreed to terms for how the indenture trustee will manage the remaining portfolio and how losses will be distributed among the noteholders. Here, the alleged debtor faces no involuntary creditors and the rules for liquidating this single purpose, single use entity were set forth by contract. Everyone, including Petitioning Creditors who purchased the already defaulted notes, agreed to those rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The Court does not view these facts in isolation but considers them within the context of the entire case. Here, Petitioning Creditors took intricate-choreographed-steps to manufacture eligibility to file an involuntary case. For example, the only reasonable inference to draw from Petitioning Creditors' waiver [ECF No. 1-3] is that Petitioning Creditors waived their rights to benefit from any security interest up to the statutory eligibility filing requirement in an attempt to artificially create eligibility to file an involuntary petition under section 303 as partially unsecured creditors. However, the cumulative actions by the Petitioning Creditors including knowingly purchasing a controlling stake of class A notes after previous failed attempts to liquidate the collateral, drafting a liquidating plan for the exclusive benefit of class A noteholders, filing the involuntary petition under chapter 11 (rather than under chapter 7) to invoke the benefits of section 1111(b), and waiving their right to benefit from any security interest up to the statutory eligibility filing requirement, makes clear to the Court that Petitioning Creditors intended to abuse the bankruptcy code and bankruptcy process. With the benefit of experienced counsel,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   10/18/18 Tr. 25:23-25, [ECF No. 161], Mr. Ghei-himself a sophisticated investor, knowledgeable both with respect to complex financial transactions including CDOs and the workings of Bankruptcy Code,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   11/28/17 Tr. 47:24-50:24, Adv.

Therefore, the Petitioning Creditors argue, there is a valid purpose here and the Court should enter an order for relief. As an initial matter, under the Code the term 'indenture' has a specific meaning. The Petitioning Creditors have not the Petitioning Creditors have not established that the Indenture here falls within the meaning of the term 'indenture' as used in section 1123(a)(5)(F), defined in section 101(28). Second, this argument puts the cart before the horse. Section 1123(a) provides a list of the tools one may use to implement a plan.
