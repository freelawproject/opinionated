Hermans, Ph.D., LL.M., M.Sc. (\"Hermans\" or \"Foreign Representative\"), filed chapter 15 petitions and asks the Court to recognize what is essentially an insurance company rehabilitation proceeding in Cura\u00e7ao as a \"foreign main proceeding\" and to recognize him as the \"foreign representative,\" both as defined in the Bankruptcy Code. (The \"Petitions,\" ECF Doc. # 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Hermans filed the Petitions on behalf of ENNIA Caribe Holding N.V. (\"ENNIA\"), the largest insurance company in Cura\u00e7ao.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ENNIA consists of three Cura\u00e7ao-based insurance companies (\"Insurer Debtors\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and three of their unregulated\n   affiliates (\"Asset Manager Debtors,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   collectively with the Insurer Debtors, the \"Foreign Debtors\"). All the Foreign Debtors are directly or indirectly owned by non-debtor Parman International B.V. (\"Parman\"). Parman filed an objection to the motion for recognition. (The \"Objection,\" ECF Doc. # 24.) The Central Bank of Cura\u00e7ao and St. Maarten (\"CBCS\") regulates Cura\u00e7ao insurance companies, including the Insurer Debtors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The genesis of the dispute between the parties-which has been building over the last two or more years-is the liquidity levels of the Insurer Debtors. In July of 2018, the CBCS' solvency concerns grew so great that they revoked the insurers' licenses and initiated a procedure to rehabilitate the companies under a statute known as the LTV, which authorizes a court upon the application of the CBCS to pronounce \"Emergency Regulations.\" Upon receiving approval from a Cura\u00e7ao court to implement the Emergency Regulations, the CBCS replaced most of the Insurer Debtors' management, effectively removing Parman's control. The CBCS is now in control of the Insurer Debtors' continued operation during the pendency of the rehabilitation proceeding, which will hopefully avoid liquidation. The CBCS appointed the Foreign Representative and supports recognition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The CBCS authorized the Foreign Representative to file chapter 15 petitions on behalf of the Foreign Debtors because, allegedly, over $240 million of the Foreign Debtors' assets are held in accounts at Merrill Lynch in New York. Some of this money is in accounts in the names of the Insurer Debtors and some is in accounts in the names of the Asset Manager Debtors. The Foreign Representative wants the funds at Merrill Lynch returned to Cura\u00e7ao to help the Insurer Debtors satisfy policyholder claims. Parman wants to block the return of the funds, or at least the portion of these funds that are in the accounts of the Asset Manager Debtors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Parman also is attempting to use the proceeding in this Court-improperly, in the Court's view-as an opportunity to relitigate issues of Cura\u00e7ao law that it has so far lost in Cura\u00e7ao, although various judicial proceedings remain pending in Cura\u00e7ao.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The principal issue before this Court is whether the Cura\u00e7ao insurance company rehabilitation proceeding is a \"foreign proceeding\" under chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Code. A \"foreign proceeding\" is \"a collective judicial or administrative proceeding in a foreign country, including an interim proceeding, under a law relating to insolvency or adjustment of debt in which proceeding the assets and affairs of the debtor are subject to control or supervision by a foreign court, for the purpose of reorganization or liquidation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (23). Parman argues that\n   the Cura\u00e7ao proceeding is not a \"collective proceeding,\" and that it is not a proceeding in which \"the assets and affairs of the debtor are subject to control or supervision by a foreign court ....\" Parman also argues that even if the Cura\u00e7ao proceeding would satisfy the requirements to be a \"foreign proceeding,\" this Court should nevertheless refuse to recognize the Cura\u00e7ao proceeding because, in Parman's view, it is \"manifestly contrary to the public policy of the United States,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201506\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , because the Cura\u00e7ao statutory procedure violates due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   For the reasons explained below, Parman's Objection to recognition is overruled, the Cura\u00e7ao proceeding is recognized as a foreign main proceeding, and Hermans is recognized as the Foreign Representative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Foreign Debtors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Foreign Debtors are part of ENNIA. ENNIA is the largest insurance company in Cura\u00e7ao and St. Maarten. (Foreign Representative Declaration \u00b6 7.) ENNIA is considered to be systemically important to Cura\u00e7ao and St. Maarten. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) ENNIA's total assets constitute approximately 50% of the total assets of the insurance sector of Cura\u00e7ao and St. Maarten. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) ENNIA's total assets are estimated to be greater than 50% of annual revenue of the government of Cura\u00e7ao and St. Maarten, and approximately 25% of the annual gross domestic product of Cura\u00e7ao and St. Maarten. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Furthermore, ENNIA is, to a large extent, responsible for the provision of pensions in Cura\u00e7ao. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   ENNIA's corporate structure includes at least two types of entities: Insurer Debtors and Asset Manager Debtors. The Insurer Debtors provide insurance products and are subject to the regulatory authority of the CBCS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) The Insurer Debtors have invested most of their assets with the Asset Manager Debtors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Relevant Cura\u00e7ao Law\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Cura\u00e7ao is a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. (Declaration of Professor Arthur Hartkamp, ECF Doc. # 51, Ex. B-4 (the \"Hartkamp Declaration\"), \u00b6 22.) The codes of Cura\u00e7ao and the Netherlands share the same origins, contain a large number of almost identical articles, and have been developed in largely the same manner. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) The Supreme Court of the Netherlands is the highest court of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) The insolvency landscape in the Netherlands and Cura\u00e7ao is significantly similar. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Cura\u00e7aoan insolvency code, the\n   <em>\n    Faillissementsbesluit 1931\n   </em>\n   (which means \"Bankruptcy Decree 1931\"), contains the following two insolvency proceedings: the\n   <em>\n    faillissement\n   </em>\n   (which means \"bankruptcy\") and\n   <em>\n    surseance van betaling\n   </em>\n   (which means \"suspension of payments\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Cura\u00e7aoan insolvency code allows for insurance companies to declare bankruptcy, but it does not permit insurance companies to initiate suspension of payment proceedings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) Instead, insurance companies may be restructured only through a special insolvency proceeding known as the\n   <em>\n    noodregeling\n   </em>\n   (\"which means, \"emergency regulation\" (\"Emergency Regulations\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Authorization for the Emergency Regulations is codified in the \"Landsverordening Toezicht Verzekeringsbedrijf\" (which means \"National Ordinance on the Supervision of the Insurance Industry\") (\"LTV\"). (Declaration of Sabine Altena, ECF Doc. # 6, \u00b6 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The CBCS is responsible for supervising insurance companies operating in Cura\u00e7ao and St. Maarten. (Foreign Representative Declaration \u00b6 6.) The CBCS has the power to revoke an insurer's license to practice insurance without court approval. If the CBCS revokes an insurer's license, it may petition a Cura\u00e7ao court to pronounce Emergency Regulations against an insurance company supervised by the CBCS. LTV Art. 60(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   When a petition for Emergency Regulations is filed, a Cura\u00e7ao court must hold a public hearing to decide whether to approve the Emergency Regulations \"with the utmost urgency.\" LTV Art. 60(4). Both the CBCS and the insurer must be heard. LTV Art. 60(6). Following the hearing, the Cura\u00e7ao court may pronounce the Emergency Regulations if \"the interest of the joint creditors of [the] insurer ... requires a special measure.\" LTV Art. 60(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   If the Cura\u00e7ao Court orders the Emergency Regulations, the LTV authorizes the CBCS to \"(a) liquidate all or part of the insurer's portfolio; (b) transfer all or part of the rights and liabilities resulting from or pursuant to any insurance contracts; or (c) restructure the business of the insurer.\" LTV Art. 60(2). The LTV directs the CBCS to \"exercise, exclusively, all powers of the directors, the members of the supervisory board or the representative of the insurer,\" and to \"look after the interests of the joint creditors.\" LTV Art. 63(1) and (2). The LTV also permits the CBCS to \"authorize the board of directors or the representative of the insurer to perform specific acts\" and to \"dismiss members of the board of directors, members of the supervisory board or the representative on behalf of the insurer.\" LTV Art. 63(4) and (5). Furthermore, any decisions by the insurer's shareholders or members require the approval of the CBCS. LTV Art. 63(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   While the Emergency Regulations are in effect, and with certain exceptions, \"the insurer cannot be forced to pay its debts that arose before the pronouncement, nor to pay its debts that arise after the pronouncement.\" LTV Art. 65(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Emergency Regulations allow the CBCS to modify insurance contracts in certain circumstances, though only after receiving court approval. LTV Art. 67(1). The CBCS also needs court approval to compensate professionals hired to exercise the CBCS' powers under the LTV. LTV Art. 63(8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   If the CBCS successfully restructures the insurer, it may request that the court withdraw the Emergency Regulations. LTV Art. 61(3). If it becomes apparent that the insurer's equity capital is negative and the objectives pursued under the\n   Emergency Regulations cannot be achieved, the CBCS must request bankruptcy on behalf of the insurer. LTV Art. 71(1). That essentially means that the debtor will be liquidated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Proceeding in Cura\u00e7ao\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Between 2015 and 2018, the CBCS and ENNIA had ongoing discussions to restructure ENNIA to comply with Cura\u00e7ao solvency requirements. (Declaration of Abdallah Andraous, ECF Doc. # 24-4, \"Andraous Declaration,\" \u00b6 6-8.) As of July 2018, the CBCS and ENNIA were unable to resolve these issues. (Foreign Representative Declaration \u00b6 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On July 3, 2018, the CBCS revoked the Insurer Debtors' insurance license\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and filed an order seeking application of the Emergency Regulations to the Insurer Debtors. (Andraous Declaration \u00b6 10.) Upon receipt of the application, the Court of First Instance of Cura\u00e7ao (\"Cura\u00e7ao Court\") scheduled a hearing for 10:00 A.M., July 4, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) The Foreign Debtors were given notice of the scheduled hearing, but at 10:30 A.M., the Foreign Debtors received notice that the Emergency Regulations hearing had been moved to 2:15 P.M. (Objection, at 10.) The Cura\u00e7ao court \"pronounce[d]\" the Emergency Regulations with respect to the Insurer Debtors and Asset Manager Debtors ECH and ECI at the hearing. (\"Cura\u00e7ao Court Opinion,\" ECF Doc. # 5, at 24.) The Cura\u00e7ao court extended the Emergency Regulations to EC Holding, the remaining Asset Manager Debtor, two days later. (Andraous Declaration \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Under the authority granted by the Cura\u00e7ao court, the CBCS removed all but one of the Insurer Debtors' board members and delegated management of the Insurer Debtors' day-to-day affairs to new management under a \"limited scope proxy.\" (Foreign Representative Declaration \u00b6 23.) The Foreign Representative claims that the CBCS \"has assumed control of the operations of the Debtors and is using such authority to recover assets of the Debtor and restructure the debts of the Debtors in a manner that is in the interest of the collective creditors of each Debtor.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On September 25, 2018, the CBCS appointed R.M. Hermans as the foreign representative of each of the Foreign Debtors to commence these chapter 15 cases. (Foreign Representative Declaration \u00b6 4.) The Foreign Representative filed the Petitions the same day. The Petitions ask the Court to (1) recognize the rehabilitation proceeding commenced by the Cura\u00e7ao court (the \"Proceeding\") as a foreign main proceeding, and (2) recognize R.M. Hermans as the foreign representative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Parman argues that recognition should be denied because (A) the Proceeding does not meet the definition of a foreign proceeding, and (B) recognition of the Proceeding would be manifestly contrary to the public policy of the United States. The Court is not persuaded by either argument. Accordingly, the Objection is overruled and the Petitions are\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Whether the Proceeding is a Foreign Proceeding\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Parman argues that the Proceeding cannot be recognized as a foreign main\n   proceeding. The Bankruptcy Code provides that, after notice and hearing, a court shall enter an order recognizing a foreign proceeding as a foreign main proceeding if (1) such foreign proceeding is a foreign main proceeding within the meaning of section 1502 of the Bankruptcy Code, (2) the foreign representative applying for recognition is a person or body, and (3) the petition meets the requirements of section 1515 of the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201517\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

First, Emergency Regulations may only be pronounced if a Cura\u00e7ao court finds that doing so would be in \"the interest of the joint creditors.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   LTV Art. 60(1); (Hartkamp Declaration \u00b6 38.) In fact, this is the only factor that the LTV instructs Cura\u00e7ao courts to consider.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LTV Art. 60(1). Second, the LTV explicitly mandates that the CBCS must \"look after the interests of the joint creditors\" while the Emergency Regulations are in place.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LTV Art. 63(2); (Hartkamp Declaration \u00b6 39.). Third, the LTV permits the CBCS to adopt a resolution, even if the resolution requires the approval of the company's shareholders or members and the shareholders or members do not approve it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LTV Art. 63(7). The Explanatory Memorandum to the LTV explains that this provision ensures that the CBCS can perform its tasks in the interests of the joint creditors. (Hartkamp Declaration \u00b6 40.) Finally, the LTV prohibits the CBCS from transferring a portion of the insurer's assets and liabilities if the transaction would prejudice the creditors whose liabilities remain.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LTV Art. 68 (\"Any transfer of rights and obligations pursuant to this chapter shall not prejudice the rights of the remaining creditors.\"); (Hartkamp Declaration \u00b6 41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Parman argues that the Proceeding is not collective in nature because it does not provide creditors with the right to participate. (Objection, at 14.) The Foreign Representative disputes whether creditors have a right to participate in the Proceeding. (\"Foreign Representative's Supplemental Brief,\" ECF Doc. # 50, \u00b6\u00b6 24-26.)

LTV Art. 60(6). The Cura\u00e7ao court in this case appears to have followed the instructions of its legislature. The Cura\u00e7ao court received an application for Emergency Regulations on July 3, 2018, initially scheduled a hearing on the matter for July 4, 2018 at 10:00 A.M., and then moved the hearing time to 2:15 P.M. The Cura\u00e7ao court did not issue a ruling until hearing from counsel for both the insurers and the CBCS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   This Court may not second guess the decision of the Cura\u00e7ao legislature or the Cura\u00e7ao court. To do so would be particularly inappropriate here, considering our States afford insurance companies with a similar amount of due process notice in insolvency proceedings. In the United States, the laws of several jurisdictions allow a regulator to seize an insurance company based on an order obtained\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 18 Del.

U.S. courts often grant temporary restraining orders and injunctions on four hours' notice (or less), if circumstances dictate.

While the LTV does not permit a direct appeal of the order pronouncing Emergency Regulations,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dutch law and Cura\u00e7ao law appear to provide procedures for challenging administrative or judicial determinations in certain situations even where statutes prohibit direct appeals. For instance, Dutch law permits appeals where the lower court has breached fundamental principles of law, such as the principle of due process. (Hartkamp Declaration \u00b6 74.) The Supreme Court of the Netherlands (the highest court that can review decisions of the courts in Cura\u00e7ao) also allows appeals if the lower court has misjudged the scope of a statute. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Parman also argues that recognition is inappropriate on foreign policy grounds because the \"Cura\u00e7ao Court lacked statutory authority over the non-regulated entities.\" (\"Supplemental Objection,\" ECF Doc. # 49, at 15.) Parman made and lost this argument in the court in Cura\u00e7ao. Therefore, this argument amounts to no more than an improper request for another bite of the apple.\n   <em>\n    SNP Boat Serv.

The Court concludes that Parman's argument is also an inaccurate statement of the law of Cura\u00e7ao and the Netherlands. In appropriate circumstances courts in those countries may extend emergency regulations to unregulated affiliates of insurance companies. (Hartkamp Declaration \u00b6 69-70.) The court in Cura\u00e7ao determined that the Emergency Regulations should be extended to the Insurer Debtors' unregulated affiliates.
