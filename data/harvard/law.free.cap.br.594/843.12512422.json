Attending the hearing were counsel for Microf, LLC (\"Microf\"), counsel for the Debtor Paul L. Cumbess (the \"Debtor\"), and Camille Hope, the Chapter 13 trustee (the \"Trustee\"). After the hearing, the parties were given time to submit post-hearing briefs. Microf and the Trustee did so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A proceeding to determine allowance of an administrative expense is a core proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A), (B), and (O). Having considered the parties' pleadings and arguments, the remainder of the record, and applicable legal authority, the Court states its findings of fact and conclusions of law in accordance\n   with Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure (\"Bankruptcy Rule\") 7052, which is made applicable through Bankruptcy Rule 9014(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Findings of Fact\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   No witnesses testified at the hearing, but the following facts are undisputed. In 2015, prior to filing of this case, the Debtor entered into a rental lease agreement (the \"Lease\") with Microf for HVAC equipment for his residence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Debtor filed his bankruptcy petition in August 2017 and his plan was confirmed a short while later (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 21). The confirmed plan provides for the Debtor's assumption of the Lease and states that the Debtor will be the disbursing agent to Microf (Doc. 21, \u00b6 2(m), (l) ). The confirmed plan also provides for the curing of pre-petition arrearage due to Microf, to be disbursed by the Trustee (Doc. 21, \u00b6 2(m) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As to estate property, the confirmed plan provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Unless otherwise ordered by the court, all property of the estate, whether in the possession of the trustee or the debtor, remains property of the estate subject to the court's jurisdiction, notwithstanding \u00a7 1327(b), except as otherwise provided in paragraph (m) above. Property of the estate not paid to the trustee shall remain in the possession of the debtor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (Doc. 21, \u00b6 2(p) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Several months after plan confirmation, the Debtor defaulted on payments due under the Lease. As of July 6, 2018, the Debtor owes $1,763.95 in arrearages on the Lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the hearing, the Debtor's attorney acknowledged that the Debtor has possession of the HVAC equipment, and that the Debtor \"is benefiting from its use.\" No evidence or other information about the Debtor's use of the HVAC equipment or any other heating or cooling equipment was offered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The question before the Court is whether the amounts due for post-confirmation missed Lease payments qualify as administrative expenses under \u00a7 503(b)(1)(A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Conclusions of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Summary\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Microf asserts that the bankruptcy code and applicable case law provide that a debtor's post-confirmation default under a lease assumed in a chapter 13 plan gives rise to the lessor's administrative expense claim for damages. Microf seeks the allowance of an administrative expense for its claim and, if necessary, an order requiring a modified plan to provide for the payment of that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Trustee opposes this motion, arguing primarily that (1) the Debtor's use of the leased HVAC equipment does not meet the \"actual, necessary costs and expenses of preserving the estate\" standard of \u00a7 503(b)(1)(A), and (2) even if the Lease payments were actual and necessary to preserve the estate, Microf's claim is already classified in the plan and cannot now-post-confirmation-be reclassified as an administrative expense, as such reclassification would unfairly grant priority to\n   Microf's claim ahead of other creditors' claims. The Trustee also recites several policy and practical concerns that she suggests should weigh against Microf's Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Debtor takes no position as to whether the missed Lease payments qualify as administrative expenses, but expresses concern about the mechanics, method, and payment schedule of both the current arrears and any future arrears. The Debtor opposes any order requiring plan modification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After due consideration, the Court holds that Microf has not met its burden with respect to its Motion. Contrary to Microf's assertion, the Court finds that an administrative expense claim does not arise automatically from the default under a lease assumed by a debtor in a chapter 13 plan. Therefore, to establish an administrative expense claim, Microf must demonstrate that the subject of the assumed lease-here, the HVAC equipment-was an actual and necessary expense for the preservation of the estate. Microf has failed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Standard and Burden of Proof\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Section 503 establishes the standard for allowance of administrative expenses.

To the contrary, in that case, the court held that an administrative claim\n   <em>\n    does not\n   </em>\n   automatically arise from a post-petition breach of a lease assumed under a chapter 13 plan.\n   <em>\n    In re Michalek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3736474\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/393/642/\">\n    393 B.R. 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 644, 646 (\"I do not find support in the code for the proposition that a post-assumption breach automatically obligates the estate, or the plan, for damages from that breach....

As explained\n   below, the Court does not consider pre-2005 Chapter 11 cases helpful on the issue before the Court, due to the provisions of \u00a7 365(p)(1), enacted in 2005.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   With respect to the presumed benefit to the estate from an assumed lease, the Court is persuaded by a case to which no party cites.\n   <em>\n    In re Ruiz\n   </em>\n   , No. 09-38795-BKC-LMI,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%205305741\">\n    2012 WL 5305741\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. S.D. Fla. Feb. 15, 2012). The facts of\n   <em>\n    In re Ruiz\n   </em>\n   are analogous to ours-a lessor sought an administrative expense claim for post-confirmation default under a lease assumed by the debtor in a chapter 13 plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. The plan provided that the debtor rather than the trustee would make the lease payments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. Upon default, the lessor filed a motion seeking allowance of an administrative expense.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. The court denied the lessor's motion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   It its analysis, the court weighed the historical presumption of benefit to the estate by the assumption of a lease, against requiring a lease claimant to demonstrate an \"actual, concrete benefit to the estate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2. The court took issue with the historical practice of presuming benefit because the 2005 enactment of \u00a7 365(p) (as part of BAPCPA) gave rise to a meaningful distinction between the assumption of a lease by a debtor and the assumption of a lease by a Chapter 13 trustee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3. The court focused on the interplay between \u00a7\u00a7 365(d)(2), (p)(1), and 1322(b)(7) and concluded that when the debtor assumed the lease at plan confirmation under \u00a7 1322(b)(7), the lease was no longer property of the estate by operation of \u00a7 365(p)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1-2. The court reasoned that because \u00a7 365(p)(1) had removed the leased property from the estate, the lessor must show \"actual, concrete benefit to the estate\" to prevail on its request for administrative claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court concluded that the debtor, rather than the estate, was responsible for the default amounts owing under the lease.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The logic of\n   <em>\n    Ruiz\n   </em>\n   applies to this case, as to this issue. Under \u00a7 365(d)(2), the Trustee could have assumed the Lease at any time\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   plan confirmation. Because the Trustee did not do so, however, \u00a7 365(p)(1) took effect, removing the HVAC equipment from the estate and terminating the automatic stay with respect thereto.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly,\n   when the Debtor's plan was confirmed and the Lease assumed under \u00a7 1322(b)(7), the HVAC equipment had already ceased to be property of the estate and was no longer protected by the automatic stay.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court agrees with\n   <em>\n    Ruiz,\n   </em>\n   that the relevant code sections should preclude the finding of any presumed or automatic benefit to the estate by virtue of the Lease assumption.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Michalek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3736474\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/393/642/\">\n    393 B.R. 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 646 (Bankr.
