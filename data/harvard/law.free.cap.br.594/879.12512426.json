Hunt, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   At issue before the court is the purely legal question of whether the law of this Circuit still holds that only unpaid new value can be used by a creditor to reduce preference liability under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(4)(B). After reviewing the parties' cross-motions for partial summary judgment and the applicable case law, the court concludes the answer to that question is yes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Background\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The parties agree on the salient facts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Debtor Calumet Photographic, Inc. (\"debtor\"), filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy relief on March 12, 2014, and plaintiff Catherine Steege was appointed as case trustee (\"Trustee\"). In March 2016, the Trustee filed this adversary proceeding against defendant Canon U.S.A., Inc. (\"Canon\"), to avoid nearly $3 million in preferential payments made by debtor to Canon during the 90-days preceding the bankruptcy filing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Canon responded to the complaint with new value and ordinary course defenses. Fact discovery concluded in January 2018, and expert discovery closed several months thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Canon then moved for partial summary judgment on its new value defense pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(4)(B), which allows a creditor to offset its net preference liability by the amount of subsequent new value it provided to the debtor during the preference period. The parties agree that the new value for which the debtor never paid amounts to $1,351,792, although there is apparently an additional $124,311 in \"unapplied credit memos\" in dispute. The primary disagreement, at this point, involves the remainder of new value-$803,932-which Canon contends was paid by avoidable transfers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Canon argues that a recent decision,\n   <em>\n    In re OneStar Long Distance, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265291,12269862\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/526/\">\n    872 F.3d 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2017), expands application of the new value defense to allow offset \"where debtor either never pays for the new value or makes an otherwise avoidable payment.\" (Canon Mem. at 5-6, Dkt. # 72). In other words, Canon asserts that its preference exposure may be reduced by both the new value\n   <strong>\n    unpaid\n   </strong>\n   by the debtor at the petition date\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the new value\n   <strong>\n    paid\n   </strong>\n   by the debtor with avoidable transfers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Trustee opposes Canon's motion and has cross-moved for summary judgment on this point, citing\n   <em>\n    In re Prescott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1111610,6123543\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/805/719/\">\n    805 F.2d 719\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 1986) and later cases, as binding precedent affirming that the Seventh Circuit adheres to the \"remains unpaid rule,\" whereby only\n   <strong>\n    unpaid\n   </strong>\n   new value can reduce preference liability. (Trustee Resp. at 3-4, Dkt. # 83). In its reply brief, Canon challenges the Trustee's interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Prescott\n   </em>\n   -a case Canon curiously did not mention in its opening brief-as inconsistent with the \"plain and unambiguous language\" of Section 547(c)(4) and that provision's statutory history, as well as important policy considerations behind the new value defense. (Canon Rep. at 12-13, Dkt. # 87). The court has considered the well-reasoned arguments on both sides and concludes that the Trustee has the better position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Analysis\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

The dispute between the parties, then, centers on whether binding precedent interpreting the relevant statutory language also encompasses\n   <strong>\n    paid\n   </strong>\n   new value. Where \"the only issue before the court is the meaning of a statutory phrase,\" resolution of that legal question on summary judgment is appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Local 1239 v.

Two distinct viewpoints have emerged among the Circuits with respect to interpretation of that language.

The opinion continues with a citation to two additional bankruptcy cases in support of the rule,\n   <em>\n    In re Formed Tubes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6114786\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/46/645/\">\n    46 B.R. 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr.

Lower courts in this district have likewise followed suit.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re GGSI Liquidation, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9216584\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/313/770/#p777\">\n    313 B.R. 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 777 (Bankr.

Indeed, the bankruptcy court in\n   <em>\n    GGSI Liquidation\n   </em>\n   soundly rejected the creditor's argument that \"the law in this circuit does not require new value to remain unpaid.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9216584\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/313/770/#p777\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9216584\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/313/770/#p777\">\n    at 778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Nevertheless, the Seventh Circuit \"remains unpaid\" rule is the minority viewpoint among the Circuits. In\n   <em>\n    In re BFW Liquidation, LLC\n   </em>\n   , the Eleventh Circuit recently concluded that its prior precedent reciting the\n   <em>\n    Prescott\n   </em>\n   statutory requirements was nonbinding dicta, and held, instead, that \"so long as the transfer that pays for the new value is itself avoidable, that transfer is not a barrier to assertion of \u00a7 547(c)(4)'s subsequent-new-value defense.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518043\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/1178/#p1189\">\n    899 F.3d 1178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1189 (11th Cir. 2018). The court described that holding as being on \"common ground with the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518043\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/1178/#p1189\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , and \"in contrast\" to the Seventh and Third Circuits that still \"require new value to remain unpaid.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518043\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/1178/#p1189\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518043\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/1178/#p1189\">\n    at 1189, n.9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Significantly, the Eleventh Circuit asserted that \"[s]ince [\n   <em>\n    Prescott\n   </em>\n   in 1986), \"the Seventh Circuit has continued to follow that approach.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518043\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/1178/#p1189\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518043\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/1178/#p1189\">\n    at 1189, n.9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Canon nonetheless insists that language in the Seventh Circuit's 2017\n   <em>\n    OneStar\n   </em>\n   decision indicates that the court has, in fact, shifted to the majority approach, but that is not so. In discussing the standard for excepting preferential transfers from avoidance under \u00a7 547(c)(4), the court explained\n   that \"[i]f the debtor pays for the creditor's new value (and that payment isn't itself avoidable), then the new value is canceled out. That leaves only the preferential payment that \u00a7 547 is designed to address in the first place.\"\n   <em>\n    OneStar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265291,12269862\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/526/\">\n    872 F.3d at 530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Canon latches on to that parenthetical note as evidence of the court's change in position, (Canon Rep. at 4-5), but reading further in the opinion clearly demonstrates that Canon is taking that phrase out of context. Indeed, the court continues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Accordingly, the Code disallows the new-value defense when 'on account of the new value, the debtor responds with 'otherwise unavoidable transfer to or for the benefit of [the] creditor.' \u00a7 547(c)(4)(B). That is,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     the new value must remain unpaid in order to reduce the creditor's preference liability.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   (emphasis supplied).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265291,12269862\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/872/526/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In sum, the Seventh Circuit in\n   <em>\n    OneStar\n   </em>\n   certainly referenced the statutory language, which plausibly could be read as the majority of Circuits have done to include new value paid with avoidable transfers, but then reaffirmed its position that only unpaid new value counts. Thus, Canon's reliance on\n   <em>\n    OneStar\n   </em>\n   is misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In conclusion, Canon raises a number of interesting policy considerations for allowing both unpaid and paid new value to offset preference liability. (Canon Rep. at 12-14). After all, the preference defenses are designed \"to encourage creditors to continue to sell on credit to a buyer slipping into bankruptcy and perhaps prevent the bankruptcy altogether.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Deborah L. Thorne,\n   <em>\n    Inequality Among Preference Defendants: How Is That Fair?\n   </em>\n   , Am. Bankr. Inst. J., Nov. 2014, at 24. And as the other Circuits have concluded, the \"remains unpaid\" rule is arguably inconsistent with that goal.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BFW Liquidation, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518043\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/899/1178/#p1189\">\n    899 F.3d at 1192-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But that is clearly not the interpretation of \u00a7 547(c)(4) that the Seventh Circuit has adopted.
