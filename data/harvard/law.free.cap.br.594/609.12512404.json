R. Bankr. P. 3007, to Claim No. 16-1 filed in this case on behalf of U.S. Bank National Association as trustee on behalf of the holders of CSMC Mortgage-Backed Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2007-1 (\"U.S. Bank\"). The Claim Objection accurately states that in a prior case under the Bankruptcy Code of Debtor Jack Pinnock (Case No. 11-22011 (RDD) ), U.S. Bank filed a motion for relief from the automatic stay under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) that the Court denied by an order dated December 10, 2012 based on U.S. Bank's failure to produce any evidence (a) that it was the holder of the underlying note or (b) that the underlying mortgage on the Debtor's property in the Bronx, New York (the \"Property\") had been properly recorded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit\n   <em>\n    B\n   </em>\n   to the Claim Objection. The lift-stay motion attached a note issued by the Debtors to First Meridian Mortgage, A Limited Liability Company (\"First Meridian\") that contained no subsequent indorsements (the \"Note\"), and, notwithstanding being given several months to produce evidence of its standing to enforce the Note, U.S. Bank failed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In the Debtors' present case under the Bankruptcy Code, U.S. Bank's Proof of Claim No. 16-1, dated February 20, 2017, attached the Note\n   <em>\n    along with an undated document titled \"Allonge to Promissory Note\" purporting to be indorsed in blank by First Meridian\n   </em>\n   (the \"Allonge\"). Proof of Claim No. 16-1 also attached a Corporate Assignment of Mortgage, dated July 9, 2013, pursuant to which Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (\"MERS\"), purportedly \"as nominee for First Meridian Mortgage Its Successors And Assigns,\" assigned the mortgage at issue, \"together with all moneys now owing or that may hereafter become due in respect thereof,\" to U.S. Bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Claim Objection contends that the Allonge is not a proper allonge under NY U.C.C. \u00a7 3-202(2) because it was not \"firmly affixed\" to the Note as required by such section\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and as evidenced by the fact that\n   it was not attached to the prior lift-stay motion. The Claim Objection further states that the Allonge and the purported assignment of the mortgage were prepared by Richmond Monroe Group, a company whose website states that it \"prepares allonge[s]\" among other documents for lenders and has a hyperlink to its services for \"preparation of missing/intervening assignments,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Exhibit\n   <em>\n    C\n   </em>\n   to the Claim Objection, and therefore also contends that the Allonge and assignment were fraudulent. Further, the Claim Objection contends that MERS had no authority to assign the underlying debt to U.S. Bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Based on these allegations, the Debtors contend that U.S. Bank lacks the ability to enforce the Note and, accordingly, the underlying mortgage under New York law and, therefore, that Claim No. 16-1 should be disallowed and expunged. The Claim Objection further seeks an order declaring the lien securing the Note void pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20506\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   including as recorded on behalf of the original lender by MERS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After due notice, the Court held the initial hearing on the Claim Objection on May 23, 2018. Although U.S. Bank had not filed a response to the Claim Objection, notwithstanding the passage of over three months since service, at the initial hearing its counsel requested more time to do so. The Court therefore set June 4, 2018 as the objection deadline, adjourned the hearing on the Claim Objection, and informed counsel for U.S. Bank that by the deadline it would need to provide extrinsic evidence supporting its contention that it was the holder or transferee entitled to enforce the Note and, therefore, the mortgage under New York law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   U.S. Bank never filed a response to the Claim Objection. Instead, at the adjourned hearing on the Claim Objection, which was ultimately held on September 26, 2018, counsel for U.S. Bank only (a) handed the Court a separate page that appeared to be the original signed Allonge but which was not firmly attached to the Note, which counsel also handed to the Court, and (b) asserted that U.S. Bank had physical possession of the Note. Counsel made no showing, however, as to how, when or from whom U.S. Bank obtained the Note. Nor did U.S. Bank demonstrate MERS's authority to act on First Meridian's behalf with respect to any rights under the Note, as opposed to the mortgage. Nevertheless, counsel for U.S. Bank contended that U.S. Bank could enforce the Note and mortgage because it possessed the Note.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This Memorandum of Decision states the Court's reasons for concluding that U.S. Bank is not entitled to enforce the Note, and therefore the mortgage, under New York law. It also states why the Debtors' request under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20506\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) is too broad and that the proper relief under that section is to declare U.S. Bank's lien on the Property void but not to declare void the original mortgage on the\n   Property in the hands of any party other than U.S. Bank, its successors and assigns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction over the Claim Objection pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) - (b) and 1334(b), as a core proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(B) that the Court may determine by a final order under the United States Constitution because it involves the core bankruptcy function of the allowance or disallowance of claims and liens against the Debtors' estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

Under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3001(f), a proof of claim that complies with the Bankruptcy Rules constitutes prima facie evidence of the validity and amount of the claim. Here, Proof of Claim No. 16-1 conforms to the official claim form and attaches the supporting documents -- the Note, mortgage, and evidence of recordation -- required by Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3001(c), thus entitling it to a presumption of validity.

New York law is clear that a party can establish itself as the \"holder\" of a negotiable instrument\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   entitled to enforce it\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   it complies with NY U.C.C. \u00a7 3-202(1), which provides,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Negotiation is the transfer of an instrument in such form that the transferee becomes a holder.

NY U.C.C. \u00a7 3-301. Thus U.S. Bank would clearly be entitled to enforce the Note under NY U.C.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-201(21), 3-202(1) and 3-301 if the Note were specifically indorsed by the prior owner, First Meridian to U.S. Bank and U.S. Bank possessed the Note (which is not the case here, as the Note is not specifically endorsed by First Meridian to U.S. Bank) or if it possessed the Note indorsed in blank by First Meridian (as U.S. Bank argues is the case here based on the Allonge).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Arnold v.

As discussed above, the term \"holder\" has a specific definition under the N.Y.
