On November 3, 2017, the Plaintiffs Anthony (sometimes herein referred to as \"Tony\") Recanati and Sergio Recanati (hereinafter \"Plaintiffs\" unless otherwise stated) filed their Complaint alleging the nondischargeability of the debt(s) owed by Debtor, Anna Roberts, to Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs' Complaint consists of two causes of action: Count I, a request for declaratory judgment that the debt owed by Debtor was obtained by fraud under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4) ; and Count II, for fraud in the inducement based on Debtor's alleged false statements made with the intent to deceive the Plaintiffs and induce them to rely on Debtor's allegedly false assertions that she had the ability and intent to pay off the debts and liabilities of Jomarser, Inc., d/b/a Recanati's Italian Restaurant (hereinafter \"the Company\" or \"Recanati's\" or \"the Restaurant\"), pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4) and (6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The events that led up to this case occurred on December 21, 2010 when Plaintiffs and Debtor entered into a written Stock Sale and Purchase Agreement (hereinafter \"the Agreement\"), wherein Debtor agreed to purchase and Plaintiffs agreed to sell all of Plaintiffs' interest in the Company. The Debtor was not obligated on any of the company debts prior to the December 21, 2010 signing date, and the conduct\n   of the parties before December 21 is relevant to the Court's analysis set out below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Debtor retired from the United States Postal Service (hereinafter \"Post Office\") in late 2013. (Doc. 42 at 92). Her annual salary was approximately $65,000.00 to $70,000.00. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 84). During the latter year of her career at the Post Office, Debtor patronized the Restaurant and formed a relationship with Company owner Tony Recanati when the restaurant was located on Avalon Road. (Doc. 42 at 85). The Restaurant was also co-owned by Sergio Recanati and Anthony Recanati's sister, Cathy Ellis; however, the percentage of ownership is unclear from the pleadings and exhibits filed and the actual percentage is unnecessary for this Court to rule. At some point in early 2010, Debtor loaned Tony Recanati approximately $8,000.00 to help improve the restaurant. Debtor characterizes her role during this time period as a \"silent investor\" in the Restaurant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 87). Tony Recanati would run the Restaurant, and Debtor would loan the Restaurant money as needed. As a silent investor, Debtor paid the rent for the Restaurant, shopped for and purchased equipment for the Restaurant, used her personal funds to make payroll for the Restaurant, and helped with relocating the Restaurant to a new location on Highway 90. These loans by Debtor to the Restaurant totaled an approximate amount of $60,000.00, leading Debtor to conclude that the Restaurant was in an \"unbelievable\" amount of debt. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 84-87, 90, 91).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During Debtor's time as silent investor, she was responsible for maneuvering the BP claims process, which resulted in two separate payouts to the Company. The first payout was in the amount of $84,000.00. The second payout was in the amount of $25,000.00, and will be discussed further below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Because Debtor was the person responsible for handling the claim, when BP distributed the first claim payout, it incorrectly released the $84,000.00 to the Debtor's personal checking account through her social security number, instead of to the Company through its EIN Number. (Doc. 42 at 40). However, as soon as the mistake was discovered, the money was removed from Debtor's personal checking account and placed into the Company's business account on October 21, 2010. (Doc. 42 at 41). Distributions from the first payout were then made to the then shareholders of the Company, Tony Recanati, Sergio Recanati and their sister Cathy Ellis. (Doc. 42 at 42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Sometime in mid-2010, Cathy Ellis began to suggest that she and the Debtor should buy out Tony Recanati from the Restaurant because he was \"running it into the ground\" by not coming to work but receiving a salary of $750.00 per week. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 94-95). The Debtor agreed, and negotiations began for Debtor to purchase the Restaurant from Tony Recanati, Sergio Recanati, and Cathy Ellis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    The Stock Purchase Agreement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On December 21, 2010, the Debtor signed the Stock Purchase Agreement. (Doc. 42-3 at 13). As consideration for the contract, Debtor agreed to assume all debts, liabilities, and obligations of the Company thereby relieving Plaintiffs of the same, to forgive the personal debts of Plaintiff Tony Recanati, and to have all personal guarantees, loans, and vendor agreements paid off or assumed by Debtor within thirty (30) days of the closing on the purported \"stock purchase.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 42-3 at\n   14). The debts and liabilities included a line of credit with Regions Bank, a note payable to Regions Bank, an oil spill bridge loan with Pen Air Federal Credit Union, a balance to the U.S. Food Service, and back tax payments. (Doc. 42-3 at 14). There were approximately $155,717.32 in liabilities, and approximately $35,236.00 in assets of the Company. Also as part of the transaction, the parties agreed that the forthcoming $25,000.00 payout from the Company's oil spill claim would go toward paying off the abovementioned debts and liabilities. The transaction also required that Debtor forgive all personal debts owed to Debtor by Anthony Recanati and Cathy Ellis, which Debtor accomplished. (Doc. 42-3 at 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In early 2011, after becoming the sole owner of the Company, Debtor opened a new bank account for the Company in an effort to better keep track of money coming in and going out. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45, 99). Soon after, the Restaurant received its anticipated second BP claim payout in the amount of $25,000.00. This second payout was deposited into the new Restaurant bank account and, in compliance with the Agreement, was used catch up back rent, vendor accounts, taxes and other debts that Debtor was unaware of were owed by the Company. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 99-102). The Restaurant stayed open for approximately another year until sometime in 2012, when the liquor license expired, and Debtor no longer had any income to keep it open. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 104).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At some point within 30 days of signing the Agreement, Debtor acknowledged in an undated writing that by signing the Agreement the debts therein became her sole responsibility. (Doc. 42-1 at 18). The writing is addressed to \"To whom it may concern.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In another undated writing, Debtor requested an \"extension of time to obtain financing to meet the requirements of the original purchase agreement due to complications arising from funding sources.\" (Doc. 42-1 at 19). The writing is not addressed to a specific person, but has Anthony Recanati's name at the bottom, presumably where he would be expected to sign. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The writing requests an additional 30 days from January 21 to comply with the Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On January 26, 2011, it appears that Anthony Recanati wrote by hand that the \"extension is specific to the U.S. Foods, Regions Bank, and Penair debts\" only. (Doc. 42-1 at 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    The State Court Lawsuit\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On August 14, 2013, Tony Recanati and Sergio Recanati filed a lawsuit against the Debtor in the Circuit Court of Santa Rosa County, Florida (hereinafter, \"State Court\"). The Complaint alleges three causes of action: Count I Breach of Contract, Count II Fraud in the Inducement, and Count III Unjust Enrichment. In her answer, Debtor denied the allegations raised in the Complaint. On March 11, 2014, the Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment on all three Counts alleging that summary judgment was due to be granted on the grounds that Debtor \"failed to perform her obligations under the Agreement by failing to pay the debts and liabilities of the Company, by failing to assume the obligations of the Company, and by failing to allocate the proceeds from the oil spill settlement as agreed.\" (Doc. 42-3 at 2). On September 23, 2014, the State Court held a hearing and entered an order on the motion stating that the motion was \"granted in part ... and the Court finds that the [Debtor] breached the subject contract and therefore grants the Motion for Summary Judgment as to liability, only.\" (Doc. 42-4 at 1). The State\n   Court reserved ruling on the amount of damages, fees, and costs pending separate hearing on the same. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On February 10, 2015, the State Court entered a Final Summary Judgment in favor the Recanatis and against the Debtor stating that the rent payments claimed were satisfied, but that Debtor was responsible for the payroll and sales taxes, \"the Penn Air Bridge Loan, the Regions Bank Line of Credit, the Regions Bank account, and the Brady Lo loan.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). The Order further directs where payment should be delivered to and the remaining terms of payment of the judgment. The last paragraph of the Order states that the State Court reserves jurisdiction to enforce the \"Final Judgment in this matter.\" At the top of the Order, it appears that Plaintiffs recorded this Judgment on February 11, 2015; however this Court makes no finding as to whether the recording was proper. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Plaintiffs encountered problems enforcing the judgment against Debtor and on October 13, 2016, they recommenced the State Court action alleging that Debtor engaged in multiple fraudulent transfers of real property in an attempt to evade her creditors and sought avoidance of those alleged transfers therein. (Doc. 42-5 at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    The Petition for Relief and Adversary Proceeding\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On May 8, 2017, Debtor filed for Chapter 7 relief. On May 9, 2017, a suggestion of bankruptcy was filed in the State Court case, of which no substantive proceedings had taken place since it was recommenced on October 13, 2016. On November 3, 2017, Tony Recanati and Sergio Recanati initiated this adversary proceeding by filing their Complaint to determine the dischargeability of the debts owed to them pursuant to the State Court Final Judgment. The Complaint alleges two causes of action pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4) and (6). Count I requests a declaratory judgment that the debt owed by the Debtor was obtained by fraud and thus should be found nondischargeable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Count II is for fraud in the inducement alleging that Debtor had no ability or intention to pay or assume the debts and liabilities of the Company, and made false statements with the intent to deceive and induce reliance by Plaintiffs in order to obtain the stock and gain control of the Company. Count II is pled pursuant to \u00a7 523(a)(4) and (6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   However the nature of the facts and the request for relief as pled would more properly fall under Section 523(a)(2)(A), which renders a debt nondischargeable if it was incurred under false pretenses, false representations, or actual fraud. Because the State Court did not expressly state that fraud was or was not present in its Final Order on Summary Judgment, and, in an effort to provide a fair and final analysis of the issues raised herein, this Court will apply Sections (a)(2)(A), (a)(4) and (a)(6) to the facts as pled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Motions for summary judgment are governed by FED.

The case law interpreting \u00a7 523(a) requires a strict construction in favor of the Debtor, whereas the case law interpreting Rule 56 requires the Court to construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Given that the case law interpreting the bankruptcy statute provides a more specific standard of review regarding exceptions to discharge, this Court concludes that the specific bankruptcy statute interpretation controls. Therefore, applying the concept of specific over general in this case, and pursuant to the case law interpreting \u00a7 523(a), this Court strictly construes the evidence against the objecting party and liberally in favor of the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) False Pretenses, False Representations and Actual Fraud\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that the Debtor made misrepresentations to them regarding her intent and ability to pay off or assume the debts and liabilities of the Company and that she intended to deceive them in order to gain control of the Company from Plaintiffs.

M.D. Fla. 2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Having considered the record and the evidence before it, this Court finds that Plaintiffs have failed to prove that Debtor engaged in materially deceptive conduct intended to deceive Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs failed to establish any evidence that, when Debtor signed the Agreement, she knew she could not perform the terms of the contract, or had no intention of performing them. Instead, the evidence reflects that Debtor believed in keeping the Restaurant alive, and intended to keep it going by complying with her end of the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Prior to her signing the Agreement, the evidence reflects that Debtor funneled in excess of $50,000.00 into the restaurant as a \"silent investor.\" (Doc. 42 at 91). She assisted Plaintiffs in relocating the Restaurant in hopes of finding more success in a better location, and purchased costly equipment, tables and chairs to get the Restaurant up and running at the new location. She also testified that despite the amount of debt the Company was in, she believed in the business and signing the Agreement was her genuine effort to keep the Restaurant operative. (Doc. 42 at 50, 94). The Court finds Debtor's behavior to be generous; not deceptive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   After signing the Agreement, Plaintiffs were contractually free from the obligations of the Company and those obligations thereafter rested on the shoulders of the Debtor. (Doc. 42-1 at 18). During the year that she was able to keep the Restaurant afloat, Debtor suffered the consequences of Plaintiffs' prior actions by having to pay the food vendor, U.S. Foods., in cash before they would deliver food to the Restaurant because U.S. Foods was so upset with the previous owners (Plaintiffs). (Doc. 42 at 63). Meanwhile, Debtor negotiated a second BP claim, which generated proceeds of approximately $25,000.00, which she used entirely to pay off Restaurant debt and rent. It was only after the liquor license expired that she determined she personally no longer had the funds to operate the business and she shut it down. (Doc. 42 at 104).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The evidence presented regarding Debtor's behavior and intent when she signed the Agreement is compelling, and, considering it in conjunction with the record as a whole, this Court finds that there is no genuine issue of material fact on which a trial might be held regarding Debtor's alleged fraud. There is no evidence that when Debtor signed the Agreement, that\n   she knew she could not fulfill it or had no intention of fulfilling it. There is no evidence that she engaged in any materially deceptive conduct intended to induce Plaintiffs into signing over their interests in the Restaurant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Further, a thorough review of the Agreement itself establishes that there was no requirement therein for the Debtor to have the funding, or a letter of credit, in place in order to comply with the terms of the Agreement. Plaintiffs have presented no evidence whatsoever that Debtor made any false, incorrect, or misleading statement that she\n   <em>\n    had\n   </em>\n   obtained or was substantially certain that she\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   obtain the proper financing to comply with the Agreement. There is no provision to this effect; rather, the Agreement expressly states that such payoff or assumption must occur \"within 30 business days of the closing date of this agreement.\" (Doc. 42-3 at 14). There was no mention at all, in the Agreement or otherwise, that Debtor had to have or did have the proper financing in place prior to signing the Agreement. The fact that she was unable to secure financing thereafter may place her in breach of the contract, but it does not evidence any fraud on her part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Because Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate the first element of fraud, the Court will not address the remaining elements, and, any requested relief pursuant to \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) must be denied. Therefore, having considered the evidence presented and determining that no genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Debtor engaged in fraud in signing the Agreement, this Court hereby finds that summary judgment is due to be entered against Plaintiffs and in favor of Debtor on the allegation of fraud under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    \u00a7 523(a)(4) Fraud in A Fiduciary Capacity\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiffs assert in their Complaint that by handling the proceeds of the BP oil spill claim, a fiduciary relationship was established between Debtor and Plaintiffs, and was violated when Debtor allegedly used the claim proceeds for her own benefit. Section 523(a)(4) excepts from discharge any debt that was obtained by debtor by fraud or defalcation while acting a fiduciary capacity, embezzlement, or larceny. Having considered the facts presented, this Court finds there is no genuine issue of material fact regarding Debtor's handling of the claim proceeds, that there was no fiduciary relationship between her and Plaintiffs, and if there was, that she did not violate said relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \"To establish fraud while acting in a fiduciary capacity, one must show (1) that the debt results from a fiduciary's defalcation under an express or technical trust; (2) that the debtor acted in a fiduciary capacity with respect to the trust; and (3) that the transaction in question is a defalcation [or fraud] within the meaning of bankruptcy law.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Migell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201174890\">\n    2018 WL 1174890\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (Bankr.

Even if it did exist, this Court finds that the evidence reflects that Debtor properly handled the $25,000.00 BP claim proceeds by paying Restaurant debts as soon as the money was distributed. There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever that Debtor used the proceeds for personal gain. Therefore, even if it can be found that a fiduciary relationship existed based on these facts, this Court finds that Debtor did not breach the alleged fiduciary relationship. Accordingly, this Court finds that summary judgment is due to be and hereby is entered against Plaintiffs and in favor of Debtor on the \u00a7 523(a)(4) claims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3270512,3281107\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/451/813/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20524\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(6) Willful or Malicious Injury\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   To succeed under Section 523(a)(6), a creditor must prove that the injury at issue is both willful and malicious.\n   <em>\n    In re Carter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512335\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/593/354/#p364\">\n    593 B.R. 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 364,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204945128\">\n    2018 WL 4945128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (Bankr.

Debtor sought at least one extension due to funding issues, but no evidence was presented that Debtor lacked the requisite intent to perform the Agreement, and no evidence\n   was presented that she acted with willful or malicious intent to injure Plaintiffs.
