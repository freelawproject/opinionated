Nov. 19, 2018), this Court denied summary judgment where the plaintiff relied primarily on the debtor's Rule 2004 examination testimony to support its motion for summary judgment because the examination did not qualify as a \"deposition\" taken under Rule 7030 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure (\"Rule\n   7030\") that can be used as evidence in an adversary proceeding under Rule 7056(c)(1)(A) of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure (\"Rule 7056(c)(1)(A)\") and because the Court was unable to determine from the record whether there was any prejudice to the debtor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Like a Rule 2004 examination, the meeting of creditors is broad in scope.

In deciding whether there is no genuine dispute on the merits of BancorpSouth's dischargeability claim, the Court declines to consider the Meeting of Creditors Transcript that is broad in nature and that lacks the safeguards and protections of the discovery rules, absent an agreement between the parties to the contrary that is evident from the record. The Court next addresses whether BancorpSouth has shown that no genuine dispute exists as to its dischargeability claim without the use of the Meeting of Creditors Transcript.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

A bankruptcy court cannot declare a debt nondischargeable until the creditor establishes the existence and amount of that debt. It does not appear that any judgment has been entered against the Debtor for the amount due under the Promissory Note (the \"Note\") (Adv. Dkt. 1 at 6-7). The Summary Judgment Motion thus involves a two-step process: (1) the establishment of the debt owed BancorpSouth under Mississippi law and (2) a determination of the dischargeability of that debt under bankruptcy law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morrison v.

(B. Ex. D &amp; Adv. Dkt. 1 at 6-7). BancorpSouth secured the loan by the Commercial Guaranty (B. Ex. B) signed by the Debtor and by the Commercial Pledge Agreement (B. Ex. C), which granted to BancorpSouth a security interest in the Debtor's investment accounts. The Debtor defaulted under the Note (B. Ex. D) and, as of May 15, 2018, BancorpSouth asserts that Airlock, or the Debtor pursuant to the guaranty, owes BancorpSouth \"$154,697.68, which consist[s] of principal in the amount of $146,064.19, accrued interest in the amount of $7,252.49, late charges of $250.00, other charges of $1,131.00, plus reasonable attorneys' fees as provided for by the terms of the Note ...

It is thus premature to examine the reasonableness of the amount of the attorneys' fees requested or to determine the amount to which BancorpSouth is contractually entitled to recover under the Note. The Court does, however, find that BancorpSouth has established the existence and amount of the debt owed and now will examine the debt's dischargeability under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Section 523(a)(2)(A) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (a) A discharge under section 727 ... of this title does not discharge an individual debtor from any debt-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (2) for money, property, services, or an extension, renewal, or refinancing of credit, to the extent obtained by-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (A) false pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud, other than a statement respecting the debtor's or an insider's financial condition[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A). There are three (3) independent grounds for nondischargeability listed in \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A). BancorpSouth asserts that the Debtor's debt to it is nondischargeable under both the false representation and actual fraud grounds. (Adv. Dkt. 12 at 5). BancorpSouth bears the burden of proving the nondischargeability of the Debtor's debt by a preponderance of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grogan v.
