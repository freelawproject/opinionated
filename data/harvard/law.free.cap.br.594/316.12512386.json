(\"NCVA\" or \"Debtor\") commenced the underlying bankruptcy case by filing a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 7 on January 7, 2015. Plaintiff serves as the duly appointed chapter 7 trustee under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20701\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and 702(d). Sara A. Conti, as chapter 7 trustee of Debtor (\"Plaintiff\") commenced this adversary proceeding against Fidelity on August 3, 2015. Compl., ECF No. 1. In response, Fidelity filed its answer and counterclaim, ECF No. 5, and a third party complaint against Dealers. ECF No. 6. Plaintiff timely filed her answer to the counterclaim. ECF No. 33. Plaintiff subsequently filed her motion to amend the complaint, seeking to add Dealers\n   as a party defendant and to assert various claims against Dealers. ECF No. 63.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court allowed the amendment in part and denied it in part by Memorandum Opinion (\"Amendment Opinion\") and Order. ECF Nos. 84, 85. Plaintiff filed her consolidated Amended Complaint, ECF No. 88, against both Fidelity and Dealers. The Amended Complaint asserts a claim against Dealers for breach of contract,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and asserts claims against Fidelity for conspiracy, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, constructive and actual fraud, unfair and deceptive trade practices, aiding and abetting conversion, and unjust enrichment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Both Defendants filed motions to dismiss the Amended Complaint, which the Court denied in its second Memorandum Opinion and Order (\"Dismissal Opinion\"). ECF No. 122.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Fidelity raises several defenses, including that Debtor, as grantor of the trust, could not have suffered any damages because the trust funds that Fidelity represented it originally received were misappropriated long before Fidelity became trustee. Fidelity further contends that Debtor authorized all of the actions that it undertook through express authority given to the bank on behalf of Debtor by the principal of the fraud and Debtor's agent, Tray Thomas. Finally, Fidelity argues that any claims in tort are barred by North Carolina's economic loss rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Dealers argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiff's breach of contract claim because Plaintiff's claim is barred by the statute of limitations and there is no evidence it breached the contracts or caused Debtor any damages. Dealers also seeks summary judgment on its affirmative claims against the estate for Debtor's breach of those same contracts, or alternatively, unjust enrichment. In the Court's prior Amendment Opinion, the Court denied Dealers' motion to dismiss the remaining breach of contract claim. Amendment Op. 28-33. Applying the standards under Rule 12(b)(6), the Court denied Dealers' motion because the Court previously permitted Plaintiff to amend the Complaint over Dealers' objection that the amendment was futile and because the allegations in the Amended Complaint were sufficient to invoke equitable estoppel against Dealers' assertion of the statute of limitations for purposes of the motion to dismiss. Dealers now argues that the record at summary judgment establishes that its defense based on the statute of limitations is not subject to equitable estoppel, and that Plaintiff's breach of contract claim is time barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff timely responded to the Motions for Summary Judgment. ECF Nos. 191, 192. The Court conducted a hearing on the Motions and took the matters under advisement. The Motions are ripe for determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Fidelity Bank, as trustee, agreed to take possession of over four million dollars in\n   trust to ensure the payment of warranty claims by NCVA's customers or reimbursement of Dealers, and to return the balance of funds to NCVA. Fidelity represented to Dealers and NCVA that it had received those funds, and over the next three years issued ongoing statements reflecting its receipt of the original funds and its continued receipt of further funds into trust that it did not in fact receive, all while failing to disclose to NCVA that it did not hold any trust funds in custody, and charging NCVA fees for fiduciary custodial services that it did not provide. Among other claims for relief, Plaintiff alleges that Fidelity's actions and inactions as a fiduciary abdicated its responsibilities as trustee, breached its contract, breached its fiduciary duties, and facilitated the concealment and continued perpetration of a fraud against Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ronnie Thomas was the president and sole shareholder of NCVA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fidelity's Br. \u00b6 5.

After the Trust Agreement was entered, and after Fidelity represented it had received over $3.4 million in trust as custodian, NCVA provided further corporate resolutions identifying Tray Thomas as a vice president of NCVA, giving him signature authority over the deposit accounts with the bank, and ratifying all actions previously taken by Tray Thomas to the same extent given in the resolutions as \"if said authority [in the resolutions] had been in effect prior to this meeting ....\" Dep.

They were irate when I explained that we were not in fact the owners of the account at IB, that these accounts are under Marbury's umbrella, and we have no way of accessing information on these accounts for reconcilement purposes unless we receive the information through Marbury. They really think we just receive wires in and send them out to a location that has nothing to do with IB. They think\n   we are being used as a fraudulent conduit, basically. They really flipped when I told them that I have had zero contact with our end clients on any of these accounts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   At this point, I am being told that I need to close these accounts by the end of next week if I can't get some process in place where I can do a random daily check on the assets that are in the various accounts independent of anything that Marbury produces. For example, we have two custodians that we use currently. Each of those either has straight through data feed to our trust accounting system that we can reconcile with on a daily basis, or we can go online and view the assets held in our custody account with view only access. They were not satisfied with the plan we came up with yesterday where you may be able to pull off the transactions in the accounts, export them to excel, and then send them to me.

Fidelity moves for summary judgment in its favor on all claims, asserting that: (1) the record demonstrates that any actions by Fidelity were neither the cause in fact nor proximate cause of any injury to NCVA; (2) it cannot be liable for breach of contract due to impossibility of performance; (3) the non-contract claims are barred by the economic loss rule; (4) the actions of Tray Thomas as NCVA's agent bar any recovery by the Trustee; (5) the fraud claim should be dismissed because NCVA did not actually or justifiably rely on any misrepresentations or omissions by Fidelity; (6) North Carolina does not recognize a cause of action for aiding and abetting conversion; (7) the constructive fraud claim should be dismissed because the record does not indicate any benefit to Fidelity arising out of its alleged breaches of fiduciary duties; and (8) the civil conspiracy claim must be dismissed because it is a dependent and derivative claim, and no other claims should survive. Dealers moves for summary judgment on the surviving breach of contract claim against it, as well as its two counterclaims as further reflected in its proof of claim against NCVA under the same contract. Dealers contends that it is entitled to summary judgment because the Trustee's breach of contract claim is barred by the statute of limitations, and NCVA's knowledge through its agent Tray Thomas and Dealers' lack of knowledge of the transfer of the trust funds out of trust defeat any claim of estoppel by the Plaintiff. Dealers further contends that, even if Dealers is estopped from asserting the statute of limitations, it did not in fact breach the contract or cause NCVA any damages. The Court will discuss\n   <em>\n    seriatim\n   </em>\n   each of the bases on which the defendants assert in their respective briefs that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law, beginning with Fidelity. Before reaching the respective bases on which Fidelity and Dealers seek summary judgment, however,\n   the Court will address the overlapping arguments made by Fidelity and Dealers regarding the knowledge and authority of Tray Thomas and his status as NCVA's agent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    Tray Thomas's Authority and Knowledge as Agent of NCVA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Dealers and Fidelity,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dealers' Br. 2-7, 16-18; Fidelity's Br.,\n   <em>\n    passim\n   </em>\n   ; Fidelity's Reply 4-7, spend significant portions of their arguments contending that the Plaintiff's claims fail because Tray Thomas was NCVA's authorized agent and Ronnie Thomas's individual attorney in fact based on a 2002 financial power of attorney.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Dealers' Br. \u00b6 6; Fidelity's Br. \u00b6 30; Dep. Ex. 214. Based on this agency and authority, Dealers and Fidelity argue, variously, that; (1) Tray Thomas's knowledge is imputed both to Ronnie Thomas and to NCVA; (2) NCVA did not in fact rely or reasonably rely on any of Fidelity's misrepresentations; and (3) NCVA, through its agent Tray Thomas, authorized the Trust Funds to be removed from a custodial trust and NCVA was in the best position to discover the truth. The record in this case does not support any of these contentions for purposes of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Prior to entering the Trust Agreement, Ronnie Thomas sent a letter to Fidelity establishing that Tray had authority \"to receive information from the Trustee, provide information to the Trustee, give direction to the Trustee, and is an authorized signatory for NCVA Warranty Inc.\" Dep. Ex. 160. Thereafter, Ronnie Thomas, on behalf of NCVA, entered the Trust Agreement with Fidelity that expressly required the trust funds to remain in trust, under the custodial control of Fidelity as trustee, and segregated from other funds. Dep. Ex. 5, \u00a7 1.(a). Nothing in this authorization, nor in the corporate resolutions that followed it, authorized Tray Thomas to modify the terms of the Trust Agreement to which Fidelity subsequently agreed, or to authorize the transfer of funds out of trust to a non-custodial account.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Generally, in North Carolina, an agent may contractually obligate his principal in three situations: 1) when the agent acts within the scope of his actual authority; 2) when the agent acts within the scope of his apparent authority and the third-party does not have reason to believe that the agent is exceeding his actual authority; and 3) when the principal ratifies the agent's previously unauthorized actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    Wachovia Bank of N.C., N.A. v.

There can be little dispute that Tray Thomas did not have actual authority from NCVA to transfer trust funds that were required to be held in a custodial account at Fidelity to a non-custodial account at Interactive Brokers under the control of Marbury Advisors. It would be difficult for Fidelity and Dealers to assert otherwise since both contend that they believed the funds were held in a custodial account in Fidelity's name at Marbury Advisors until the discovery of the fraud in 2012, and permitting the funds to be held in an account outside the control of Fidelity was specifically prohibited by the terms of the Trust Agreement they each signed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dep.

The relationship between Tray Thomas and Perry reflected a substantial departure from the usual methods of conducting business, and a reasonable jury could find that this substantial departure provided Fidelity and Dealers with sufficient notice of Tray Thomas's lack of authorization. Borchardt stated that he allowed Tray Thomas to control the trust funds even though he did not understand what Tray Thomas was doing. Borchardt Dep. 169-71.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Borchardt specifically faulted\n   Fidelity for failing to follow usual bank practices by permitting the funds to leave the bank's control.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 256 (\"Trustees all the time, when there's anything outside the ordinary, simply ask for our consent or check with us so they're held harmless. Whenever they take any external function and put it outside their scope of potential liability, they ask for us to indemnify and consent to it.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Tray Thomas's actions also were outside the usual methods of conducting business from the bank's perspective. Perry testified that Fidelity's relationship with Tray Thomas was a substantial departure from the bank's usual methods and practices, conceding that Fidelity did not have any other trust account where it engaged in shadow accounting without direct access to the purported custodial account. Perry Dep. 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Perry's and Borchardt's written correspondence is further evidence that both Fidelity and Dealers possessed information that a trier of fact could find would lead a reasonable businessperson to believe that Tray Thomas was violating the orders of NCVA and that NCVA would not have wished him to remove the funds from the custody of Fidelity under the circumstances. Perry's own email tacitly concedes that the bank should have been aware that Tray Thomas was acting outside the scope of his authority, describing the reaction of the bank's trust consultants as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   They were irate when I explained that we were not in fact the owners of the account at IB, that these accounts are under Marbury's umbrella, and we have no way of accessing information on these accounts for reconcilement purposes unless we receive the information through Marbury. They really think we just receive wires in and send them out to a location that has nothing to do with IB. They think we are being used as a fraudulent conduit, basically.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Dep. Ex. 332. Borchardt sounded similar alarms in his internal May 30, 2009 email, in which he stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   I have no doubt that Tray says the funds are held in trust, but they do not appear to be held by Wachovia or U.S. Bank's trust department. Shumpert's email indicates that the funds left the bank's physical control in January 2006 and I assume the same is true for all funds generated since then. This situation is no different than if Dealers Alliance, for example, were to wire several million dollars to my personal account against my pledge that I will hold the funds in trust and register any investments in Dealers Alliance's name. Of course I would always possess the power\n   to move the assets out of Alliance's name, so I don't think anyone would be happy with that kind of arrangement. How do we know that the funds are really there? Bernie Madoff invested client funds for over 30 years and gave all of them investment statements, but it turns out that not a single investment was ever made. When we place the fund in the hands of an institutional trustee, we gain the comfort of knowing that the trust funds are protected.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Dep. Ex. 26.

Actual Cause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   As an initial matter, Fidelity inappropriately limits NCVA's asserted injury. Fidelity assumes that \"[c]ause in fact in this case is a simple matter of timing. Alleged misconduct of a defendant cannot be the cause in fact of loss when the loss occurs years before the conduct.\" Fidelity's Br. \u00a7 II.2.B.1; Fidelity's Reply 7 (\"Whether due to the actions of Tray Thomas, NCVA, Dealers Assurance, Interactive Brokers, or U.S. Bank, or any combination of them, the trust funds were lost and the damage done long before Fidelity Bank became the purported trustee.\"). The record before the Court is insufficient to determine the full damage to Plaintiff resulting from Fidelity's breaches of its obligations. Nevertheless, over $200,000 remained in the Interactive Brokerage account when Fidelity obligated itself to take possession of all trust funds as trustee. Further, NCVA continued to sell warranties from 2009 until 2012, believing that it was remitting the required reserve amounts to Fidelity's custody, and relying on the insurance provided by Dealers as required by state law and on the custodial services of Fidelity as trustee of the Trust Funds, for which Plaintiff paid fees to Fidelity. Under these facts, NCVA's injury continued and grew after Fidelity became trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Construing the facts in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party, Fidelity repeatedly breached duties owed to Dealers and Plaintiff by not taking custody of the Trust Funds as required by the Trust Agreement and state law, failing to disclose this fact, and specifically representing that it had custody of the Trust Funds among other breaches. Fidelity's breaches and failures actually caused Plaintiff to lose funds that were required to be, and should have been, entrusted from 2009 until 2012. Had Fidelity performed its due diligence in establishing the Trust Account by assuming the role of trustee and taking control of the remaining Trust Funds as agreed, there would have been no opportunity for Tray Thomas to abscond with those funds, which was the primary purpose of having the funds put in trust in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Similarly, had Fidelity furnished accurate information that the Trust Funds did not exist and Fidelity did not have control over the Trust Account, NCVA could have stopped the ongoing loss of revenues it believed were being placed in trust. Instead, Fidelity continued to represent to Dealers both the existence and its possession of the funds (and failed to disclose to NCVA otherwise), even after Perry conceded in writing that Fidelity could not \"independently verify\" the existence of Plaintiff's Trust Funds in December of 2011, two years after Fidelity assumed the role of trustee. In fact, four months later, Fidelity certified the availability of $4,327,974.21 as \"[s]ecurities held by [Fidelity] for [Dealers'] account.\" Dep.

Specifically, and without limitation to any damages arising from Fidelity's failure to take possession of funds generated on and after its execution of the Trust Agreement, Fidelity argues that Plaintiff has not come forward with sufficient evidence of the steps NCVA could have taken to recover the funds remaining at Interactive Brokers at the time Fidelity initially agreed to take possession\n   of the trust assets if Fidelity had not misrepresented that it possessed the funds.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Fidelity's Br. \u00b6 64. On the contrary, to the extent that Fidelity breached its contractual obligation to take possession of those funds and appropriately and timely has raised the affirmative defense of impossibility, the burden of proof at trial will be on Fidelity to demonstrate that, through no fault of its own, it could not have taken possession of the remaining funds and that the impossibility of taking possession of any of the putative Trust Funds was unforeseeable at the time it executed the agreement. Therefore, the Court will deny summary judgment based on impossibility of performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Economic Loss Rule\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Relying on this Court's prior dismissal of the extra-contractual claims against Dealers under the economic loss rule, Fidelity argues that \"the purported trust agreement defines Fidelity's duties, and the limitations upon its duties, and it expressly states that Fidelity has no duties beyond those stated in the contract. As such, all other causes of action should be dismissed.\" Fidelity's Br. \u00a7 II.D, at 25. As this Court noted in its prior opinion, Dealers owed no fiduciary or other extra-contractual duties to NCVA under the Insurance Agreement or due to a special relationship of trust and confidence, and Plaintiff did not assert any actions by Dealers that breached a legal duty other than those which Dealers owed under the agreement.\n   <em>\n    NC &amp; VA Warranty Co., Inc. v.

Actual and Justifiable Reliance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Fidelity contends that NCVA did not actually or justifiably rely on Fidelity's misrepresentations and omissions because: (1) the statements that it held the trust funds were sent only to Dealers and its auditors, and therefore, NCVA could not have relied on those statements; (2) there is no evidence that NCVA relied on the misrepresentations because Ronnie Thomas is dead and cannot testify as to what he would have done to recover the remaining funds in the Interactive Brokers account at the inception of the Trust Agreement; and (3) because Tray Thomas, as NCVA's agent, was aware of the facts, and \"[a] party cannot be deceived as to a material fact of which it is already aware.\" Fidelity's Br. \u00a7 II.F. The Court has already addressed the issue of Tray Thomas's imputed knowledge above and need not recapitulate that discussion here. The remaining two bases similarly are insufficient to support summary judgment with respect to Fidelity's omissions and its representation that it had received the original funds as reflected in EXHIBIT A to Dep. Ex. 4. Ronnie Thomas's signature\n   appears on Dep. Ex. 4 and there is sufficient evidence in the record from which a reasonable jury could conclude that NCVA relied on that assurance. Nevertheless, Plaintiff may not rely on the audit statements to support a claim for fraud because there is no evidence that NCVA directly relied on those statements. Fidelity provided the false custodial statements to Dealers and its auditors and not directly to NCVA, and there is no evidence in the record that the statements in the audit confirmations were repeated to NCVA by Dealers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Actual and justifiable reliance are questions for the jury, \"unless the facts are so clear that they support only one conclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Choplin v.

Fidelity, Dealers, and NCVA all were in direct privity with respect to the Trust Agreement and the information provided by and between the parties to that agreement. In fact, the agreement purports to require statements only to be sent to NCVA \"for\" Dealers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trust Agreement \u00a7 7.(e). Borchardt specifically testified that Dealers would have acted if it had not been told that Fidelity had custody of the funds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Borchardt Dep. 207-08. This testimony is consistent with the entire circumstances of the case and common sense. As stated above, the central purpose of the Trust Agreement was to protect the reserve through custodial services. To the extent that Fidelity failed to disclose its compliance with this central purpose-especially in light of the surrounding circumstances indicating fraud-it would be reasonable to conclude that NCVA relied on Fidelity's original assurance that it had taken possession of the Trust Funds and that both beneficiaries relied on its subsequent omissions. Therefore, the Court will deny Fidelity's motion for summary judgment based on any argument that NCVA did not actually rely on Fidelity's original representation in Dep. Ex. 4 and its subsequent omissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

The first precept provides that, in such proceedings and where there is no controlling precedent from the state's highest court on the issue presented, the federal court \"must ... offer its best judgment about how [the] state's highest court would rule on [the] claims, giving appropriate weight to any opinions of [the] state's intermediate appellate courts.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

Moreover, as set forth above, the Court cannot conclude for purposes of summary judgment that Dealers was unaware that the trust funds had been transferred out of US Bank and not returned at the time that it executed the Trust Agreement with Fidelity and NCVA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   At that time, Dealers had reason to believe Tray Thomas was committing a fraud, and knew that there was no account at Interactive Brokers in the name of US Bank despite Tray Thomas's previous assurances to the contrary. In the face of this knowledge, Borchardt affirmatively decided to \"play it out and see what Tray will do next.\" Dep. Ex. 32. At that time, Dealers knew that Tray Thomas already had lied to US Bank about the existence of a custodial account in the bank's name at Interactive Brokers. Thereafter, with no indication that the funds had been returned other than Fidelity's execution of the Trust Agreement itself and without any evidence of an affirmative inquiry to Fidelity or Interactive Brokers regarding the same, Dealers executed the Trust Agreement with the attached Exhibit A reflecting possession of over $3.4 million in assets. For the reasons set forth above, the Court cannot conclude for purposes of summary judgment that Ronnie Thomas or NCVA had any knowledge of these facts. Therefore, for reasons similar to those set forth in its prior Dismissal Opinion, the Court will deny Dealers' Motion for Summary Judgment based on the statute of limitations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

At his August 4, 2015, deposition by counsel for Fidelity, Kirk Borchardt, the President and CEO of Dealers until the fall of 2013, testified that Dealers had consented to the transfer of the funds out of the possession of US Bank. Borchardt Dep. 78, ECF No. 193-1 (\"I sent [Dealers' prior president, Robin Ratchford] emails, I think you've seen them, when I learned about the fact that we, meaning [Dealers], had authorized it.

When asked by counsel whether Ratchford had authorized a Dealers employee, Rhonda Holland, to consent to the transfer, Borchardt responded, \"That's my belief.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 131, ECF No. 193-2. Fidelity has attempted to contradict this testimony with a later affidavit from Borchardt, ECF No. 187 (\"Borchardt Affidavit\"), in support of its motion for summary judgment. In his affidavit, Borchardt contends that he only assumed that Dealers had consented based on a notation in the documentation that the transfer was made pursuant to the written direction of Holland, and that he had no personal knowledge of her authorization or his prior testimony.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 13-14. First, the affidavit merely seeks to rebut the authorization and his personal knowledge of the transfers, but does not purport to rebut the fact that others at Dealers knew that the transfers had occurred prior to the inception of the Fidelity trust account. Second, regarding Dealers' consent to the transfers, Fidelity and Dealers cannot rebut the deposition testimony by affidavit in this manner at this stage in the proceedings. Such an argument is improper at summary judgment, where the Court may not make inferences or factual determinations, and must construe all facts in a light most favorable to the non-movant.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Murrell v.

Clementson Dep. 87-97. Regardless, Tray Thomas did not have actual or apparent authority to authorize the transfer under the terms of the US Bank Trust Agreement, which would have required, at a minimum, the consent of Dealers, and Cody testified that US Bank followed Tray Thomas's directions regarding the account only if they complied with the terms of the Trust Agreement. Cody Dep. 27.

First, Plaintiff may have it both ways for purposes of defending against motions for summary judgment filed by different defendants. The Court cannot determine a material fact at summary judgment when the record contains sufficient evidence on which a reasonable jury could make a finding other than as proposed by the movant. Instead, the Court must construe all evidence in favor of a non-moving party. With respect to Dealers' motion, the Court must construe the record in favor of its knowledge. With respect to Fidelity's motion, the Court must construe the record in favor of reliance. Second, any lack of reliance by Dealers does not necessarily vitiate reliance by NCVA, but, if the Court determines at trial that Dealers consented to the transfers, it may make reliance or causation more difficult for Plaintiff to establish against Fidelity by circumstantial evidence.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Rowan Cty.

Assuming that Fidelity's representation of possession assuaged Borchardt's concerns would require the Court to construe those facts in favor of the movant, Dealers, which it cannot do at this stage. The Court is required to construe facts in favor of the non-movant, and in doing so, this same argument can be made to demonstrate that Fidelity's execution of the Trust Agreement and the representations therein reassured NCVA and Ronnie Thomas that the funds had been returned to a custodial trust. Moreover, although the Control Agreement indicates that Ronnie Thomas was aware that the funds were being held in a custodial account at Interactive Brokers, nothing in the record indicates that Ronnie Thomas or anyone else at NCVA knew that the account at Interactive Brokers was not a custodial account held in the name of US Bank at the time Dealers signed the Trust Agreement.

Tonya Cody, the U.S. Bank account manager for the NCVA trust account, spoke with Ronnie Thomas on the telephone and received his oral authorization for Tray Thomas to act on behalf of NCVA, particularly in respect to the management of its finances and conducting trades and transactions with the funds\n    <em>\n     held in the trust account\n    </em>\n    . Cody depo. pp. 21-24.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-215\">\n    Fidelity's Br. \u00b6 14 (emphasis added). First, any putative apparent authority in the discussion with Cody was given to US Bank, rather than to Fidelity, and Fidelity does not cite any evidence in the record that Ronnie Thomas made any statements to Fidelity that imbued Tray Thomas with the scope of apparent authority described in the brief. Nevertheless, even if this authorization had been provided to Fidelity rather than to US Bank, nowhere in the cited testimony does Cody testify that she either asked for or received from Ronnie Thomas NCVA's authorization for Tray Thomas to direct wire transfers of funds held in the Wachovia/US Bank trust account to the brokerage account at Interactive Brokers, much less to a non-custodial account in the name of Marbury Advisors in violation of the requirements of the Trust Agreement. The communication reflected in Dep. Ex. 201, which she testifies correctly memorialized the authority discussed with Ronnie Thomas on the telephone,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Cody Dep. 26, falls far short of such authorization. Moreover, Cody specifically testified that she only followed instructions from Tray Thomas that were consistent with the terms of the US Bank Trust Agreement,\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 27, which required US Bank to take and retain the assets under its control, unless withdrawn by Dealers for a permitted purpose.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dep. Ex. 2, \u00a7\u00a7 1.(a), 2.(a), 3. Although the US Bank Trust Agreement permits \"the Grantor or its designated advisor or designated portfolio manager\" to direct the trustee to invest assets \"\n    <em>\n     in\n    </em>\n    the Trust Account in Eligible Securities,\" nothing in that provision authorizes the trustee to abdicate to the advisor its responsibility to invest the assets as directed or authorizes the advisor to direct the transfer or investment of assets outside the control of the trustee or the trust account.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 4.(b) (emphasis added). Further, even if this testimony and evidence could be construed in some manner to support the statements in Fidelity's brief, the Court may not draw any such inferences in favor of the movant on a motion for summary judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-216\">\n    Local Rule 7056-1(c) provides: \"Each material fact in dispute shall be set forth in a separate paragraph, shall refer specifically to those portions of the record upon which the opposing party relies, and, if applicable, shall state the paragraph number in the movant's listing of facts that is disputed. All facts set forth in the statement of the movant shall be deemed admitted for the purpose of the motion for summary judgment unless specifically controverted by the opposing party.\" In response to a number of the enumerated factual statements in Defendants' briefs, Plaintiff states, \"These averments are immaterial ...,\" but then fails to address the accuracy of the averments.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 192, at 2-5. These responses expose Plaintiff to the potential consequence of admitting stated facts that may be entirely unsupported by the record as set forth above, and about which the Court may disagree as to materiality. Nevertheless, Courts have broad discretion in applying local rules.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Phillips v. Ins. Co. of N.

As stated above, a number of the putative facts are unsupported by the citations to the record offered by Fidelity. Further, a number of Fidelity's statements are mere statements of conclusions to be drawn from facts, rather than statements of specific facts. For these reasons, and unless otherwise stated herein, the Court has relied on the record submitted by the parties in determining the facts for purposes of summary judgment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"29\">\n   <p id=\"p-217\">\n    This statement should not be construed to conflict with the general rule that a principal is liable for the torts committed by his agent when the agent is acting on behalf of the principal's business and within the apparent scope of his authority, even when those actions are against the principal's express instructions.\n    <em>\n     See,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     West v.

The thrust of apparent authority is not how the principal instructs the agent. Instead, apparent authority focuses on the principal's manifestations of the extent and limitations of the agent's authority to third parties.

Borchardt testified as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-219\">\n    A: A DVP account is an account by which the bank enters into an agreement with an investment advisor that allows the advisor to manage the funds at the bank without ever taking control of the funds.
