The main character, Peter H. Blair, Sr., served as the patriarch of his family. Married to an\n   heiress for almost 60 years, they were the beneficiaries of great wealth. He managed the money and served as an investment counselor for his extended family as well as other families of means. Peter H. Blair, Sr. and his wife sought to protect their wealth and provide for their three children by creating a series of trusts funded mostly by her inheritance. Together, they served as co-trustees. They lived in privilege for decades until she died after a long illness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   By the time his wife died, Peter H. Blair, Sr. was retired. He moved to a luxury retirement community but was very lonely. Enter Suella Crowley. She worked as a caregiver for his friend. He became enamored with her even though they didn't really know each other. He skipped the courting and moved to a surprise and unconventional proposal of marriage in March 2011. She had suffered some hard times including several divorces and debt. They came from very different backgrounds and circumstances. He promised to take care of her financially and otherwise. She agreed and felt like Cinderella. They started to plan their life together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When they informed Peter H. Blair, Sr.'s three children, there were no \"congratulations\" or \"well wishes.\" There was only conflict. His eldest son seemed to despise her from the start. It got worse as their father professed his love and intention to support his fianc\u00e9. They investigated her and engaged in a campaign trying to convince their father not to marry her. She was not right for him, they thought. Perhaps he was deranged or mentally unstable? And, if their elderly father really was going to support her, well, then there would be less inheritance for them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   They investigated their father and accused him of misappropriating money from the trusts. Bitterly, he denied it; but he did all they asked. He transferred $4.5 million back to the trusts, he signed over a house to one son, and he resigned as co-trustee of the trusts allowing his children to manage them instead. He thought he bought peace by settling with his children and the trusts. He still had more than $700,000 in bank accounts plus another $6,000,000 in IRAs. Now, he could marry his new-found love and live his golden years. But he was wrong. Perhaps it was all preordained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Peter H. Blair, Sr. started to make good on his promises to his fianc\u00e9. He gave her and her small printing company about $70,000. He started to pay her mortgage. They got married in September 2011. They remodeled her house to make it more comfortable for him. He moved in. And, then he paid off her entire mortgage: more than $350,000. He wanted her to be stress-free and financially secure. All the while, he continued to pay his other bills: rent (until he moved), country clubs, church pledges, life insurance, health insurance, credit cards, accountants, and attorneys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Estranged from his children, he carried on his new life. But about a year later, one of his sons and the trusts made new demands against him. They accused him of mismanagement and breach of trust. They sued their father. The litigation was acrimonious. But, the trusts emerged victorious. In March 2015, they won a judgment in excess of $2.3 million against Peter H. Blair, Sr. It destroyed him. He filed for bankruptcy. And, then he died a broken man.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Chapter 7 Trustee came in to pick up the pieces of what remained. The Debtor's children and the trusts filed 95% of the claims. There really were no other significant creditors. Armed with the fruits of the children's investigation of their father's financial affairs and the $2.3 million judgment, the Chapter 7 Trustee sued the Debtor's wife, Suella Crowley, and her printing company to recover money for the\n   bankruptcy estate. He accused the Debtor of engaging in actual and constructive fraud when the Debtor paid her and her company the $70,000 many years earlier. He sought to disallow her claim against the bankruptcy estate. And, he demanded one-half of the house that she had owned for more than 20 years because her husband had paid off the mortgage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Another year of litigation and the final act played out in this Court. A trial. The Court heard from an assortment of characters: Suella Crowley, one of the Debtor's sons, one of Suella Crowley's sons, an attorney, some friends, and an accountant. The Court listened to the lawyers and their arguments. And, now the final curtain closes. Although one party will win, and one will lose, the truth is a tragedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Jurisdiction and Venue\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Blair (the \"Debtor\"), filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   on May 7, 2015 in the case captioned:\n   <em>\n    In re Peter H. Blair\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 15-15008 TBM (Bankr. D. Colo.) (the \"Bankruptcy Case\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Shortly after initiating the Bankruptcy Case, the Debtor died.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, the Court converted the Bankruptcy Case from a Chapter 11 reorganization to a Chapter 7 liquidation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On August 20, 2015, the United States Trustee appointed Jeffrey A. Weinman as the Chapter 7 Trustee for the Debtor's estate in the Bankruptcy Case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   About two years after the commencement of the Bankruptcy Case, on May 5, 2017, the Chapter 7 Trustee initiated this Adversary Proceeding against Suella M. Crowley (\"Crowley\"), the Debtor's widow, and First Class Printing, Inc. (\"First Class\"), an entity affiliated with Crowley.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (Docket No. 1, the \"Original Complaint.\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the Original Complaint, the Chapter 7 Trustee alleged that the Debtor: (1) gave at least $8,144 in cash to Crowley (the \"Cash Transfers\"); and (2) transferred at least $55,762 to Crowley \"through her business First Class ...\" (the \"Business Transfers\"). The Chapter 7 Trustee claimed that the Debtor made the Cash Transfers and the Business Transfers with actual intent to defraud in violation of Colorado Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (the \"CUFTA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also asserted that the Cash Transfers and Business Transfers constituted constructive fraud under the CUFTA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, the Chapter 7 Trustee sought to \"preserv[e] any and all avoided transfers\" and to disallow Crowley's claim in the Bankruptcy Case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Defendants did not respond to the Original Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Instead, on May 24, 2017, the Chapter 7 Trustee filed an Amended Complaint. (Docket No. 6, the \"Amended Complaint.\") The Amended Complaint is the operative pleading and is virtually identical to the Original Complaint except that the Chapter 7 Trustee added: (1) a series of new allegations concerning Crowley's home located at 2777 South Elmira Street, Denver, Colorado (the \"Real Property\"); and (2) a new cause of action for declaratory relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Chapter 7 Trustee asserted that \"between June 7, 2011 and January 19, 2012, the Debtor made payments in the amount of not less than $358,593\" to pay off Crowley's mortgage on the Real Property (the \"Mortgage Payoff Transfers\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based upon the alleged Mortgage Payoff Transfers, the Chapter 7 Trustee requested a declaratory judgment determining that he is entitled \"to not less than one-half of the [Real] Property.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Chapter 7 Trustee did not assert that the Mortgage Payoff Transfers were fraudulent under the CUFTA. The Defendants answered the Amended Complaint and denied any liability. (Docket No. 15, the \"Answer.\") The Court set the case for a three-day trial commencing on August 6, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     The Pre-Trial Proceedings and Evidentiary Rulings\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In the run-up to trial, the parties engaged in unusually extensive discovery skirmishes and motions practice including, motions to compel, motions to quash, a motion to seal documents, a motion to redact documents, motions for summary judgment, and motions to limit or exclude evidence. During the pre-trial jockeying, the Court made two key rulings on evidentiary issues that ultimately had an impact on the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On June 13, 2018, the Court issued its \"Order Regarding Defendants' Motion\n   <em>\n    In Limine\n   </em>\n   .\" (Docket No. 136, the \"\n   <em>\n    In Limine\n   </em>\n   Order.\") The Chapter 7 Trustee intended to rely heavily at trial in this Adversary Proceeding on certain factual findings\n   made by the Probate Court for the City and County of Denver (the \"Probate Court\") in its \"Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order\" issued on March 27, 2015 (the \"Probate Judgment\") in the probate proceeding:\n   <em>\n    In the Matter of\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    The Audrey R. Blair Revocable Trust, GST-Exempt Marital Trust, and Non-Exempt Marital Trust\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 12-PR-2227 (the \"Probate Case\"). The Defendants argued that the findings of fact in the Probate Judgment constituted inadmissible hearsay which should be excluded from evidence at trial under FED. R. EVID. 801 and 802, and because the Defendants were not parties to the Probate Case, the Probate Court excluded Crowley from observing the trial, and the Probate Court suppressed virtually the entire record of the Probate Case. The Chapter 7 Trustee conceded that the findings of fact in the Probate Judgement constituted hearsay but proposed the application of various hearsay exceptions under FED. R. EVID. 803, 804, or 807. In the\n   <em>\n    In Limine\n   </em>\n   Order, the Court granted the relief requested by the Defendants and ordered:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   For purposes of trial (and also for all remaining dispositive motions), the entire Probate Judgment, except the Damages Order portion of the Probate Judgment, is excluded from evidence as inadmissible hearsay. The Court will consider only the Probate Judgment's legal effect: on March 27, 2015, the Probate Court entered the Probate Judgment and held the Debtor liable for a total of $2,372,688.29 in damages for breach of fiduciary and trust duties as set forth in the Damages Order portion of the Probate Judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    In Limine\n   </em>\n   Order at 14. The Chapter 7 Trustee did not seek interlocutory appeal of the\n   <em>\n    In Limine\n   </em>\n   Order. So, the\n   <em>\n    In Limine\n   </em>\n   Order governed use of the Probate Judgment at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The second important pre-trial evidentiary ruling concerned an expert witness. As set for the below, the Debtor's financial position (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   whether solvent or insolvent) at the time of the allegedly fraudulent transfers was an important issue in this Adversary Proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   COLO. REV. STAT. \u00a7 38-8-105(2)(i) (\"consideration may be given\" to whether \"the debtor was insolvent or became insolvent shortly after the transfer was made\"). Accordingly, the Chapter 7 Trustee engaged Mark Dennis as an expert witness on solvency issues. Mark Dennis prepared an expert report opining that the Debtor was insolvent as of May 7, 2011. The Defendants sought exclusion of expert testimony from Mark Dennis under FED. R. EVID. 702 and seminal appellate precedent concerning expert witness issues:\n   <em>\n    Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    509 U.S. 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    125 L.Ed.2d 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993) and\n   <em>\n    Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. v.

The Chapter 7 Trustee contested such exclusion and requested an evidentiary\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   hearing. After conducting a\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   hearing, the Court entered its \"Memorandum Opinion and Order Granting Defendants' Motion to Exclude Expert Testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    Weinman v. Crowley (In re Blair)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512032\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/588/605/\">\n    588 B.R. 605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. D. Colo. 2018) (the \" Expert Exclusion Order\"). The Court ruled:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   ... the Chapter 7 Trustee failed to meet his burden to establish grounds for admission of Mark Dennis' expert opinion under Fed. R. Evid. 702,\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    509 U.S. 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355769\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/579/\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Kumho\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11132917\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/137/\">\n    526 U.S. 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11132917\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/137/\">\n    119 S.Ct. 1167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the Court GRANTS the Motion to Exclude. Mark Dennis will not be permitted to provide expert testimony on the issue of solvency at the trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Blair\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512032\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/588/605/\">\n    588 B.R. at 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Subsequently, the Chapter 7 Trustee sought reconsideration of the Expert Exclusion Order and also appealed the Expert Exclusion Order to\n   the United States Bankruptcy Appellate Panel for the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals (the \"Tenth Circuit BAP\"). The Court denied reconsideration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, the Tenth Circuit BAP dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction based upon its interlocutory nature.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The BAP further observed that such dismissal was \"without prejudice to [the Chapter 7 Trustee's] right to file a notice of appeal after a final order is entered.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   So, as a consequence of the\n   <em>\n    In Limine\n   </em>\n   Order and the Expert Exclusion Order, the Chapter 7 Trustee proceeded to trial without the ability to rely on the factual findings contained in the Probate Judgment and without an expert witness on solvency issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     The Trial\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court conducted a trial on the issues raised in the Amended Complaint and the Answer on August 6, 7, and 8, 2018. Prior to the trial, the parties submitted joint \"Stipulated Facts and Exhibits.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   At trial, the parties presented their opening statements, witnesses, and exhibits. The Court heard testimony from: the Chapter 7 Trustee; Crowley; Peter Hy Blair; Karen Hart; Esther LaRue; Heidi Mourning; Leonard Higdon; and Todd Searles. Notably, and consistent with the Expert Exclusion Order, Mark Dennis did not testify. Further, the Court admitted Exhibits 13, 14, 15, 17, 25, 38 40-43, 45-47, 49, 51, 53-57, 59-63, 65-67 offered by the Chapter 7 Trustee and Exhibits A, C-F, I-K, M, N1-N13, O1-8, P-Q, V, Y-Z, DDD, EEE, and FFF offered by the Defendants. The exhibits were extremely voluminous. The Chapter 7 Trustee did not introduce the Probate Judgment into evidence even for the limited purpose permitted under the\n   <em>\n    In Limine\n   </em>\n   Order. However, the Stipulated Facts do refer to the Probate Judgment and its legal effect in a manner consistent with the\n   <em>\n    In Limine\n   </em>\n   Order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   At the conclusion of the evidence, both parties presented oral closing arguments.

Blair, Sr., filed for bankruptcy in the twilight of his life - and then died a few months later.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   In many ways, the Debtor's end was incongruous with most of his long life. He married his first wife, Audrey R. Blair, in 1950. She inherited great wealth. Together, the Debtor and Audrey Blair had three children: Peter Heyliger Blair, Jr. (\"Hy Blair\"), Audrey B. Black (\"Audie Black\"), and Christopher B. Blair (\"Christopher Blair\"). The Debtor was a \"very accomplished financial planner and counselor\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   who worked for over 28 years at an investment counseling firm where he \"managed huge amounts of money\" for his family and others.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although he retired from his investment counseling firm in 1991, the Debtor continued to manage his and his family's financial affairs including his ownership of an oil and gas company: Blair Oil Investments, LLC (\"BOI\"). The Debtor was the patriarch of his family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Debtor and Audrey Blair created a trust and sub-trusts to protect their wealth and ensure their estate plan: the Audrey R. Blair Revocable Trust, GST-Exempt Marital Trust, and Non-Exempt Marital Trust (together, the \"ARB Trust\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Audrey Blair's inheritance largely funded the ARB Trust. Together, Audrey Blair and the Debtor were the initial trustees of the ARB Trust. Their three children were beneficiaries. After a long illness, Audrey Blair passed away in October 2007.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Having lost his wife of almost 60 years, the Debtor was lonely and a bit adrift.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Debtor moved from the home he shared with his wife to a luxury retirement community in Denver, Colorado: Brookdale Parkplace (\"Parkplace\"). He rented a two-bedroom apartment for more than $8,000 per month.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Suffice it to say that he had substantial financial resources at his disposal. In addition to his own assets, the Debtor continued to manage the ARB Trust as a co-trustee. Upon Audrey Blair's death, Hy Blair joined his father as the other co-trustee of the ARB Trust. Together, the Debtor and Hy Blair managed BOI, the Debtor's wholly-owned oil and gas company. An elderly, well-heeled, mostly-retired gentleman, the Debtor's days were spent at Parkplace, doctor's appointments, advisor's offices, and with his family in Denver and other locations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Suella Crowley and First Class\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Enter Suella Crowley. The Debtor first met Crowley in December 2009 when she was working at the Parkplace retirement community as a care giver for other residents.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   She came from an entirely different background than the Debtor. Crowley was a long-time Denver native who graduated from South High School in 1962.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Unlike the Debtor, she did not attend college. Instead, she worked all her life in a wide variety of positions including in retail, banking, childcare, computer supplies, and printing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   She was largely self-sufficient but sometimes had trouble making ends meet. In 2000, she started her own small business, First Class, as a custom printing company focusing on the financial industry.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   She was the sole owner of First Class and ran the company for more than a decade.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   First Class did fairly well for a number of years but suffered from the economic downturn in 2008 and also because custom printing was slowly declining as an industry. By 2009, Crowley took a second job as a caregiver at Parkplace to earn more income.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Crowley worked for\n   Parkplace only a short period of time before she was hired by one of the residents to provide for her exclusive care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Meanwhile, Crowley was somewhat unlucky in love. She married Bill Searles when she was only 19 years old. They had four children together but divorced after 15 years of marriage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   Next, Crowley married Jim Southern. But, that relationship also ended in divorce after almost a decade.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   She tried again with George Crowley. They married in approximately 1991 and stayed together until 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     The Debtor's Engagement and Marriage to Crowley\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   For about a year and a half, Crowley continued to work part-time as the care giver for a resident at Parkplace on the same floor as the Debtor. During that time, she met the Debtor occasionally. Since Crowley was providing exclusive care for someone else, her initial interactions with the Debtor were few - they exchanged pleasantries in the elevator, they saw each other from time to time in the lunch room, they bumped into each other occasionally in other locations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   Crowley testified that she and the Debtor were not particularly close friends, but they spoke together briefly most days at Parkplace during the time she worked there. They liked each other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   But, it was a big surprise to Crowley when the Debtor proposed marriage to her almost out of the blue. The day was March 9, 2011. When Crowley arrived at work, her employer - a neighbor and friend of the Debtor - told her that the Debtor had asked to meet with Crowley.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   Crowley went to his apartment. The Debtor greeted her, showed her around, and started to talk. It was their first long conversation. The Debtor told Crowley the \"history of his life\" including his family, upbringing, and education so that she really got to know him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   Then, without further delay, the Debtor proposed marriage. Cutting straight to the point, he said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   I've been observing you [Crowley] the last several years and you're the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with. Will you marry me?\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Crowley hesitated at first and explained that she was separated from her husband (George Crowley), but not yet divorced. She indicated that she planned to get a divorce when she had enough money to go through the process. Not taking \"no\" for an answer, the Debtor asked Crowley if she would marry him if he paid for the divorce. Crowley said \"Yes\" and they hugged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   It was an unconventional and surprising proposal to say the least. But the Debtor made Crowley feel \"like Cinderella.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtor promised to take care of Crowley financially and otherwise. Crowley was attracted to the Debtor because he could take care of her and also because he was \"such a gentleman.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   Reversing the typical sequence, they really got to know each other after they agreed to marry. Over the next weeks, they spent their lunches and\n   evenings together and talked about their lives and future plans together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Crowley committed that she would take care of the Debtor (who was 83 years old at the time) \"physically and emotionally and spiritually\" to the best of her ability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   She promised that the Debtor would never have to go to a nursing home, which was a very important commitment for him. She told him that she would \"love and obey\" him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtor stated to Crowley that he wanted to \"start our marriage off level\" by paying off her debts for credit cards, her car, and her home so that they could live stress-free and \"could go through this part of our life just enjoying each other.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also asked her to stop working so that she could be with him. She agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Since Crowley had a comfortable home already (with a large backyard and pool), they agreed that the Debtor would pay off the mortgage for the Real Property as a gift and he would move into Crowley's house. The Debtor thought that would also make financial sense since he would no longer have to pay rent at Parkplace, which was more than $8,000 per month. And Crowley would have the security of owning the Real Property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Crowley, the Debtor did not want to own any part of the Real Property. \"He wanted it [the Real Property] to be for [her] entirely.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   During the late spring and summer of 2011 and thereafter, the Debtor continually expressed his love for Crowley - privately and publicly. And, she reciprocated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtor was completely taken with Crowley. After announcing his intention to marry Crowley, the Debtor explained to his children that he was \"head over heels in love [with Crowley] and he had found the woman of his dreams.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   He thought his relationship with Crowley was \"incredibly beautiful and special and lovely.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtor told Hy Blair that Crowley \"was a gorgeous thing that had been sent to him from on high.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hy Blair observed that his father \"gushed like a schoolboy\" over his relationship with Crowley.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, the closeness of the relationship between the Debtor and Crowley was repeatedly confirmed by multiple witnesses including Karen Hart\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Esther Larue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   The evidence demonstrates that the Debtor was very much in love with, and even infatuated with, Crowley.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Perhaps not surprisingly given the depth of his feelings for Crowley, the Debtor made no secret that he intended to financially support Crowley and \"to help her as much as he could.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtor told Hy Blair that he was going to leave\n   Crowley financial assets (including a personal trading account and IRA) as well as pay off her house.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   Over time, the Debtor repeatedly reiterated his intention to support Crowley financially.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In August 2011, Crowley moved into the Debtor's apartment at Parkplace on a temporary basis while they remodeled Crowley's house to better accommodate the Debtor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtor married Crowley on September 14, 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   After they married, and the remodeling work was completed, the Debtor moved into Crowley's house in January 2012. But it was not to be all happily ever after for the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     The Reaction of the Debtor's Children and the Intervention\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Shortly after the Debtor's unconventional proposal to Crowley, he announced the engagement to his children. They were not pleased. There were no \"congratulations\" or \"well wishes.\" Instead, the Debtor's children rejected Crowley almost from the get-go.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   After they were informed that the Debtor intended to support Crowley financially, their opposition intensified. About a month after the Debtor made his announcement, Hy Blair wrote a letter to the Debtor explaining his opposition to the Debtor's relationship with Crowley based on a perceived need to \"protect\" the Debtor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   A while later, Hy Blair accused his father, the Debtor, of being \"under mental disability and/or undue influence or duress.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hy Blair identified the alleged \"undue influence\" as \"newly introduced non-family individuals who have already taken financial advantage of his impairment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court received no evidence whatsoever suggesting that the Debtor was \"under mental disability and/or undue influence or duress\" in 2011 or 2012. The Court concludes from the evidence that the Debtor's children (especially Hy Blair) were concerned about their father and the unconventional engagement to Crowley - but even more concerned about the potential diminishment of their own inheritance from their father. Whatever would be given to Crowley would not be available for them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   So, in the spring of 2011, Hy Blair started to pursue a \"full-on investigation\" of the Debtor and Crowley in order to stop the marriage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   The investigation was extremely intrusive. For example, Hy Blair contacted Crowley's former employers, a former husband, and even high school classmates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also communicated with the Debtor's long-time friends trying to convince them to intercede. It was all very offensive to the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Within a month of the Debtor announcing his intention to marry and support Crowley, his children invited him on a family vacation to Hawaii. But it was not a typical vacation. Instead, the Debtor's family staged a surprise multi-day \"intervention\" with the Debtor in an effort convince him that \"[i]t was a big mistake\" to marry Crowley.\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   The intervention was not well-received. The Debtor was angry with the\n   gambit and he remained committed to Crowley.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     The May 2011 Meeting, Demands, and Settlement\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The intervention having failed, the Debtor's children (led by Hy Blair) took another tack in an attempt to protect their own interests. The Debtor's family staged another meeting with him on May 11, 2011 in Stamford, Connecticut at the offices of the Blair &amp; Potts law firm (the \"May 2011 Meeting\"). The Debtor, his three children, and Nancy Blair (an attorney at Blair &amp; Potts) attended. Hy Blair surprised the Debtor at the meeting by accusing the Debtor of having improperly transferred money to himself from the ARB Trust.\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtor denied it. But, based upon such assertion, the Debtor's children requested that the Debtor immediately: (1) transfer $4.5 million from his revocable trust back to the ARB Trust; (2) transfer a house in San Luis Obispo, California to Christopher Blair; (3) repay some other small amounts to the ARB Trust; and (4) resign as co-trustee of the ARB Trust.\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtor was apoplectic. However, he ultimately agreed to all of such demands and complied so as to avoid any dispute with his children.\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Chapter 7 Trustee contends that there was another important demand made at the May 2011 Meeting: a claim by the ARB Trust against the Debtor for an additional $1.1 million\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n   for alleged malfeasance based on other withdrawals from the ARB Trust orchestrated by the Debtor. The Chapter 7 Trustee relied exclusively on the testimony of Hy Blair. On direct examination, Hy Blair testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   There was [sic] innumerable transfers out of the ARB Trusts, amounting to $1.1 million that were transferred to people that weren't entitled to that money under the ARB trusts. We asked him [the Debtor] to return all of that [at the May 11, 2011 meeting]. He refused to do it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Court discounts Hy Blair's testimony on this crucial point. Throughout the trial, Hy Blair demonstrated his extreme animus - even blind hatred - toward Crowley and counsel for the Defendants. His testimony seemed colored by his admitted self-interest: Hy Blair, his siblings, and the ARB Trust stand to receive about ninety-five percent (95%) of any net recovery from Crowley and her business in this Adversary Proceeding. But, most importantly, the Court concludes that Hy Blair's testimony on this issue and many other issues lacks credibility because of repeated inconsistencies, contradictions, failures of recollection (when cross-examined during his deposition and at trial), and lack of corroboration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   When cross-examined about the May 2011 Meeting, Hy Blair admitted that the Debtor \"did or agreed to do everything that you [Hy Blair] asked of him in Connecticut.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n   There was, at first, no mention\n   of a claim for another $1.1 million that the Debtor refused. But just minutes after confirming that the Debtor has done \"everything that [Hy Blair] asked of him,\" Hy Blair backtracked and testified to the exact opposite.\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n   His explanation for the contradictory testimony was: \"I might have misspoken.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant's counsel sought to impeach by use of Hy Blair's deposition testimony. During his deposition, Hy Blair was asked to identify what funds he had demanded from the Debtor at the May 2011 Meeting other than the $4.5 million. Hy Blair asserted that he demanded \"[w]hatever other monies he [the Debtor] owed us\" but then admitted that \"[w]e just didn't know about them. I just didn't find out about them until later.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the portion of his deposition testimony used for impeachment at trial, Hy Blair never mentioned a demand for an additional $1.1 million. On re-direct examination, Hy Blair's story changed yet again with respect to the May 2011 Meeting. This time, he was asked: \"But you specifically made an agreement with your father [the Debtor] at that May meeting that he return about $1.4 million, correct?\" Hy Blair's answer was unequivocal: \"Correct.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   So, during his trial testimony Hy Blair testified inconsistently that during the May 2011 Meeting: (1) he had demanded that the Debtor return $1.1 million but the Debtor refused; (2) the Debtor did everything he requested (without any reference to an exception for the $1.1 million demand); (3) he demanded the Debtor return some unspecified amount of money since he did not find out a specific dollar amount until later; and (4) he demanded that the Debtor return $1.4 million (not $1.1 million) and the Debtor agreed. Harmonizing these accounts is impossible. At best, Hy Blair's testimony is an utterly contradictory mess. And, it wasn't only on this issue. Hy Blair repeatedly contradicted himself throughout the trial and testified differently in his deposition testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court finds that Hy Blair, as a witness, fundamentally lacked credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Given the inconsistencies in Hy Blair's testimony, the Court has evaluated other evidence that might corroborate or contradict Hy Blair's story. None of the other participants in the May 2011 meeting testified. So, the Court is left to consider written records. A month and a half after the meeting, on July 1, 2011, Hy Blair wrote two lengthy letters to the Debtor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the first letter, Hy Blair explained, in very terse terms, his new requirements for distributions to the Debtor from the ARB Trust.\n   <footnotemark>\n    77\n   </footnotemark>\n   The lengthy correspondence makes no reference to any demand against the Debtor that was unfulfilled nor any suggestion that the Debtor was obligated\n   to return $1.1 million or any other amount to the ARB Trust.\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n   The second July 1, 2011 letter is somewhat more personal and constitutes, in the main, a lengthy accusation that the Debtor \"abandon[ed] [his] family for another related set of people [Crowley]\" to the financial detriment of Hy Blair and his siblings. With respect to the May 2011 Meeting in Connecticut, Hy Blair stated only the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   First, I want to congratulate you and thank you for attending the meeting with Nancy Blair on May 11, 2011 in Stamford, CT. Chris, Audie and I will be forever grateful to you for recognizing the importance of maintaining Mom's trust as separate property from your estate and for voluntarily resigning as trustee of Mom's trusts. Additionally, we are very grateful that you returned the $4.2 million improperly transferred to your personal revocable trust from Mom's revocable trust. You are a total gentleman and a loving father to recognize the importance of these acts to us.\n   <footnotemark>\n    79\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In other words, Hy Blair made no suggestion in his correspondence that he had demanded $1.1 million or some other amount from the Debtor which the Debtor refused to pay. Instead, the tenor of the correspondence suggests that the Debtor did everything that was asked of him at the May 2011 Meeting: returning $4.2 million\n   <footnotemark>\n    80\n   </footnotemark>\n   of transfers and resigning as trustee of the ARB Trust. In the balance of the letter, Hy Blair describes in detail a series of other interactions with the Debtor in May and June 2011. Again, there was no intimation whatsoever that Hy Blair or the ARB Trust had made any additional demand or claim against the Debtor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    81\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Hy Blair wrote numerous other letters to the Debtor throughout the rest of the summer of 2011 and the ensuing months.\n   <footnotemark>\n    82\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Hy Blair never mentioned that either he or the ARB Trust had demanded that the Debtor pay $1.1 million or some other amount to the ARB Trust. Given the character and detail of the communications, the Court is convinced that had such demand actually been made, it would have featured quite prominently in such letters. Put another way, the absence of any reference in Hy Blair's correspondence to any demand for reimbursement of $1.1 million from the Debtor suggests that no such claim was made at the May 2011 Meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Further, the Debtor never acknowledged any such claim from the ARB Trust. In fact, the Debtor's own correspondence indicates that no additional demand for $1.1 million had been made by Hy Blair and refused at the May 2011 Meeting. For example, on March 9, 2012, the Debtor wrote an emotional letter to his son, Hy Blair chronicling the breakdown of their relationship:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   It is with disgust and sadness that I write to you this day. From the moment you heard about my love for Sue you have conspired to prevent our marriage orchestrating the intervention in Hawaii and stooping to the level of hiring private detectives to pry into all of her family affairs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   You deliberately planned and executed a meeting with Nancy Blair for the\n   ex[p]ress purpose of getting me to turn over all of my rightful inheritance from Audrey to you and your siblings. In the mistaken belief that, being as generous as I could to you all I could win your approval of Sue, I went along with it. None of you ever made any gesture in that direction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   I find it almost impossible to believe that you could have been so disrespectful of me as your father, so uncaring about how I wished to spend the rest of my life, so unjustifiably disapproving of the woman I love.\n   <footnotemark>\n    83\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   It is apparent from the correspondence that the Debtor believed he had generously acceded to all of Hy Blair's requests at the May 2011 Meeting in order to buy peace and to \"win approval\" of Crowley. That is why he \"went along with it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Other testimony establishes that the Debtor believed that he had resolved everything at the May 2011 Meeting. For example, Karen Hart, a non-party witness, testified that the Debtor had told her that he thought he had \"settled with his children and that he could just enjoy his life with Sue and get on with that.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    84\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, Ester Larue, another non-party witness, confirmed that the Debtor told her that he believed he had \"settled\" disputes with his children and \"thought he had everything handled to the satisfaction that he would have the freedom to do what he wanted to do. He felt like he had kind of a clean slate ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    85\n   </footnotemark>\n   Also, the Debtor explained to her that he \"regretted\" settling because he no longer had any leverage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    86\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtor also told Crowley's son, Todd Searles that the Debtor had \"appeased\" his children in the spring or summer of 2011 by giving back funds \"even though [the Debtor] didn't believe there was any justification for it.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    87\n   </footnotemark>\n   Searles testified that the Debtor \"was merely trying to make peace with the family. He wanted to be married. He wanted to be in love. He didn't want to have this [family dispute] as part of his life.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    88\n   </footnotemark>\n   Crowley also confirmed the same: that the Debtor told her that he had satisfied his children at the May 2011 Meeting by returning \"in the neighborhood of $4 some million dollars\" and transferring a house to Christopher Blair.\n   <footnotemark>\n    89\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Based upon the foregoing, including the contradictory nature of Hy Blair's testimony, the available documentary evidence (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   letters from both the Debtor and Hy Blair), and the testimony from multiple witnesses (Crowley, Todd Searles, Karen Hart, and Ester Larue), the Court finds that neither Hy Blair nor the ARB Trust made a demand to the Debtor for an additional $1.1 million (or $1.4 million) at the May 2011 Meeting. Instead, the Debtor's children requested that the Debtor: (1) transfer $4.5 million from his revocable trust back to the ARB Trust; (2) transfer a house in San Luis Obispo, California to Christopher Blair; (3) repay some other small amounts to the ARB Trust; and (4) resign as co-trustee of the ARB Trust. And, the Debtor satisfied all these requests. The Court finds that the Debtor was not on notice at any time between May 2011 and January 2012 that Hy Blair and the ARB Trust demanded anything more. The Debtor genuinely believed that he had settled with his children and the\n   ARB Trust at the May 2011 Meeting. Three months later he married Crowley.

Although the multiple discrepancies were never explained, the Court accepts that the Chapter 7 Trustee proved a total of $10,704.95 in transfers from the Debtor to Crowley. And, at trial, Crowley acknowledged that she cashed the checks and received the Cash Transfers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Crowley testified that the Cash Transfers were \"gifts\" and that the Debtor was \"very generous.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    92\n   </footnotemark>\n   She conceded that she did not provide any economic value to the Debtor in return for the Cash Transfer gifts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    93\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, she reiterated throughout the trial that she provided her \"love and affection\" to the Debtor during their relationship as an engaged couple.

As of the end of May 2011, the Debtor had at least $719,564.36 in the three financial institution accounts. By the end of December 2011, the Debtor had even more in such accounts than he had started with: $780,725.62. And, because the Defendants advocated for use of a \"cost basis\" for UBS No. 3623, the fair market value of the Debtor's bank accounts actually was materially higher.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n    <em>\n     The Debtor's IRA Accounts\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   In addition to the Debtor's bank accounts, the Debtor also held substantial additional assets in four Individual Retirement Accounts at UBS: UBS IRA Account No. XXXX3633 (\"IRA No. 1\"); UBS IRA Account No. XXXX3627 (\"IRA No. 2); UBS IRA Account No. XXX3624 (\"IRA No. 3); and UBS IRA Account No. XXX5364 (\"IRA No. 4). The Defendants\n   presented summaries of the \"IRA fair market value\" prepared by Heidi Mourning. Ex. P and Q. The Court carefully reviewed Exhibits P and Q and then compared such summaries to the underlying account statements for IRA Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4. Regrettably, the Court concludes that Exhibits P and Q are so replete with errors that they are virtually worthless for assessing the value of IRA Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   For example, Exhibits P and Q both state that the aggregate \"fair market value\" or \"monthly account balances\" of IRA Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 was as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-124\"><em>Month</em> <em>Aggregate Balance</em> January 2011: $5,859,681.42 February 2011: $6,029,966.69 March 2011: $5,859,681.42 April 2011: $6,029,966.69 May 2011: $5,859,681.42 June 2011: $6,029,966.69 July 2011: $5,859,681.42 August 2011: $6,029,966.69</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The anomaly is apparent after scanning the numbers for just a moment. Heidi Mourning's summaries assert that the total \"fair market value\" of IRA Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 was $5,859,681.42 every odd month and $6,029,966.69 every even month over an eight-month analysis period. Since the four financial accounts held significant money market balances (generating interest) and equities (generating dividends and subject to daily price fluctuations) is seems wildly improbable that the value of IRA Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 could seesaw back and forth between identical numbers for the better part of a year. Perhaps not surprisingly, the underlying account statements (O-5, O-6, O-7, and 0-8) show that the summaries are wrong.

The Court did not receive solid evidence concerning the use of the funds after the transfers. But one of the transfers (for $2,540.95) matched exactly with Crowley's mortgage payment on the Real Property. And, two of the other payment ($2,500) are of a very similar size. The Court infers that it is likely at least some of the Cash Transfers went to pay Crowley's mortgage on the Real Property. Certainly, there is no evidence that the Debtor kept control over such funds after making the transfers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   The Debtor made the Business Transfers to First Class.

In the Court's assessment, the Debtor did not conceal the Cash Transfers or Business Transfers from anyone. Instead, after the Debtor's engagement with Crowley, he was very upfront with everyone about his financial intentions. He made no secret that he intended to financially support Crowley and \"to help her as much as he could.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    148\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtor told Hy Blair that he was going to leave Crowley financial assets (including a personal trading account and IRA) as well as pay off her house.\n   <footnotemark>\n    149\n   </footnotemark>\n   Over time, the Debtor repeatedly reiterated his intention to support Crowley financially.\n   <footnotemark>\n    150\n   </footnotemark>\n   He confirmed again and again his desire to pay off Crowley's mortgage on the Real Property. Not only did the Debtor not conceal his general intention to support Crowley, his disclosure of such intended support was the impetus for the Debtor's children to oppose his marriage and to commence an investigation of the Debtor and Crowley.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   The Chapter 7 Trustee argues that the Debtor concealed the Cash Transfers and\n   Business Transfers because \"[t]here was no discussion, no disclosure, to any of the creditors at the time the transfers were made\" and \"[t]hese transfers were not known to Hy Blair, to the estate, at the time or shortly thereafter when they were made.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    151\n   </footnotemark>\n   These contentions are very contrived. The Chapter 7 Trustee has not demonstrated that the Debtor even had any creditors during the summer of 2011 and there was no \"[bankruptcy] estate\" until four years later when the Debtor filed for bankruptcy. So, the Debtor could not have been concealing transfers from the estate. That leaves Hy Blair who, at the time, was not a creditor of the Debtor. It is true that Hy Blair had held a power of attorney from the Debtor and so had been able to directly access some of the Debtor's financial accounts prior to the summer of 2011. But after the May 2011 Meeting and the vitriolic correspondence from Hy Blair, the Debtor revoked the power of attorney he had given to his son.\n   <footnotemark>\n    152\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, the Debtor moved some funds from WF No. 3363 to establish a new account at Citywide Banks: CW No. 8916. But, the Chapter 7 Trustee did not prove concealment. Instead the evidence demonstrates that the Debtor had had enough of Hy Blair's attacks and did not wish for him to have free rein over the Debtor's bank accounts. The Chapter 7 Trustee seems to suggest that the Debtor should have sent his estranged son and siblings copies of each of the 16 checks constituting the Cash Transfers and the Business Transfers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    153\n   </footnotemark>\n   The argument is nonsense. The Debtor was very upfront with his children that he was supporting Crowley financially. He had no obligation to send a copy of his checkbook to his children, especially after their demands and the settlement made at the May 2011 Meeting. The Chapter 7 Trustee failed in his burden to show concealment as a \"badge of fraud.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     Had the Debtor been Sued or Threatened with Suit Prior to the Cash Transfers and Business Transfers\n    </em>\n    ?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   The Debtor had not been sued before the Cash Transfers and Business Transfers. The only evidence of a lawsuit is that Hy Blair and the ARB Trust initiated the Probate Case against the Debtor on November 6, 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    154\n   </footnotemark>\n   The month before filing the Probate Case, Hy Blair and the ARB Trust presented the Debtor with an \"interim accounting\" and \"requested the money that was outlined in the accounting as being missing or improperly distributed.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    155\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the Court did not receive any direct testimony that a lawsuit was threatened at that time, the Court accepts that was the unstated implication of the request. But that was well over a year\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the Cash Transfers and Business Transfers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   The Chapter 7 Trustee argued that prior to the Cash Transfers and the Business Transfers - during the May 2011 Meeting in Connecticut - Hy Blair had demanded that the Debtor pay an additional $1.1 million and that such demand constituted a threat of suit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    156\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Trustee acknowledged\n   that the only evidence of such demand was Hy Blair's testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    157\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court already has determined that Hy Blair was not a credible witness. And, specifically in regard to the alleged demand for $1.1 million, Hy Blair's testimony was riddled with inconsistencies, contradictions, and failures of recollection. Further, the Chapter 7 Trustee offered no corroboration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   On the other hand, the documentary record negates Hy Blair's testimony. Hy Blair wrote many letters to the Debtor in the summer of 2011. But none of such correspondence ever mentioned an additional demand for $1.1 million that had been refused. Instead, the import of Hy Blair's contemporaneous correspondence was that his father had done everything that had been requested of the Debtor at the May 2011 Meeting. Similarly, the Debtor's correspondence with Hy Blair established that the Debtor thought he had settled any disputes with his children and the ARB Trust. He thought he had \"bought peace.\" Four witnesses (Crowley, Todd Searles, Ester Larue, and Karen Hart) confirmed that the Debtor had told them that he believed he had settled any disputes at the May 2011 Meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   Notably, in his closing argument, counsel for the Chapter 7 Trustee acknowledged that the $4.5 million payment made by the Debtor as part of the May 2011 Meeting:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-204\">\n   ...\n   <em>\n    was made for a settlement\n   </em>\n   ... to bring peace as all of the witnesses had discussed. To bring peace to the family and to resolve a dispute. That's what the payment was for. The return of the money to resolve a dispute that had arisen in May.\n   <footnotemark>\n    158\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   (Emphasis added.) The Chapter 7 Trustee's concession guts his argument that there was some lingering demand or claim constituting a threatened lawsuit at the May 2011 Meeting. The Court finds that the Debtor had no notice of any such thing. At the time he made the Cash Transfers and the Business Transfers, he thought he had resolved the demands made by his children and the ARB Trust. It turns out he was sadly mistaken; but he did not come to that realization until October 2012 - well after the Cash Transfers and Business Transfers. The Chapter 7 Trustee failed in his attempt to prove a lawsuit or threatened lawsuit before the Cash Transfers and Business Transfers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   <strong>\n    5.\n    <em>\n     Did the Cash Transfers and Business Transfers Constitute Transfers of Substantially All of the Debtor's Assets?\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   The Chapter 7 Trustee and the Defendants provided only very incomplete information concerning the Debtor's assets during the summer of 2011. No witness, for either side, gave a complete listing of the Debtor's assets and the value of such assets. Similarly, no admitted exhibits itemized and valued all of the Debtor's assets. Since the Court only has an incomplete picture of the Debtor's assets, it follows that the Chapter 7 Trustee failed his burden to show that the Cash Transfers and Business Transfers constituted transfers of substantially all of the Debtor's assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   Nevertheless, the Court has attempted to assess the incomplete information admitted at the trial. Section 102(2) of the CUFTA defines the \"assets\" that should be considered:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-209\">\n   \"Asset\" means property of the debtor. \"Asset\" shall not include: (a) Property to the extent it is encumbered by a lien; (b)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-210\">\n   Property to the extent it is generally exempt immediately prior to the time of transfer under nonbankruptcy law ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   COLO. REV. STAT. \u00a7 38-8-102(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   The Court received evidence concerning only three categories of the Debtor's assets: (1) bank accounts; (2) IRA accounts; and (3) ownership of BOI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   <strong>\n    a.\n    <em>\n     The Bank Accounts\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   During the summer of 2011, the Debtor's \"ending balances,\" \"closing balances\" or \"cost basis totals\" for UBS No. 3623, WF No. 3363, and CW No. 8916 ranged between $715,578.64 to $949,579.34.\n   <footnotemark>\n    159\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the Debtor's remaining assets clearly were substantial. However, in his closing argument, the Chapter 7 Trustee argued that the significant amounts in UBS No. 3623 should not be considered in assessing the Debtor's financial condition because such account was encumbered by a valid lien during the relevant time period. Each of the account statements for UBS No. 3623 does bear the notation \"Pleg'd Coll Acct-FBO UBS Bank USA.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    160\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court supposes that such designation means: \"Pledged Collateral Account for the benefit of UBS Bank USA.\" Each of the account statements for UBS No. 3623 also states: \"This account has been pledged to secure an obligation or is guaranteeing the obligations of another account.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    161\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, none of the account statements identify any obligation or guarantee made by the Debtor for the benefit of UBS. The Court received no evidence that the Debtor actually owed anything to UBS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   In closing argument, the Chapter 7 Trustee stated that a \"Credit Line Account Application and Agreement for Trust and Estate Accounts\" (the \"Credit Application\") entered into evidence as Exhibit 17 proved that UBS had a lien on UBS No. 3623 in 2011. The contention is wrong. The Credit Application (which is extensively redacted) is an application made by the ARB Trust: \"Audrey R. Blair Rev. Trust Peter H. Blair and Peter H. Blair, Jr. Trustees.\" The Credit Application refers to an ARB Trust \"Variable Credit Line Account\" and an ARB Trust \"Fixed Credit Line Account.\" There is one \"Collateral Account\" identified apparently in the name of \"Audrey R. Blair Rev. Trust Peter H. Blair and Peter H. Blair, Jr. Trustees.\" The account number has been redacted. The Debtor and Hy Blair signed the Credit Application as co-trustees of the ARB Trust on February 18, 2009. Suffice to say that nothing in the Credit Application shows that the Debtor pledged UBS No. 3623 as collateral to UBS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   To the extent that the Chapter 7 Trustee wished to argue that UBS No. 3623 should not count as the Debtor's asset in a solvency analysis, the Chapter 7 Trustee had the obligation to show that there was a valid lien against UBS No. 3623 and \"the extent\" to which UBS No. 3623 was encumbered. He did not do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    162\n   </footnotemark>\n   Since the Chapter 7 Trustee failed to meet his evidentiary burden, the Court will not eliminate UBS No. 3623 from consideration as an asset of the Debtor. So, the Debtor had substantial assets in his bank accounts\n   even after the Cash Transfers and Business Transfers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n    <em>\n     The IRA Accounts\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   During the summer of 2011, the Debtor's \"closing account values\" for the Debtor's IRA Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 ranged from $6,089,135.07 to $4,459,952.39.\n   <footnotemark>\n    163\n   </footnotemark>\n   Significant would be an understatement for characterizing such accounts. However, as the Chapter 7 Trustee has correctly observed, the Court should not include as \"assets\" \"property to the extent it is generally exempt immediately prior to the time of transfer under nonbankruptcy law.\" COLO. REV. STAT. \u00a7 38-8-102(2)(b). Although the Court received no evidence on the issue during the trial, both the Chapter 7 Trustee and the Defendants appeared to acknowledge that IRA Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 all were generally exempt assets. Thus, the Court will not count these very substantial amounts in the Debtor's IRA Accounts for purposes of determining the Debtor's remaining assets under the CUFTA. However, the significant balances in the Debtor's IRA Accounts may bear on other legal issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   <strong>\n    c.\n    <em>\n     Value of BOI\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   The Debtor wholly-owned BOI, an oil and gas company, both before and after the Cash Transfers and Business Transfers. He did not divest himself of the entity. The Chapter 7 Trustee and the Defendants presented only very sketchy and incomplete information concerning the value of the Debtor's interest in BOI in 2011. The low end of the value range was $65,181.53 in equity based upon the book value from a December 2010 BOI Balance Sheet. However, in a 2010 e-mail from Hy Blair, he presented a $4.8 million valuation for BOI based upon a computer model. At this juncture, the Court need not decide the value of the Debtor's interest in BOI. It is enough to say that the Debtor's interest was at least $65,181.53 and that the Debtor retained such interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   Based upon the foregoing, the Cash Transfers and the Business Transfers did not constitute transfers of substantially all the Debtor's assets. The Debtor retained significant assets after such transfers. Thus, the Chapter 7 Trustee failed to prove this \"badge of fraud\" factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   <strong>\n    6.\n    <em>\n     Did the Debtor Abscond or Remove or Conceal Assets?\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   The Debtor did not secretly leave Colorado after making the Cash Transfers and Business Transfers. Instead, he recommitted to staying in the Centennial State. He married Crowley who was a long-time Denver resident. Together, they remodeled a portion of the Colorado house that she had owned for more than two decades. And then the Debtor moved in with his new wife. He continued to live with her for the rest of his life. Suffice it to say that he did not abscond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   The Court already has determined that the Debtor did not conceal the Cash Transfers and Business Transfers. Further, he did not remove assets from the jurisdiction or conceal them either. Neither party provided the Court with a full inventory of the Debtor's assets at the time of the Cash Transfers and the Business Transfers - or afterward. Instead, the Court only received evidence about three categories of assets: bank accounts; IRA accounts; and the Debtor's ownership of BOI. The Debtor continued to wholly own BOI (which itself filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code) until he died. The Court received no evidence suggesting that the Debtor concealed\n   the bank accounts and IRA accounts. Thus, this factor cuts against the Chapter 7 Trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   <strong>\n    7.\n    <em>\n     Did the Debtor Receive Reasonably Equivalent Value in Return for the Cash Transfers and Business Transfers?\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   \"Reasonably equivalent value\" under the CUFTA means some sort of economic benefit.\n   <em>\n    Lewis v.

REV. STAT. \u00a7 38-8-102(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   The Court starts its analysis of this \"badge of fraud\" factor by considering whether a presumption of insolvency has arisen under Section 103(2) of the CUFTA - thus, potentially shifting the burden to the Defendants. To establish such a presumption, the Chapter 7 Trustee was required to prove that the Debtor was \"generally not paying his debts as they become due\" at the time of each of the Cash Transfers and Business Transfers. The Chapter 7 Trustee provided no such evidence. In fact, in a rare area of agreement, both Hy Blair and Crowley testified that the Debtor generally was paying his bills when they became due. The Debtor's bank account records confirm as much and detail all manner of monthly payments during the summer of 2011. The issue is so clear that the Chapter 7 Trustee effectively conceded the point by not arguing for such presumption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   Since no presumption of insolvency came into play, the Chapter 7 Trustee tried to demonstrate actual insolvency. The statutory definition of insolvency (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   \"sum of the debtor's debts is greater than all of the debtor's assets at a fair valuation) is another way of saying that the fair value balance sheet method is required to show insolvency.\n   <em>\n    CB Richard Ellis, Inc. v.

On the assets side of the balance sheet the Court received evidence concerning only three categories of assets: (1) bank accounts; (2) IRA accounts; and (3) ownership of BOI. As previously explained, the Debtor's \"ending balances,\" \"closing balances\" or \"cost basis totals\" for UBS No. 3623, WF No. 3363, and CW No. 8916 ranged between $715,578.64 to $949,579.34 during the summer of 2011. The Chapter 7 Trustee failed to show that UBS No. 3623 should have been excluded because it was \"encumbered by a lien.\" Furthermore, the aggregate bank account balances appear to be understated since the Defendants proposed using \"cost basis totals\" rather than fair market values for UBS No. 3623. With respect to the IRA accounts, the \"closing\n   account values\" for the Debtor's IRA Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 ranged from $6,089,135.07 to $4,459,952.39 during the period. However, the Court excludes the IRA accounts from the balance sheet since both the Chapter 7 Trustee and the Defendants seemed to concede that the IRA accounts were \"generally exempt\" immediately prior to the Cash Transfers and Business Transfers under nonbankruptcy law. With respect to the value of the Debtor's equity interest in BOI, the Chapter 7 Trustee failed to produce sufficient evidence for the Court to determine the actual fair market value of the Debtor's interest in BOI during the summer of 2011. The Chapter 7 Trustee seemed to concede that the Debtor's interest was at least $65,181.53 based on the book value from a December 2010 BOI Balance Sheet. But, this value suggestion was not based upon fair market value as required by Section 103(1) of the CUFTA. As a counter, the Defendants offered a $4.8 million valuation for BOI based upon an e-mail from Hy Blair in which he referenced a computer valuation model. The actual computer valuation model was not introduced into evidence. Hy Blair's testimony indicated that the calculation was based upon some sort of cash flow analysis rather than fair market value as required by Section 103(1) of the CUFTA. So, the Court is left with no definitive evidence to assess the value of the Debtor's interest in BOI. The Court also notes that the Chapter 7 Trustee failed to establish that the three categories of assets constituted all of the Debtor's assets during the relevant time period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   At the end of it all, the Chapter 7 Trustee did not prove up the assets side of the balance sheet. The best the Court can conclude is that the Debtor had bank accounts worth in excess of $715,578.64 to $949,579.34, an interest in BOI worth a minimum of $65,181.53 (but probably much more), and perhaps other assets. Because the Chapter 7 Trustee did not prove the Debtor's assets during the relevant time period, he cannot show that the Debtor was insolvent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   Even though the Chapter 7 Trustee lost this \"badge of fraud\" factor for failure to prove the Debtor's assets, the Court also briefly addresses the liabilities side of the balance sheet. The Chapter 7 Trustee introduced no evidence of the Debtor's liabilities during the summer of 2011. And, because the Debtor was generally paying his current debts as they became due, it does not appear that the Debtor had any material creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   However, the Chapter 7 Trustee contends that somehow the $2,372,688.29 Probate Judgment entered against the Debtor on March 27, 2015 should fly back in time and be counted as a liability of the Debtor during the summer of 2011. This is hindsight nonsense. The Court already has determined that Hy Blair and the ARB Trust did not raise any additional claim for $1.1 or otherwise at the May 2011 Meeting. The first inkling the Debtor had that Hy Blair and the ARB Trust were demanding more was the \"interim accounting\" presented during October 2012 which then formed the basis for Hy Blair and the ARB Trust commencing the Probate Case on November 6, 2012. The Probate Case was hotly disputed and resulted in years of litigation before the Probate Court entered the Probate Judgment against the Debtor. Nevertheless, the Chapter 7 Trustee suggests that a contingent claim somehow should be included on the Debtor's balance sheet a year before it was first asserted and four years before the entry of judgment. This proposition is directly contrary to Colorado appellate precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   Colorado law on insolvency follows the generally accepted methodology for valuing contingent liabilities. Under the\n   CUFTA, contingent liabilities (such as pending litigation that has not been reduced to judgment) must be discounted by the probability of the contingency's becoming non-contingent (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   by the likelihood that a judgment will actually enter) as of the date of the alleged fraudulent transfer.\n   <em>\n    CB Richard Ellis\n   </em>\n   is the seminal case. Therein, the Colorado Court of Appeals held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-245\">\n   While an insolvency determination measures a debtor's assets against its liabilities at a \"fair valuation,\" section 38-8-103(1), such determination will depend on whether the liability is certain or contingent. There is no dispute that here, at the time of the transfer, the broker had a \"claim\" under section 38-8-102(3), C.R.S. 2009 (definition of \"claim\"), against the LLC. However, no judgment existed at the time of the transfer, and the trial court found that the parties had a bona fide dispute over whether the claim should be paid at all.

The Chapter 7 Trustee cannot refute the\n   <em>\n    CB Richard Ellis\n   </em>\n   holding. As of the time of the Cash Transfers and Business Transfers, no demand had been asserted against the Debtor and the Probate Case was not filed until more than a year later. The Chapter 7 Trustee introduced no evidence to show how the unasserted and contingent liability (eventually adjudicated in the Probate Case) should have been valued and discounted as of the summer of 2011. Accordingly, the Chapter 7 Trustee failed to prove the Debtor's liabilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   Ultimately, since Chapter 7 Trustee was unable to establish both the Debtor's assets (at \"a fair valuation\") and the Debtor's liabilities, the Court cannot adjudicate the Debtor as insolvent at the time of the Cash Transfers and Business Transfers. This \"badge of fraud\" factor favors the Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   <strong>\n    9.\n    <em>\n     Did the Cash Transfers and Business Transfers Occur Shortly Before or Shortly After a Substantial Debt Was Incurred\n    </em>\n    ?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   The Debtor made the Cash Transfers and Business Transfers during the short time window between June 6 and August 30, 2011. This period follows closely after the May 2011 Meeting. As noted previously, the Chapter 7 Trustee argued that during the May 2011 Meeting, Hy Blair and the ARB Trust asserted a claim against the Debtor for $1.1 million, which the Debtor refused. The argument raises an interesting legal issue: Is a debt \"incurred\" simply by assertion of a demand? But, the Court need not delve too deeply into the legal part of the argument because it is contrary to the facts. The Court already has determined - and the Chapter 7 Trustee's counsel conceded in closing argument - that the May 2011 Meeting resulted in a settlement. The Debtor \"bought peace\" with his children by performing all that was asked of him. The Court scrutinized Hy Blair's inconsistent testimony and the documentary record (correspondence between the Hy Blair and the Debtor). The Court also considered the testimony of many other witnesses. Based upon such assessment, Court concluded that there was no additional demand for $1.1 million against the Debtor made at the May 2011 Meeting. The Debtor thought he has resolved all issues. Only afterward did he make the Cash Transfers and Business Transfers. So, he did not make the transfers right after incurring a substantial debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   Then, more than another year passed before Hy and the ARB Trust asserted a new demand against the Debtor through the presentation of an \"interim accounting\" during October 2012. That led to filing of the Probate Case the following month. Many more years of contentious litigation followed before the Probate Court issued the Probate Judgment against the Debtor on March 27, 2015. The Cash Transfers and Business Transfers were not \"shortly before\" the new demand, the start of the Probate Case, or the Probate Judgment. Thus, the Chapter 7 Trustee failed to prove this \"badge of fraud\" factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   <strong>\n    10.\n    <em>\n     The Chapter 7 Trustee Did Not Establish Actual Fraud\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   As noted previously, the Court must engage in a holistic analysis to determine whether the Debtor made the Cash Transfers and the Business Transfers with \"actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud\" under Section 105(1)(a) of the CUFTA.\n   <em>\n    Schempp II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9095755\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/75/1157/#p1165\">\n    75 P.3d at 1161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Chapter 7 Trustee provided no direct evidence of fraudulent intent. So, the Court turned to circumstantial evidence and considered the extensive list of \"badges of fraud\" contained in Section 105(2) of the CUFTA. Virtually all the \"badges of fraud\" negate a finding a fraudulent intent. Only a single factor favors the Chapter 7 Trustee - the Debtor did not receive reasonably equivalent value from Crowley and First Class in return for the Cash Transfers and Business Transfers. This \"badge of fraud\" factor is one of the most important of the statutory factors; but it is not dispositive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   In addition to assessment of the \"badges of fraud\" list, the Court also has considered the unique context of this case. Before making the Cash Transfers and Business Transfers, the Debtor settled (or at a\n   very minimum, the Debtor believed that he had settled) the demands made by Hy Blair and the ARB Trust. The Debtor believed that he \"bought peace.\" During the summer of 2011, he was paying his bills as they became due and was not insolvent. At the time, the Debtor had no creditors. So, he had every right to use his funds however he saw fit, including making transfers to his fianc\u00e9. Hy Blair and the ARB Trust first asserted additional claims against the Debtor more than a year after the Cash Transfers and Business Transfers. The Probate Court did not issue the Probate Judgment until almost four years after the Cash Transfers and Business Transfers. The Chapter 7 Trustee's position is nothing more than some hindsight\n   <em>\n    ipse dixit\n   </em>\n   . After carefully weighing the evidence and the \"badges of fraud,\" the Court concludes that the Chapter 7 Trustee failed to meet his difficult burden to prove the Debtor's \"actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

REV. STAT. \u00a7 38-8-105(1)(b). In his Sixth Claim for Relief, the Chapter 7 Trustee asserted that the Business Transfers are recoverable from First Class based upon the same statutes. Since the statutory framework is the same, the Court analyzes both the causes of action together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   Section 105(1)(b) of the CUFTA states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-262\">\n   A transfer made or obligation incurred by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor, whether the creditor's claim arose before or after the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred, if the debtor made the transfer or incurred the obligation: ...

So, there is a threshold legal question whether Subsection 105(1)(b)(I) may be used against a retired individual like the Debtor. But, regardless of such theoretical issue, the Chapter 7 Trustee did not plead the requirements of Subsection 105(1)(b)(I) of the CUFTA in either the Second Claim or the Sixth Claim of the Amended Complaint. He did not advance any argument under this Subsection of the CUFTA. And, he did not introduce evidence to prove that the Debtor was engaged in a business or transaction for which the remaining assets of the Debtor were unreasonably small in relation to the business or transaction. So, Subsection 105(1)(b)(I) of the CUFTA does not help the Chapter 7 Trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   Instead, the Chapter 7 Trustee relies on Subsection 105(1)(b)(II) of the CUFTA and asserted that the Debtor \"intended to incur, or believed or reasonably should have believed that he would incur, debts beyond his ability to pay as they became due.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    166\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"This test measures whether the debtor ... would reasonably have been seen as able to pay [his] debts after making the questionable transfer.\"\n   <em>\n    CB Richard Ellis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988188\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/251/523/#p532\">\n    251 P.3d at 531-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Pajaro Dunes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6108679\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/174/557/#p591\">\n    174 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   593 ).

There is none. The Cash Transfers added up to only $10,704.95 whilst the Business Transfers totaled $57,733.81. Meanwhile, during the same period, the Debtor had about $715,578.64 to $949,579.34 (or more if UBS No. 3623 was valued at fair market value instead of only \"cost basis\") in liquid assets in his bank accounts (UBS No. 3623, WF No. 3363, and CW No. 8916). If he ever ran low, the Debtor had access to substantial additional exempt assets including about $4,459,952.39 to $5,872,058.24 in his IRA accounts (IRA Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4). He continued to pay all his regular bills on time (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   charges for apartment rental, country club dues, telephone, cable, life insurance, health insurance, credit cards, attorneys, and accountants). The Cash Transfers and Business Transfers were a mere fraction of his available resources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   Blessed with such abundant financial resources, there also is no evidence that the Debtor intended to incur any new debt during the summer of 2011. Instead, he\n   was mostly retired (albeit he still owned BOI) and trying to enjoy his golden years with his fianc\u00e9. The Debtor was looking forward to marrying Crowley and spending their lives together with no stresses while enjoying financial security. He didn't believe that he would incur further debt either. He had resolved disputes with his children and the ARB Trust at the May 2011 Meeting. No additional demands were made until more than a year later and made quite unexpectedly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   After considering all the evidence, the Court concludes that the Chapter 7 Trustee failed to meet his burden to prove constructive fraud under Section 105(1)(b) of the CUFTA. The Defendants conceded that the Debtor did not receive reasonably equivalent value for the Cash Transfers to his fianc\u00e9 and the Business Transfers to her company.

How did that come to pass? In the Amended Complaint, the Chapter 7 Trustee offered no clues and failed to articulate any legal basis for the shift in ownership of the Property.

He jettisoned the original claim for \"declaratory judgment.\" Instead, according to the Chapter 7 Trustee, the Eighth Claim became two new claims: (1) unjust enrichment; and (2) resulting trust. The Chapter 7 Trustee also contended that he was not trying to avoid the Mortgage Payoff Transfers under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20544\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Chapter 7 Trustee seemed to contend that the Eighth Claim was some sort of free form theory existing under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (governing \"property of the estate\") but entirely independent of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20544\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 546 (governing strong-arm powers to bring state law avoidance actions and establishing the limitations period for avoidance actions\"). Based upon the Chapter 7 Trustee's express argument that the Eighth Claim was not an avoidance action governed by Sections 544 and 546, the Court denied summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    175\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-291\">\n   Armed with this explanation supplementing the very sketchy allegations in the Eighth Claim, the Defendants tried for summary judgment again.\n   <footnotemark>\n    176\n   </footnotemark>\n   This time, the Chapter 7 Trustee had a different explanation of the Eighth Claim. He reiterated that the Eighth Claim involved a \"resulting trust theory\" and the \"unjust enrichment theory\" morphed into a \"constructive trust\" theory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    177\n   </footnotemark>\n   Contrary to representations made earlier in the litigation, the Chapter 7 Trustee now stated: \"The Trustee's unjust enrichment claim is properly construed as a claim on behalf of the Debtor's creditors pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20544\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)....

Whereas the Chapter 7 Trustee previously\n   pushed a resulting trust theory, he abandoned it in closing argument as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-293\">\n   <em>\n    Court\n   </em>\n   : Is there any evidence that the Debtor intended any kind of trust arrangement vis-\u00e0-vis the house to create a trust?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-294\">\n   <em>\n    Chapter 7 Trustee Counsel\n   </em>\n   : Your honor, I think you're referring to the resulting trust argument, which, if we were arguing it was a resulting trust, then yes, there had to be an intent to create a trust. We are not arguing a resulting ... trust theory. We are arguing the constructive trust theory.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-295\">\n   <em>\n    Court\n   </em>\n   : Okay, I have been very, very confused in your arguments on claim eight and, in my estimation, they have shifted over time. But, for now, and here we are at the end ... what is your argument?

But, the Court determines from the final dialogue that the Chapter 7 Trustee expressly and definitively waived and abandoned any resulting trust theory of recovery for the Eighth Claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-298\">\n   Given such waiver and abandonment, the Court need not adjudicate a resulting trust theory. And declaratory judgment is no longer in play either. Instead, what remains for decision is only the Chapter 7 Trustee's contention that Crowley was unjustly enriched. The Chapter 7 Trustee proposes a constructive trust remedy for such unjust enrichment. Furthermore, as the Chapter 7 Trustee has conceded, such claim falls within the ambit of Section 544(a) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    180\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-299\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     The Eighth Claim Is Barred By the Statute of Limitations\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-300\">\n   In her Answer and throughout this litigation process, Crowley asserted the statute of limitations as a defense to the Eighth Claim. She stated the rationale succinctly as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-301\">\n   Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20546\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), the statute of limitation for the Trustee to bring an adversary proceeding expired on May 7, 2017. The Amended Complaint was filed on May 24, 2017, and asserts new causes of action arising out of transactions and occurrences that were not set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original Complaint, and which therefore do not relate back under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15.\n   <footnotemark>\n    181\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-302\">\n   Crowley's reference to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20546\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) is spot on. That statute is titled \"Limitations on Avoiding Powers\" and establishes a statute of limitation for certain actions by chapter 7 trustees:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-303\">\n   An action or proceeding under section 544... of this title may not be commenced after the earlier of -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-304\">\n   (1) the later of -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-305\">\n   (A) 2 years after the entry of the order for relief; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-306\">\n   (B) 1 year after the appointment of election of the first trustee under section 702 ... of this title ...; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-307\">\n   (2) the time the case is closed or dismissed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-308\">\n   Applying Section 546(a) to the Eighth Claim in this Adversary Proceeding is a rather simple exercise. The Bankruptcy Case has not been closed. The Chapter 7 Trustee was appointed on August 20, 2015 - so the one-year deadline after his\n   appointment was August 20, 2016. But since the Bankruptcy Case was filed on May 7, 2015, the Chapter 7 Trustee enjoyed a longer, two-year period after the commencement of the Bankruptcy Case within which to bring actions under Section 544. That extended limitations period expired on May 7, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    182\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-309\">\n   For reasons unknown, the Chapter 7 Trustee waited until almost the very end of the Section 546(a) limitations period to commence the Adversary Proceeding. He filed on May 5, 2017. So, he was timely with respect to those claims included in the original Complaint. However, the original Complaint was narrowly tailored to the Cash Transfers and Business Transfers only. The Chapter 7 Trustee made no factual allegations whatsoever concerning the Real Property or the Mortgage Payoff Transfers. He did not assert an Eighth Claim for declaratory judgment. All that came later in the Amended Complaint on May 24, 2017, which was a little more than two weeks after the expiration of the Section 546(a) statute of limitations. And, the Chapter 7 Trustee has never established or even argued that the Eighth Claim somehow should relate back to the filing of the original Complaint under FED. R. CIV. P. 15(c)(1), FED. R. BANKR. P. 7015, or otherwise. On its face, the brand-new allegations concerning the Real Property and the Mortgage Payoff Transfers do not arise out of \"the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out - or attempted to be set out - in the original pleading.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED. R. CIV. P. 15(C)(1) and FED. R. BANKR. P. 7015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-310\">\n   How did the Chapter 7 Trustee respond to the statute of limitations argument? First, the Chapter 7 Trustee contended that the Eighth Claim was not an avoidance claim under Section 544 at all. Instead, he claimed to be standing in the Debtor's shoes and pursuing claims under Section 541, claims that the Debtor held when he filed his case. Thus, the Chapter 7 Trustee argued that Section 546 was not applicable. This worked temporarily while the exact nature of the Eighth Claim remained a mystery. Emboldened by having narrowly escaped defeat of his Eighth Claim, the Chapter 7 Trustee reversed course completely and declared: \"The Trustee's unjust enrichment claim is properly construed as a claim on behalf of the Debtor's creditors pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20544\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    183\n   </footnotemark>\n   Again at trial, the Chapter 7 Trustee maintained that his Eighth Claim was based on Section 544.\n   <footnotemark>\n    184\n   </footnotemark>\n   The main case law authority bandied about by the Chapter 7 Trustee on the Eighth Claim also dictates that an unjust enrichment and constructive trust claim falls within the ambit of Section 544.\n   <em>\n    Lofstedt v.

Instead, he threw up a series of additional straw man arguments. The Chapter 7 Trustee's main response is that the unjust enrichment and constructive trust claim did not really expire before the Debtor filed for bankruptcy. Under Colorado law, \"unjust enrichment is a form of relief in quasi-contract or contract implied in law [so] the time within which to assert such a claim ordinarily is assessed under the three-year statute of limitations for contract actions.\"\n   <em>\n    Sterenbuch v.

App. 2011). The Mortgage Payoff Transfers occurred between June 2011 and January 2012, which was more than three years before the Bankruptcy Case was filed. Thus, the unjust enrichment and constructive trust claim may have expired long before the bankruptcy.

But they have nothing to do with Crowley's specific statute of limitations defense under Sections 544 and 546. Crowley is not arguing that the Chapter 7 Trustee's unjust enrichment and constructive trust claim expired before the bankruptcy (although the claim may very well be barred on that basis). Instead, Crowley makes only the simple point that whether lapsed or not before the bankruptcy, the Chapter Trustee had to bring the Eighth Claim by May 7, 2017 - and he did not.

Crowley has objected to the changes and the Court has effectively sustained her objections.

The contention is self-evident and satisfies the first two elements of the unjust enrichment claim. So, it all comes down to the third element and the question: Were the Mortgage Payoff Transfers made in circumstances such that it would be unjust for Crowley to retain the benefit without repayment?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-325\">\n   The Court determines that it would not be unjust for Crowley to retain the Real Property - the house that she has owned exclusively for at least 21 years - even though the Debtor paid off Crowley's lenders through the Mortgage Payoff Transfers between June 2011 and January 2012. The evidence established that the Debtor's action in paying off Crowley's mortgage was an extremely generous gift. He was never obligated (as a borrower or guarantor) on the note and mortgage associated with the Real Property. But he paid anyway. He did not take title to the Real Property because he did not want to do so. It was the Debtor's idea and intention to pay off the mortgage on the Real Property so that the Debtor and Crowley could \"start their marriage off level\" by eliminating Crowley's debts. The elimination of debts allowed Crowley to become financially secure so that the couple could live stress-free and \"could go through this part of our life just enjoying each other.\" The Debtor asked Crowley to stop working so that she could be with him. She could not do so unless the Debtor paid her mortgage. Paying off the mortgage also was the Debtor's way of protecting Crowley in the event of his passing. Although the Debtor knew he was making a gift, the Debtor also thought it would make financial sense because the couple planned for him to move into the Real Property and thereafter save the very high monthly rent charged by Parkplace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-326\">\n   Colorado law suggests that a completed gift may not be recoverable under an unjust enrichment theory.

The\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   circumstances are very similar to this case and suggest the that it would be improper to impose a constructive trust against Crowley's Real Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-334\">\n   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Court is reticent to deny the unjust enrichment claim and constructive trust remedy in this Adversary Proceeding solely because the Mortgage Payoff Transfers were gifts. Certainly, viewing the situation from the Debtor's perspective (if he were alive today) suggests that it would be unlikely the Debtor could or would recover back the completed gifts he made three and a half years before his bankruptcy. But, a more fulsome consideration of the circumstances surrounding the Debtor's generous gift to Crowley seems prudent and warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-335\">\n   The Chapter 7 Trustee did not assert claims against Crowley for fraud or fraudulent conveyances in relation to the Mortgage Payoff Transfers. Perhaps because he did not sue on that basis, he did not establish that the Debtor or Crowley engaged in fraud. The evidence showed that during the period when the Mortgage Payoff Transfers were made (June 2011 through January 2012), the Debtor continued to have substantial assets including: (1) about $715,578.64 to $780.725.62 in his bank accounts (UBS No. 3623, WF No. 3363, and CW No. 8916); (2) about\n   $4,870,667.41 to $5,872,058.24 in his IRA accounts (IRA Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4); and (3) the value of his interest in BOI. As with the Cash Transfers and Business Transfers, the Chapter 7 Trustee failed to provide a comprehensive picture of the Debtor's assets. During the same time period, the Debtor continued to pay his regular bills. The Chapter 7 Trustee failed to identify the Debtor's liabilities, except that the Debtor argued that the $2,372,688.29 Probate Judgment should be retroactively applied during the time period. The Court already has rejected that legal argument as contrary to Colorado law because any such claim was contingent and unasserted.\n   <em>\n    CB Richard Ellis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988188\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/251/523/#p532\">\n    251 P.3d at 533-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Chapter 7 Trustee failed to show that the Debtor had any creditors during the period from June 2011 through January 2012. The Debtor had not been sued or threatened with suit. He thought he had settled with Hy Blair and the ARB Trust. So, the Debtor should have enjoyed the freedom to make whatever gifts he wished to whomever he wished at that stage of his life. He did so using his own funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-336\">\n   As the Court considers whether it would be unjust for Crowley to receive the benefit of the Mortgage Payoff Transfers, the Court also is cognizant of the economic benefit that she provided. The Debtor and Crowley agreed that the Debtor would move into the Real Property with Crowley. Part of the idea was that the Debtor would save rent at Parkplace, a luxury building which cost more than $8,000 per month. The Debtor lived the last 43 months of his life with Crowley at the Real Property rent free. Applying the Parkplace rental rates, the Debtor saved at least $344,000 ($8,000 monthly rent X 43 months) because of the arrangement. The amount almost matches the Mortgage Payoff Transfers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-337\">\n   Short on facts helpful to his Eighth Claim, the Chapter 7 Trustee repeatedly referred to the Colorado Supreme Court's decision:\n   <em>\n    Shepler v. Whalen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8935720\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/119/1084/\">\n    119 P.3d 1084\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Colo. 2005). The Chapter 7 Trustee contended that\n   <em>\n    Shepler\n   </em>\n   was \"directly on point\" and presented \"facts almost identical to the facts in this matter.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    187\n   </footnotemark>\n   On the surface there are some similarities: the debtor's wife owned a townhouse; the debtor lived at the townhouse; and the debtor paid off his wife's mortgage on the townhouse to the tune of $353,000. However, that is where the similarities end.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-338\">\n   <em>\n    Shepler\n   </em>\n   did not involve an unjust enrichment claim. Instead, the issue was fraudulent conveyance.

With respect to the Cash Transfers and Business Transfers, the Chapter 7 Trustee alleged actual fraud and constructive fraud. The Court rejected the Chapter 7 Trustee's claims. Regarding the Mortgage Payoff Transfers, the Chapter 7 Trustee did not allege or prove fraud of any type. And, whereas the debtor in\n   <em>\n    Shepler\n   </em>\n   had numerous creditors that he intended to defraud by using money he owed to them to pay off his wife's mortgage, in this dispute the Chapter 7 Trustee did not establish that the Debtor had any creditors when the Mortgage Payoff Transfers\n   were made. In the end, and because the cases are so different, the\n   <em>\n    Shepler\n   </em>\n   holding does not support the Eighth Claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-340\">\n   Having considered the evidence and argument, the Court determines that the Chapter 7 Trustee failed to prove unjust enrichment and entitlement to a constructive trust remedy. To the contrary, it would be unjust to permit the Chapter 7 Trustee to take one half of Crowley's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-341\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-342\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Court denies the Chapter 7 Trustee relief on all of the claims asserted in the Amended Complaint.

The Court received no explanation from the Defendants why the \"cost basis\" should be used as a value for UBS No. 3623 rather than the fair market value listed in the account statements. The fair market values are significantly higher than the \"cost basis\" values. For example, the closing fair market value of UBS No. 3623 for June 2011 was $841,370.89 as compared to a \"cost basis\" value of only $694,336.43.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Ex.

Thus, all the amounts listed by the Court for UBS No. 3623 are for the lower \"cost basis\" value only.

The Official Comment for the CUFTA definition of \"insider\" is exactly the same as the Official Comment circulated with the model Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Law. As noted by the Chapter 7 Trustee, the Official Comment certainly suggests that the term \"insider\" under the CUFTA should be construed broadly and consistent with the Bankruptcy Code.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-510\">\n    Ordinarily, under both Colorado and Federal law, the official commentary accompanying a statute is \"instructive and persuasive in helping [ ] discern the meaning\" of a statute.\n    <em>\n     Green Tree Acceptance, Inc. v.

The Official Comment references the Bankruptcy Code definition of \"insider\" and notes that \"the word 'includes' is not limiting.\" Based upon the broad nature of the term \"includes\", the Official Comment concluded that a long-term household companion may qualify as an \"insider.\" However, the problem with this is obvious: the definition of the term \"insider\" in Section 102(8) of the CUFTA does not use the word \"includes\" at all. As discussed previously, the Colorado legislature departed from both the model Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Law, the Bankruptcy Code, and the similar statutes adopted in almost every other State by excising the word \"includes\" and narrowing the definition of the term \"insider\" by using the verb \"means.\" So, the Official Comment is commenting on something that is not part of the Colorado statute at all. And the Official Comment is not the governing law - only the statute is. The Court rejects deference to the Official Comment to Section 102 of the CUFTA because commenting on something not in the statute is not \"instructive or persuasive\" in ascertaining the meaning of the statutory text.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"148\">\n   <p id=\"p-512\">\n    Trans.
