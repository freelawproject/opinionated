(ECF No. 95 at 2). Technicool eventually filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy, leading NOV to file a proof of claim based on its state court lawsuit. (ECF No. 94-4 at 3). NOV later amended its state court petition to include specific fraud claims which allege that Robert Furlough,\n   Technicool's founder, played a role in the purported fraud against NOV. (ECF No. 95-4 at 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Furlough filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that NOV may only look to the contract for any possible recovery and its fraud claims are barred under the Texas Business Organizations Code. (ECF No. 95 at 3-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Furlough's motion for summary judgment is granted as to his personal liability for fraud by Technicool. Summary judgment is denied as to Furlough's liability for his individual conduct in which he allegedly committed fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Robert Furlough founded Powerhouse Marine International, Inc., in the 1970s to sell industrial HVAC units to the oil and gas industry. (ECF No. 27 at 4). Furlough's business grew to include the production of modular control houses as well as HVAC units. In 1997, Furlough founded Safe-T-Cool, Inc., in order to spin off the HVAC producing portion of Powerhouse into a separate company. (ECF No. 27 at 4). After the split, Powerhouse continued to build modular control houses until 2006, when Furlough created WorldFab, Inc., which assumed all of Powerhouse's modular building assets and operations. (ECF No. 27 at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2006, Safe-T-Cool was accused of trademark infringement and became involved in a dispute over the right to use the Safe-T-Cool name. (ECF No. 27 at 5). Furlough decided to create a new entity to assume all of Safe-T-Cool's operations. To effectuate this, Furlough founded Technicool in 2008, naming himself as the sole owner and his then son-in-law, Robert Huckaby, as President. (ECF No. 27 at 5-6). All of Safe-T-Cool's assets and operations were transferred to Technicool, which operated until August 14, 2015, when it filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy in this Court. (ECF No. 27 at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   One of Technicool's principal customers was NOV. (ECF No. 27 at 11). From 2010 to 2014, NOV purchased 260 industrial HVAC units at price of $3,297,212.50. According to NOV, Furlough and Technicool agreed to service and support the HVAC units overseas and that the units were tested to withstand the harshest environmental conditions. (ECF No. 104 at 6). NOV claims these attributes were critically important to the HVAC units' intended uses. (ECF No. 104 at 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Once installed, the HVAC units began failing in the field or were unable to perform at the quoted specifications. (ECF No. 104 at 6-7). This led NOV to sue Technicool on November 10, 2014, in Texas state court. (ECF No. 27 at 11). NOV's lawsuit alleged various causes of action, including breach of contract, breach of warranty, negligent misrepresentation, and product liability. (ECF No. 27 at 13). This lawsuit eventually transitioned into NOV's proof of claim in Technicool's chapter 7 bankruptcy case. (ECF No. 95-4). NOV amended its lawsuit on November 11, 2015, to include fraud claims against Furlough individually. (ECF No. 95-4 at 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   NOV's amended lawsuit specifically cites four causes of action against Furlough: (i) fraud and fraudulent inducement, (ii) fraud by non-disclosure, (iii) negligent misrepresentation, and (iv) aiding and abetting. (ECF No. 104 at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In Technicool's bankruptcy case, NOV has been the only active creditor. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Case No. 15-34435). NOV developed\n   an alliance with the Trustee in which NOV's counsel was retained by the Trustee to represent the Trustee in litigation against Technicool's former owners and affiliates. As an accommodation to the Trustee (and to overcome any potential conflict), NOV agreed to subordinate its claims against the Estate to 100% payment of all administrative expenses and to 100% recoveries by all other unaffiliated, general unsecured creditors in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In light of NOV's agreement to fully subordinate its interest and other factors, the Court approved NOV's state court counsel as Trustee's counsel in this present litigation. (Case No. 15-34435; ECF No. 96).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Furlough moved for summary judgment against NOV's fraud claims, alleging that NOV's claims are barred under the Texas Business Organizations Code \u00a7 21.223, merger clauses in the allegedly breached contracts, and the economic loss doctrine. (ECF No. 95 at 3-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Jurisdiction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court has \"related to\" jurisdiction over this matter.

(ECF No. 104 at 17). NOV claims to have provided evidence demonstrating that Furlough benefitted from money flowing to other entities and to his family members. (ECF No. 104 at 19-20). This evidence fails to satisfy the plain language of \u00a7 21.223(b) which requires a direct, personal benefit\n   <em>\n    to the holder\n   </em>\n   .

(\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 104-22; 104-15; 104-26). However, the provided evidence fails to conclusively establish that Furlough himself received a direct benefit from these purported payments.

At the outset, the Court notes that the causes of action NOV asserts against Furlough differs from those pursued by the Trustee in a parallel suit. The Trustee has alleged that Furlough abused corporate form to justify applying veil piercing as a remedy. NOV, on the other hand, has alleged fraudulent conduct\n   and negligent misrepresentation against Furlough. (ECF No. 104 at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Furlough cites\n   <em>\n    TecLogistics, Inc. v. Dreser-Rand Grp., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , to support his argument that absent a direct personal benefit to Furlough, the corporate shield in \u00a7 21.223(a)(2) protects Furlough from contractual liability. (ECF No. 95 at 9-10). NOV responds that the overwhelming weight of precedent in Texas requires that a corporate actor be held liable for their individual tortious conduct. (ECF No. 104 at 12-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   While it is true that a significant volume of case law exists regarding whether a corporation's officers may be held liable for corporate wrongs, all case law NOV cited interprets the predecessor statute to Texas Business Organizations Code \u00a7 21.223, which was enacted in 2012. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 104 at 12-17). As a result, the analysis begins with determining whether \u00a7 21.223(a)(2) applies to this dispute between NOV and Furlough on its face. The statute states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (a) A holder of shares, an owner of any beneficial interest in shares ... may not be held liable to the corporation or its obligees with respect to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (2) any contractual obligation of the corporation or any matter relating to or arising from the obligation on the basis that the holder, beneficial owner, subscriber, or affiliate is or was the alter ego of the corporation or on the basis of actual or constructive fraud, a sham to perpetrate a fraud, or other similar theory.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   TEX. BUS. ORG. CODE \u00a7 21.223(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Furlough managed and controlled Technicool from 2010 through 2014 when Technicool agreed to provide the alleged fraudulent HVAC units to NOV. (ECF No. 104 at 4). This places Furlough squarely within the corporate protection provided by \u00a7 21.223(a) which applies to owners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Secondly, the statute insulates officers from liability for the contractual obligations between the corporation and the obligee, namely NOV. \u00a7 21.223(a)(2). From the attached exhibits to the parties' motions, it is clear that a contract existed for the HVAC units between Technicool and NOV which NOV now seeks to impute individual liability on Furlough for. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 104-10 at 6 \"Purchase Order Terms and Conditions\"). As a result, the fraud NOV alleges regarding Furlough's purported fraud as a corporate officer fits squarely within the plain language of \u00a7 21.223(a)(2), which was specifically enacted to shield corporate officers from fraud allegations absent a showing of direct, personal benefit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Furlough's Individual Fraud\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   NOV's complaint also alleges that Furlough committed individual tortious acts of fraud which induced NOV to purchase the defective HVAC units, knowing that the HVAC units would fail to meet their quoted standards. (ECF No. 104 at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Texas common law holds a corporation's agents individually liable for their tortious acts, even while acting within the scope of their employment.\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Keyser\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9323307\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/90/712/#p717\">\n    90 S.W.3d 712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 717 (Tex. 2002) (imposing individual liability due to personal affirmative misrepresentations);\n   <em>\n    Ward Family Found. v. Arnette (In re Arnette)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4182041\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/454/663/#p697\">\n    454 B.R. 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 697 (Bankr. N.D. Tex. 2011). \"In an action seeking to hold an agent individually liable for his tortious or fraudulent acts, the corporate veil is not required to be pierced.\"\n   <em>\n    Sanchez v. Mulvaney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8169794\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/274/708/#p712\">\n    274 S.W.3d 708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 712 (Tex. App.-San Antonio 2008). Accordingly, Texas Business Organizations Code \u00a7 21.223 is inapplicable to shield Furlough against NOV's allegations of individual fraudulent conduct. NOV has sufficiently pled, and Furlough\n   has failed to refute on summary judgment, that Furlough made statements that the HVAC units were \"desert proof\" and that Technicool would offer support and repairs. (ECF No. 104 at 5). Additionally, the pleading demonstrates that NOV relied on Furlough's statements, that Furlough had knowledge of the HVAC units' inadequacies, and that NOV experienced significant damages as a result of the HVAC units' failure. (ECF No. 104 at 7-11). These statements are adequate to support a cause of action for common law fraud under Texas law. Consequently, Furlough's motion for summary judgment is denied with regard to NOV's alleged individual fraudulent acts committed by Furlough.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Court will issue an Order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    The following background section is intended to provide context for the dispute and does not constitute findings of fact by the Court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    The Court specifically addressed the jurisdictional issues of this dispute in a Memorandum Opinion issued on March 30, 2018, which is available at ECF No. 138 in Case No. 15-34435.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
