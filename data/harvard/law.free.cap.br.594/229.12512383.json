Geltzer (the \"Trustee\"), seeks to recover as constructive fraudulent transfers amounts paid by the Chapter 7 co-debtors, Luba Pincus and Bruce Sterman (the \"Debtors\"), to or for the benefit of their two daughters, defendants Alexandra Sterman and Samantha Sterman (the \"Defendants\"), allegedly for college tuition, books and supplies, and room and board while they were students at Oberlin College. The Trustee and the Defendants filed cross-motions\n   for summary judgment (the \"Trustee's Motion,\" ECF Doc. # 24; the \"Defendants' Motion,\" ECF Doc. # 22 at 11). The Defendants' Motion is supported by the affidavits of debtor Luba Pincus (the \"Pincus Affidavit,\" ECF Doc. # 22 at 1) and debtor Bruce Sterman (the \"Sterman Affidavit,\" ECF Doc. # 22 at 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parties also entered a stipulation of undisputed facts (the \"Stipulated Facts,\" ECF Doc. # 21). The Stipulated Facts indicate that some of the transfers to or for the benefit of Samantha were made while she was a college student\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   she was 21 years old and some were made while she was a college student\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   she was 21 years old. The Stipulated Facts indicate that the transfers to or for the benefit of Alexandra were made\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   she was 21 years old and\n   <em>\n    had already graduated from college\n   </em>\n   . According to the Stipulated Facts, since Alexandra graduated college in 2009, she has been \"financially independent.\" (Stipulated Facts \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The parties limit their cross motions to a request that the Court rule whether the Debtors received \"reasonably equivalent value\" for the transfers for college tuition and expenses; if the Debtors received reasonably equivalent value, the transfers would not be avoidable as constructive fraudulent transfers even if the Debtors were insolvent at the time of the transfers. There are two questions presented: first, did the Debtors receive reasonably equivalent value for their daughters' college educations and related expenses because their daughters' education will enhance their self-sufficiency; and second, does it matter whether the daughters were younger or older than 21 when the transfers were made?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the reasons explained below, the Court grants the Trustee's Motion in part and denies it in part with respect to the transfers to or for the benefit of Samantha. The Trustee's Motion is granted with respect to the transfers to or for the benefit of Alexandra, as she was older than 21 and no longer a student when the transfers were made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Debtors, Luba Pincus and Bruce Sterman, filed a joint chapter 7 petition on February 19, 2016 (the \"Petition Date\"). (The Stipulated Facts \u00b6 2.) The Trustee filed an adversary proceeding to recover allegedly constructively fraudulent transfers made by the Debtors to or for the benefit of their daughters. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11-12.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Alexandra attended Oberlin College from 2005-2009; Samantha attended Oberlin College from 2009-2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15-19.) In the six years prior to the Petition Date, the Debtors made several transfers to or for the benefit of their daughters. The parties stipulate that the transfers were made in connection with the Defendants' \"college educations at Oberlin College and related expenses, including school books and supplies, meals, campus housing/rent/utilities, transportation and birthday presents.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Stipulated Facts state that Alexandra Sterman reached age 21 on January 12, 2008 and graduated from Oberlin College in 2009. (Stipulated Facts \u00b6\u00b6 13 &amp; 14.) Exhibit A to the Complaint (ECF Doc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   # 1) indicates that transfers to or for the benefit of Alexandra, totaling $15,675.00, were made between August 13, 2010 and October 13, 2015. Paragraph 12 of the Stipulated Facts states that \"[t]he schedules of transfers that are attached to the Complaint as Exhibits A and B accurately describe the transfers to and/or for the benefit of the Defendants that are the subject of the Complaint.\" Those two exhibits list transfers between 2010-2015. Both the Stipulated Facts and the Pincus Affidavit state that Alexandra attended college between 2005 and 2009, and graduated in 2009, so it is clear under the Stipulated Facts that the transfers to or for the benefit of Alexandra all were made after she was 21 years old and after she graduated from Oberlin. The Pincus Affidavit also makes clear that \"[s]ince graduation [Alexandra] has been fully employed, self sufficient and tax paying adult.\" (Pincus Affidavit \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Trustee claims that the transfers are constructively fraudulent. The Trustee seeks to recover $15,675.00 from Alexandra for transfers \"while she was of majority age.\" (Stipulated Facts \u00b6 16.) The Trustee seeks to recover $9,952.00 from Samantha; $2,276.00 of those transfers were made \"in respect of college tuition and living expenses ... while she was a minor, and $7,676.00 were made while she was of majority age.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   For purposes of the summary judgment motions, \"the parties have agreed not to put solvency at issue.\" (Trustee's Motion \u00b6 12, ECF Doc. # 11.) Therefore, the sole question is whether the Debtors received reasonably equivalent value for the transfers to or for the benefit of their daughters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

S.D.N.Y. 2010). The Trustee alleges that the transfers in question were fraudulent under the New York Debtor and Creditor Law (\"NYDCL\"). Under the NYDCL, a conveyance is fraudulent if it is incurred without \"fair consideration.\" NYDCL \u00a7\u00a7 273 and 275. \"Fair consideration\" is defined by the NYDCL as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   fair consideration is given for property, or obligation,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   a. When in exchange for such property, or obligation, as a fair equivalent therefor, and in good faith, property is conveyed or an antecedent debt is satisfied, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   b. When such property, or obligation is received in good faith to secure a present advance or antecedent debt in amount not disproportionately small as compared with the value of the property, or obligation obtained.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   NYDCL \u00a7 272.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Ordinarily, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving a lack of fair consideration but where, as here, \"the facts regarding the nature of the consideration are within the transferee's control, the burden of proving the fairness of consideration shifts to the transferee.\"\n   <em>\n    Ackerman v.

(Stipulated Facts \u00b6 18.) The Stipulated Facts also state that the transfers were made for her \"college education[ ] at Oberlin College and related expenses, including school books and supplies, meals, campus housing/rent/utilities, transportation and birthday presents.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) While the case law does not\n   <em>\n    require\n   </em>\n   that parents pay for college tuition for a minor child at a private college to satisfy the parents' obligation to provide a minor child with education, the issue rather is whether the parents receive reasonably equivalent value when they do pay for such an education. On this issue, the Court agrees with Chief Judge Craig, writing in\n   <em>\n    In re Akkanmu\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    :\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   The Trustee argues that New York law does not require the Debtors to provide parochial or private school education, and that the Debtors could have satisfied their obligation at no cost by sending the children to public school. This argument misses the point. The fact that the Debtors chose to educate their children in parochial school rather than public school, arguably exceeding the \"minimum standard of care,\" does not change the fact that, by doing so, they satisfied their legal obligation to educate their children, thereby receiving reasonably equivalent value and fair consideration. It is irrelevant to this determination whether the Debtors could have spent less on the children's education, or, for that matter, on their clothing, food, or shelter. To hold otherwise would permit a trustee to scrutinize debtors' expenditures for their children's benefit, and seek to recover from the vendor if, in the trustee's judgment, the expenditure was not reasonably necessary, or if the good or service could have been obtained at a lower price, or at no cost, elsewhere. For example, a trustee could seek to avoid a debtor's payments to a restaurant for a meal purchased for the debtor's child, or payments to a department store for clothing purchased for the child, on a theory that adequate food or clothing could have been obtained at lower cost. A trustee could sue the vendor to recover the cost of a computer or other electronic device purchased pre-petition by a debtor for his child, on the theory that the item was not reasonably necessary..... The absurdity of this scenario is obvious.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   A trustee is not granted veto power over a debtor's personal decisions, at least with respect to pre-petition expenditures. \"[A] trustee's powers are not limitless.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Thompson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11191500\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/253/823/#p825\">\n    253 B.R. 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 825 (Bankr.

On the other hand, on the record before the Court, transfers to or for the benefit of Samantha while she was a minor for college tuition and related expenses were supported by reasonably equivalent value and, therefore, are not avoidable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    The Complaint also seeks to recover conveyances made to Oberlin College, Oberlin Student Cooperative Association, Navient Corporation, and Nelnet, Inc.
