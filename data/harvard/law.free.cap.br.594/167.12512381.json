BERNSTEIN, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Irving H. Picard (the \"Trustee\"), the trustee for the liquidation of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (\"BLMIS\") under the Securities Investor Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78aaa,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"SIPA\"), filed his proposed\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   on August 30, 2017 (\"PAC\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF Doc. # 100)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   seeking to recover avoidable transfers totaling approximately $156 million from subsequent transferees BNP Paribas S.A. (\"BNP Bank\"), BNP Paribas Arbitrage SNC (\"BNP Arbitrage\"), BNP Paribas Securities Services S.A. (\"BNP Securities Services\"), and BNP Paribas Bank &amp; Trust (Cayman) Limited (\"BNP Cayman,\" and collectively, the \"Defendants\"). The Defendants have moved to dismiss the PAC arguing that (i) it was improperly filed without leave of Court, (ii) the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over the Defendants, (iii) the PAC fails to state claims upon which relief can be granted, and (iv) certain claims are time-barred. For reasons outlined below, the motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction is denied, the filing of the PAC will be treated as a motion by the Trustee for leave to amend his existing complaint, and that motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Unless otherwise indicated, the background information is taken from the well-pleaded factual allegations of the PAC and other information the Court may consider in determining whether the pleading is legally sufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Ponzi Scheme\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At all relevant times, Bernard Madoff operated the investment advisory arm of\n   BLMIS as a Ponzi scheme. (\u00b6 36.) Beginning in 1992, Madoff told investors that he employed the \"split-strike conversion\" strategy (\"SSC Strategy\"), under which BLMIS purported to purchase a basket of stocks intended to track the S &amp; P 100 Index, and hedged the investment by purchasing put options and selling call options on the S &amp; P 100 Index. (\u00b6\u00b6 42-45.) In reality, BLMIS never purchased any securities on behalf of its investors and sent monthly statements to investors containing falsified trades typically showing fictitious gains. (\u00b6\u00b6 40, 41.) All investor deposits were commingled in a JPMorgan Chase Bank account held by BLMIS, and the funds were used to satisfy withdrawals by other investors, benefit Madoff and his family personally, and prop up BLMIS' proprietary trading department. (\u00b6 40.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The BLMIS Ponzi scheme collapsed when redemption requests overwhelmed the flow of new investments, (\u00b6 49), and Madoff was arrested by federal agents for criminal violations of federal securities laws on December 11, 2008 (the \"Filing Date\"). (\u00b6 18.) The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") contemporaneously commenced an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and that action was consolidated with an application by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (\"SIPC\") asserting that BLMIS' customers needed the protections afforded by SIPA. (\u00b6\u00b6 18, 19.) On December 15, 2008, the District Court granted SIPC's application, appointed the Trustee and his counsel, and removed the SIPA liquidation to this Court. (\u00b6 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At a plea hearing on March 12, 2009, Madoff pleaded guilty to an eleven count criminal information and admitted that he \"operated a Ponzi scheme through the investment advisory side of [BLMIS].\" (\u00b6\u00b6 23, 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   BNP Bank is a corporation organized under the laws of France. (\u00b6 52.) It provides banking services in seventy-five countries and has maintained a presence in the United States since the late 1800s. (\u00b6 58.) Currently, BNP Bank has over 10,000 employees and more than 700 retail branches in the United States. (\u00b6 58.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   BNP Arbitrage and BNP Securities Services, both French entities, are wholly-owned subsidiaries of BNP Bank, (\u00b6\u00b6 53, 55), and maintain offices in Paris, France and New York, New York. (\u00b6\u00b6 53, 55, 59.) BNP Cayman is also a wholly owned subsidiary of BNP Bank that is located in and organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands. (\u00b6 54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    C. BNP Bank's Introduction to Madoff and the Creation of a Feeder Fund\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    1. BNP Bank Made Loans to Madoff\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   BNP Bank's relationship with Madoff began around November 1988 when it provided a $15 million personal line of credit to Madoff, which increased to $40 million by May 1995, and to $75 million by October 1996. As collateral for the loan, Madoff pledged securities it held on behalf of BLMIS customers. (\u00b6 84.) BNP Bank conducted due diligence in connection with the extension of credit, which included reviewing BLMIS' Financial Operating and Combined Uniform Single (\"FOCUS\") Reports and audited financials and meeting with Madoff at BLMIS' office. (\u00b6 85.) Madoff used the loan proceeds to finance and grow the BLMIS Ponzi scheme. (\u00b6 88.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    2. BNP Bank Created and Serviced Oreades\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In 1997, BNP Bank partnered with Access International Advisors (\"Access\") to create Oreades SICAV (\"Oreades\"), a Luxembourg-incorporated \"feeder fund\" that invested exclusively with BLMIS. (\u00b6 89.) BNP Bank, through its subsidiaries purported to provide services to Oreades while Access recruited investors. (\u00b6 90.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In January and March 1998, a BNP Bank subsidiary opened two investment accounts at BLMIS for Oreades. (\u00b6 91.) Two BNP Bank subsidiaries served as administrators of Oreades: BNP Paribas Fund Administration S.A. from 1997 to 2002 and BNP Securities Services from 2002 to 2004. (\u00b6 92.) The administrators were responsible for processing subscriptions into and redemptions from Oreades and frequently corresponded with BLMIS employees to direct transfers in and out of Oreades' BLMIS accounts. (\u00b6 94.) The administrators received all of the BLMIS account statements and trade confirmations for Oreades, and were responsible for calculating the fund's monthly net asset value based on those numbers. (\u00b6 95.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   By 2003, BNP Bank's standard practice was to receive account statements and trade confirmations electronically. In May 2003, BNP Securities Services asked BLMIS to adhere to this policy, but BLMIS refused, and continued to send paper statements and confirmations through the mail. BNP Bank exempted BLMIS from this requirement to maintain the business relationship. (\u00b6 96.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   From the time of Oreades' formation, BNP Bank and Access hid the fact that BLMIS was serving as Oreades' custodian and investment advisor. (\u00b6 97.) Oreades represented that a BNP Bank subsidiary served as its official custodian (BGL BNP Paribas from 1997 to 2002 and BNP Securities Services from 2002 to 2004), but in reality, the BNP Bank subsidiary delegated all custodial authority to BLMIS through an undisclosed sub-custodian agreement. (\u00b6\u00b6 98, 99.) Madoff demanded this arrangement as a precondition to investment, (\u00b6 99), but did not charge a fee for the custodial services performed by BLMIS. (\u00b6 100.) This allowed the BNP Bank subsidiaries to charge custodial fees to Oreades investors without performing corresponding services. (\u00b6 100.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Similarly, Oreades represented to investors and to Luxembourg's financial regulator, the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (\"CSSF\"), that a BNP Bank affiliate, Inter Conseil, served as its investment advisor. (\u00b6 101.) However, Inter Conseil delegated its investment advisory duties to BLMIS in an undisclosed Sub-Advisory and Management Agreement. (\u00b6 102.) Madoff required the delegation and performed the services free of charge, (\u00b6\u00b6 102, 105), and Inter Conseil received fees from Oreades investors despite the delegation of duties. (\u00b6 105.) In addition, BNP Bank's own compliance rules required a \"strict separation\" between a fund's investment adviser and custodian. (\u00b6 106;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 99, 102.) The delegation of custodial and investment advisory duties to BLMIS violated this rule. (\u00b6 107.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   BNP Bank knew that the delegation to BLMIS of custodial and investment advisory duties violated Luxembourg law. First, only a Luxembourg-regulated entity could act as Oreades' custodian, but BLMIS was not regulated by the CSSF. (\u00b6 108.) Second, Luxembourg law required that Oreades' investment advisor and custodian be disclosed, but BNP Bank and its affiliates deliberately omitted mention of BLMIS in offering materials. (\u00b6 109;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 261-62.) Third, Luxembourg law required the BNP Bank subsidiary purportedly acting as custodian to verify the\n   actions of BLMIS as investment advisor, but the subsidiary lacked the ability to verify BLMIS trades. (\u00b6 110.) Because BLMIS' relationship with Oreades violated Luxembourg law, BNP Bank required that Inter Conseil's management arrangement with BLMIS \"must remain 'private' that is, the CSSF ... must remain unaware of it.\" (\u00b6 111;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 261-62.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    3. BNP Bank Recognized BLMIS' Fraud Risk and Closed Oreades\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On July 10, 2003, a senior executive at BNP Securities Services, Lionel Trouvain, reviewed a BNP Bank internal audit and compliance report on Oreades and became concerned \"that the risk [to] BNP Paribas is very extensive.\" (\u00b6 113.) Trouvain noted that BLMIS' practice of sending account documents via mail was problematic:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [N]o reference is ever made to the method of sending the [trading] deals carried out by 'BLMIS'. As you undoubtedly know, the trades are sent by mail after 7 or 8 days and are then posted after the fact by our settlement department. Market practices are really different today and it would seem that B. Madoff does not ever want to improve its order transmission methods.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   In practice [today], orders are sent by fax or via SWIFT by the managers on the day of the deal (along with the broker confirmation if the orders are not pre-matched). They are then coded by the depository bank and the operation is then carried out on the Settlement date (D+1;2;3) according to the markets. It would be appropriate to put this type of order transmission in place between us and B. Madoff because in current practice,\n   <em>\n    we have no opportunity to consider the true validity of the orders\n   </em>\n   ....\n   <em>\n    This is a point that our risk and ethics departments found during their internal audit\n   </em>\n   and I have to contribute a source of improvement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (\u00b6 114 (emphasis and ellipsis in PAC);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 246-49, 253.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Trouvain also stated that BNP Bank would ultimately be held liable for misrepresenting and omitting the role of BLMIS as Oreades' custodian and investment advisor:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   In my opinion, if there is a management problem with [BLMIS], the entire responsibility for management would lie ... in the last resort, with the promoter, namely BNP Paribas ... In the eyes of the CSSF, B. Madoff does not exist.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (\u00b6 116.) He also inquired about where BLMIS was holding U.S. Treasury Bills on Oreades' behalf. (\u00b6 117.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In August 2003, Trouvain and other BNP Bank employees met with Access' management to determine whether it was possible to bring their relationship with BLMIS into compliance with BNP Bank's internal rules. According to the meeting minutes, BLMIS' hidden role as Oreades' custodian and investment advisor was an \"unconscionable\" violation of BNP Bank's rules and Luxembourg law. BNP Bank wanted \"to be released from liability it ha[d] incurred as a 'sponsor' (initiator of the creation) manager, and custodian of the fund.\" (\u00b6 118;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 241-45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Communicating through Access, BNP Bank asked Madoff to permit it to disclose BLMIS to the CSSF, but Madoff refused. Access told BNP Bank that Madoff's refusal was based in part on wanting to avoid U.S. regulatory scrutiny for BLMIS' failure to register as an investment advisor. (\u00b6 119.) One BNP Bank employee warned\n   that \"if the CSSF asks me about the precise role of Inter Conseil and of BNP in Oreades, I will have to tell the truth.\" (\u00b6 120.) Madoff similarly refused BNP Bank's request to permit BNP Securities Services or Access to track BLMIS trading activity in real time. (\u00b6\u00b6 121, 252.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   By November 2003, BNP Bank was measuring its potential liability as Oreades' sponsor, administrator and custodian \"in the event of a default on the part of Madoff.\" (\u00b6 122.) Ultimately, BNP Bank decided to shut down Oreades: BNP Securities Services closed the BLMIS accounts in March 2004, and Inter Conseil placed Oreades into liquidation in Luxembourg in May 2004. (\u00b6\u00b6 123-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Others at BNP Bank were Suspicious of Madoff\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Paulo Gianferrara, who from 2000 to 2006 served as the Head of Hedge Funds for BNP Paribas Private Wealth in Paris and Geneva, refused to approve transactions involving BLMIS feeder funds for private banking clients. (\u00b6 128.) According to employees of Fairfield Greenwich Group - an entity that managed certain BLMIS feeder funds - Gianferrara \"always had a problem with Madoff\" and would \"not even consider[ ]\" investments in Fairfield's Madoff-related products. (\u00b6 129.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Patrick Fauchier of Fauchier Partners - an entity that was involved in a joint venture with a BNP Bank affiliate - told Access in June 2008 that he was concerned that the SEC would not allow BLMIS to continue as a business and found it suspicious that Madoff did not charge customary investment management fees. (\u00b6\u00b6 131, 133, 134;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 258-60.) Fauchier also flagged BLMIS' FOCUS Reports in which BLMIS disclosed that it managed only twenty-three investment accounts; Fauchier knew that BLMIS was underreporting that figure. (\u00b6 135.) The Trustee alleges, upon information and belief, that Fauchier shared his concerns about Madoff to senior officers at BNP Bank. (\u00b6 136.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    E. BNP Bank Became a Global Leverage Provider to BLMIS Feeder Funds\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Despite the circumstances surrounding the closing of Oreades, BNP Bank embarked on a strategy to become a global leverage provider to BLMIS feeder funds and their investors. (\u00b6 138.) In addition to generating fees for BNP Bank and its subsidiaries, pursuing this business would build BNP Bank's reputation as a leverage provider and allow it to compete with rival bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale (\"SocGen\"). It also presented opportunities to cross-sell BNP Bank services to institutional clients. (\u00b6 139.) Becoming a leverage provider allowed BNP Bank to profit from BLMIS' performance without the risk associated with serving in a fiduciary capacity (as it did with Oreades). (\u00b6\u00b6 140, 148.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Acquisition of ZCM\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In the early 2000s, BNP Bank lacked the infrastructure and personnel necessary to offer credit facilities and structured products at the level of rival banks. (\u00b6 141.) In 2003, Zurich Financial offered to sell its leverage business unit, Zurich Capital Markets, Inc. (\"ZCM\"), consisting of sixty employees in New York and a portfolio linked to investment funds. (\u00b6 142.) In connection with a potential acquisition, BNP Bank conducted due diligence on ZCM's portfolio, including a multi-million dollar credit facility with Santa Barbara Holdings Ltd. (\"Santa Barbara\") - a fund that was invested solely in BLMIS feeder fund Harley International (Cayman) Limited (\"Harley\"). (\u00b6 143.) BNP Bank had a strict policy against transacting with single-manager funds, and Harley was a single-manager\n   fund managed by BLMIS. (\u00b6 144.) BNP Bank nonetheless approved the acquisition of ZCM in July 2003. (\u00b6 145.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The ZCM acquisition provided BNP Bank with the infrastructure and personnel necessary to create and market credit facilities and structured products to clients, including BLMIS feeder funds. (\u00b6\u00b6 146-47.) These transactions were highly lucrative and, according to the Trustee, incentivized BNP Bank to turn a blind eye to Madoff's fraud. (\u00b6 150.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   SocGen had also considered acquiring ZCM but its diligence revealed obvious risks of fraud associated with Harley, including \"impossibl[y]\" consistent returns, BLMIS' failure to charge customary management or performance fees, and BLMIS acting as its own custodian. (\u00b6\u00b6 153-59.) SocGen offered to purchase ZCM's assets excluding the Santa Barbara credit facility, but Zurich Financial refused. Thereafter, SocGen blacklisted BLMIS-related investments. (\u00b6 161.) According to the Trustee, BNP Bank chose to acquire ZCM despite knowing about SocGen's misgivings concerning Madoff. (\u00b6 162.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Defendants Deviated from Standard Diligence Practices to Avoid Confirming Madoff's Fraud\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Following the ZCM acquisition, customer demand for leverage and credit on BLMIS-related transactions was high and BNP Bank management was eager to profit from the demand. (\u00b6 168.) This line of business was handled by the \"Fund Derivatives Group\" - consisting of employees of BNP Bank, BNP Arbitrage, and non-party BNP Paribas Securities Corp. (\"BNP Securities Corp.\"), (\u00b6 66), - that created, marketed, and serviced credit facilities and derivative financial instruments such as swaps, notes, and other structured products. Such products offered customers \"leverage,\" thereby creating an opportunity to earn multiples of the returns generated by the underlying referenced asset without large up-front outlays of capital. (\u00b6 64.) BNP Bank provided billions of dollars in capital to fund the credit facilities and structured products. (\u00b6\u00b6 4, 67.) BNP Arbitrage created and managed the facilities and products, and BNP Securities Corp. marketed and monitored the facilities and products. (\u00b6 67.) In addition, BNP Securities Corp. served as the calculation agent, which included calculating the amount that BNP Bank should invest or redeem from a BLMIS feeder fund. (\u00b6 68.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Typically, the Fund Derivatives Group's due diligence in connection with an ongoing or potential transaction entailed reviewing all relevant public documents including financial documents, offering memoranda, subscription agreements, account statements, trade confirmations and documents relating to the fund manager's investment strategy. (\u00b6 169.) When a transaction would result in significant exposure to BNP Bank, it was standard procedure for the due diligence team to conduct on-site visits and memorialize findings in a memorandum. (\u00b6 170.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Notwithstanding the diligence procedures, the Fund Derivatives Group's due diligence team lacked authority to reject Madoff-related transactions, (\u00b6\u00b6 165, 167), and such transactions were pre-approved by senior management at BNP Bank. (\u00b6 168.) Likewise, senior management instructed the due diligence team not to contact Madoff or anyone from BLMIS to arrange on-site diligence visits. (\u00b6 174.) The due diligence team did make one on-site visit to BLMIS in March 2008, but did not draft a memorandum to memorialize the visit. (\u00b6 175.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The due diligence team also ranked fund managers in a periodic report called the \"Heat Map\" based on a risk score assigned by the team. For purposes of this report,\n   Madoff-related transactions were grouped into a single \"Madoff\" category regardless of the BLMIS feeder fund involved, and Madoff was always listed at the top of the Heat Map. (\u00b6\u00b6 171-73.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Moreover, by taking on billions of Madoff-related deals, the Fund Derivatives Group disregarded BNP Bank's policy against taking on exposure from single-manager trades. (\u00b6 178.) According to the Trustee, BNP Bank deviated from its standard operating procedures because the Fund Derivatives Group would not have been profitable absent the Madoff-related transactions. (\u00b6\u00b6 166, 179.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    3. BNP Bank Provides Leverage to BLMIS Feeder Funds\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Santa Barbara\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In February 2004, BNP Bank, through its Fund Derivatives Group, entered into another credit facility with Santa Barbara. (\u00b6 180.) Trouvain (who had previously raised concerns regarding Oreades) worked on this transaction. (\u00b6 182.) The credit facility called for BNP Bank to make senior secured loans to Santa Barbara for levered investments with Harley; Harley's BLMIS account served as collateral for the credit facility. In exchange, Santa Barbara paid BNP Bank above-market fees and interest, which, as of 2004, was 170 basis points above LIBOR. (\u00b6 183.) BNP Arbitrage served as calculation agent, (\u00b6 185), and BNP Securities Corp. served as collateral agent, (\u00b6 184), for the credit facility. Under the terms of the credit facility, BNP Bank, BNP Arbitrage and BNP Securities Corp. took control over Harley's BLMIS account so that Harley could not make redemptions absent BNP Bank's consent. (\u00b6 187.) These BNP entities communicated directly with BLMIS and received and reviewed Harley's BLMIS account statements and trade confirmations. (\u00b6 186.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In 2007, BNP Bank entered into an option agreement with HSBC Bank USA, N.A. (\"HSBC\"), with Harley as the underlying reference fund. The option required HSBC to pay BNP Bank for losses sustained by Harley above a certain fixed percentage of the fund's net asset value. The notional amount of the trade was $70 million, and increased to $90 million in 2008. The Trustee alleges that BNP Bank entered into this transaction to protect itself in the event of BLMIS' failure. (\u00b6 190.) During negotiations over the option, the head of trading at the Fund Derivatives Group told an HSBC employee that he was unable to reconcile the trading statements BNP Bank had received from BLMIS. (\u00b6 191.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Between 2003 and 2008, BNP Bank's relationship with Santa Barbara, Harley and Fix Asset Management (the investment manager of Santa Barbara and Harley) grew substantially, as did the size of the credit facility. By the Filing Date, BNP Arbitrage had received transfers of approximately $975 million of customer property from Harley's BLMIS account. (\u00b6 192.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Legacy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In July 2004, BNP Bank entered into a $100 million credit facility with Legacy Capital Ltd. (\"Legacy\"), an investment company that invested exclusively with BLMIS. (\u00b6 193.) Under the facility, BNP Arbitrage and BNP Securities Corp. served as calculation agent and collateral agent, respectively, and both were authorized to act on BNP Bank's behalf. (\u00b6 195.) Legacy pledged all of its capital stock to BNP Securities Corp. and granted a security interest in Legacy's BLMIS account. (\u00b6 196.) In connection with the Legacy credit facility, BNP Bank, BNP Arbitrage, and/or BNP Securities Corp. communicated directly with BLMIS and received and reviewed Legacy's BLMIS account statements\n   and trade confirmations. (\u00b6 197.) In September 2006, the credit facility was increased to a maximum of $120 million. (\u00b6 198.) BNP Bank, BNP Arbitrage and BNP Securities Corp. maintained the Legacy credit facility through the Filing Date and directed the withdrawal of approximately $175 million of customer property from BLMIS. (\u00b6 199.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The PAC also described the circumstances leading to BNP Bank's extension of the Legacy credit facility. In June 1999, Meritage - a sub-fund of Renaissance Technologies Corp. (\"Renaissance\"), entered into a total return swap through which it received returns equal to those paid on an equivalent amount of the counterparty's own investment with BLMIS via Legacy's BLMIS account. (\u00b6 201.) In 2003, Renaissance identified red flags at BLMIS analogous to that identified by SocGen in connection with the ZCM acquisition (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , returns not correlated to the S &amp; P 100 Index, nearly impossible market timing, impossible options trading volume, failure to charge customary management fees, failure to use a well-known auditor). (\u00b6\u00b6 200, 203-05.) As a result, Renaissance directed Meritage to begin unwinding its BLMIS investment, and Legacy began looking for an investor to replace Meritage. (\u00b6 206.) In 2004, Legacy approached BNP Bank about providing it with a line of credit to replace the Meritage investments. (\u00b6 207.) BNP Bank performed due diligence on Legacy's BLMIS account receiving information similar to that reviewed by Renaissance and thereafter decided to extend the $100 million credit facility to Legacy in July 2004. (\u00b6\u00b6 208-09.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Tremont\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In August 2005, BNP Bank entered into a $100 million credit facility with Rye Select Broad Market Insurance Portfolio LDC (\"Insurance Portfolio Fund\"), a BLMIS feeder fund managed by Tremont Group Holdings, Inc. (\"Tremont\"). (\u00b6 212.) As collateral for the credit facility, Insurance Portfolio Fund pledged the assets held in its BLMIS account. (\u00b6 214.) BNP Bank authorized and directed BNP Securities Corp. to act as the collateral agent and calculation agent for the credit facility, and BNP Bank received and reviewed Insurance Portfolio Fund's BLMIS account statements and trade confirmations. (\u00b6\u00b6 215-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Prior to entering into a credit facility with BNP Bank, Tremont explored a similar facility with the investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort (\"Dresdner\"). Dresdner raised a variety of concerns about Madoff with Tremont including whether BLMIS segregated its investment accounts, whether an independent third party verified the assets held by BLMIS, how BLMIS was compensated for its role with respect to Tremont's investment, and Madoff's secrecy regarding BLMIS operations. In light of Dresdner's concerns, Tremont decided to pursue a credit facility with BNP Bank instead. (\u00b6 218.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Option and Swap Agreements with BLMIS Feeder Funds\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In December 2005, BNP Bank entered into an option agreement to provide leverage to Equity Trading Fund, Ltd., a fund that invested exclusively in BLMIS feeder fund Equity Trading Portfolio Limited (\"Equity Trading\"). (\u00b6\u00b6 219-20.) The agreement contemplated another transaction (the \"Equity Trading Option\") wherein BNP Bank sold Equity Trading Fund, Ltd. a structured option to leverage Equity Trading's investments with BLMIS. (\u00b6 221.) As collateral for the Equity Trading Option, BNP Arbitrage and BNP Cayman acquired a direct ownership interest in Equity Trading. (\u00b6 222.) Pursuant to the Equity Trading Option, BNP Bank, BNP Arbitrage and BNP Cayman received and reviewed Equity Trading's BLMIS account\n   statements and trade confirmations. (\u00b6 223.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In October 2006, BNP Paribas Securities\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   entered into an option agreement to provide leverage to Tremont (Bermuda) Ltd., a fund of funds managed by Tremont that invested with BLMIS. (\u00b6 224.) Under the agreement, BNP Bank sold Tremont (Bermuda) Ltd. a structured option (the \"Tremont Option\") to leverage Rye Select Broad Market Portfolio Limited (\"Portfolio Limited Fund\"), a Tremont-managed BLMIS feeder fund. (\u00b6 225.) In practical terms, the Tremont Option meant that BNP Bank would provide Tremont (Bermuda) Ltd. with increased returns on its BLMIS investments. (\u00b6 226.) In January 2007, BNP Bank entered into a swap agreement (the \"Tremont Swap\") to provide leverage to Tremont Enhanced Market Neutral Fund L.P., a Tremont-controlled fund that invested with BLMIS. (\u00b6 227.) The Tremont Swap called for a total return swap transaction linked to various Tremont-controlled reference funds, including Rye Select Broad Market Prime Fund L.P. (\"Prime Fund\"), Rye Select Broad Market Fund, L.P. (\"Broad Market Fund\"), and Rye Select Broad Market, L.P. (\"XL LP\") - all funds that invested directly or indirectly with BLMIS. (\u00b6 228.) Pursuant to the Tremont Option and Tremont Swap, BNP Bank and BNP Securities Corp. received and reviewed Tremont's BLMIS account statements and trade confirmations. (\u00b6 229.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   For some deals, BNP Bank affiliates helped to shield the involvement of Madoff/BLMIS in the transactions. In December 2007, BNP Bank was negotiating an option agreement administered by HSBC, which referenced a BLMIS feeder fund. HSBC told BNP Securities Corp. to delete any reference to Madoff or BLMIS in the option agreement and BNP Securities Corp. complied. (\u00b6 263.) Similarly, in September 2008, an Access employee asked a BNP Bank subsidiary - FundQuest - to remove BLMIS references in marketing materials for products invested in BLMIS feeder fund Luxalpha SICAV; FundQuest complied with Access' request. (\u00b6\u00b6 264-65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    4. BNP Bank Created Structured Products for Clients Referencing BLMIS Feeder Funds\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In addition to providing leverage to BLMIS feeder funds, BNP Bank sold BLMIS-related financial products to its customers touting its \"extensive experience\" with Madoff. (\u00b6 232.) In 2006, BNP Bank began providing leverage to clients who invested in BLMIS feeder fund Ascot Partners, L.P. (\"Ascot\") in exchange for fees and interest payments. Through these leveraged transactions, BNP Cayman redeemed shares and ultimately received transfers of customer property from Ascot. (\u00b6 233.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   BNP Bank also marketed and sold structured products to clients that referenced other large BLMIS feeder funds. For example, BNP Bank sold three-year term notes that paid note purchasers a return based on the performance of Fairfield Sentry Limited (\"Fairfield Sentry\") - the largest BLMIS feeder fund. However, BNP Bank structured the notes so that it did not have to pay investors in the event Fairfield Sentry lost more than 30% of its value. (\u00b6\u00b6 234-39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Last, BNP Bank sold shares in BLMIS feeder funds directly to its clients earning fees from both the clients and the funds. (\u00b6 240.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Red Flags\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The PAC also includes allegations that the Defendants were aware of various performance\n   impossibilities at BLMIS learned while servicing Oreades and providing leverage to clients. (\u00b6\u00b6 267-68.) These include that BLMIS achieved returns inconsistent with a fund employing the SSC Strategy (\u00b6\u00b6 269-84), some of BLMIS' trades were made at prices outside the daily price range for the security (\u00b6\u00b6 285-88), there were not enough options in the entire market to implement the SSC Strategy for the amount that BLMIS purported to have under management (\u00b6\u00b6 289-95), BLMIS was misreporting the number of accounts and amount under management (\u00b6\u00b6 296-303), BLMIS consistently purchased shares below the daily average price and sold shares above the daily average price (\u00b6\u00b6 304-10), BLMIS reported options trading volumes beyond the entire options volume reported on the Chicago Board Options Exchange for certain days (\u00b6\u00b6 311-16), BLMIS was secretive about identities of counterparties to its purported over-the-counter options trades, and the volume of such options was implausible (\u00b6\u00b6 317-21), BLMIS sometimes made profitable trades that were purely speculative and not consistent with the SSC Strategy (\u00b6\u00b6 322-27), BLMIS settled options trades as much as three days after execution instead of the one-day period customary in the industry (\u00b6\u00b6 331-35), and certain BLMIS customer statements showed multiple dividends paid from a Fidelity money market fund within a given month even though the fund paid dividends only once per month. (\u00b6\u00b6 336-39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    G. The Transfers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Trustee seeks to recover avoidable transfers from the Defendants as subsequent transferees under section 550(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code in the amount of approximately $156 million. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 423-46.) The subsequent transfers came from two sources: (i) the BLMIS accounts held by four Tremont-managed funds: Prime Fund, Broad Market Fund, Insurance Portfolio Fund, and Portfolio Limited Fund (collectively, the \"Tremont Funds\") and (ii) the BLMIS account held by Ascot. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PAC, Ex. B.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

On September 22, 2011, the Court approved a settlement under Federal Bankruptcy Rule 9019 that \"ensure[d] judgments\" against the defendants and \"enable[d] the estate to immediately recover $1.025 billion ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Bench Memorandum and Order Granting Trustee's Motion for Entry of Order Approving Agreement\n   </em>\n   , dated Sept. 22, 2011 (\"Tremont Settlement Order\"), at 2 (ECF Adv.

Transfers from Ascot\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The PAC sought to recover subsequent transfers totaling $57,190,550 from Ascot to the Defendants (\"Ascot Subsequent Transfer Claims\"), but these claims are now moot. The Trustee had commenced a separate adversary proceeding styled\n   <em>\n    Picard v. Merkin\n   </em>\n   , Adv. Proc. No. 09-01182 (SMB), seeking,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , to avoid and recover $461 million transferred from BLMIS to Ascot within six years of the Filing Date. By order, dated December 10,\n   2014 (ECF Adv. Proc. No. 09-01182 Doc. # 251), the Court dismissed the Trustee's avoidance claims against Ascot other than the intentional fraudulent transfer claims made within two years of the Filing Date pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20548\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A).

(\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 267-339.) The Court has previously rejected the Trustee's attempt to plead, in hindsight, a defendant's subjective knowledge by showing trading impossibilities in BLMIS account statements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Legacy Capital\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4172903\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/548/13/#p36\">\n    548 B.R. at 33-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Hindsight is infallible, but connecting the dots in real time may require clairvoyance.

The Court also observed that the \"red flag\" theory of\n   <em>\n    scienter\n   </em>\n   has been rejected in Madoff-related securities fraud litigation by numerous courts in the Second Circuit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4172903\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/548/13/#p36\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (listing cases).

Feb. 2, 2010) (\"[T]he complaint supports the reasonable inference that Madoff fooled the defendants as he did individual investors, financial institutions, and regulators.\"). The Trustee pleads the same red flags in the PAC, (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 284 (returns of BLMIS feeder funds were too consistent), \u00b6 286 (Defendants received trade confirmations for BLMIS feeder funds with prices above the daily high or below the daily low), \u00b6 305 (BLMIS timed trades too consistently), \u00b6 314 (BLMIS option volumes were too high), \u00b6 322 (BLMIS made trades that were inconsistent with the SSC Strategy) ), and for the same reasons, the Trustee's \"red flag\" allegations do not support an inference that the Defendants subjectively believed there was a high probability that BLMIS was not actually trading securities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Servicing and Shutting Down Oreades\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The Trustee alleges that the way certain Defendants serviced and ultimately closed Oreades supports an inference that they knew that there was a high probability of fraud at BLMIS. Some of the Defendants' practices with respect to Oreades were undoubtedly questionable. They include representing that BNP Securities Services was Oreades' custodian and receiving fees while delegating those duties to BLMIS, (\u00b6\u00b6 97-100), allowing BLMIS to act as Oreades' custodian and investment adviser in violation of BNP Bank's \"strict separation\" rule, (\u00b6 106), and Luxembourg law, and failing to disclose that BLMIS served as Oreades' investment advisor. (\u00b6\u00b6 108-111.) Although these allegations raise questions about the propriety of certain of Defendants' actions in servicing Oreades, and imply that they were willing to overlook legal and regulatory violations to make more money, they do not support the inference that those Defendants believed there was a high probability that BLMIS was not actually trading securities on behalf of Oreades and its investors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   The Trustee's allegations relating to Oreades center on the aforementioned email authored by Trouvain, a senior officer at BNP Securities Services, who expressed concern about the antiquated methods of communication used by BLMIS for sending trade documentation. Truncating that email, the PAC attempts to imply that Trouvain thought BLMIS was not actually making the trades it was reporting:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   It would be appropriate to put this type of order transmission in place between us and B. Madoff because in current practice,\n   <em>\n    we have no opportunity to consider the true validity of the orders\n   </em>\n   ....\n   <em>\n    This is a point that our risk and ethics departments found during their internal audit\n   </em>\n   and I have to contribute a source of improvement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   (\u00b6 114 (emphasis in original).) The Trustee argues that the emphasized portion of the email shows that Trouvain questioned whether BLMIS was actually engaged in trading securities. (\n   <em>\n    Trustee Brief\n   </em>\n   at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   The omitted portion of the email indicated by the ellipsis appeared in the Trustee's 2010\n   <em>\n    Oreades Complaint\n   </em>\n   and is supplied in italics below. It clearly shows that Trouvain did not question whether BLMIS was actually trading securities - he was satisfied that it was - and instead, pointed out that the lack of real-time trading information made it difficult for auditors to determine how to allocate the BLMIS trades among BLMIS' clients, which included Oreades:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   It would be appropriate to put this type of order transmission in place between\n   us and B. Madoff because in current practice, we have no opportunity to consider the true validity of the orders.\n   <em>\n    As Broker/Dealer, B. Madoff was audited and it seems that everything is correctly posted but since there is no B. Madoff management company, it is surely very difficult for the auditors to verify that all the deals carried out on behalf of the clients of B. Madoff are correctly indexed to these same clients\n   </em>\n   . This is a point that our risk and ethics departments found during their internal audit and I have to contribute a source of improvement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Oreades Complaint\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56 (emphasis added and omitted from a separate portion).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   The Trustee also asks the Court to infer that BNP Bank and BNP Securities Services subjectively believed that BLMIS was not trading securities based on the circumstances surrounding the closing of Oreades. According to the Trustee's counsel, \"[y]ou don't [shut down a successful feeder fund] because you have concerns that ... the bookkeeping isn't being adequately done.\" (\n   <em>\n    Tr.\n   </em>\n   at 39:1-3.) However, Trouvain's July 2003 email confirmed that Madoff \"was audited and it seems that everything was correctly posted.\" In addition, BLMIS and its auditors confirmed to Trouvain one month later that all securities positions had been segregated. (\u00b6 59.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   The Defendants closed the Oreades fund nine months later in May 2004, and the PAC does not allege any information that came to the Defendants' attention during that period that turned them from believers to non-believers. The more plausible inference is that the Defendants shut down the Oreades fund because of the risks associated with using the unregistered BLMIS as a sub-custodian and investment advisor in violation of Luxembourg law, (\u00b6\u00b6 116, 118, 122, 123), questions regarding the location of the U.S. Treasury securities held by BLMIS, (\u00b6 117), and Madoff's refusal to allow BNP Bank to confirm the trades in real time or disclose his role to the CSSF because BLMIS was not registered as an investment adviser in the United States and wanted to avoid regulatory scrutiny. (\u00b6\u00b6 119, 121.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Concerns of Third Parties Regarding BLMIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   The PAC alleges or implies that various third parties expressed concern to one or more of the Defendants about BLMIS or refused to do business with BLMIS or any fund that invested with BLMIS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   First, rival bank SocGen (like BNP Bank) considered purchasing ZCM but was unwilling to take on the credit facility to BLMIS feeder fund Santa Barbara because BLMIS' returns were impossibly consistent, BLMIS failed to charge customary investment management fees and BLMIS acted as its own custodian. (\u00b6\u00b6 153-61.) The Trustee alleges that a former ZCM employee told BNP Bank executives about SocGen's concerns, (\u00b6 162), but these concerns involved three of the red flags that were generally known. In addition, a Tremont employee confirmed SocGen's reluctance to do Madoff-related financing to a member of BNP Bank's Fund Derivatives Group, (\u00b6 162), but the PAC does not indicate what he said or the reason for its reluctance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Second, Mr. Fauchier, who was involved in a joint venture with a BNP Bank affiliate, became suspicious about Madoff because BLMIS did not charge investment management fees and underreported the number of managed accounts in its FOCUS Reports. Fauchier refused to invest with BLMIS or BLMIS feeder funds and questioned whether the SEC would allow BLMIS to continue as a business. (\u00b6\u00b6 131-35.) The PAC then alleges \"[u]pon information and belief, as a member of BNP Paribas's Asset Management Group, Fauchier\n   Partners shared its knowledge that Madoff was illegitimate, as well as its prohibitions against investing with Madoff, with other senior officials at BNP Paribas.\" (\u00b6 136.) The PAC does not allege the basis for the Trustee's belief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Third, the PAC alleges that BNP Bank extended a $100 million credit facility to Legacy because Renaissance, upon identifying multiple red flags associated with BLMIS, decided to terminate its Legacy investment. (\u00b6\u00b6 200, 203-05.) The PAC does not allege that the Defendants were privy to the diligence performed by Renaissance or the red flags it identified. In fact, the Trustee represented in connection with the motion to dismiss the\n   <em>\n    Legacy\n   </em>\n   complaint that the Renaissance Report was never shared with BNP Securities Corp., the only BNP defendant in that case. (\n   <em>\n    Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendants' Motions to Dismiss the Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   , dated Aug. 27, 2015, at 32 (\"Neither the Renaissance Proposal nor the Meritage Oversight Committee's subsequent findings were disclosed to BNP when Legacy sought to secure its funding.\") (ECF Adv. Pro. No. 10-05286 Doc. # 122).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Fourth, the PAC describes how Dresdner raised a variety of concerns about Madoff with Tremont, (\u00b6 218), but the Trustee does not allege that these concerns were communicated to the Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Fifth, the PAC alleges that the head of hedge funds at BNP Paribas Private Wealth, Mr. Gianferrara, would not approve Madoff-related investments for his private banking clients, (\u00b6 128), \"always had a problem with Madoff,\" and \"would 'not even consider[ ]' investments in FGG's Madoff-related funds.\" (\u00b6 129.) The PAC does not, however, identify the problems or imply that Mr. Gianferrara believed that BLMIS was not trading securities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Sixth, the Trustee alleges that in December 2007, HSBC told non-party BNP Securities Corp. to delete any reference to Madoff and BLMIS in an option agreement, and BNP Securities Corp. complied, (\u00b6 263), and in September 2008, an Access representative told BNP Bank subsidiary FundQuest to remove any references to Madoff, and FundQuest \"deleted all references to Madoff and deliberately destroyed FundQuest's old marketing materials.\" (\u00b6 264.) Access stressed that Madoff's role in Luxalpha, another foreign feeder fund, was \"very sensitive,\" and wanted assurances, which FundQuest gave, that no one would be able to find any traces of Madoff in the files or on the internet. (\u00b6 265.) As in many of the prior instances just discussed, the PAC does not identify the concerns with disclosing Madoff's connection with the fund or option agreement at issue, whether the non-debtor affiliates communicated these concerns to the Defendants or, for that matter, whether the Defendants had any connection to the two transactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Third-party concerns that are actually communicated to a defendant may be relevant to the defendant's knowledge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Merkin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12186386\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/563/737/#p752\">\n    563 B.R. at 749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the \"warnings\" identified by the Trustee amount, in most cases, to pleading by innuendo.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Typically, they refer to a third-party\n   \"concern,\" sometimes unidentified, with Madoff that may or may not have been conveyed to the Defendants and as to which the Trustee asks the Court to infer that the Defendants were aware of the concern. But even if these concerns raised a suspicion that Madoff might be engaged in fraudulent activities, they did not imply a subjective belief in the high probability that Madoff was operating a Ponzi scheme, or was not actually trading securities, or that the trades reported in the monthly customer statements were fictitious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   This brings me to the ultimate question - does the PAC allege a plausible claim,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , does it make sense, that the Defendants would have done what the PAC says they did if they subjectively believed that there was a high probability that BLMIS was not trading securities, and the trades it was reporting to its customers, including the Defendants' transaction counterparties, were fictitious? For the reasons that follow, it does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Implausibility of the Trustee's Theory of the Case\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   The crux of the Trustee's argument is that the Defendants engaged in the leverage business while entertaining a belief that there was a high probability that BLMIS was not actually trading securities, the reported BLMIS trades were fictitious and their collateral was therefore fictitious, and their obligors' sole assets, at least in the case of feeder funds fully invested with BLMIS, were non-existent. The reason: the Defendants wanted to earn fees, \"to establish their reputation as a leverage provider in a highly-competitive market, to grow the brand of BNP Paribas's Fund Derivatives Group, to compete with its biggest rival, SocGen, and to cross-sell services to BNP Paribas's institutional clients.\" (\u00b6 139.) In other words, BNP Bank made billions of dollars of risky and possibly uncollectible loans to those investing with BLMIS or BLMIS feeder funds in order to make tens of millions of dollars in fees and build its profile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Buchwald Capital Advisors LLC v.

It extended credit to Santa Barbara in an undisclosed amount to invest in Harley, another BLMIS feeder fund, and collateralized the loan with Harley's BLMIS account. (\u00b6 183.) It loaned $120 million to Legacy, an entity that invested exclusively with BLMIS, and collateralized that loan with a pledge of Legacy's BLMIS account. (\u00b6\u00b6 193-98.) It even made a direct loan to Tremont's Insurance Portfolio Fund in the sum of $100 million, and collateralized that loan with a pledge of the assets held in its BLMIS account. (\u00b6\u00b6 212, 214.) The PAC refers with less detail to many similar transactions by which BNP Bank loaned money to a counterparty for the purpose of investing with BLMIS or a BLMIS feeder fund, and took a pledge of its borrower's account with BLMIS or the BLMIS feeder fund as collateral to secure repayment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   The Defendants' ability to collect on whatever leverage BNP Bank extended to direct investors in BLMIS or investors in BLMIS feeder funds ultimately depended on the value of the BLMIS investments. If BLMIS was a Ponzi scheme, the securities listed in the BLMIS customer statements were non-existent and BNP Bank's collateral was as worthless as its borrowers' investments in BLMIS or a BLMIS feeder fund. According to the PAC, BNP Bank nonetheless engaged in billions of dollars of risky transactions, including loans and extensions of credit that ultimately depended on the value of BLMIS accounts, to earn \"tens of millions of dollars in fees and interest payments,\" (\u00b6 64), and raise BNP Bank's position as a world leader in\n   the fast-moving derivatives market. (\u00b6 151.) This theory is as preposterous as the scheme alleged by the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Fabrikant\n   </em>\n   , and it is implausible to suggest that the Defendants would make loans or engage in the transactions described in the PAC if they subjectively believed that there was a high probability that BLMIS was not actually trading securities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Accordingly, the PAC fails to plausibly allege that the Defendants subjectively believed there was a high probability that BLMIS was not actually trading securities and was, in fact, a Ponzi scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Second Element: Turning a Blind Eye\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Since the Court has concluded that the Trustee failed to plead that the Defendants were highly suspicious of BLMIS fraud, it need not address whether the Defendants took deliberate actions to avoid confirming that fraud. But assuming that the Trustee adequately pleaded the knowledge prong of the willful blindness test, he failed to plead that the Defendants turned a blind eye.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   The Trustee's pleadings are replete with allegations that the Defendants performed due diligence when dealing with Madoff, BLMIS, BLMIS feeder funds or BLMIS-related securities. BNP Bank performed due diligence on Madoff and BLMIS as early as 1988 and into the mid-1990s when it extended a personal line of credit to Madoff and accepted BLMIS customer securities as collateral. (\u00b6\u00b6 84-85.) BNP Bank also conducted due diligence of ZCM's portfolio, including the sizeable credit facility with BLMIS feeder fund Santa Barbara, in connection with the acquisition of ZCM in 2003. (\u00b6\u00b6 143, 163.) After the acquisition, the Defendants continued to perform due diligence when transactions involved BLMIS, (\u00b6 83 (the Fund Derivatives Group and BNP Bank's \"Group Risk Management\" department conducted due diligence on transactions involving BLMIS feeder funds); \u00b6 208 (BNP Bank conducted due diligence on Legacy's BLMIS account when entering into $100 million credit facility with Legacy); \u00b6 230 (the head of the Fund Derivatives Group represented to BNP Bank's risk management department that it would conduct due diligence on BLMIS and BLMIS feeder funds) ), and made an on-site diligence visit to BLMIS in March 2008. (\u00b6 175.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Trustee's Proffer\n   </em>\n   also includes several allegations relating to the Defendants' due diligence of BLMIS and Madoff. It alleges that the Defendants \"conducted initial and ongoing due diligence on BLMIS and BLMIS feeder funds,\" (\n   <em>\n    Trustee's Proffer\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13), \"[a]s the collateral agent, BNP Securities Corp. conducted due diligence, monitored the [Santa Barbara] facility, and provided operational support to BNP, and as the calculation agent BNP Securities Corp. calculated the facility's interest rates, fees, and loan-to-value ratio,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61), BNP Securities Corp. \"served as the calculation agent for the Tremont credit facility and ... as the collateral agent for the Tremont credit facility ... was responsible for conducting due diligence, monitoring the facility, and providing operational support to BNP,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86), and requested that the Kingate Funds, large BLMIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   feeder funds, email all due diligence materials to BNP. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 145.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   In addition, the\n   <em>\n    Oreades Complaint\n   </em>\n   detailed how Trouvain followed-up with BLMIS after he expressed concerns in July 2003. On August 7, 2003, Trouvain sent a fax attaching a letter written by his colleague to BLMIS requesting periodic verification of the assets in Oreades' BLMIS accounts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-183\">\n   The current operational flow provides a monthly statement of trading activity and positions sent via fax and post. This process has been reviewed by the Bank's internal and external auditors and is not considered to be compliant with our requirements under Luxembourg Law, as it does not constitute an independent verification.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-184\">\n   <em>\n    We are therefore seeking from yourselves a method whereby a periodic independent verification of the Fund's assets\n   </em>\n   and its two underlying accounts can be conducted and confirmed to Luxembourg in order to allow [BNP Securities Services] to discharge its fiduciary function. Were this verification to be proved by your auditors, Friehling and Horowitz, the information can be relied upon by both the Fund's auditors KPMG and our internal auditors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Oreades Complaint\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57 (emphasis in original and emphasis omitted from other portions).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   Frank DiPascali of BLMIS responded to Trouvain on August 12, 2003. He assured Trouvain that as of June 2002 (when BNP Securities Services became Oreades' administrator and custodian), \"all security positions ... have been segregated for the exclusive benefit of [BNP Securities Services].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58.) BLMIS' auditor, Friehling &amp; Horowitz (\"F &amp; H\"), also wrote back to Trouvain on August 21, 2003 providing an independent verification of the assets in Oreades' BLMIS accounts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-187\">\n   As Independent Auditors for [BLMIS], we have verified and hereby confirm to you that on May 31, 2003 the security positions stated on Appendix 1 and Appendix 2 (please see attached) were held in segregated accounts for the exclusive benefit of [BNP Securities Services].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-188\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-189\">\n   We further confirm that we are independent with respect to [BLMIS], [BNP Securities Services] and their affiliates under requirements of A.I.C.P.A.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Rather than turn a blind eye, the above correspondence and other allegations show that the Defendants engaged in ongoing due diligence and received repeated confirmations that the transactions were real. Furthermore, while the Trustee alleges that the Fund Derivatives Group made exceptions to its typical due diligence practices for BLMIS-related transactions, (\u00b6\u00b6 165, 167, 168, 171-74, 178), these allegations do not undercut the affirmative allegations of due diligence. In short, and not surprisingly, the Defendants did not ignore their BLMIS exposure; the likelihood of repayment of the Defendants' loans and\n   credit facilities depended on the value of their counterparties' BLMIS assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Value\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   Although the Trustee has failed to plead the Defendants' lack of good faith or knowledge that the initial transfers were avoidable, the Defendants must still demonstrate that they gave value for the subsequent transfers to prevail on their defense under section 550(b)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   The \"value\" that a subsequent transferee must provide is \"merely consideration sufficient to support a simple contract, analogous to the 'value' required under state law to achieve the status of a bona fide purchaser for value.\"\n   <em>\n    Legacy Capital\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4172903\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/548/13/#p36\">\n    548 B.R. at 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted);\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Enron Corp. v.
