Kirkland, and Poshow Ann Kirkland, as Trustee of Defendant Bright Conscience Trust (BC Trust), move the Court to withdraw the reference of adversary proceeding No. 12-02424 ER to the bankruptcy court. Dkt. 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   Court deems this matter appropriate for decision without oral argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 78 ; Local Rule 7-15. The motion is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This is one of several bankruptcy proceedings involving EPD Investment Co., LLC (EPD).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Jerrold S. Pressman is the sole proprietor of EPD.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Jason M. Rund, the Chapter 7 Trustee (Rund), alleges EPD has not been profitable since before 2003.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Between 2003 and 2009, EPD allegedly lost money every year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Rund also alleges that EPD has operated as a Ponzi scheme since 2003, specifically alleging that EPD used investments it received to pay existing creditors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   By 2009, EPD had allegedly stopped making payments to its creditors because it lacked cash infusions from new investors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   John Kirkland served as Pressman's lawyer for his various ventures and allegedly invested money in EPD.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Rund's basic allegation is that Kirkland took various steps to hide EPD's financial condition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Rund brings six claims for relief against both Kirkland and the trustee of the BC Trust.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Case No. 2:12-ap-02424-ER, Dkt. 234, Fourth Am. Compl. (FAC). Rund's First Claim is for disallowance of proof of claim; the remaining claims are for avoidance and recovery of allegedly fraudulent transfers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 17, 2018, the bankruptcy court filed a Report and Recommendation (R &amp; R) and proposed findings recommending this Court enter final judgment in favor of Rund as to some of the claims. This Court rejected the R&amp;R and denied Rund's motion for reconsideration. Case No. CV 18-1413-DSF, Dkt. 22, 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After the instant motion was filed, Rund and Pressman moved the bankruptcy court to abandon the Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Claims. Case No. BK 10-62208-ER, Dkt. 1278, at 3. The bankruptcy court denied the motion. Dkt. 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Kirkland demands a jury trial of the fraudulent conveyance claims, has not filed a proof of claim against the estate, and has not consented to a jury trial in the bankruptcy court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 21, Ex. 2, at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.
