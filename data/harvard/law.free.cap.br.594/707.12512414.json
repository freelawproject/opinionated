Rosania, Jr., United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   An individual debtor is ineligible for relief under Chapter 13 if such debtor's secured debts exceed $1,184,200.00 or unsecured debts exceed $394,725.00. Due to these debt limitations, in recent years, a growing number of professionals, entrepreneurs, and high net-worth individuals have sought relief under Chapter 11 to restructure their personal finances and maintain control of their businesses and investments. An individual Chapter 11 case is not merely a large Chapter 13. To the contrary, individual Chapter 11 cases present complex challenges and encapsulate the Chapter 11 doctrines of absolute priority and new value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   James Michael Summers (\"Debtor\") filed a voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition on October 13, 2016. Thereafter, he filed his Plan of Reorganization Dated April 19, 2018 (the \"Plan;\" Doc. No. 89).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The confirmation issues the Court must determine are whether the Plan satisfies the absolute priority rule and whether the Debtor can retain his interest in property of the estate by providing new value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Debtor's Schedule E/F reflects a total of $450,479.00 in unsecured debt. According to the claims filed in this case, the Debtor's unsecured debt includes, but is not limited to, a priority unsecured claim held by Rachelle A. Summers (\"Ms. Summers\") in the amount of $45,112.22 (Claim No. 6-1), and a non-dischargeable claim for a student loan held by the U.S. Department of Education in the amount of $114,555.61 (Claim No. 4-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Under the Plan, Ms. Summers's claim comprises Class 8, and the Plan provides for treatment of her claim in accordance with the settlement agreement attached as Exhibit C to the Plan. Class 7 consists of all unsecured claims other than Ms. Summers's claim. The Plan provides for total payment of $30,000.00 in satisfaction of Class 7 claims (i.e., approximately a 7% distribution). Both Class 7 and Class 8 are impaired under the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Plan also states the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Class 9 includes the Interests of the Debtor in his property. Class 9 is unimpaired by this Plan. On the Effective Date of the Plan Class 9 shall retain its interests in all assets owned prior to the Confirmation Date.\n   <em>\n    If confirmation of this Plan is sought pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201129\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b), all property of the Debtor which is property of the Debtor's bankruptcy case as of the Effective Date of the Plan shall remain property of the estate during the term of the Plan\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   VIII \u00a7 8.1 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court held a hearing on confirmation of the Plan on August 28, 2018 (the \"Confirmation Hearing\"). No objections to confirmation were filed. The Debtor, with counsel, appeared at the Confirmation Hearing and represented that only two impaired classes of creditors voted on the Plan. Specifically, Class 8 voted to accept the Plan, and Class 7 voted to reject the Plan. According to the Summary of Voting Results, only two creditors in Class 7 voted on the plan: Feldman Nagel, LLC, with a claim of $14,867.16, voted to accept the Plan, and the U.S. Department of Education, with its claim of $114,55.61, voted to reject the Plan (Doc. No. 113). The Debtor argued that, notwithstanding a dissenting class of creditors, the Plan can be confirmed under \u00a7 1129(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Debtor's arguments in support of confirmation under \u00a7 1129(b) were twofold. First, the Debtor argued that the absolute priority rule is not at issue in this case because the Debtor will not receive or retain any property under the Plan. The Plan provides that all the Debtor's property which is property of the estate as of the effective date of the Plan will not revest in the Debtor upon confirmation. Rather, said property will remain property of the estate during the term of the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Alternatively, the Debtor argued that even if the Court finds that the Debtor is receiving or retaining property under the Plan, the Plan can be confirmed using the concept of new value. The Debtor contends that because the property does not revest in the Debtor but instead remains property of the estate during the term of the Plan, this contribution constitutes new value. According to the Amended Disclosure Statement (Doc. No. 102) which was previously approved by this Court (Doc. No. 106), the assets in this case are valued at\n   $705,944.00, without accounting for liens and exemptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the close of the Confirmation Hearing, the Court ordered (Doc. No. 117) that on or before September 14, 2018, the Debtor should file (i) authority supporting his arguments in favor of confirmation; or (ii) an amended Chapter 11 plan. On September 12, 2018, the Debtor filed the Brief in Support of Plan Confirmation Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201129\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (Doc. No. 119). No amended plan was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The Plan does not comply with the absolute priority rule.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code sets forth the general requirements for confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan. Section 1129(a) allows for confirmation where each impaired class of creditors consents. Alternatively, \u00a7 1129(b) provides a \"cram-down\" mechanism that allows for confirmation without the consent of each impaired class if, among other things, the plan is \"fair and equitable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Section 1129(b)(2) outlines the criteria that must be satisfied for a plan to be deemed fair and equitable. Among the criteria is the absolute priority rule, which \"requires that certain classes of claimants be paid in full before any member of a subordinate class is paid.\"\n   <em>\n    Richard M. Allen v. Geneva Steel Co. (In re Geneva Steel Co.)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9397390\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/281/1173/\">\n    281 F.3d 1173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1181 n. 4 (10th Cir. 2002). This requirement is codified in \u00a7 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii), which, as amended by the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (\"BAPCPA\"), provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   the holder of any claim or interest that is junior to the claims of such class will not receive or retain under the plan on account of such junior claim or interest any property,\n   <em>\n    except that in a case in which the debtor is an individual, the debtor may retain property included in the estate under section 1115\n   </em>\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201129\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Section 1115, added by BAPCPA, in turn states the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (a) In a case in which the debtor is an individual, property of the estate includes, in addition to the property specified in section 541-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (1) all property of the kind specified in section 541 that the debtor acquires after the commencement of the case but before the case is closed, dismissed, or converted to a case under chapter 7, 12, or 13, whichever occurs first; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (2) earnings from services performed by the debtor after the commencement of the case but before the case is closed, dismissed, or converted to a case under chapter 7, 12, or 13, whichever occurs first.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (b) Except as provided in section 1104 or a confirmed plan or order confirming a plan, the debtor shall remain in possession of all property of the estate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201115\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Section 1141 governs the effect of confirmation.

In\n   <em>\n    Stephens\n   </em>\n   , the Tenth Circuit declined\n   to find that the BAPCPA amendments eliminated the absolute priority rule as applied to an individual's entire estate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3654353\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/704/1279/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3654353\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/704/1279/\">\n    at 1287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, the Court agreed with the view that the amendments can be best understood as preserving the status quo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3654353\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/704/1279/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3654353\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/704/1279/\">\n    at 1286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To wit, only the post-petition property which \u00a7 1115 adds to an individual Chapter 11 debtor's estate is exempt from the absolute priority rule, but the absolute priority rule continues to apply to the pre-petition property defined by \u00a7 541.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3654353\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/704/1279/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3654353\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/704/1279/\">\n    at 1285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In so holding, the Court reversed the bankruptcy court's order confirming a Chapter 11 plan that allowed two individual debtors to \"retain possession and control of their property.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3654353\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/704/1279/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3654353\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/704/1279/\">\n    at 1282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Plan in the present case attempts to circumvent the absolute priority rule by providing that, contrary to \u00a7 1141, \"all property of the Debtor which is property of the Debtor's bankruptcy case as of the Effective Date of the Plan shall remain property of the estate during the term of the Plan.\" Thus, the Debtor contends that he will not receive or retain any property under the Plan on account of his interest (which is junior to that of Class 7). However, the Plan also provides that the Debtor will remain in possession of his assets, including his pre-petition property that falls within the purview of \u00a7 541. The Debtor maintains that his continued possession of property is not a result of the Plan, but rather by operation of \u00a7 1115. But this is a distinction without a difference. Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Stephens\n   </em>\n   , the Plan runs afoul of the absolute priority rule because it allows the Debtor to \"retain possession and control\" of prepetition property notwithstanding a senior dissenting class of creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Nonetheless, the Debtor argues that if the absolute priority rule is implicated, which the Court finds that it is, the Plan can still be confirmed under the concept of new value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Debtor's proposed contribution does not satisfy the requirements of the new value exception.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The new value exception allows courts to find that an interest holder in a Chapter 11 debtor whose plan violates the absolute priority rule may in some circumstances retain the interest because they provide \"new value\" to the debtor, in the form of new capital or similar contributions.\n   <em>\n    CRE/ADC Venture 2013, LLC v.
