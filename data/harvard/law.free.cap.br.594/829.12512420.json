Existence of a Fiduciary Duty\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The crux of Defendant's argument is that a technical trust requires the segregation of trust assets. In support of this, Defendant relies heavily on the holdings of\n   <em>\n    Quaif v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Cooseman's Miami, Inc. v. Arthur (In re Arthur)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512116\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/589/761/\">\n    589 B.R. 761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. S.D. Fla. 2018). However, Defendant misinterprets the holdings of\n   <em>\n    Quaif\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Cooseman's\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Quaif v.

In analyzing whether the statutory trust fell within the exception to discharge contained in \u00a7 523(a)(4), the Eleventh Circuit specifically noted the difficulty associated with classifying the statutory trust which \"...create fiduciary duties that are dependent upon the relationship between the parties but fit into neither of the traditional categories.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6532568,11937543\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/4/950/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Eleventh Circuit observed that the new, statutory trusts, fell somewhere between express trusts, which traditionally fell under the purview of \u00a7 523(a)(4), and a trust created by operation of law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 593-594. To determine if the trust created by the Georgia statute in issue was more akin to an express trust, and thus covered by \u00a7 523(a)(4) or a constructive or residual trust, the Eleventh Circuit looked to whether trust assets had been segregated prior to any defalcation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 954. Rather than standing for the proposition that segregation is required for\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   trust to fall within \u00a7 523(a)(4)'s exception to discharge\n   <em>\n    Quaif\n   </em>\n   stands for the proposition that segregation is needed before a\n   <em>\n    statutory trust\n   </em>\n   will fall within \u00a7 523(a)(4)'s exception to discharge\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   . This interpretation is supported by the Eleventh Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Guerra v.

In applying the holding of\n   <em>\n    Quaif\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   the Eleventh Circuit stated \"Quaif also discussed the trends in judicial interpretation of the \u00a7 523(a)(4) exception and noted that courts seemed to include the voluntary, express trust created by contract within the scope of \"fiduciary capacity\" as used in \u00a7 523(a)(4).\"\n   <em>\n    Guerra v.

The\n   <em>\n    Cooseman\n   </em>\n   's Court noted that \"a technical trust is more akin to a trust created by voluntary agreement., i.e. an express trust.\"\n   <em>\n    Cooseman's\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512116\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/589/761/\">\n    589 B.R. at 766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Just as in\n   <em>\n    Quaif\n   </em>\n   , the Court in\n   <em>\n    Cooseman\n   </em>\n   's noted that \"statutory trusts fall in the middle\" and endeavored \"[t]o determine whether a statutory trust is more analogous to an express trust than it is to a resulting or constructive trust...\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512116\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/589/761/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, just as in\n   <em>\n    Quaif\n   </em>\n   , the holding of\n   <em>\n    Cooseman\n   </em>\n   's is limited to statutory trusts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The same can be said for the other cases cited by Defendant in his Reply.

However,\n   <em>\n    Ershowsky\n   </em>\n   stands for the very conclusion reached\n   by the Court in the present case, holding that \u00a7 523(a)(4)'s exception to discharge \"require[s] the existence of an[ ] express or technical trust, and included statutorily created trusts if they were somehow segregated from other amounts.\"\n   <em>\n    Ershowsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3818267\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/431/245/\">\n    431 B.R. at 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
