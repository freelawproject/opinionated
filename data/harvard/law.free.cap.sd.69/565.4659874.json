King, applicant for a writ of habeas corpus, is being held in the penitentiary at Sioux Falls, South Dakota, by virtue of a judgment of the Circuit Court, Second Judicial Circuit, Minnehaha County, South Dakota, bearing date the 6th day of November, A. D. 1922, sentencing him to imprisonment in that institution for the remainder of his natural life. As will appear from the opinion in State v. King, 62 S. D. 184, 252 N. W. 36, 37, the information upon which the applicant was tried charged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-9\">\u201c \u2018* * * The said J. B. King had been theretofore duly and legally arrested, tried and convicted on the 24th day of March, 1921, in the County of Bon Homme, State of South Dakota, on the charge of Grand Larceny, and had been on said day duly sentenced to serve a term of two years in the state penitentiary at Sioux Falls, South Dakota. * * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-10\">\u201c \u2018And that thereafter and while each of said defendants were incarcerated in the said South Dakota state penitentiary and serving the sentences thereinbefore stated, and on the 17th day of August, 1922 * * * the said defendants and each of them, being then and there armed with dangerous weapons, namely knives about six or eight inches long, did then and there unlawfully, wilfully and feloniously commit an assault and battery upon the person of Arthur Muchow by then and there forcibly striking, cutting, beating, bruising and wounding the said Arthur Muchow with the said knives aforesaid with the intent upon the part of the said defendants to kill and murder the said Arthur Muchow, and the said knives used as aforesaid being such as was likely to produce death, and the said defendants and each of them, did then and there and by said means commit the crime of assault with the intent to kill, contrary to the form of the Statute in such case made and provided. * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>The judgment of the court, among other things recites, \"and the jury having heard the evidence * * *, returned into open Court, * * * their oral verdict \u2018Guilty as charged in the information,\u2019 * * Upon former applications this recital has been accepted as true. In connection with the present application it is made to appear by a certified copy of the minutes of the court that the verdict of the jury, as recorded therein, reads as follows: \u201cWe the jury find the defendant guilty of assault with intent to kill, second offense as charged in the information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">Predicated upon this record, the contention now made is that the applicant was in fact convicted of the included offense of assault with intent to kill, second offense, upon which the maximum sentence the court was empowered to impose was for a term of ten years, and that therefore the sentence being excessive, the judgment is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">A preliminary matter should be put aside before we turn to a consideration of this principal issue. We haV\u00e9' quoted both the recital of the judgment and the full verdict as recorded in the minutes of the court. It is settled that as between the irreconcilable recitals of a judgment and the record as a whole, the record controls, and such a judgment is vulnerable to collateral attack based upon such record if its invalidity is made to appear thereby. Illinois Trust &amp; Sav. Bank v. Town of Roscoe, 46 S. D. 477, 194 N. W. 649. Habeas corpus is but a method of collateral attack of a judgment. State v. King, supra. The statute, \u00a7 4932, Rev. Code 1919, required the clerk to record the verdict in full in the minutes. We have concluded that the principle to which we have adverted is applicable here and that we must accept the record as reflecting the true finding of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\"> Certain well-settled principles serve as postulates in a consideration of the applicant\u2019s principal contention. If the judgment under which the applicant is held is void, the writ should issue and he Should be discharged. SDG-37.5504; State v. King, supra.'7 A judgment which imposes a sentence in excess of that' which is authorized by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>law is void as to the excess. In re Taylor, 7 S. D. 382, 64 N. W. 253, 45 L. R. A. 136, 58 Am. St. Rep. 843; In re Lackey, 6 S. D. 526, 62 N. W. 134. See Lee Lim v. Davis, 75 Utah 245, 284 P. 323, 76 A. L. R. 468, at page 476, and 25 A'm.- Jur. 188, \u00a7 59. As the applicant has been imprisoned more than ten years, the question for decision is whether his position that the court was without power to impose more than a ten-year sentence under the recorded verdict is welL taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The sentencing power of the court with which we are here concerned arose in part from the following sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">\u00a7 3612, Rev. Code 1919. \u201cEvery person who having been convicted of any offense punishable by imprisonment in the state, penitentiary, commits any crime after such conviction, is punishable therefor as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">\u201c1. If the offense of which such person is subsequently convicted is such that upon a first conviction an offender would be punishable by imprisonment in the state penitentiary for any term exceeding five years, such person is punishable by imprisonment in the state penitentiary for a term not less than ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">\u201c2. If such subsequent offense is such that upon a first conviction the offender would be punishable by imprisonment in the state penitentiary for five years, or any less term, then the person convicted of such subsequent offense is punishable by imprisonment in the state penitentiary for a term not exceeding ten years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">\u00a7 3617, Rev. Code 1919. \u201cWhenever any person is declared punishable for a crime by imprisonment in the state penitentiary for a term not less than any specified number of years, and no limit to the duration of such imprisonment is declared, the court authorized to pronounce judgment upon such conviction may, in its discretion, sentence such offender to imprisonment during his natural life, * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AtdY\">From a reading of these sections it will be noted that if the offense under consideration as a second or subsequent offense would upon a first conviction be punishable by a term exceeding five years, it was punishable under \u00a7 3612, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>subd. 1, supra, by a term of \u201cnot less than ten years\u201d and therefore under \u00a7 3617, supra, was punishable by life imprisonment. State v. Foreman, 68 S. D. 412, 3 N. W.2d 477. On the other hand, if as an original offense the crime was punishable for five years or less, as a subsequent or second offense, it was punishable by a sentence of not more than ten years. \u00a7 3612, subd. 2, Rev. Code 1919, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The information in legal effect charged the applicant with the commission of an assault and battery upon another by means of a deadly weapon with intent to kill as a second offense and was obviously framed under \u00a7 4051 and \u00a7 3612, Rev. Code 1919. State v. Foreman, supra. \u00a7 4051 reads as follows: \u201cEvery person who shoots or attempts to shoot at another, with any kind of firearm, air gun, or other means, with intent to kill any person, or who commits any assault and battery upon another by means of any deadly weapon, or by any other means or force likely to produce death, with intent to kill any other person, is punishable by imprisonment in the state penitentiary not exceeding ten years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">In passing, we observe that this section is divisible and describes separate crimes of like grade. However, each of the offenses so defined embrace distinct elements, and an information charging one of these offenses does not include any other crime described in that section. Territory v. Conrad, 1 Dak. 363, Reprint p. 348, 46 N. W. 605. We therefore give no further consideration to the other aggravated assaults described in that section. The information as drawn, however, did embrace the elements of other lesser assaults. By \u00a7 4052, Rev. Code 1919, it was provided: \u201cEvery person who is guilty of an assault with intent to kill any person, the punishment for which is not prescribed in the preceding section, is punishable by imprisonment in the state penitentiary not exceeding five years, or in a county jail not exceeding one year, or by a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars, or by both such fine and imprisonment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Section 4077, Rev. Code 1919 provided: \u201cAn assault <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>is any wilful and unlawful attempt or offer, with force or violence, to do a corporal hurt to another\u201d \u2014 and \u00a7 4078, Rev. Code 1919 provided: \u201cA battery is any wilful and unlawful use of force or violence upon the person of another.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Unquestionably, all of the elements of these three lesser crimes were embraced within the charges contained in the information. Another provision of statute provided: \u201cThe jury may find the defendant guilty of any offense, the commission of which is necessarily included in that with which he is charged in the * * * information, * * *.\u201d \u00a7 4926, Rev. Code 1919.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">The trial court looked to these sections of the statutes and instructed the jury that \u201cIncluded therefore within the offenses charged in the information is that of assault with intent to kill, which is a lesser offense\u201d and further that \u201cUnder the information in this case the defendant, if guilty at all, may be found guilty of the crime charged in the information, or of an assault with intent to kill or of an assault and battery or simply an assault, as you may find the facts to be from the evidence.\u201d See People v. Odell, 1 Dak. 197, Reprint p. 189, 46 N. W. 601; Territory v. Conrad, supra; State v. Peterson, 23 S. D. 629, 122 N. W. 667; State v. Cotton, 36 S. D. 396, 155 N. W. 8. The jury found the defendant \u201cguilty of assault with intent to kill, second offense as charged \u2019ift1 the information.\u201d This verdict invoked and measured the power of the court to sentence the applicant. Feaster v. State, 15 Okl. Cr. 366, 177 P. 124. Decision therefore turns upon a proper construction of this verdict of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\"> The statute provided \u201cA general verdict upon a plea of not guilty, is either \u2018guilty\u2019 or \u2018not guilty\u2019 which imports a conviction or acquittal of the offense charged. * * *\u201d \u00a7 4918, Rev. Code 1919. The verdict was not general. The statute further provided: \u201cA special verdict is that by which the jury finds the facts only, leaving th\u00e9 judgment to the court. It must present the conclusions of fact, as established by the evidence and not the evidence to prove them, and the conclusions of fact must be so presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>as that nothing remains to the court but to draw conclusions of law upon them.\u201d \u00a7 4919, Rev. Code 1919.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Viewing the jury\u2019s finding as a special verdict, the conclusion is impelled that it is not sufficiently comprehensive to support a conclusion of law of guilt of the major offense charged in the information. It fails to expressly find all of the elements of that crime; for instance, it does not expressly find that defendant committed a \u201cbattery.\u201d These omitted elements may not be supplied by a process of implication. We have concluded that those authorities are sound which hold that the addition of the phrase \u201cas charged in the information,\u201d or a phrase of similar import, to such a verdict as is here under consideration does not furnish a premise from which a conclusion may be drawn that the jury intended to find every element of the offense charged in the information. Kimball v. Territory et al., 13 Ariz. 310, 115 P. 70; People v. Lee, 237 Ill. 272, 86 N. E. 573; State v. Johnson, 3 N. D. 150, 54 N. W. 547. See State v. Pickus, 63 S. D. 209, 257 N. W. 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Such a verdict has been denominated a \u201cpartial verdict,\u201d 1 Bishop\u2019s New Criminal Procedure (4th Ed.) \u00a7 1009, and is said to be a verdict \u201cof conviction as to a part of the charge, and acquittal or silence as to the residue.\u201d In dealing with this character of verdict the territorial court said: \u201cAnd as an indictment must be direct and certain as it regards the particular circumstances of the offense charged, when they are necessary to constitute a complete offense, so must a verdict be direct and certain in a case like this, and must embrace all the necessary elements, if the jury intended to convict under this section. Perhaps the jury so intended, but how are we to say this, except by giving a loose rein to conjecture or inference? It is their peculiar province to determine facts, intents, and purposes, and it is their duty to pronounce their conclusions in accordance with their own judgments. As the juries do not give reasons for their verdicts, it can never be legally known what were the precise grounds for them; and, if they are in any degree favorable to the accused, it is always presumable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>they were so given because the evidence was not sufficient in degree, or satisfactory in character.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">And in that case the court' further said: \u201cBut the jury did not find the defendant guilty of the offense with the commission of which he stood charged. They inferentially acquitted him of that when they found him guilty of an assault \u2018with intent to do bodily harm.\u2019 \u201d Territory v. Conrad, 1 Dak. 363, Reprint p. 348, 46 N. W. 605, 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">When this verdict is read and construed in the light of the statutes, the information and the instructions, the conclusion is irresistible that the jury did not convict the defendant of a violation of \u00a7 4051, Rev. Code 1919. The language they employed indicates an intention to convict the defendant of one of the lesser included offenses. We need not now determine whether that verdict convicts defendant of the offense described in \u00a7 4052, Rev. Code 1919 or of a simple assault. It is sufficient for our present purposes to determine that the jury did not convict the defendant of a crime which authorized the court to impose a greater penalty than the defendant had suffered when this proceeding was instituted. Viewed as a finding of guilt of the more serious of these two assaults, as a second offense, the verdict authorized a maximum sentence of ten years. Assault with intent to .kill as defined by \u00a7 4052, Rev. Code 1919, is punishable by imprisonment \u201cnot exceeding five years\u201d and under \u00a7 3612, subd. 2, supra, is therefore punishable as a second or subsequent offense by a sentence of \u201cnot exceeding ten years.\u201d That penalty had been suffered by the applicant before he instituted this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">To the extent by which the court exceeded its power to sentence applicant, the judgment in our opinion is unquestionably void and we therefore hold that the writ should issue and the applicant should be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">The merits having been submitted and heard, further procedure would be futile. Our judgment will be that the applicant is illegally held and that he be forthwith discharged from the custody of the warden of the state penitentiary.</p>\n<judges id=\"b603-10\">All the Judges concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
