The proof at the trial was that George W. Keyes acted as the agent of the defendants; that he took the bread named in the declaration on commission to sell for the plaintiffs; that the bread was to remain the property of the plaintiffs ; that the defendants\u2019 agent was to sell it at a commission of twenty per cent, and return to the plaintiffs what remained unsold. It was also in evidence that this contract was carried out, and the money received for the bread was used by the agent in the defendants\u2019 business; and the present action was brought to recover the eighty per cent, due the plaintiffs, as the proceeds of the sales.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b608-13\">\u201c The defendants contended that the proof did not support the declaration, and that in that form of action the plaintiffs could not recover. But the court ruled that although a count for money had and received would have been more correct in form, yet, no exception having been made until the evidence was all in, the declaration, under the new practice act, would be sufficient.

The defect, if any, is in the account annexed, as not being sufficiently full and precise. This, if true, would be no ground of exception for variance. But we do not perceive that the account is open to the objection. The terms \u201c bread furnished,\u201d and \u201c delivered \u201d to the defendants\u2019 agent are consistent with a sale, but well enough describe a balance due for bread sold on consignment</p>\n<p id=\"AyeD\"><em>Exceptions </em>- <em>verruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
