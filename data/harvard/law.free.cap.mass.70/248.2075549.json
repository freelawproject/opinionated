The parties submitted the case to the judgment of the court upon the following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-9\">The will of John Browning, who died in 1809, contained the following clauses : \u201c I give and bequeath unto my beloved wife, Clara Browning, one full third of my estate, both real and per-, sonal, for her use and improvement agreeably to the law in that case made and provided.\u201d <em>\u201c </em>The remainder of my estate I give and bequeath unto my children, to be divided among them all,\u201d [in certain specified proportions,] <em>\u201c </em>and further it is my will that my children shall receive their respective portions when they arrive at the age of twenty one years.\u201d The premises were set off in 1814, by commissioners duly appointed by the judge of probate, to the widow, who, claiming to hold the same in fee, in 1838 conveyed them by warranty deed to Moses Phelps, under whom the plaintiff\" claims. The widow died in 1852. The defendant is the husband of one of the daughters of John Browning, and made the entry upon the premises, which is the trespass <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>complained of, for the purpose of asserting his wife\u2019s right to a share therein.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b259-5\"><em>C. </em>Allen, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AjH\">The words \u201c one full third of my estate,\u201d pass \u00e1 fee, unless clearly limited by other words. <em>Tracy </em>v. Kilborn, 3 Cush. 557. <em>Godfrey </em>v. Humphrey, 18 Pick. 537. <em>Kellogg </em>v. Blair, 6 Met. 322. 1 Roberts on Wills, 465. 2 Jurman on Wills, (Amer. ed.) 181, <em>&amp; note. </em>Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>62, \u00a7 4. The words \u201c for her use and improvement,\u201d do not indicate such a limitation, but correspond to the words \u201c use and benefit \u201d in <em>Tracy </em>v. Kilborn, 3 Cush. 557. In Fay v. <em>Fay, </em>1 Cush. 93, the testator gave only \u201c the use and improvement,\u201d and not the estate itself. Nor can the words \u201c agreeably to the law in that case made and provided \u201d have any effect; for there is no particular statute or law making such provision for the widow of a testator; and in the case of an intestate estate, the law gives the widow a life estate in one third of the real property, and the absolute disposal of one third of the personal; while this will puts both in the same category. The terms of the residuary devise to the children show that the testator contemplated but one distribution, and that a final one, between his children, upon their arrival at twenty one; and not that they should receive a further share upon the death of their mother, then a young woman, and who in fact survived her husband forty three years.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b259-6\"><em>P.

And the terms of his will leave us in no doubt that he meant to give her the same, and no more.</p>\n<p id=\"AyH\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
