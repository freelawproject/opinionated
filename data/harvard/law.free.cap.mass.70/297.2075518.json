The defendant justified under a way of necessity attached to adjoining land, belonging, at the time of said deed, to Sher<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>man, from whom the defendant also derived title. At the trial in the court of common pleas, it appeared that Sherman, at the time of the first deed, retained no other way to his remaining lot except over the land granted. But Perkins, J. ruled that the defendant could not justify under a way of necessity over land which he had conveyed by deed of warranty. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b308-5\">P. <em>C. </em>Bacon, for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AE9\">cited Co.

These points are settled, as well in the cases cited for the plaintiff', as those cited for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">Is the rule affected by the fact that the grantor conveyed by deed of warranty ? We think not. If the way were expressly reserved in the deed, the covenants must apply to the premises granted, that is, an estate with a right of way reserved or carved out of the fee. In the present case, the law does for the parties the same thing, and the covenants apply to an estate with this way of necessity reserved.</p>\n<p id=\"AuC7\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
