Sts. <em>c. </em>39, $ 53, and not upon the contract of subscription, and need not aver performance of the conditions precedent of the contract.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b71-7\">Under <em>St. </em>1852, <em>c. </em>312, \u00a7 23, an appeal lies from the decision of a judge of the court of common pleas upon a demurrer taken for the cause that the declaration does not state a legal cause of action, substantially in accordance with the rules contained in that statute, and particularly assigning, for cause of demurrer, that performance of the conditions precedent of the contract declared upon is not alleged.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-8\">Action of contract. The declaration alleged that after the plaintiffs\u2019 directors, pursuant, to then- act of incorporation, <em>(St. </em>1851, <em>c. </em>277,) had determined the amount of their capital stock, and had appropriated and set apart one moiety thereof for the construction of the section cof their road between Palmer and the village of Amherst, they then opened books of subscription for said capital stock, in shares of one hundred dollars each; \u201c that the defendant became a subscriber for ten shares of said stock, and promised in wilting to take and pay for the same, to the treasurer of said railroad company, in such instalments, and at such times, as were required by the act of incorporation aforesaid, and as should be assessed by said directors.\u201d The declaration then set forth the making by the directors of ten assessments, at various times specified, amounting in all to one hundred dollars a share, due notice thereof to the defendant, his neglect for more than thirty days to pay any but the first assessment, and the sale of his shares by public auction by the treasurer, under the order of the directors, and after due notice, for less than enough to pay the unpaid assessments; and alleged that the defendant owed the plaintiffs the amount of.the deficiency.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-9\">The defendant demurred to the declaration, because it did not state a legal canse of action, substantially in accordance with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>the rules contained in <em>St. </em>1852, <em>c. </em>312; and particularly assigned, for cause of demurrer, that the declaration did not aver that or wherein the plaintiffs had complied with the terms and conditions of the alleged promise of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-4\">The court of common pleas sustained- the demurrer, and the plaintiffs appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b72-5\"><em>G. P. Huntington, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Amp\">1. This declaration is not, like that in <em>Troy &amp; Greenfield Railroad </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>1 Gray, 544, brought upon the Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>39, \u00a7 53, to recover of a stockholder the amount of the deficiency in the amount received from the sale of his shares ; it does not even allege that the defendant became a stockholder; but it is brought upon his contract of subscription, and is therefore defective, in not stating the performance of the precedent conditions disclosed in the contract. <em>St. </em>1852, c. 312, \u00a7 2, <em>cl. </em>10.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b72-6\">2. This demurrer is not general, but points out the particular defects in the manner of stating the plaintiffs\u2019 case. The decision of the single judge of the court of common pleas was therefore final. <em>St. </em>1852, <em>c. </em>312, \u00a7\u00a7 21, 23.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b72-7\"><em>E. Dickinson, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b72-8\">Thomas, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOr\">The demurrer must be overruled. The action is not brought upon the contract of subscription. It is based upon the provisions of the Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>39, \u00a7 53. A sale of the defendant\u2019s shares having been made, for failure to pay the assessments laid upon them, this action seeks to recover the difference between the amount of the assessments and the sum for which the stock was sold. The case is within the rule settled in <em>Troy &amp; Greenfield Railroad </em>v. <em>Newton, </em>1 Gray, 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">It is said, however, that this demurrer having been sustained in the court of common pleas, no appeal lies from that judgment. The demurrer is not to form, but to substance, to the cause of action. It is, in effect, that the facts stated do not in point of law support the action. It is therefore within the provisions of the <em>St. </em>of 1852, c. 312, \u00a7 23, and may be heard on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"ANj\">\n<em>Demurrer overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
