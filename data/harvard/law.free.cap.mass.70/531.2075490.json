The two justices of the peace and of the quorum made and kept no record, otherwise than by signing the following certificate :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-9\">\u201c Worcester, ss. To Rufus Carter, underkeeper of the jail in Worcester. We, the subscribers, two of the justices of the peace for the said county of Worcester, and each of us of the quorum, hereby certify that Henry Fairbanks, a poor prisoner, confined upon execution for debt in the jail at Worcester, hath caused Benjamin F. Butler and William P. Webster, the creditors at whose suit he is so confined, to be notified according to law, of his, the said Fairbanks\u2019s, desire to take the benefit of the law for the relief of poor debtors ; that in our opinion the said Fairbanks hath not any estate, real or personal, to the amount of twenty dollars, except the goods and chattels which are by law exempted from being taken in execution; and hath not any other estate now conveyed or concealed, or in any way disposed of, with design to secure the s.ame to his own use, cr to defraud his creditors; and we have, after due examination of the said Fairbanks, administered to him the oath prescribed by law to be taken by poor prisoners who are committed on execution for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>debt. Witness our hands, this twenty third day of April Anno Domini 1853. W. Jennison, ) Justices of the Peace</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-5\">Wm. Eaton, ) and of the Quorum.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b542-6\"><em>B. F. Butler, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AxX\">1. The certificate produced is not competent evidence of the administration of the poor debtors\u2019 oath; as it is not the record of the proceedings, or a copy thereof; but a mere notice to the jailer, reciting that the magis\u00ab trates have administered the oath, so that he may discharge the prisoner. These proceedings being judicial, a record is presumed. Rev. Sts. c. 85, \u00a7 35. 1 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 513.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b542-7\">2. If the certificate is to be deemed a record, it is the record \u25a0 of a court of inferior jurisdiction, and should therefore show not only that the justices are \u201c of the quorum,\u201d but also that they are \u201c disinterested, and not related either to the creditor or the debtor.\u201d Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>98, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b542-8\"><em>A. C. Clark, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b542-9\">Merrick, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AK_\">1. This court have already decided that the cer- . tificate delivered by the examining magistrates to the jailer is all that is required to complete the debtor\u2019s discharge. <em>Green </em>v. <em>Wilbur, </em>10 Cush. 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">2. The objection of the plaintiffs to the validity of the proceedings, by virtue of which the defendant was discharged from custody, that it nowhere appears in the record that the justices were disinterested and not related to either of the parties, is, in view of the provisions of law upon the subject, unimportant and immaterial. The statute has prescribed the form in which the justices, who administer the oath to poor debtors imprisoned for debt, shall make their certificate of that fact. The .certificate made by the justices in the present case was in exact conformity to that requisition, and may therefore well be held to be sufficient. The words of the statute are of plain import; and no. judicial construction should be allowed to vary or modify their obvious meaning. Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>98, \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendants.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
