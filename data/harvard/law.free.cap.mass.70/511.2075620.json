That the defendant, on the 23d of May 1848, applied for the benefit of the insolvent laws ; a warrant was duly issued, and notice published; that John B. Atwill was chosen his assignee in June 1848, and in September 1848 commenced an action against Sargent in this court for $11,000 had and received; that in that action all the claims and demands which Sargent then had against this defendant were filed in set off, and were considered and adjudicated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-8\">At the trial in the court of common pleas the plaintiff gave in evidence a copy of the judgment declared on. The defendant put into the case a copy of the writ in the action on which that judgment was rendered, bearing date March 15th 1848, and returnable at April term 1848, by which it appeared that the cause of action was for bricks sold by the plaintiff to the defendant in this commonwealth; and it was agreed that the defendant did not appear in that action, but was defaulted on or before the 18th of April 1848.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-9\">The defendant also proved, by the record thereof, the proceedings in insolvency relied on in the answer; and gave in evidence a copy of the judgment obtained in the action brought by his assignee against the plaintiff, from which it appeared that Atwill, at October term 1849, recovered a verdict against Sargent for $948.63.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b521-10\">The defendant offered evidence to prove \u201cthat on the trial of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>that action of <em>Atwill, assignee, </em>v. <em>Sargent, </em>Sargent, by consent of Atwill and Fitzpatrick, was allowed to and did present, as matter of set-off, all claims and demands which he then had against Fitzpatrick, and that, although the judgment declared on was not specifically mentioned in the set-off filed by Sargent, the subject matter and cause of action on which that judgment was founded was considered and adjudicated in that action.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b522-5\">Hoar, J. ruled \u201c that, as it was not shown for what specific items the jury found their verdict in the action of Atwill, <em>assignee, </em>v. <em>Sargent, </em>nor whether any thing was allowed by them upon the judgment now in suit, the facts offered in evidence would not be a defence to this action.\u201d To this ruling the defendant alleged exceptions, the verdict being against him.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b522-6\"><em>B. F. </em>Butler, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5D\">-1. The discharge in insolvency was a bar to any action on the defendant\u2019s judgment, for that judgment was founded on a debt contracted within the commonwealth, provable against the defendant\u2019s estate. <em>St. </em>1838, <em>c. </em>163, \u00a7 7. So far as the defendant is concerned, the debt is the same after as before judgment. The defendant\u2019s confession in court by suffering a default was of the same character as the judgment itself. <em>Drake </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>3 East, 251. The plaintiff had the statute notice of the insolvency, and was bound by it. He might subsequently preclude himself from proving his debt, but could not alter the defendant\u2019s position. If it is urged that the cause of action is merged in the judgment, the court will look behind the judgment to see on what it is founded. <em>Wyman </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>1 Cow. 321. <em>Betts </em>v. <em>Bagley, </em>12 Pick. 572. <em>Sampson </em>v. <em>Clark, 2 </em>Cush. 173. The doctrine of merger is never allowed to work injustice, or to defeat the manifest intention of the parties. <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Crehore, </em>3 Pick. 482.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b522-7\">2. The claim on which this judgment is founded has been discharged by being proved, in effect, against the insolvent\u2019s estate, and paid in full out of that estate; for it was allowed by way of set-off, in fact, though not in form, and thus reduced the amount recovered by the assignee ; and to compel the debtor to pay it would be to allow the creditor to recover it twice.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b522-8\"><em>B. F. Jacobs, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3g\">1. The discharge is no bar; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>for the judgment on which the original claim was merged, was subsequent to the petition ; and it is immaterial whether the defendant appeared or made default. <em>Sampson </em>v. <em>Clark, 2 </em>Cush, 173. <em>Woodbury </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>5 Cush. 86. <em>Mann </em>v. <em>Houghton </em>7 Cush. 592. <em>Faxon </em>v. <em>Baxter, </em>11 Cush. 35.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b523-5\">2. The alleged set-off is no bar. 1st, Because the judgment was not pleaded in set-off. Rev. Sts. c. 96, \u00a7 17, 23. 2d, Because the assignee could not set off any thing except as of the day of the first publication. <em>Demmon </em>v. <em>Boylston Bank, </em>5 Cush. 194. Nor is it a bar as a set-off of the subject matter of the judgment, for that is merged and extinct. And this defendant cannot take advantage of an unlawful act of his assignee, allowing the set-off, to which act he was not a party.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b523-6\">Merrick, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AmD\">The evidence offered by the defendant relative to the proceedings had in the previous suit of his assignee against the plaintiff ought to have been received and submitted to the jury. It tended directly to show that he had already received satisfaction in full for the claim which he is here seeking to recover. If under the permission conceded to him, as well by Fitzpatrick, who had an indirect and perhaps also a real interest in the suit, as by his assignee, by whom it was prosecuted, he actually availed himself of this demand in his defence, he thereby made it a subject of adjudication, and by the rendition of judgment in the suit it became satisfied and discharged. Under such circumstances he would be precluded by the fina, determination of the matter in that action from the right of maintaining any other for its recovery. The facts therefore which the defendant offered to prove were very material to him upon the trial, and would have been decisive in his favor, if they had been satisfactorily established.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">The reasons assigned for not allowing the proposed evidence to be introduced are not sufficient to justify its exclusion. For it was not necessary to show specifically for what items the jury returned their-verdict, or whether they allowed any thing on account of the cause of action which is declared on in the present action, because without any such particular proof the payment would be held to be conclusive upon the parties in relation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>to all the matters which were in issue between them upon the trial. And that issue comprehended as well the matters which were presented in set-off, as the cause of action relied on by the plaintiff. Rev. Sts. c. 96, \u00a7\u00a7 21,22. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Whiting, </em>11 Mass. 445. <em>Sprague </em>v. <em>Waite, </em>19 Pick. 457. 1 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 522-534.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">The plaintiff cannot be allowed to derive any benefit from the objection urged by him, that Atwill had no right to give his consent that the demand of the plaintiff might be filed and used in set-off to his suit, because the judgment against Fitzpatrick now declared on was rendered after the commencement of the proceedings in insolvency against him. It may be that in yielding such permission the assignee exceeded his authority, and thereby suffered the fund for the payment of the debts due to the creditors of the insolvent to be unnecessarily diminished. But that is a question with which the plaintiff has nothing to do ; it lies wholly between other parlies, to be settled and arranged as they shall deem best for themselves. It is sufficient for the plaintiff that no injustice was done to him. The allowance of his own claim, if it was a just one, in diminishing to a corresponding extent that of Fitzpatrick against him, was equivalent to payment, and was all that he had a right to require, to secure to himself the full benefit and advantage of it. Having thus availed himself of the debt, he has no cause of complaint, even if it be true that others, of which we express no opinion, may he justly dissatisfied with the arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"AhLB\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
