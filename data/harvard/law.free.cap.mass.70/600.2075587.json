Trial before <em>Bigelow, </em>J., who reserved the case for the decision of the whole court upon the following facts :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-7\">At the sale, the defendant represented that the purchaser was to have a complete and perfect title, and the bidding proceeding upon that supposition, and it was finally struck off at about its full value free of incumbrances. The purchaser afterwards claimed that the plaintiff should sign the deed to him, to which she objected, but, upon the defendant\u2019s saying that \u201c it should be \u201d or \u201c would be as well for her,\u201d signed, but did not seal, nor acknowledge before a magistrate, the following writing at the end of the defendant\u2019s deed to the purchaser: \u201c And I, Mary F. Giles, widow of the above named Noah Giles deceased, hereby release my right to dower in the above described premises.\u201d And the purchaser, upon the delivery of the deed to him, with this writing added to it, paid the purchase money to the defendant.

The plaintiff\u2019s release being of a mere right to have a life estate set off to her, and made for a good consideration, was effectual to bar her right, without a seal.

She had not conveyed or released it in any of the modes specially provided by statute. Such right, therefore, could only be alienated by deed; but the memorandum signed by her, not sealed or acknowledged, was not a deed, and did not work an alienation of her dower. Her right to her dower, if she had any, stands unaffected by that memorandum ; and there was no consideration moving from her, upon which to raise an implied promise of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"AIg\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
