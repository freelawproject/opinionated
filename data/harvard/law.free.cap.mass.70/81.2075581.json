The declaration contained two counts, one in contract, and one in tort, averring them to be for the same cause of action, and each setting forth the bond,and alleging a breach thereof by a sale of intoxicating liquors within one year, contrary to law. The defendant demurred, and assigned, as one cause of demurrer, that the plaintiffs were not the obligees named in the bond, and could not therefore maintain this action in their own names. The other causes of demurrer, and the arguments thereon, not having been passed upon by the court, are omitted in this report.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b91-9\"><em>W.

The whole legal title to maintain the action consists in the deed by which the defendant has bound himself to the Commonwealth. The right of action on a sealed instrument belongs to the party having the legal interest. This is now well settled. <em>Sanders </em>v.
