Hoar, and Charles G. Hoar his son, in their answers admitted the entry of the shop and attaching of the belt; but denied that the plaintiffs were thereby damnified as alleged; and left it to the plaintiffs to prove whether the acts of the defendants impeded the progress of the plaintiffs\u2019 wheel, or rendered its power or gearing of no use to the plaintiffs ; and alleged that the said Thomas, and the said Charles by his father\u2019s authority, did the acts complained of under and by virtue of a contract in writing made by Parley Sibley, the father of the plaintiffs and former owner of the plaintiffs\u2019 shop, with Thomas N. Hoar and Francis Nadeau, on the 8th of February 1848, (a copy of which was annexed to the answers,) and took no more power than was necessary to carry the fan bellows in said contract mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b232-9\">By that contract Parley Sibley let to Hoar and Nadeau, for five years from the 1st of October 1848, two buildings on the north side of his scythe shop, \u201c for the purpose of carrying on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>the iron foundry business,\u201d on certain terms and conditions, of the material part of which the following is an exact copy, in words and punctuation: \u201c Said Hoar and Nadeau shall have the right of water power from said Sibley\u2019s scythe shop and take said power from the wheel and shaft that now carries a fan bellows in said Sibley\u2019s shop at all times when there is water equal to and sufficient for to carry a fan bellows to blow for the stack in said foundry. Also a privilege around said building for all purposes necessary to carry on said foundry work and business. The expense of carrying the aforesaid power from said scythe shop to said foundry is to be borne by the said Hoar and Nadeau.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-5\">At the trial in the court of common pleas at December term 1853, before Mellen, J., the plaintiffs admitted the execution of the contract; and introduced evidence which tended to prove that in August 1852 the defendants went into the plaintiffs\u2019 shop, and were about to displace from the wheel the belt used to carry the plaintiffs\u2019 fan bellows, for the purpose of attaching to the wheel the belt by which the mill for milling iron castings in the defendants\u2019 foundry was carried; and one of the plaintiffs, interposing, was forcibly held by one of the defendants, while the other slipped off the belt, and put on the belt of the defendants\u2019 mill, and forbade the plaintiffs to remove it, and afterwards continued to use the wheel occasionally by means of this belt; that before this time the defendants, on some dispute arising between them and the plaintiffs as to the right to use the wheel, had threatened to take possession of the wheel, and try their right. It also appeared that this belt could be slipped from the drum by any one in the plaintiffs\u2019 shop; but the plaintiffs, after this entry of the defendants, discontinued using the bellows wheel, and were at expense and delay in fitting up another wheel to drive the fan for their bellows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b233-6\">The defendants introduced evidence tending to show that the right leased to Hoar and Nadeau was part of a large water power owned by Parley Sibley; that in April 1848 they built a stack in the building let to them, and fitted into the foundry a shaft adapted for several drums, and fixed a drum thereon, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>arranged a belt leading from the dram of the bellows wheel in the. plaintiffs\u2019 shop, to carry the fan to blow the defendant's\u2019 \u25a0 stack; and two or three months afterwards fitted up a mill for milling the iron cast, and attached to the same shaft a second drum, by means of a belt running upon which this mill was carried ; that this mill was used from time to time about two hours a day, but only when the plaintiffs\u2019 bellows wheel was not working ; that milling was part of the business of a foundry, and was essential to its profitable management, when the castings were of suitable size to be milled; that the fan bellows in the plaintiffs\u2019 shop could be run at the same time with the defendants\u2019 bellows, there being power enough for both; but the plaintiffs\u2019 fan bellows could not, as then geared, run at the same time with the defendants\u2019 mill, because the motion of the latter was slower; and that the plaintiffs were present from time to time when the defendants were putting in their works, and made no objection to the manner in which they were constructed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-5\">The plaintiffs contended, \u201c first, that the defendants had no right by said contract to use the power of the plaintiffs\u2019 bellows wheel, except to carry a fan bellows, to blow for the stack in said foundry; or secondly, if the defendants had a more extensive right, they could not use it to the injury of the plaintiffs, by impeding thereby the speed of their bellows wheel, more than would be occasioned by the operation of blowing a fan bellows for the stack ; and that when the defendants took possession of said wheel, for the purpose and in the manner above stated, the plaintiffs had a right to abandon res use, and hold the defendants responsible for stopping the plaintiffs\u2019 works, till a new wheel could be prepared.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b234-6\">The defendants denied that they had taken any possession of the wheel; and contended \u201cthat the use of the power was not limited to blowing the stack; that that was a measure of the power leased, and that it was competent for the lessee to use it in the proper and legitimate business of a foundry; and that if the right that was leased had been transcended, they would not jointly be liable for any thing except the mere act of entering the plaintiffs\u2019 shop and fixing the belt upon the drum.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>In regard to the construction of the contract, the presiding judge ruled as follows: \u201c That said contract conveyed to said Thomas N. Hoar and Nadeau a water power at all times equal to that required to carry a fan bellows for a stack in the foundry\u2014 not restricted to carrying a fan bellows to blow for a stack in the foundry, but restricted to the business of a foundry; and that this was limited in point of time, when there is a deficiency of water for the use of the grantors in carrying a fan bellows in their scythe shop\u2014this grant to the defendants being subject to the grantors\u2019 reserved power to carry a fan bellows in the scythe shop ; that the grantees were, by the contract, to use the granted power, subject to the grantors\u2019 power so reserved, and were bound to regulate the speed of their machinery, in the use of their power, so as not to interfere with the reserved power of the grantors, and would be responsible for using water beyond the power granted, and for any use of the power in any manner inconsistent with the grantors\u2019 right; as, for instance, in preventing the grantors\u2019 use of the power, by retarding the machinery of the grantors, so that they could not run the fan bellows for the use of the scythe shop.\u201d And the judge instructed the jury that the plaintiffs were entitled to damages, if the operation of the defendants\u2019 mill impeded the operation of the plaintiffs\u2019 fan, to the injury of the plaintiffs ; or if the mill required the use of more power than was sufficient to blow the defendants\u2019 stack.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b235-5\">Upon the measure of damages, the judge instructed the jury \u201c that if the defendants merely removed the plaintiffs\u2019 belt when they had no power to remove it on the principles above stated, the plaintiffs were entitled to merely nominal damages, as it was the duty of the plaintiffs to restore the belt; but if the acts of the defendants, at the time of the removal of the belt, or in connection with previous, threats, were such as to lead the plaintiffs to believe there would be a constant and forcible interruption of their use of their wheel, they had a right to make such alterations in their works as would enable them to carry on their business in the usual manner, and the defendants would be responsible for the damages occasioned by such delay, and the expenses necessarily incurred in such alterations.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b236-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>The jury found specially that the power used for carrying the mill was not so great as that required to blow the stack, and returned a general verdict for the plaintiffs, with damages assessed in the sum of twenty five dollars; and the defendants alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b236-5\"><em>G. F. Hoar, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AE1\">1. The contract is to be so construed as to effect the principal intent of the parties, which was to furnish the lessees with power \u201c for the purpose of carrying on the iron foundry business,\u201d of which the process of milling was proved to be an essential part. \u201c At all times when there is water,\u201d the lessees are to have power \u201c sufficient to carry a fan bellows \u201d ; but their use of the power is unrestricted; and there is no reservation of power to the lessors. The \u201c wheel and shaft that now carries a fan bellows in Sibley\u2019s shop \u201d merely describe the place from which the power is to be taken. If the meaning of the contract be not clear, it should be construed beneficially for the lessees. 23 Amer. Jurist, 258. 2 Bl.

The ruling as to the measure of damages was too broad, and permitted the jury to give damages for losses wdiich the plaintiffs might have prevented, and which were not, directly or indirectly, the result of the act of placing the belt on the dram, (which was the only trespass sued for,) but from the apprehension of future trespasses, for which, when committed, the law would afford a recompense. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Gooday, </em>8 M. &amp; W. 146. <em>Loker </em>v. <em>Damon, </em>17 Pick. 284. <em>Batchelder </em>v. <em>Sturgis, </em>3 Cush. 201. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Mariners\u2019 Church, </em>7 Greenl. 51.

But if this be not so, the instructions were sufficiently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>favorable to the defendants; for they certainly had no right so to use the power for any other purpose, as to impede its use for the plaintiffs\u2019 fan bellows. <em>Dexter </em>v.
