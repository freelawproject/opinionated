Sts. c. 126, \u00a7 17, for stealing it.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b426-14\">In an indictment for stealing a bank bill of a denomination and value described, \u201c of the goods and chattels of\u201d a person named, the words w of the goods and chattels \u201d may ba rejected as surplusage, and the indictment remain sufficient.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-15\">Writ of error to reverse a judgment by which the plaintiff was sentenced to three years\u2019 imprisonment in the state prison, on an indictment charging him with stealing \u201c one bank bill of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>the denomination of one hundred dollars, and of the value of one hundred dollars, one gold half eagle of the value of five dollars, and one wallet of the value of fifty cents, of the goods and chattels of one Daniel Carter.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b427-5\">The errors assigned were that the punishment was greater than was authorized by law, because the indictment was materially defective, 1st, in not describing, in the words of the statute, the instrument alleged to have been stolen, as \u201c a bank note \u201d ; 2dly, in describing said instrument as of the \u201c goods and chattels\u201d of one Daniel Carter.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b427-6\"><em>F. F. Heard, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEq7\">The indictment is insufficient, because it describes the instrument alleged to have been stolen, as a <em>\u201c </em>bank bill,\u201d instead of describing it, in the words of the Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>126, \u00a7 17, as a \u201c bank note.\u201d <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Craven, </em>Russ. &amp; Ry. 14. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Chard, </em>Russ. &amp; Ry. 488. 1 Stark. Crim. Pl. (2d ed.) 195, 196.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-7\">Bank notes should be laid as \u201c the property \u201d of the owner, and not as \u201c goods and chattels.\u201d <em>The King </em>v. <em>Guy, </em>1 Leach, (3d ed.) 276. <em>The King </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>2 Leach, 525. 1 Stark. Crim. Pl. 196. <em>Slate </em>v. <em>Calvin, </em>2 Zab. 207. The decision in <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Radley, </em>3 Cox C. C. 460, and 1 Denison, 450, that the words \u201c goods and chattels,\u201d though an incorrect description of money, might be rejected as surplusage, is in direct conflict with the opinion of this court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, 2 </em>Cush. 587, and with <em>Long\u2019s case, </em>Cro. Eliz. 490.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b427-8\">As the articles duly described amounted to less than one hundred dollars in value, the court had no authority to sentence the plaintiff in error to imprisonment for more than one year. Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>126, \u00a7 17. But the defendant might properly have been sentenced for the larceny of those articles. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eastman, 2 </em>Gray, 76. <em>Hope </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>9 Met. 134.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b427-9\"><em>J. II. Clifford, </em>(Attorney General,) for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b427-10\">Metcalf, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALU3\">The seventeenth section of <em>c. </em>126 of the revised statutes, on which the plaintiff in error was indicted, prescribes the punishment of larceny by stealing (among other things) <em>u </em>any bank note \u201d ; but the indictment charged him with stealing a \u201cbank bill.\u201d We are of opinion that there is no error in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>for, throughout the revised statutes, the words \u201cbank note\u201d and \u201cbank bill\u201d are used indifferently, and have the same meaning. Eev. Sts. <em>c. </em>36, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 10, 29, 53, 56,57,58, 61; c. 120, \u00a7 4 ; <em>c. </em>127, \u00a7\u00a7 4, 5, 8. A bank bill, therefore, is a bank note.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Although bank notes or bills may not, perhaps, be properly termed goods and chattels, in an indictment, yet, in the present case, the words \u201c of the goods and chattels \u201d may be rejected as surplusage, and the remaining words in the indictment will constitute a sufficient charge of larceny. So are the English decisions. <em>The King </em>v. <em>Morris, 2 </em>Leach, (3d ed.) 525. <em>Regina </em>v. <em>Radley, </em>1 Denison, 450. And they conform to our own decisions in analogous cases. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>9 Met. 138. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bolkom, </em>3 Pick. 281. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v <em>Moseley, 2 </em>Virg. Cas. 154.</p>\n<p id=\"A8O\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
