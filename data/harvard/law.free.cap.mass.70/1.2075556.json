But the court refused. The district attorney, before the court refused the inspection, offered to furnish the defendant with a list of the witnesses sworn in his case, but the defendant insisted upon inspecting the record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-5\">The defendant then asked the court to inspect the records of the court, to ascertain if any such list, as required by law, of the witnesses sworn before the grand jury, had been returned and filed of record ; and it was found that a list of the witnesses so sworn was filed of record, not under the hand of the foreman, but of the clerk of the grand jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-6\">The defendant then moved that the indictment be quashed and dismissed, for the following reasons :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-7\">\u201c 1st.

The records of the court are kept for the public convenience, and every citizen has a right to inspect them. And the defendant is especially entitled to know what witnesses were sworn against him before the grand jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>that he may know whether the indictment against him was found upon proper evidence; and his rights do not depend upon the good faith of the prosecuting officer. He is also entitled to know that a list of all the witnesses sworn before the grand jury during the term has been filed of record, under the hand of the foreman, as required by the Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>136, \u00a7 9. If these provisions of law, made for the defendant\u2019s benefit, are not shown to have been complied with, the indictment cannot be maintained. 2 Phil. Ev. (3d ed.) 174. 1 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7\u00a7 471, 472. 2 Russell on Crimes, (7th Amer. ed.) 812. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Locke, </em>14 Pick. 485. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>9 Pick. 498.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b14-4\">2. The indictment is defective, in not purporting to be found for the grand jurors for the county of Hampshire. 1 Archb. Crim. Pl. (Waterman\u2019s ed.) 76 <em>&amp; seq. Clark </em>v. <em>State, </em>1 Indiana, 253. <em>Tipton </em>v. <em>State, </em>Peck, 308. Indeed it does not show that the jurors who presented it were grand jurors at all.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b14-5\">.3. The material allegation of being a common seller should have been accompanied by a definite allegation of the county where the offence was committed. <em>Thayer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 12 </em>Met. 9. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>7 Mass. 9. 3 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7\u00a7 12, 143. 1 Archb. Crim. Pl. 85. The county is not laid, except in the caption; and the caption cannot be resorted to in aid of the indictment. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>1 Missouri, 547. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>7 Blackf. 494. <em>People </em>v. <em>Jewett, </em>3 Wend. 319. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gilbert, </em>13 Verm. 647. 1 Archb.

The indictment charges no offence; for it does not allege that the defendant made three several sales of intoxicating liquor. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Giles, </em>1 Gray, 468.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b14-7\">5. This indictment cannot be maintained, because it was found after the repeal of the statute on which it was based. The <em>St. </em>of 1852, <em>c. </em>322, was repealed by the <em>St. </em>of 1855, <em>c. 215, </em>which provided different punishments for like offences, without specifically reserving the right to prosecute for offences already committed. <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Squire, 5 </em>Pick. 168. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kimball, </em>21 Pick. 373. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Herrick, </em>6 Cush. 465. Bouvier Law Dict. \u201c Repeal.\u201d The only saving clause is in <em>St. </em>1855, <em>c. </em>215, \u00a7 39, which (after expressly repealing the <em>St. of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>1852, c. 322, and all other inconsistent acts) declares that \u201c this repeal shall not affect any action or prosecution which has been already commenced, or which may be hereafter commenced, or any rights acquired or liabilities incurred, by virtue of any existing law, on account of any thing done before this repeal takes effect.\u201d This limits the express repealing clause only, and not the repeal by implication; its operation upon actions or prosecutions \u201c hereafter commenced \u201d should be limited to those commenced within the thirty days (prescribed by Rev. Sts. c. 2, \u00a7 5) preceding its taking effect; and it only saves liabilities incurred \u201c by virtue of any existing law,\u201d that is, law existing at the time of the commencement of the prosecution.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b15-5\"><em>J. H. </em>Clifford,, (Attorney General,) for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b15-6\">Dewey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AF\">1. This defendant had no particular interest in knowing who were sworn as witnesses' before the grand jury, other than those who were thus sworn in his particular case. In capital cases, a list of the witnesses sworn before the grand jury in the particular case, is, under our practice, always furnished the prisoner. But we are not aware of any right to demand such list of witnesses in any other than a capital case.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-7\">Nor is it any objection that can be taken by the defendant, that there was an omission to comply with the provisions of the Rev. Sts. c. 136, \u00a7 9, requiring the foreman of the grand jury to return to the court a list, under his hand, of all witnesses who shall have been sworn before the grand jury during the term. Such provision is directory merely, and the omission to return such list, in the manner required by the statute, does not furnish any ground for quashing an indictment found and returned into court at the term when such omission occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-8\">2. It is then insisted that this indictment is bad, because it does not appear that it was found and returned by the grand jury of the county of Hampshire. It is said that the name of the county is only alleged in the caption, and that the caption is no part of an indictment. In answer to this it may be replied, that in our practice every indictment has a caption attached to it, and returned by the grand jury as a part of their presentment in each particular case; and in this respect a caption, as used in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>this commonwealth, differs essentially from that of other tribunals where the separate indictments are returned without any caption, and the caption is added by the clerk of the court, as a general caption embracing all the indictments found at the term. We are of opinion, that, under our practice, it is sufficient that, in the caption returned by the grand jury in the particular case, or by reference thereto, they describe themselves as grand jurors for the county of Hampshire; and also that such indictment is in good and proper form where the grand jury are described, as in our ancient practice, as \u201cjurors for the Commonwealth,\u201d and that it is not necessary that they be directly described as \u201c grand jurors.\u201d No other jurors than grand jurors being authorized by law to find and return bills of indictment, this indictment, under this long established form of description, must be taken to have been found by the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-4\">3. The name of the county being fully set forth in the caption thus returned as attached to the indictment, a reference thereto in the indictment, as \u201c in said county,\u201d may properly be had, to find the county where the offence is alleged to have been committed ; and being thus made certain, the place of the commission of the offence is sufficiently charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-5\">4. This indictment properly charges, in general terms, that the party was a common seller of intoxicating liquors, and in such case it is not necessary to set forth in the indictment any particular acts of sale, or any number of sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-6\">5. It is further contended that this indictment cannot be sustained, because it was found after the <em>St. </em>of 1852, c. 322, was repealed. If such repeal had taken place without any sufficient saving clause as to liabilities previously incurred, the position taken by the defendant would be entirely sound. But we think the true construction of the saving clause in <em>St. </em>1855, <em>c. </em>215, \u00a7 39, is much broader than that contended for by the defendant; and that it is a saving of all prosecutions that may hereafter be commenced, for any liabilities incurred before the repealing act took effect, by virtue of any laws existing at the time the offence was committed, and that the saving clause is not limited to prosecutions actually commenced before the <em>St. </em>of 1855, <em>c. </em>215, took <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>effect, but embraces all cases of liability for offences against the provisions of <em>St. </em>1852, <em>c. </em>322, during its continuance in force as a law, which was up to the period when the <em>St. </em>of 1855, <em>c. </em>215, went into operation.</p>\n<p id=\"Ad\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
