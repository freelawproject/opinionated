And the plaintiff contended that the construction of the deed to Lees was a question for the jury in c connection with the other facts in the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b291-7\">But the presiding judge ruled that, by virtue of the deed from the plaintiff to Lees, the defendant was entitled to the use of the water whenever it was necessary for the purposes of his mill, and that the plaintiff had deprived himself, to that extent, of the right to take water needed to irrigate his farm; and ruled that the construction of this deed could not be affected by the deed made by Lees to the plaintiff. A verdict was taken by consent for the defendant, and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b291-8\"><em>H. Chapin 8f JE.

It is said that the deed from Lees to the plaintiff, although bearing the same date as that \u25a0from the plaintiff to Lees, was not recorded until after the execution of the deed by the executors of Lees to the defendant, and that no actual notice to Lees of the contents of this deed is shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">But the deed of the executors of James Lees is a restricted conveyance, in its very terms. It is of an interest of which he died seized and possessed, and subject to all the limitations, charges and restrictions, created by the several deeds to and by said Lees. This opens the inquiry broadly enough to give effect to the deed by Lees to the plaintiff, and passes the estate and interest of Lees to the defendant subject to that deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">The inquiry further will be, whether the plaintiff\u2019s rights have been interfered with by the defendant, giving full effect to the deed of Lees to the plaintiff, and giving effect to the evidence as to the manner in which the water had heretofore been taken and used, under the exception contained in the deed of Lovering to Braman.</p>\n<p id=\"ASYf\">\n<em>New trial ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
