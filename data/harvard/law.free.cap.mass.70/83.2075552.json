At the trial in the court of common pleas at October term 1854, the defendant contended that, as that statute purported to give him jurisdiction of the complaint made before him against the plaintiff, no action would lie against him, if his proceedings conformed to that statute, although that section was unconstitutional. But <em>Mellen, </em>C. J. ruled that, as that statute was unconstitutional, his proceedings under it were unlawful, and he was liable to this action. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b93-10\">it. <em>A. Chapman Sf C. R.

But that section of the statute has been adjudged to be unconstitutional and void. <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>McGirr, </em>1 Gray, 1. It therefore conferred no authority or jurisdiction upon magistrates. Under a government of limited and defined powers, where, by the provisions of the organic law, the rights and duties of the several departments of the government are carefully distributed and restricted, if any one of them exceeds the limits of its constitutional power, it acts wholly without authority itself, and can confer no authority upon others. The defendant could derive no power or jurisdiction from a void statute. He therefore acted without any jurisdiction; and, upon familiar and well settled principles, is liable in this action. <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>McGirr, </em>1 Gray, 45. <em>Piper </em>v. <em>Pearson, </em>2 Gray, 120. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>May, 2 </em>Gray, 410.</p>\n<p id=\"AHu\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
