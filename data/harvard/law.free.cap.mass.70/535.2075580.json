Trial in the court of common pleas, before <em>Bishop, </em>J., who signed the following bill of exceptions :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-12\">\u201c John R. Tufts, the first witness called by the government, testified, in his examination in chief, that he did not know the defendant\u2019s business, and that he did not know where his shop was situated. The witness testified with a great deal of reluctance, and showed a strong disposition to conceal the facts which be knew, and evaded the questions put to him by the district attorney. The district attorney put to the witness the following interrogatory: \u2018 Did you not swear before the grand jury that you did know the defendant\u2019s business, and that you did know where the defendant\u2019s shop was situated ? \u2019 To this, the counsel for the defendant objected ; but the court permitted the question to be put. The district attorney assigned no reason for putting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>the question, and the court gave no reason for allowing it, nol was there any explanation made by court or counsel. The reason why the court permitted the question to be put, was the manifest reluctance of the witness to say any thing implicating the defendant, and his obviously evasive answers to the questions put to him, which induced the court in its discretion to allow the examination; but the reasons for so doing were not stated by the court. The above question was asked, and answered by the witness in the affirmative ; the jury found a verdict of guilty ; and the defendant excepted-to the above ruling of the court.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b546-5\"><em>G.

Bellows, 4 Pick. 179. <em>Whitaker </em>v. <em>Salisbury, </em>15 Pick. 534. <em>Stockton </em>v. <em>Demuth, </em>7 Watts, 39. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Price, </em>8 Watts, 447. <em>Winston </em>v. <em>Mosely, 2 </em>Stew. 137. <em>Fulton Bank </em>v. <em>Stafford, 2 </em>Wend. 483. <em>Friedlander </em>v. <em>London Assurance Co. </em>4 B. &amp; Ad. 193. <em>Ewer </em>v. <em>Ambrose, </em>3 B. &amp; C. 746. Where a witness disclaims all knowledge of facts sought to be proved by the party calling him, such party cannot interrogate the witness as to his prior contradictory statements, his credit is immaterial; and such statements are not substantive evidence. 1 Stark.

Whether the question objected to should have been put on cross-examination was a matter within the discretion of the \u25a0presiding judge, and not a subject of exception. <em>Moody </em>v. <em>Rowell, </em>17 Pick. 498.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b546-8\">2. The question was rightly permitted to be put. \u201c If a witness by his conduct in the box, shows himself decidedly adverse, it is always in the discretion of the judge to allow a cross-examination ; but if a witness called stands in a situation which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>of necessity makes him adverse to the party calling him, the counsel may, as matter of right, cross-examine him.\u201d By Best, C. J. in <em>Clarke </em>v. Saffery, Ry. &amp; Mood. 126. See also 1 Greenl.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Auh\">The evidence of what the witness testified before the grand jury ought not to have been received. It bore upon no question pertinent to the issue. It was not to neutralize the effect of evidence given by the witness against the party calling him; for the witness had given none. It could only be to disparage the witness, and show him unworthy of credit with the jury, which was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"A3N\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
