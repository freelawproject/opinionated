At the trial in the court of common pleas, there was evidence tending to show that the defendant, a field driver of Grafton, found the plaintiff\u2019s horse going at large in the highway, without a keeper, and took him up and drove him to the pound keeper\u2019s house, which was sixty or eighty rods from the town pound, and, not finding the pound keeper at home, put the horse into his barn, and requested his wife to tell her husband, when he returned, to put the horse in the pound; that the pound keeper returned in about half an hour, and his wife at once communicated to him the defendant\u2019s directions, and he, in compliance therewith, immediately put the horse into the pound; and the next morning, for some reason connected with the condition of the pound, and for convenience of feeding, and without the knowledge or consent of the defendant, took the horse out, and put him in his barn, where he was found and replevied by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b322-7\"><em>Briggs, </em>J. instructed the jury that if these facts were proved to their satisfaction, and the defendant took the horse to the pound keeper\u2019s house without unnecessary delay, and placed the horse in the barn for the purpose of safety until the pound keeper should arrive, the defendant had so far complied with the requirements of the law; and that the defendant would not be responsible for the removal of the horse by the pound keeper the next morning without the defendant\u2019s knowledge or consent.

Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>19, \u00a7 33 ; <em>c. </em>113, \u00a7 1. <em>Bruce </em>v. Holden, 31 Pick. 191. <em>Wild </em>v. Skinner, 33 Pick. 253, 254. The authority conferred on a field driver to perform these duties must be strictly pursued; and cannot be delegated so as to enable another person to impound beasts in his absence. <em>Coffin </em>v. Field, 7 Cush. 358. Bac. Ab. Offices &amp; Officers, L.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-5\">It is not the duty of the pound keeper, in the absence of the field driver, to drive and impound beasts taken up and restrained in his barn, in his absence, by the field driver, and there abandoned and left until he should return home; nor could he be made liable for keeping the beast in the barn where the field driver left it.

Crim. Law, 33, 59. D. Davis\u2019s Justice, (3d ed.) 94. <em>Marblehead Mutual Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Underwood, </em>3 Gray, 313. The jury have found that the delay was not unreasonable, and that the defendant put the horse in the pound keeper\u2019s barn for the purpose of safety. He was only bound to deliver the beast to the pound keeper. But if it was his duty to take it to the pound, although he could not appoint a deputy generally, he might employ the pound keeper as his servant or bailiff to do a particular act. Broom\u2019s Max.

To \u201c forthwith impound \u201d is to impound without unnecessary delay. The act of impounding by the field driver does not require that he should open or close the gate. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>pound is under the care and in the custody of a keeper e.ected for the purpose. Rev.
