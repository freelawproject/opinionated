Appellee, United Ohio Insurance Company, has moved this court for reconsideration of our decision in <em>Newman v. United Ohio Ins. Co. </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 170, 624 N.E.2d 728. Appellee \u201cseeks reconsideration in order that the Court may clarify the ambiguities and confusion created by the <em>Savoie </em>decision, specifically syllabus 3.\u201d In seeking reconsideration, appellee argues that \u201c * * * Syllabus 3 of <em>Savoie </em>fails to mention the issue of setoff or to address whether the setoff is to be made from the insured\u2019s <em>damages </em>as opposed to the <em>written limit of </em>underinsured <em>coverage. </em>* * * \u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b895-14\">I concurred in <em>Savoie v. Grange Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 500, 620 N.E.2d 809. My concurrence was based on my understanding (and it is still my belief) that <em>Savoie </em>(1) requires setoff; (2) requires that any setoff be against the insured\u2019s <em>damages ('not the written limits </em>of underinsured coverage); and (3) that paragraph three of the syllabus of <em>Savoie </em>applies to \u201c * * * <em>ail </em>personal iiy'ury cases * * * \u201d (emphasis added) <em>(Hillman v. Hastings Mut. Ins. Co. </em>[1994], 68 Ohio St.3d 238, 239, 626 N.E.2d 73, 74, Pfeifer, J., concurring) and not <em>just </em>to wrongful death cases. I write now only to reassert what <em>Savoie, </em>in part, stands for and to clarify any alleged confusion with the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-15\">Finally, it is interesting to note how many parties, seeking reconsideration of their cases and <em>Savoie, </em>are now citing to us <em>Wood v. Shepard </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 86, 526 N.E.2d 1089, as an accurate and moderate pronouncement of the law on the subjects addressed therein. The previous continued hammering at <em>Wood, </em>in attempts to limit or overrule its holding, produced a plethora of bad case law which the <em>Savoie </em>court felt the need to correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>Appellee now has its clarification without need of reconsideration. I concur with the majority in denying reconsideration.</p>\n<judges id=\"b896-5\">AW. Sweeney, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
