In that case, an insured was injured as a result of a collision with an uninsured motorist. The insured\u2019s policy provided uninsured motorist coverage. That coverage contained a provision requiring that any dispute between the insured and his insurance carrier be submitted to arbitration. However, the right to arbitration was limited by the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-11\">\u201c \u2018Action Against the Company: No suit or action whatsoever or any proceeding instituted or processed in arbitration shall be brought against the company for the recovery of any claim under this coverage unless as a condition precedent thereto, the insured or his legal representative has fully complied with all of the terms of the policy and unless same is commenced within twelve months next after the date of the accident.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 293, 23 O.O.3d at 281, 432 N.E.2d at 168.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>In <em>Colvin, </em>the insured failed to request arbitration within one year of the date of the accident. On this basis, the carrier denied uninsured motorist coverage. Thereafter, the insured filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a determination that the one-year limitations period in the insurance contract was void as against public policy. The trial court held that the provision was neither unlawful nor violative of public policy. On appeal, the court of appeals reversed. Upon further appeal, this court reversed the judgment of the court of appeals, holding that the one-year time limitation contained in the uninsured motorist provisions of the policy was \u201cneither in conflict with R.C. 2305.10, the two-year statute of limitations for bringing actions for personal injuries, nor in violation of the public policy as embodied in R.C. 3937.18, the statute requiring the offering of uninsured motorist insurance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 297, 23 0.0.3d at 283, 432 N.E.2d at 170. The plurality in <em>Colvin </em>held that the parties to an insurance contract can agree to limit the time within which to commence an action or proceeding for payment of uninsured motorist benefits, if the contractual limitation is clear, unambiguous and reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 296, 23 0.0.3d at 283, 432 N.E.2d at 169. Finding that these requirements had been satisfied, the plurality in <em>Colvin </em>upheld the one-year limitations period in the uninsured motorist provisions of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">In the years since <em>Colvin </em>was decided, the courts of appeals in this state have apparently sought to limit the full effect of that decision. Specifically, the courts of appeals in a number of appellate districts have held that a contractual one-year time limitation of the type upheld in <em>Colvin </em>is invalid (unreasonable) as applied to <em>underinsured </em>motorist coverage. See, <em>e.g., Cook v. Ohio Mut. Ins. Assn. </em>(May 29, 1990), Clermont App. No. CA89-09-081, unreported, 1990 WL 70931; <em>Worley v. Ohio Mut. Ins. Assn. </em>(1991), 76 Ohio App.3d 531, 602 N.E.2d 416; <em>Lapata v. Progressive Cas. Ins. Co. </em>(1992), 79 Ohio App.3d 65, 606 N.E.2d 1015; and <em>Medved v. Progressive Cos. </em>(Jan. 31, 1992), Lake App. No. 90-L-15-161, unreported, 1992 WL 40207. In essence, these courts have distinguished <em>Colvin </em>as a case applying to <em>uninsured </em>motorist coverage. See, also, <em>Am. Select Ins. Co. v. Stopar </em>(Dec. 10, 1992), Cuyahoga App. Nos. 61158 and 61159, unreported, 1992 WL 369254. Further, at least one Ohio appellate court has found, in a case involving <em>uninsured </em>motorist coverage, that a one-year contractual limitations period, like the one at issue in <em>Colvin, </em>is unenforceable in certain limited circumstances. See <em>Dougherty v. Colonial Ins. Co. of California </em>(Aug. 31, 1992), Stark App. No. CA-8753, unreported, 1992 WL 238479. In this regard, we, too, have strained to avoid the impact of <em>Colvin </em>under circumstances where <em>Colvin </em>would seemingly compel a conclusion perceived by us to be unfair. See, <em>e.g., Kraly v. Vannewkirk </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 627, 635 N.E.2d 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">To enforce our pronouncements of the law, courts must rely to a large extent upon the strength and reasoning of our opinions and judgments. Obviously, we have no army or police force at our disposal to enforce our pronouncements. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>clear to us that <em>Colvin </em>has been viewed as unfair and that, where possible, the rule in <em>Colvin </em>has been avoided. <em>Colvin </em>has been riddled with exceptions and distinguished to death. The time has come for its judicial burial.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">R.C. 3937.18(A) mandates that uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage must be offered when a policy of automobile or motor vehicle liability insurance is delivered or issued for delivery in this state with respect to any motor vehicle registered or principally garaged in Ohio. In considering a former version of this statute, and the requirement of offering uninsured motorist coverage, this court said in <em>Bartlett v. Natiomuide Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1973), 33 Ohio St.2d 50, 52, 62 O.O.2d 406, 408, 294 N.E.2d 665, 666, that \u201cthe legislative purpose in creating compulsory uninsured motorist coverage was to place the injured policyholder in the same position, with regard to the recovery of damages, that he would have been in if the tortfeasor had possessed liability insurance.\u201d Further, as we recognized in <em>State Farm Auto. Ins. Co. v. Alexander </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 397, 400, 583 N.E.2d 309, 312, the intent of R.C. 3937.18 is (1) to provide <em>uninsured </em>motorist coverage for injured persons <em>who have a legal came of action </em>against a tortfeasor but who are uncompensated for their injuries because the tortfeasor lacks liability insurance, and (2) to provide underinsured motorist coverage for injured persons who have a legal cause of action against the tortfeasor but who are undercompensated for their injuries because the tortfeasor\u2019s liability coverage is insufficient to provide full compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">The policy provision at issue in this case, like the provision at issue in <em>Colvin, supra, </em>limits the insured to a period of one year to demand arbitration and/or file suit against the insurer for payment of uninsured motorist benefits. Failure to satisfy this deadline results in the loss of coverage and precludes any legal action whatsoever against the insurance carrier for payment of uninsured motorist benefits. Such a provision is contrary to the purposes of R.C. 3937.18. In Ohio, the statute of limitations for bodily injury actions is two years. R.C. 2305.10. Thus, appellants, who apparently claim to have suffered bodily injury as a result of the accident, were entitled to a statutory two-year period to commence an action for bodily injury against the tortfeasor. Conversely, the time-limitation provision in appellants\u2019 policy provided a lesser period of time for appellants to initiate an action or proceeding against appellee to recover benefits for the injuries they suffered at the hands of the tortfeasor. As a result of the policy provision, appellants were not placed in the same position, with regard to the recovery of damages, that they would have enjoyed had the tortfeasor been insured. As a practical matter, the effect of the policy provision was to deprive appellants of the coverage required by R.C. 3937.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">In <em>Alexander, supra, </em>syllabus, we held that: \u201cAn automobile insurance policy may not eliminate or reduce uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>required by R.C. 3937.18, to persons injured in a motor vehicle accident, where the claim or claims of such persons arise from causes of action that are recognized by Ohio tort law.\u201d Contrary to <em>Alexander </em>and the purposes of R.C. 3937.18, that is precisely what the time-limitation provision in the policy issued by appellee sought to do. Accordingly, the provision must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">We recognize that an action by an insured against an insurance carrier for payment of uninsured or underinsured motorist benefits is a cause of action sounding in contract. The statute of limitations for an action upon a written contract is fifteen years. See R.C. 2305.06. We are also aware, and are in agreement with, the principle recognized in <em>Colvin, supra, </em>69 Ohio St.2d at 295, 23 O.O.3d at 282, 432 N.E.2d at 169, that, \u201c[generally, in the absence of a controlling statute to the contrary, a provision in a contract may validly limit, as between the parties, the time for bringing an action on such contract to a period less than that prescribed in a general statute of limitations provided that the shorter period shall be a reasonable one.\u201d However, the contractual limitations period in the case at bar violates the public policy embodied in R.C. 3937.18 because it purports to dilute or eliminate the rights of the insured to coverage required by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">The purposes of uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage are similar. Our determination with respect to the validity of a contractual time-limitation provision for uninsured motorist coverage applies with equal force to the validity of a limitations provision affecting underinsured motorist coverage. Whether a case involves uninsured or underinsured coverage, the central question concerning the validity of a contractual period of limitations remains the same: Does the public policy embodied in R.C. 3937.18 prohibit provisions in an insurance contract which limit the period within which an insured must initiate an action or proceeding for payment of uninsured or underinsured motorist benefits to a period of one year? We answer this question in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">Accordingly, we hold that a provision in a policy for uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage which precludes the insured from commencing any action or proceeding against the insurance carrier for payment of uninsured or underinsured motorist benefits, unless the insured has demanded arbitration and/or commenced suit within one year from the date of the accident, is void as against public policy. Therefore, to the extent that they conflict with this holding, <em>Colvin, supra, </em>69 Ohio St.2d 293, 23 O.O.3d 281, 432 N.E.2d 167, and <em>Duriak v. Globe Am. Cas. Co. </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 70, 28 OBR 168, 502 N.E.2d 620 (applying and reaffirming <em>Colvin), </em>are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">Finally, we do not suggest that time-limitation provisions of the type at issue in this case are altogether prohibited. Consistent with our analysis, a <em>two-year </em>period, such as that provided for bodily injury actions in R.C. 2305.10, would be a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>reasonable and appropriate period of time for an insured who has suffered bodily injuries to commence an action or proceeding for payment of benefits under the uninsured or underinsured motorist provisions of an insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals regarding the validity of the contractual time-limitations provision of the policy. We remand this cause to the trial court to reinstate appellants\u2019 action for payment of uninsured motorist benefits and for further proceedings on that claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b811-6\">A.W. Sweeney, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b811-7\">Moyer, C.J., and Wright, J., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b811-10\">. Appellants have raised a number of other issues in this appeal. However, without further comment, we do not disturb the findings of the trial court or court of appeals on any of these matters, including the trial court\u2019s and court of appeals\u2019 determination that appellee was entitled to summary judgment on appellants\u2019 cause of action for the tort of bad faith.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b811-8\">Wright, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AQB\">dissenting. Judicial decisions are theoretically keyed to ideas and, in cases having little precedent, are creative in character. And although constraints on the process <em>do </em>exist, our system is such that these constraints are largely internal in nature, <em>ie., </em>they <em>are </em>enforced chiefly by self-restraint. Thus, I believe it is a given that the reasoning contained in our opinions is the only way to lend legitimacy to the results. We must be accountable to the public and to interested parties, and when courts exceed the boundary of justification by a lack of reasoning, legitimacy goes out the window. Thus, where a court rules seemingly from the heart, ignoring precedent and indulging in \u201creasoning\u201d skewed toward a desired result as opposed to applying the prevailing law to the facts at hand, legitimacy is lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">I must say that there is a certain amount of irony in the stated rationale for \u201crevisiting\u201d <em>Colvin v. Globe Am. Cas. Co. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 293,23 O.O.3d 281, 432 N.E.2d 167. Aside from citing sundry appellate court decisions distinguishing <em>Colvin, </em>the majority simply states that \u201c[i]t is clear to us that <em>Colvin </em>has been viewed as unfair * * *.\u201d The majority echoes one of the founders of our country, Alexander Hamilton,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by stating that \u201ccourts must rely to a large extent upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>strength and reasoning of our opinions\u201d for enforcement of our pronouncements, as \u201cwe have no army or police force at our disposal.\u201d I quite agree with this thesis, but the specter of barbarians at the gate in this context is a tad overdone.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">My fundamental objection to the majority opinion is the total absence of \u201creasoning\u201d underlying its destruction of a simple, unambiguous contractual limitation running between an insurer and its insured. I suppose \u201cunfairness\u201d lies in the eyes of the beholder, but it is worth noting that there is no hint of fraud or misrepresentation in the present case. I also note that we have repeatedly upheld statutes of limitations as short as one year or even six months. The question asks itself: Why there and not here?</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">I suggest that all this talk of unfairness has no real validity. When one cuts to the bone, what emerges here is a simple case of negligence by one of the parties and a misguided effort by this court to ameliorate the effects of that error.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">For the record, I would reiterate the solid reasoning contained in <em>Colvin, </em>where we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-7\">\u201cThis court has previously stated that the legal basis for recovery under the uninsured motorist coverage of an insurance policy is contract and not tort. <em>Motorists Mutl. Ins. Co. v. Tomanski </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St.2d 222 [223, 56 Q.0.2d 133, 134, 271 N.E.2d 924, 925].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-8\">\u00ab * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-9\">\u201cGenerally, in the absence of a controlling statute to the contrary, a provision in a contract may validly limit, as between the parties, the time for bringing an action on such contract to a period less than that prescribed in a general statute of limitations provided that the shorter period shall be a reasonable one. <em>United Commercial Travelers v. Wolfe </em>(1947), 331 U.S. 586, 608 [67 S.Ct. 1355, 1365, 91 L.Ed.2d 1687, 1695].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-10\"><em>it </em>* * Jfc</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-11\">\u201cR.C. 3937.18, the statute providing for the mandatory offering of uninsured motorist coverage, has no statute of limitations, nor does it make reference to any prescribed statute of limitations. Therefore, again it may be reasonably concluded that the time within which to bring an action on the policy may be provided within the instrument, if the time provision is clear, unambiguous, and a reasonable period. Here, the contract of insurance is unambiguous in its terms relating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>to the period within which an action must be brought against the company on the uninsured motorist provisions of the policy, and that is clearly one year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Our conclusion in <em>Colvin </em>bears repeating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-6\">\u201cAlthough this case and its fact situation may present some degree of hardship, we cannot say as a general rule that a period of one year provided by the insurance contract entered into by the parties is an unreasonable period of time within which to bring an action against the company on the uninsured motorist provision of the policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-7\">\u2018We therefore conclude that such a time limitation as contained within an uninsured motorist provision of the policy is neither in conflict with R.C. 2305.10, the two-year statute of limitations for bringing actions for personal injuries, nor in violation of the public policy as embodied in R.C. 3937.18, the statute requiring the offering of uninsured motorist insurance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">For the reasons noted above, I respectfully but vigorously dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b813-9\">Moyer, C.J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b811-11\">. \u2018Whoever attentively considers the different departments of power must perceive, that, in a government in which they are separated from each other, the judiciary, from the nature of its functions, will always be the least dangerous to the political rights of the Constitution; because it will be least in a capacity to annoy or injure them. The Executive not only dispenses the honors, but holds the sword of the community. The legislature not only commands the purse, but prescribes the rules by which the duties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>judiciary, on the contrary, has no influence over either the sword or the purse; no direction either of the strength or of the wealth of the society; and can take no active resolution whatever. It may truly be said to have neither FORCE nor WILL, but merely judgment; and must ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments.\u201d Hamilton, The Federalist No. 78.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
