This cause is pending before the court as an appeal from the Court of Appeals for Summit County. This court granted appellants\u2019 request for an extension of time to file a merit brief. Appellants\u2019 merit brief was due on June 30, 1994. It appears from the records of this court that appellants have not filed a merit brief in compliance with the Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court and therefore have failed to prosecute this cause with the requisite diligence. Upon consideration thereof,</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-25\">IT IS ORDERED by the court that this cause be, and hereby is, dismissed <em>sua sponte.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
