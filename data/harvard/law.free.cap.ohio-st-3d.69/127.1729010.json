See <em>State ex rel. Gay v. Mihm </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 315, 626 N.E.2d 666. The commission and employer seek reinstatement of the commission\u2019s order. For the reasons to follow, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">We find initially that the commission\u2019s order violates <em>Noll. </em>Claimant has a fairly low physical impairment and is relatively young \u2014 factors that militate against permanent total disability. The commission\u2019s order, however, also lists claimant\u2019s extremely limited education and unskilled work history as factors that purportedly support its decision. The commission\u2019s order does not explain how these factors combine to produce a claimant who can do other work. As the appellate court referee aptly observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-9\">\u201c[T]here is no language in the commission\u2019s order which constitutes an explanation within the meaning of <em>Noll </em>because there is no connection between the evidence listed and the ultimate conclusion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">Having found <em>Noll </em>noncompliance, we must determine whether to issue relief consistent with Noll or <em>Gay. </em>Given the pendency of claimant\u2019s motion for psychiatric allowance, we find the latter relief to be premature, since the commission may render a different decision if the psychiatric condition becomes an allowed part of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">We also note that, contrary to claimant\u2019s assertion, claimant\u2019s psychiatric condition, if denied, cannot be considered in a determination of claimant\u2019s entitlement to permanent total disability compensation. <em>State ex rel. Waddle v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 452, 619 N.E.2d 1018. Likewise, claimant\u2019s contention that his due-process rights were violated by a lack of written commission permanent total disability guidelines was previously rejected in State ex rel. <em>Blake v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 453, 605 N.E.2d 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-12\">The cause is therefore returned to the commission for resolution of claimant\u2019s motion for additional psychiatric allowance. Once that is determined, the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>mission is to reconsider claimant\u2019s application for permanent total disability compensation and issue an amended order that satisfies <em>Noll.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">The appellate court\u2019s judgment is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b316-7\">Moyer, C.J., A.W. Sweeney, Douglas, Wright, Resnick and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b316-8\">F.E. Sweeney, J., dissents and would reverse on authority of <em>State ex rel. Gay v.
