In addition, the board increased the sanction recommended by the panel because of \u201cthe calculated, deliberate manner in which Respondent conducted and concealed his fraudulent schemes, his gross abuse of a position of trust and responsibility for personal gain, the amount of the theft, the length of time over which the thefts occurred and a concern that Respondent\u2019s testimony, offered in mitigation and justification of the thefts, instead demonstrated a fundamental lack of appreciation for lawyers\u2019 ethical obligations to the profession and the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">We agree with this assessment of respondent\u2019s misconduct and that indefinite suspension is the appropriate sanction.
