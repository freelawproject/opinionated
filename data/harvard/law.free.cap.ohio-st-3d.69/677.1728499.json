Lindley </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 232, 234, 527 N.E.2d 828, 830, quoting <em>Kroger Grocery &amp; Baking Co. v.

No. 133 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-7\">\u201cExclusive recognition through a written contract, agreement, or memorandum of understanding by a public employer to an employee organization whether specifically stated or through tradition, custom, practice, election, or negotiation [that] the employee organization has been the only employee organization representing all employees in the unit is protected subject to the time restriction in division (B) of section 4117.05 of the Revised Code. <em>Notwithstanding any other provision of this act, an employee organization recognized as the exclusive representative shall be deemed certified until challenged by another employee organization under the provisions of this act and the State Employment Relations Board has certified an exclusive representative.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 140 Ohio Laws, Part I, 336, 367.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">The issue presented in this case is whether Ohio Adm.Code 4117-5-01(F) is in conflict with Section 4(A) of Am.Sub.S.B. No. 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">Section 4(A) expressly states that an employee organization\u2019s deemed certified status continues \u201cuntil challenged by another employee organization.\u201d SERB contends, and the court of appeals held, that this language does not preclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>SERB, in the absence of such a challenge, from changing the configuration of a bargaining unit that contains a combination of employees prohibited by R.C. 4117.06(D). SERB advances two arguments in support of this contention: (1) the \u201cseparate concept\u201d argument, and (2) the \u201cexception\u201d argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">In order to cogently discuss each of SERB\u2019S arguments, we must first set forth both arguments in full. The \u201cseparate concept\u201d argument was explained by the court of appeals as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-7\">\u201cThe concept of whether a bargaining unit includes the appropriate job classifications is a concept which is separate from the issue of certification. A challenge to the appropriateness of a bargaining unit does not necessarily threaten a representative\u2019s deemed certified status</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-8\">\u00ab * &gt;J: *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-9\">\u201c * * * Whether SERB segments the bargaining unit according to the prohibitions set forth in R.C. 4117.06(D)(2) or decides not to segment the bargaining unit, the representative\u2019s \u2018deemed certified\u2019 status is not affected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">The \u201cexception\u201d argument, on the other hand, begins with the premise that \u201cit is clear from the total statutory reference that the boundaries of exclusive representation are fixed <em>by the unit </em>in which pre-April 1, 1984 recognition occurred. Beyond this, the legislative command, expressed specifically in the relevant enactments, requires that the \u2018deemed certified\u2019 recognition acquired before April 1, 1984, continue indefinitely unless displaced. Displacement, according to the Act, occurs when an incumbent employee organization is successfully \u2018challenged\u2019 by a rival employee organization with consequent [SERB] certification.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>In re Univ. of Cincinnati (Univ. Hosp.), supra, </em>SERB 85-022, at 122. The argument continues, however, that \u201c[t]here is one exception to this principle. That exception is operative when the unit in question combined classifications before April 1,1984, which could not have been joined after that date. * * * [I]t is hardly conceivable that the legislature intended to proscribe specific job combinations in the same unit (as it obviously did) and at the same time intended to allow those combinations to stand indefinitely simply because they were negotiated before the effective date of the Act.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b867-11\">The \u201cseparate concept\u201d argument erroneously presumes that it is only the union and not the preexisting bargaining units that are deemed certified by Section 4(A) of Am.Sub.S.B. No. 133. However, \u201c[w]hen enacted, the [Ohio Public Employees\u2019 Bargaining] Act contained special uncodified or temporary provisions that related to historical <em>units and </em>bargaining relationships. The effect, in part, of these provisions was to preserve the <em>units, </em>agreements, and bargaining structures that existed prior to April 1,1984 [the effective date of R.C. 4117.05 as enacted by the Act]. By operation of Section 4 of these temporary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>provisions, <em>existing units </em>were preserved in their original, pre-Act form, and public employers have been required to pursue bargaining relationships with the exclusive representatives of these units as if there had been a SERB-certified election and designation of bargaining agent.\u201d (Emphasis added; footnotes omitted.) Drucker, Collective Bargaining Law in Ohio, <em>supra, </em>at 233-234, Section 5.18(A). \u201cThe unions <em>and units </em>thus were referred to as having been \u2018grandfathered\u2019 into their certification rights * * (Emphasis added.) <em>Id </em>at 244, Section 6.02(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">Section 4 of Am.Sub.S.B. No. 133, therefore, was clearly \u201c \u2018designed to maintain the status quo in those public sector employer/employee collective bargaining relationships antedating April 1, 1984.\u2019 \u201d <em>State Emp. Relations Bd. v. Bedford Hts. </em>(1987), 41 Ohio App.3d 21, 23, 534 N.E.2d 115, 117, quoting <em>In re Bedford Hts. </em>(July 24, 1987), SERB 87-016, at 3-56. \u201cIt is clear from the emphasized language of Section 4 of the Act that the legislature intended that those <em>bargaining units </em>in existence on October 6,1983 [the effective date of Section 4], <em>would remain intact.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Univ. of Cincinnati, Univ. Hosp. v. State Emp. Relations Bd </em>(1988), 42 Ohio App.3d 78, 81, 536 N.E.2d 408, 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Further, the idea that under Section 4(A), the composition of a bargaining unit is a concept distinct from representative certification is akin to envisioning a wagon as a concept distinct from its wheels. \u201c[T]he appropriateness of the unit is an integral, interwoven, and indispensable element in selecting an exclusive representative. * * * The bargaining unit describes the \u2018physical geography of collective bargaining.\u201d Day, A Primer of Unit Design Under Ohio\u2019s Public Employees\u2019 Collective Bargaining Statute (1986), 11 U.Dayton L.Rev. 221, 222-223.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">Moreover, SERB\u2019S \u201cseparate concept\u201d argument directly conflicts with its \u201cexception\u201d argument embraced by Ohio Adm.Code 4117-5-01(F). The exception argument assumes that \u201cthe boundaries of exclusive representation are fixed <em>by the unit </em>in which pre-April 1,1984 recognition occurred.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>In re Univ. of Cincinnati (Univ. Hosp.), supra, </em>SERB 85-022 at 122. Specifically, Ohio Adm.Code 4117-5-01(F) provides that what is being clarified or amended is \u201ca deemed certified <em>unit.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) It would be anomalous to uphold Ohio Adm.Code 4117-5-01(F) pursuant to a concept which it belies.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">SERB\u2019S \u201cexception\u201d argument is also faulty for three very simple reasons. The first reason is that Section 4(A) of Am.Sub.S.B. No. 133 contains no such exception. On the other hand, Section 4(D) of Am.Sub.S.B. No. 133 does contain the very exception that SERB seeks to have read into Section 4(A), but confines it to cases of previously granted <em>nonexclusive </em>recognition. Section 4(D) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>\u201cNonexclusive recognition previously granted through an agreement or memorandum of understanding shall not preclude the Board from: (1) determining an appropriate unit, (2) if necessary, removing classifications from a bargaining unit under an existing nonexclusive contract, agreement or memorandum of understanding, and (3) holding a recognition-certification election to determine an exclusive representative for all such employees deemed part of the appropriate unit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">As SERB itself has succinctly noted, \u201cSection 4(D) is concerned with nonexclusive representation and treats it differently from exclusive recognition. This is a distinction that obviously intends a difference between exclusive and nonexclusive.\u201d <em>In re Bedford Hts. </em>(July 24, 1987), SERB 87-016 at 3-56, fn. 6.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">The second reason is that the principles of statutory construction preclude SERB from interpreting an R.C. 4117.06(D) exception into Section 4(A) of Am.Sub.S.B. No. 133. Once it is determined, as it was in <em>In re Univ. of Cincinnati (Univ. Hosp.), supra, </em>SERB 85-022 at 122, that \u201cthe legislative command, expressed specifically in the relevant enactments requires that the \u2018deemed certified\u2019 recognition, acquired before April 1,1984, continue indefinitely unless * * * an incumbent employee organization is successfully \u2018challenged\u2019 by a rival employee organization with consequent [SERB] certification,\u201d that is the end of the matter. There can be no further interpretation. \u201c \u2018The first general maxim of interpretation * * * \u2019 is, that it is not allowable to interpret what has no need of interpretation.\u201d <em>Lawler v. Burt </em>(1857), 7 Ohio St. 340, 350. \u201cIt is a cardinal rule of statutory construction that where the terms of a statute are clear and unambiguous, the statute should be applied without interpretation.\u201d <em>Win-gate v. Hordge </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 55, 58, 14 O.O.3d 212, 214, 396 N.E.2d 770, 772.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">The third reason is that Section 4(A)\u2019s provision for deemed certification operates \u201c[notwithstanding any other provision of this act.\u201d In <em>Univ. Hosp., Univ. of Cincinnati College of Medicine v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 339, 587 N.E.2d 835, the employer refused to negotiate with a deemed certified employee organization pending a determination by SERB that the employee organization was a valid bargaining unit. We explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-9\">\u201cThe appellate court further determined that, inasmuch as the officers were not public employees under R.C. 4117.01(C), they could not form an \u2018employee organization\u2019 as defined in R.C. 4117.01(D). This determination is erroneous. Section 4(A) specifically provides for the grandfathering of existing bargaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>representatives \u2018[Notwithstanding any other provision of this act.\u2019 Accordingly, reference to R.C. 4117.01(D) to determine what constitutes a preexisting employee organization is at odds with the plain language of Section 4(A).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 345, 587 N.E.2d at 840.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Similarly, reference to R.C. 4117.06(D) to determine what preexisting units are appropriate is at odds with the plain language of Section 4(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">Accordingly, we hold that Ohio Adm.Code 4117-5-01(F) is in clear conflict with Section 4(A) of Am.Sub.S.B. No. 133 and is, therefore, invalid. Whereas Ohio Adm.Code 4117-5-01(F) authorizes adjustments or alterations to deemed certified collective bargaining units absent a challenge by and subsequent certification of a rival employee organization, Section 4(A) forbids it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, SERB was without jurisdiction to hear the city\u2019s petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">In light of the foregoing, the decision of the court of appeals is reversed, and the judgment of the trial court is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">\n<em>Judgement reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b870-9\">A.W. Sweeney, Douglas, F.E. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b870-10\">Moyer, C.J., and Wright, J., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b869-10\">. This interplay between Sections 4(A) and 4(D) also makes it clear that the General Assembly did not subscribe to the \u201cseparate concept\u201d notion that Section 4(A) deems only exclusively recognized representatives, and not units, as certified. Otherwise, it would not have been necessary for the legislature to specifically provide for unit determinations involving nonexclusive recognition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b870-13\">. To foreclose any future arguments on this issue, we note that the hearing officer\u2019s determination that Section 4(A) applies only to \u201cthe period of time extending three years after April 1, 1984\u201d is erroneous. In order to reach such a conclusion, we would have to read the time restrictions of Section 4(A)\u2019s first sentence into its second sentence. However, the second sentence operates independently of the first. \u201cSubsection 4(A) [first sentence] has fixed the life expectancy of written agreements, contracts, or understandings resulting from such recognition at three years by incorporating the time limits of [R.C.] 4117.05(B). However, the time limit cuts down only the life of the contract bar defense.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) Day, A Primer of Unit Design Under Ohio\u2019s Public Employees\u2019 Collective Bargaining Statute, <em>supra, </em>11 U.Dayton L.Rev. at 226. The \u201ccontract bar\u201d operates to prohibit <em>all </em>challenges to an exclusive representative who is under written contract, for a period of three years. R.C. 4117.05(B). If we were to read this time restriction into the second sentence of Section 4(A), then the result would be that for three years, a union operating under contract is protected from all challenges <em>except </em>from a rival union. The result would be an anomaly \u2014 that which is given in one sentence of a statutory provision is taken away by the very next sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b870-11\">Moyer, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AJS\">dissenting. I respectfully dissent. Ohio Adm.Code 4117-5-01(F) does not conflict with Am.Sub.S.B. No. 133, Section 4(A), and is therefore valid. Consequently, the State Employment Relations Board (\u201cSERB\u201d) has final and exclusive authority to determine the composition of an exclusive bargaining unit and may exercise that power in the absence of a challenge by another employee organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-12\">R.C. 4117.06(A) provides that SERB \u201cshall decide in each case the unit appropriate for the purposes of collective bargaining. The determination is final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>and conclusive and not appealable to the court.\u201d The intention of the General Assembly is clearly stated in the law. No right of appeal pursuant to R.C. 119.12 exists for such determinations. <em>S. Community, Inc. v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 224, 527 N.E.2d 864.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">SERB promulgated Ohio Adm.Code 4117-5-01(F) to assist it in fulfilling the statutory mandate of R.C. 4117.06(A). It is well established that an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute, and regulations enacted pursuant thereto, is entitled to \u201cconsiderable deference.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Celebrezze v. Natl. Lime &amp; Stone Co. </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 377,386, 627 N.E.2d 538, 545 (Resnick, J., dissenting). This court will not invalidate an administrative regulation unless it is unreasonable or in clear conflict with a statute. <em>Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Lindley </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 232, 234, 527 N.E.2d 828, 830, quoting <em>Kroger Grocery &amp; Baking Co. v. Glander </em>(1948), 149 Ohio St. 120,125, 36 O.O. 471, 474, 77 N.E.2d 921, 924.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">Ohio Adm.Code 4117-5-01(E) allows SERB to perform its statutory duty by clarifying or amending the composition of a collective bargaining unit if it \u201ccontains a combination of employees prohibited by division (D) of Section 4117.06 of the Revised Code.\u201d R.C. 4117.06(D)(2) prohibits SERB from approving a unit that includes \u201cany public employee employed as a guard to enforce against other employees rules to protect property of the employer or to protect the safety of persons on the employer\u2019s premises in a unit with other employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">It is agreed that the unit in question contains such prohibited members; the sole question is the effect of Am.Sub.S.B. No. 133, Section 4(A) on the power of SERB to remedy this violation in the absence of a challenge from a rival employee organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">The majority has concluded that Section 4(A) not only protects the status of the deemed certified employee organization, but also \u201cgrandfathers\u201d any unit, intact, in the exact form in which it existed prior to the Act\u2019s passage. The majority asserts that the concepts of certified status and composition of a unit are so inextricably bound as to be like a wagon and its wheels. To remove any member of a unit, in other words, is tantamount to disabling the unit and changing its very nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">This argument suffers from two faults. The first is that the concepts of certified status and unit composition are not inextricably connected. They are not akin to a wagon and its wheels but, rather, to a wagon and its contents. Removing an item from the wagon does not alter the fact that it is still a wagon.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-11\">The second fault is that the language of Section 4(A) does not support the majority\u2019s interpretation. The section states in part that <em>\u201can employee organizar tion </em>recognized as the exclusive representative <em>shall be deemed certified </em>until challenged by another employee organization * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>Act, by its explicit language, protects only certification of the exclusive representative (in this case AFSCME), not composition of the bargaining unit. Consequently, SERB may not decertify an employee organization in the absence of a challenge by a rival employee organization. Its directive in this case did not do so. It merely removed the improper class of unit members and certified that class as an independent unit with AFSCME as the exclusive representative. The original unit and its representative thus emerged intact, and AFSCME retained its status as the exclusive representative of the newly created unit of guards. The status quo was maintained to the extent that Am.Sub.S.B. No. 133, Section 4(A) requires, and, additionally, the SERB directive brought the units into compliance with R.C. 4117.06(D). In my view, this is the logical and proper result intended by the General Assembly. For this reason, and because the trial court lacked jurisdiction to review a SERB determination of the composition of a bargaining unit, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b872-4\">Wright, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
