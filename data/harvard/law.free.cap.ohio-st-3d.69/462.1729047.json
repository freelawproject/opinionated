The commissioner contends that the BTA erred in excepting the eleven motor vehicles from tax, while Columbia says the BTA erred in not excepting another fifty-nine vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">R.C. 5739.01(E), as pertinent, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-6\">\u201c \u2018Retail sale\u2019 and \u2018sales at retail\u2019 include all sales except those in which the purpose of the consumer is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">U * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">\u201c(2) To * * * use or consume the thing transferred * * * directly in the rendition of a public utility service * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">R.C. 5739.0KP) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-10\">\u201c \u2018Used directly in the rendition of a public utility service\u2019 means * * * used in the repair and maintenance of the production, transmission, transportation or distribution system, including only such motor vehicles as are specially designed and equipped for such use.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-11\"><em>E. Ohio Gas Co. v. Limbach </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 363, at 365, 575 N.E.2d 132, at 134, sets forth the test for exception of motor vehicles used in the rendition of public utility services under R.C. 5739.01(E) and 5739.01(P):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-12\">\u201cThe statute requires that the motor vehicles, to be excepted from taxation, be <em>both </em>specially equipped and specially designed. Nothing in the statute requires, however, that the motor vehicles be specially equipped and designed <em>by the vendor. </em>Thus, the purchaser is entitled to make the modifications.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-13\">The BTA is responsible for determining questions of fact, and unless the determination is unreasonable or unlawful, it must be affirmed by this court upon review. <em>SFZ Transp., Inc. v. Limbach </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 602, 604, 613 N.E.2d 1037, 1039. As to this issue, we agree with the BTA\u2019s analysis of the evidence and find its decision is reasonable and lawful. Therefore, it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b650-15\">As to the advertising issue, the decision of the BTA is unreasonable and unlawful and the cause is remanded to the BTA for reconsideration in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-16\">Columbia claims the advertising services purchases were purchases of nontaxable personal services. The BTA found some separately invoiced services to be excepted and found that \u201c[t]he remaining charges all involve an element of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>tangible personal property, being transferred, incapable of distinction or separation for value purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\"><em>Emery Industries, Inc. v. Limbach </em>(1989), 43 Ohio St.3d 134, 539 N.E.2d 608, is dispositive of the advertising issue and the BTA\u2019s failure to apply the appropriate test from <em>Emery </em>is unreasonable and unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">The record discloses that the purchases in question involved an element of tangible personal property. Such transactions may be taxed. <em>Id., </em>paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Paragraph four of the syllabus of <em>Emery, </em>states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-7\">\u201cIn a professional, insurance, or personal service transaction in which the charge for the services is not separated from the charge for the property, if the overriding purpose of the purchaser is to obtain tangible personal property produced by the service, the transfer of the property is a consequential element of the transaction and the entire transaction is taxable. If the purchaser\u2019s overriding purpose is to receive the service, the transfer of the personal property is an inconsequential element of the transaction, and the entire transaction is not taxable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">The BTA did not determine whether the transfer of personal property by LS &amp; Y was a consequential element of the advertising purchases by Columbia. The failure of the BTA to decide this question is unreasonable and unlawful, and the decision as to this issue is reversed and the cause is remanded to the BTA for further consideration in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">As to the penalty issue, the BTA\u2019s decision affirming the commissioner\u2019s refusal to reduce the statutory penalty below five percent was neither unreasonable nor unlawful, and it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">We said in <em>Jennings &amp; Churella Constr. Co. v. Lindley </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 67, 70-71, 10 OBR 357, 359-360, 461 N.E.2d 897, 900:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-12\">\u201cR.C. 5739.13 mandates the imposition of a penalty in the event of an assessment. Remission of the penalty is discretionary. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-13\">\u201cAppellate review of this discretionary power is limited to a determination of whether an <em>abuse </em>has occurred. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-14\">\u201c * * * R.C. 5739.13 places no constraints on the <em>degree </em>of the remission permitted. Rather, the Tax Commissioner has full discretion to partially remit any statutory penalty assessed under R.C. 5739.13.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>The decision of the BTA is affirmed in part, reversed in part, and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">\n<em>Decision affirmed in part, reversed in part, and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b652-6\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
