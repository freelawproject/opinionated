McMonagle </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 28, 29, 6 OBR 50, 51, 451 N.E.2d 225, 226.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">Continuing contracts of employment, <em>i.e., </em>tenure, for teachers are provided for in R.C. 3319.11. <em>State ex rel. Kelley v. Clearcreek Local School Dist. Bd. ofEdn. </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 93, 94, 556 N.E.2d 173, 174-175; <em>State ex rel. Specht v. Painesville Twp. Local School Dist.

Teachers who are eligible for continuing contract service status in a school district include certified teachers who within the last five years have taught for at least three years in the district. R.C. 3319.11(B). Teacher tenure Acts protect qualified teachers by preventing their arbitrary dismissal; however, these acts omit administrators from coverage because administrators generally exercise executive and discretionary power in addition to holding professional qualifications as a teacher. <em>State ex rel. Smith v. Etheridge </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 501, 506-507, 605 N.E.2d 59, 63-64; see, also, <em>State ex rel. Saltsman v. Burton </em>(1950), 154 Ohio St. 262, 43 O.O. 136, 95 N.E.2d 377. Therefore, contracts of \u201cother administrators\u201d are always limited contracts. See <em>Bennett v. Lorain Cty. Bd. ofEdn. </em>(1985), 23 Ohio App.3d 136, 23 OBR 248, 491 N.E.2d 742 (applying the holding to school psychologists).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Pursuant to R.C. 3319.09(A), the term \u201cteacher\u201d includes \u201call persons certified to teach and who are employed in the public schools of this state as instructors, principals, supervisors, superintendents, or in any other educational position for which the state board of education requires certification including persons having a certificate issued pursuant to sections 3319.22 to 3319.31, inclusive, of the Revised Code and employed in an educational position * * *.\u201d As noted by the court of appeals, under the foregoing definition, even school administrators are teachers. However, for purposes of the continuing contract eligibility requirements for administrators, supervisors, and special teachers, R.C. 3319.02(A) defines the term \u201cother administrator\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number><em>\u201cAs </em>used in this section, <em>\u2018other administrator\u2019 means any employee in a position for which a board of education requires a certificate of the type described by division (I), (M), or (0) of section 3319.22 of the Revised Code, provided that an employee required to have the type of certificate described by division (M) of such section spends less than fifty per cent of his time teaching or working with students, </em>or any other employee, except the superintendent, whose job duties enable him to be considered as either a \u2018supervisor\u2019 or a \u2018management level employee,\u2019 as defined in section 4117.01 of the Revised Code.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">R.C. 3319.22(M) provides that teachers\u2019 certificates may be issued for \u201c[p]upilpersonnel workers, including school psychologists * * Appellant was required to have a certificate of the type described in R.C. 3319.22(M) for school psychologists. Therefore, for purposes of being eligible for tenure, it is clear that a school psychologist would not be a teacher but an \u201cother administrator\u201d if the school psychologist spent less than fifty percent of the time teaching or \u201cworking with students.\u201d R.C. 3319.02(A); see, generally, Baker <em>&amp; </em>Carey, 1993-94 Handbook of Ohio School Law (1993) 264, Section T 7.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Appellant\u2019s first, second, and part of her third propositions of law assert that the court of appeals erred in interpreting the phrase \u201cworking with students\u201d to require the presence of students when the work activity is performed. In construing a statute, a court\u2019s paramount concern is the legislative intent in enacting the statute. <em>State v. S.R. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 590, 594, 589 N.E.2d 1319, 1323. In determining legislative intent, the court first looks to the language in the statute and the purpose to be accomplished. <em>Id. </em>at 594-595, 589 N.E.2d at 1323. Words used in a statute must be taken in their usual, normal or customary meaning. <em>Id. </em>at 595, 589 N.E.2d at 1323. See R.C. 1.42.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">As the court of appeals determined, if \u201cworking with students\u201d were construed as broadly as appellant desires, <em>ie., </em>to include any time spent on an activity which assists or benefits a student regardless of the student\u2019s presence during the activity, the fifty percent or more distinction would be rendered virtually meaningless, since, as appellant admitted in her testimony, the activities of all school employees are ostensibly for the benefit of a student or a group of students. In effect, the limiting preposition \u201cwith\u201d would be replaced with the words \u201cin the interest of.\u201d Consequently, appellant\u2019s interpretation of R.C. 3319.02(A) would be contrary to the statute\u2019s plain and unambiguous language. See, also, R.C. 1.47(C) (presumption against any construction that would produce an unreasonable or unjust consequence); <em>State v. Arnold </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 175, 178, 573 N.E.2d 1079, 1082 (cardinal rule of statutory construction that a statute shall be construed, if practicable, as to give some effect to every part of it). Moreover, although R.C. 3319.02(A) is a remedial statute required to be liberally construed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>in favor of administrators and teachers, see, <em>e.g., Smith, supra, </em>at syllabus, the issue here is whether appellant is an administrator or a teacher. The court of appeals correctly determined that the R.C. 3319.02(A) phrase \u201cworking with students\u201d requires the presence of the student(s) when the activity is performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">The court of appeals further concluded that appellant failed to establish that she spent fifty percent or more of her time working with students in her physical presence. Although appellant claims that there was no evidence that she spent less than fifty percent of her time working with students, it is <em>her </em>burden to prove a clear legal right to mandamus relief. <em>State ex rel. Ellis v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 64, 65, 559 N.E.2d 454, 455. Prufer\u2019s testimony indicated that appellant\u2019s work activities included only a small percentage of time in the presence of students. Appellant did not testify that fifty percent or more of her time at work was spent in the physical presence of students. Therefore, sufficient evidence supports the court\u2019s finding. Appellant\u2019s first, second, and the first portion of her third propositions of law are thus meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Appellant additionally asserts in her third proposition of law that the court of appeals erred when it found that the CS-1 reports prepared and filed by appellee list personnel by the type of certificate held and not by their position, and that these state funding requests and reports conclusively established that appellant spent fifty percent or more of her time working with students. Initially, it should be noted that appellant did not object below to the referee\u2019s finding that the CS-1 reports submitted to the State Department of Education, in which appellee reported appellant as being employed as a school psychologist rather than as a director or supervisor, listed \u201cemployees by the type of certificate held rather than by position held.\u201d On appeal, a party may not assign as error the court\u2019s adoption of. a referee\u2019s finding of fact unless an objection to that finding is contained in that party\u2019s written objections to the referee\u2019s report. Civ.R. 53(E)(6); <em>Proctor v. Proctor </em>(1988), 48 Ohio App.3d 55, 548 N.E.2d 287; see, generally, McCormac, Ohio Civil Rules Practice (2 Ed.1992) 344, Section 12.32(E). Therefore, to the extent that the referee\u2019s finding may be considered to be factual, appellant waived any error. In this regard, Superintendent Raymond\u2019s testimony that the CS-1 report indicated type of certification rather than the title or responsibilities of the position supported the referee\u2019s finding and the court\u2019s adoption of that finding. An appellate court should not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court where some competent and credible evidence supports the trial court\u2019s factual findings. <em>Wisintainer v. Elcen Power Strut Co. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 352, 355, 617 N.E.2d 1136, 1138.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Moreover, to the extent that the referee\u2019s finding may be characterized as the resolution of a question of law which is not subject to the waiver set forth in Civ.R. 53(E)(6), see, <em>e.g., Hartt v. Munobe </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 3, 5-6, 615 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>N.E.2d 617, 620, citing <em>Normandy Place Assoc. v. Beyer </em>(1982), 2 Ohio St.3d 102, 2 OBR 653, 443 N.E.2d 161, paragraph one of the syllabus, appellant\u2019s actual duties, rather than any \u201ctitle\u201d filled out on forms, were the critical and conclusive evidence concerning the issue of her status.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">For similar reasons, appellant\u2019s remaining contention under her third proposition of law, that her contracts, denominated as teacher\u2019s contracts, and not specifying her administrative position and duties pursuant to R.C. 3319.02, were conclusive evidence that she was employed as a teacher rather than an administrator, is likewise meritless. As noted by the court of appeals, the fact that a valid contract was not executed would not void the parties\u2019 agreement, and R.C. 3319.02(A) does not specify the existence of a proper contract as a determinative factor in resolving whether a school employee is an \u201cother administrator.\u201d Even appellant admits, in her reply brief, that her status as either an administrator or a teacher must be \u201cdetermined by examining what she does * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Appellant in her fourth proposition of law asserts that she is entitled to a supplemental contract for her additional teaching duties. Where a school board has authorized compensation for duties performed in addition to a teacher\u2019s regular duties, R.C. 3319.08 mandates that the school board shall issue a supplemental limited contract to the teacher performing such additional duties. <em>Wolf v. Cuyahoga Falls City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 222, 556 N.E.2d 511, paragraph one of the syllabus. However, there is no statute authorizing a board of education to enter into supplemental contracts with nonteaching employees. <em>Hall v. Lakeview Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 380, 383, 588 N.E.2d 785, 788. Since the court of appeals correctly held that appellant was an administrator rather than a teacher, it had no legal duty to issue a supplemental contract for appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">In short, the court of appeals correctly found that appellant possessed no clear legal right to either a continuing or a supplemental contract and appellee possessed no corresponding clear legal duty to issue such contracts because appellant was an \u201cother administrator\u201d as provided in R.C. 3319.02(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b305-10\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
