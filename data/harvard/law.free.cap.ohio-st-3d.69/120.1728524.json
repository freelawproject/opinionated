Gay v. Mihm </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 315, 626 N.E.2d 666. We favor the first alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">As is increasingly the case, the commission\u2019s order combines vocational factors that are both favorable and unfavorable without explaining how these factors make claimant capable of sustained remunerative employment. For this reason, the commission\u2019s order does not comply with <em>Noll.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">The presence of disabling nonallowed medical conditions, however, makes this case unconducive to the relief granted pursuant to <em>Gay. </em>If claimant is indeed unable to work and that inability is due, not to his combined allowed medical and nonmedical factors, but to his heart condition, the commission\u2019s decision is appropriate. The commission\u2019s order, however, does not clearly indicate whether this is the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-12\">The possibility of a defensible commission order distinguishes this case from <em>Gay. </em>It is not one in which the commission\u2019s decision is so incapable of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>justification as to render futile a return of the cause to the commission for further consideration and explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Accordingly, the appellate court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b309-7\">Moyer, C.J., AW.
