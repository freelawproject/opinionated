Upon review, we affirm in full the appellate court\u2019s disposition of the first two. Its judgment as to the remaining question is upheld only in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Common to each challenge is the March 16,1990 staff hearing \u2014 either in terms of the proceeding itself or the order that it generated. As to the former, Superior\u2019s Brand contends that its pending motion for suspension of further activity in claimant\u2019s claim should have prevented the March 1990 hearing from going forward. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Certainly, it would have been preferable for the commission to have disposed of Superior\u2019s Brand\u2019s motion before the staff hearing. We do not, however, find that this failure was an abuse of discretion. Superior\u2019s Brand\u2019s motion was precipitated by claimant\u2019s failure to relinquish certain medical records, and we recognize Superior\u2019s Brand\u2019s frustration with claimant\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">Superior\u2019s Brand\u2019s argument, however, appears to be largely premised on its belief that had its motion been heard, the commission would have been required to suspend the claim, forcing claimant to surrender her records. However, Ohio Adm.Code 4121-3-12(B) states that in the event that a claimant fails to cooperate with his or her self-insured employer, the commission <em>\u201cmay </em>withhold action on the claim.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, suspension was not a given and Superior\u2019s Brand was not stripped of a right it otherwise would have possessed had its motion been decided first.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">We are equally unpersuaded by Superior\u2019s Brand\u2019s suggestion that the commission\u2019s failure to suspend the claim left it without any means to force claimant to relinquish her records. Superior\u2019s Brand could have asked the <em>commission </em>to demand the records. Had claimant still refused, the commission may have been more inclined to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">Finally, we find no merit to Superior\u2019s Brand\u2019s allegation of a constitutional violation. Superior\u2019s Brand maintains that the commission denied it due process by forcing it to address claimant\u2019s C85A without claimant\u2019s medical records. Superior\u2019s Brand\u2019s argument, however, ignores its own substantial contribution to its predicament.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">Claimant filed her C85A on August 19, 1988. Superior\u2019s Brand\u2019s first request for medical records was not made until approximately one year later. More important, Superior\u2019s Brand\u2019s preliminary request to claimant was not made until ten weeks <em>after </em>the regional board\u2019s hearing on the disputed C85A. Being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>unpersuaded that Superior\u2019s Brand\u2019s request could not have come in a more timely fashion, we find its argument unconvincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Superior\u2019s Brand\u2019s challenge to continued chiropractic treatment arose from Dr. Mark E. Weaver\u2019s March 19, 1987 report, which stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">\u201cI feel the claimant\u2019s present condition does not warrant further intensive chiropractic care. I recommend further treatment at a frequency of once every two weeks for two months and once a month for two months, with a progress report by [her] treating physician at that time. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">In response, Superior\u2019s Brand moved to halt further authorization for treatment. By the time the motion was heard, however, claimant had already received the treatment recommended by Dr. Weaver. Accordingly, the district hearing officer ordered payment for all treatment already rendered. In denying payment for further chiropractic treatment, the hearing officer stated that he had \u201ctaken the following evidence into <em>consideration:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">\u201cDr. Bille, claimant\u2019s physician\u2019s fee bills in file.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">\u201cDr. Weaver, state examiner\u2019s report of March 19, 1987.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-10\">The district hearing officer also explained:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-11\">\u201cNo further chiropractic treatments are authorized; as per Dr. Bille\u2019s fee bill dated 9-16-87, covering services from May 4, 1987 through August 11, 1987 inclusive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-12\">\u201cThe claimant has received the treatment recommended by Dr. Weaver in his March 19, 1987 report.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-13\">The order was administratively affirmed without comment. Upon examination, we find an evidentiary deficiency warranting further consideration and amendment under <em>Noll, supra. </em>The commission\u2019s explanation implies that chiropractic treatment was terminated pursuant to Dr. Bille\u2019s fee bill. That bill, however, says nothing about the necessity, or lack thereof, for additional treatment. Conversely, we cannot assume that it was actually Weaver\u2019s report that was relied on, since it is possible that the commission consulted the Weaver report on the question of past treatment only. Absent clarification of the basis for the denial of future treatment, our review can go no further. Accordingly, further explanation is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-14\">We turn finally to the issue that has generated both appeal and cross-appeal\u2014 the commission\u2019s declaration of overpayment. Claimant denies that an overpayment exists. Superior\u2019s Brand contests the date on which the overpayment was determined to have started. Only the latter challenge has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-15\">Claimant contests the commission\u2019s determination that she was gainfully employed while receiving temporary total compensation. Alternatively, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>maintains that her employment does not preclude temporary total compensation. Both arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The dispute over entitlement to temporary total disability compensation arises from claimant\u2019s involvement with two home distributorships \u2014 Queens-Way to Fashion, Inc. and Entourage International, Inc. Claimant\u2019s activities came to light in 1986 and 1987 when Superior\u2019s Brand \u2014 acting on employee tips \u2014 hired Niam Investigations to investigate claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Niam initially discovered that claimant had been a sales representative for Queens-Way since approximately mid-1985. A short time later, a Niam investigator responded to an Entourage ad in the local newspaper that listed claimant\u2019s phone number as the contact. Posing as a prospective recruit, the investigator contacted claimant and recorded the conversation. Claimant indicated that she was \u201cthe area director for the State of Ohio\u201d and had joined the enterprise \u201cover a year ago.\u201d Claimant alleged an income of about $10,000 a month. There was no mention of any participation in the business by her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">At an Entourage recruitment meeting only days later, an investigator reported that \u201cit was very visible that she [claimant] was in charge of the meeting (i.e. greeting all, entrance speech of main speakers, controls of the tape on the VCR, and concluding the meeting).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">The investigator also noted claimant\u2019s behavior in a telephone conversation a few days later:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-9\">\u201cMrs. Durant was not very receptive and from the onset of the conversation Mrs. Durant began to change her story. She stated the business was actually her husband\u2019s and that she simply talked to people who inquired. * * * Inv. # 419 believes that Mrs. Durant was changing her story because she feared she was being investigated. She was tripping over her words in an attempt to tie her husband into the Company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">Superior\u2019s Brand forwarded this information to the Industrial Commission\u2019s Investigation Division (\u201cICID\u201d). ICID initiated its own inquiry and interviewed claimant on October 22, 1987. Claimant told ICID that she joined Queens-Way before May 1985. Claimant stated that she did some paperwork, collected and returned orders and attended some Queens-Way parties. She further stated that she joined Entourage in 1985 or 1986, went to meetings and seminars, and did phone and promotion work. She denied any strenuous work activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">Queens-Way stated that \u201cCathy and Gary Durant, in the conduct of their own business, served as distributors of Queens-Way fashions in 1985 and 1986.\u201d IRS form 1099 from Queens-Way to the Durants reported $5,220.94 and $3,098.71 in \u201cMiscellaneous Income\u201d for those two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>A.R. Craig, Entourage\u2019s controller, listed claimant\u2019s 1985, 1986 and 1987 commissions as $184.80, $11,168 and $9,302.07, respectively. This letter made no reference to any involvement in Entourage operations by claimant\u2019s husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Claimant\u2019s 1040 tax forms contained other relevant information. For example, claimant and her husband in 1986 filed a \u201cSchedule C Profit or Loss for Business or Profession\u201d that listed the proprietor as \u201cCathy and Gary Durant at 50% each\u201d and described the business as \u201csales.\u201d Claimant also claimed business depreciation on a car. Percentage of business use was listed as 53.5 with annual business miles totalling 15,784. 1987 tax forms were much the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">ICID also obtained a copy of the 1988 publication \u201cScentiments\u201d which profiled claimant \u2014 by then the company\u2019s executive vice president \u2014 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-7\">\u201cCathy Durant began her career in network marketing just three short years ago. Little did she realize that first small sample kit would change her life so dramatically.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-8\">\u201cAfter working 16 years in a meat packing plant, Cathy was ready for <em>new goals, new challenges, </em>a way to improve her lifestyle and chart a new course. For the first 6 months, she worked the business part time to supplement income from her regular job. <em>Suddenly, circumstances changed! </em>Because of an on the job back injury, her \u2018good secure job\u2019 of 16 years was in jeopardy. No longer an asset to her company, she now became a liability with no future and no security.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-9\"><em>\u201cCrisis does </em>indeed <em>present opportunity! </em>The \u2018little part-time job\u2019 now became Cathy\u2019s full focus and she quickly seized the opportunity to learn, to grow personally, to gain in depth training, to share the opportunity and rise to the top as an area and national sales and recruiting leader. Dreams were beginning to come true and the vision was clear for the future.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">On February 3,1988, ICID issued its final report, which incorporated all of the above evidence, and concluded that claimant \u201cwas self employed as a sales representative, and received substantial commissions while concurrently receiving Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation benefits.\u201d Superior\u2019s Brand responded with its overpayment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">All of this evidence was cited by the staff hearing officers in support of their decision. Claimant asserts that the staff hearing order is fatally flawed, having listed the evidence therein as \u201creviewed and evaluated\u201d rather than \u201crelied on.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-12\">Claimant\u2019s argument rests on the important distinction between evidence which the commission \u201crelied on\u201d and that which it merely \u201cconsidered.\u201d As we have indicated since <em>State ex rel. Mitchell v. Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 481, 6 OBR 531, 453 N.E.2d 721, our evidentiary review is confined to the former. On two recent occasions, we returned orders to the commission for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>clarification and amendment because the commission had listed various doctors reports as \u201cconsidered\u201d instead of \u201crelied on.\u201d See <em>State ex rel. Gen. Am. Transp. Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 91, 551 N.E.2d 155, and <em>State ex rel. B.O.C. Group, Gen. Motors Corp. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 199, 569 N.E.2d 496.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\"><em>BOC </em>and <em>GATC, </em>however, are distinguishable. In both, the cited evidence was contradictory \u2014 while some of the physician\u2019s reports indicated that the claimant could return to her former position of employment, others concluded the opposite. This conflict made evidentiary review impossible. If we assumed that the commission had relied on Doctors A and B, the orders were indeed supported by some evidence. On the other hand, the order was unsupported if we assumed reliance on Doctors C and D. Thus, clarification of which reports were specifically relied on was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">In this case, the evidence described as \u201creviewed and evaluated\u201d does not conflict. None of the evidence supports claimant\u2019s allegation that she was uninvolved in Queens-Way or Entourage. To the contrary, the evidence indicates that claimant actively participated in both endeavors. The validity of the commission\u2019s decision does not, therefore, hinge on which piece of evidence it relied. Judicial review can be accomplished without further clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Claimant also accuses the commission of somehow violating her due process rights. Claimant\u2019s argument, however, is difficult to follow because it is premised on consideration of the \u201cICID private investigative report prepared by the employer.\u201d No such document exists. The employer prepared no report, and the ICID report and private investigative report \u2014 the Niam report \u2014 are two different things. Claimant also repeatedly refers to ICID reports, even though only one report was prepared.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">The alleged violation stems fi*om her claim that she \u201cwas not <em>formally </em>made aware that said reports were part of the record.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Again, it is unclear to what documents she is speaking and what \u201cformally made aware\u201d means. Claimant was contacted by ICID in October 1987. She thus knew at that time that she was being investigated and that a report would follow. Moreover, Superior\u2019s Brand certified on March 2, 1988 that it had sent a copy of its overpayment motion to claimant\u2019s counsel, and that motion specifically referred to the ICID report.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">We suspect that the claimant is alleging that she either did not receive a copy of the ICID report or, alternatively, original copies of the documents attached to the report. Claimant, however, does not dispute that she knew of the ICID report. She also does not dispute that the report was contained in her workers\u2019 compensation file and was available to her at any time during the ten months between Superior\u2019s Brand\u2019s motion and the district hearing. Thus, if claimant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>alleging that she had no opportunity to confront her accusers, her assertion is simply untrue. <em>At a minimum, </em>claimant had ten months in which to obtain rebuttal evidence or subpoena parties from Queens-Way and Entourage. That claimant chose not to examine the evidence to be used against her is a self-created obstacle.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Claimant\u2019s hearsay argument is equally untenable, since R.C. 4123.10 frees the commission from the usual common-law or statutory rules of evidence. See, also, <em>State ex rel. Roberts v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 1, 10 OBR 1, 460 N.E.2d 251. Claimant\u2019s evidentiary challenges to the commission order are accordingly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Claimant alternatively contends that temporary total compensation is not barred because (1) her earnings did not arise from full-time employment, and (2) she is a potential \u201codd lot\u201d employee. Both assertions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\"><em>State ex rel. Johnson v. Rawac Plating Co. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 599, 575 N.E.2d 837, destroys claimant\u2019s initial argument, holding that part-time work indeed precludes compensation for temporary total disability. Claimant\u2019s response that <em>Rawac </em>cannot be retroactively applied to destroy her right to temporary total disability compensation fails for two reasons. First, claimant never had a right to engage in gainful employment while drawing temporary total disability compensation. Contrary to her representation, <em>State ex rel. Nye v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 75, 22 OBR 91, 488 N.E.2d 867, never said that <em>only </em>full-time alternate employment barred temporary total disability compensation. It said only that full-time employment <em>did </em>bar temporary total disability compensation. Second, <em>Rawac </em>did not retroactively change substantive law. It simply interpreted law that had controlled since 1982 \u2014 the prohibition of <em>State ex rel. Ramirez v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 630, 23 O.O.3d 518, 433 N.E.2d 586, against concurrent wages and temporary total disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">The odd-lot doctrine raised in claimant\u2019s second argument has never been accepted or rejected in this state. Our only encounter with the theory was in <em>Nye, </em>a decision whose facts were held to be unconducive to consideration of the odd-lot doctrine. The same holds true here.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">The odd-lot concept is generally used to preserve the eligibility for total disability compensation of one who can theoretically do some work, but \u201cis so handicapped by a compensable injury that he will no longer be employed regularly in any well known branch of the competitive labor market and will require a specially-created job if he is to be steadily employed.\u201d <em>Ham v. Chrysler Corp. </em>(Del.1967), 231 A.2d 258, 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">The distinguishing feature of odd-lot employment is its \u201cirregularity and unpredictability.\u201d <em>Wendt v. North Dakota Workers\u2019 Comp. Bur. </em>(N.D.1991), 467 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>N.W.2d 720, 725. See, also, Larson, The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation (1992), Section 57.51(c). This alone makes the present claimant \u2014 and the nature of her employment \u2014 unlikely candidates for application of the odd-lot doctrine. While the <em>success </em>of her enterprises may be irregular and unpredictable, her ability to engage in the work itself is not. Claimant is her own boss and any incontinuity in the <em>work itself </em>is of claimant\u2019s making.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Claimant has also not established that she possesses the required degree of disability common to all odd-lot cases. She has not alleged that she is removed from all other employment save for home sales. Claimant alleges only that she cannot return to her former position of employment \u2014 a conclusion with which the commission disagrees. Odd-lot employment would be only the exception, not the rule, and is seen only in particularly egregious situations. As observed by the Montana Supreme Court in <em>Metzger v. Chemetron Corp. </em>(1984), 212 Mont. 351, 357, 687 P.2d 1033, 1036:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">\u201cThe [odd-lot] rule above is gleaned from cases involving, among others, a sixty-one-year-old claimant suffering severe mental deficiency, a previously injured illiterate diabetic, a forty-year-old laborer with one month of formal education, and a seventy-year-old arthritic laborer. * * * Claimant, here, is twenty-eight years old, enjoys high manual dexterity skills, above average intelligence and has gained experience in a variety of job settings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Likewise, the present claimant is forty-two years old with the business acumen to rise to an executive level of leadership in two ventures \u2014 Entourage and Scentsations. She is not the type of work-amenable claimant that the odd-lot exception is designed to assist.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">We thus find that, like <em>Nye, </em>the present case is not conducive to broader consideration of odd-lot doctrine and reject claimant\u2019s odd-lot defense. Accordingly, we find that the commission did not abuse its discretion in assessing an overpayment against claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">We turn last to Superior\u2019s Brand\u2019s objection to the date on which the overpayment was held to have started. Noting claimant\u2019s admission that she joined Queens-Way before her temporary total disability began, Superior\u2019s Brand argues that the commission abused its discretion in starting overpayment at October 31, 1985 instead of May 6, 1985 \u2014 the date temporary total disability compensation started. Superior\u2019s presents a persuasive argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">Contrary to the appellate referee\u2019s report, adopted by the court, it is not obvious why the district hearing officer selected October 31,1985 as the first date of overpayment. The order says only that claimant was \u201cearning substantial commissions through Queens Way Fashion and Entourage International from October 31, 1985.\u201d The referee theorized that October 31, 1985 corresponds to the date of claimant\u2019s written application to be a representative for Entourage, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>and a reference in an November 11, 1987 letter from Entourage\u2019s controller indicating that \u201ccommissions were initially paid to Miss Durant during November 1985, representing remuneration for October sales.\u201d The referee speculated that the district hearing officer chose this date because it was the first specific date to which remuneration could actually be documented.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The logic of the referee\u2019s reasoning falters when balanced against the facts as a whole. The total commissions for claimant\u2019s three months in 1985 with Entourage were $184.80. Conversely, claimant\u2019s 1985 commissions with Queens-Way were $5,220.94. If, as the referee states, there is no evidence of <em>any </em>remuneration prior to October 31, 1985, one must assume that claimant\u2019s entire $5,200 in Queens-Way commissions was also earned subsequent to October 1985. This leads to one of two conclusions \u2014 either claimant was an exemplary salesperson or claimant earned her $5,200 over a period exceeding three months. Because the latter alternative appears at least as plausible as that put forth by the referee, the commission\u2019s explanation for its decision is inadequate in this situation. We accordingly order the commission to amend its order with further explanation pursuant to <em>Noll.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">For the reasons given above, we hereby reverse that portion of the appellate judgment that upheld the overpayment start date, and remand the cause to the commission for further proceedings. The balance of the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed in part, affirmed in part and, cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b481-8\">AW.
