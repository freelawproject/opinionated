Claimant apparently seeks a writ of mandamus to compel a permanent total disability award consistent with our decisions in <em>State ex rel. Galion Mfg. Div., Dresser Industries, Inc. v. Haygood </em>(1991), 60 Ohio St.3d 38, 573 N.E.2d 60, or <em>State ex rel. Gay v. Mihm </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 315, 626 N.E.2d 666. The commission wants the order upheld. For the reasons to follow, the appellate court judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-12\">Central to claimant\u2019s position is the removal of Dr. Katz\u2019s report from evidentiary consideration. We initially reject claimant\u2019s assertion that the commission\u2019s reliance on Katz\u2019s report violated due process. Even if the report proves to be irreparably flawed, reliance on an evidentially deficient report is not a constitutional infringement. Claimant, moreover, had every opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>address any perceived flaw at the hearing. Having had this opportunity, no due-process violation occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">We also disagree with claimant\u2019s assertion that the length of Katz\u2019s medical examination renders his report inherently unreliable. This criticism essentially attacks the doctor\u2019s medical expertise and abilities \u2014 an inquiry we refuse to pursue.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Claimant also challenges Dr. Katz\u2019s understanding of claimant\u2019s job duties. A lack of awareness of previous duties is generally of little consequence in a permanent total determination, since the relevant issue is not the ability to return to the former job, but is instead claimant\u2019s capacity for any sustained remunerative work. In this case, however, recognition of previous duties is relevant, since the commission premised its decision on Katz\u2019s statement that claimant could resume his previous job. This, in turn, necessarily influenced the weight given to claimant\u2019s nonmedical disability factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">We find claimant\u2019s position to be unpersuasive. The commission forwarded a detailed job description to Katz. That the description was the employer\u2019s and not claimant\u2019s is immaterial, as both descriptions attest to the heavy nature of claimant\u2019s foundry job. Katz was, therefore, adequately apprised of claimant\u2019s former duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Claimant argues that the \u201cequivocal\u201d nature of Katz\u2019s report bars its consideration under <em>State ex rel. Paragon v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 72, 5 OBR 127, 448 N.E.2d 1372. We disagree with the characterization of Katz\u2019s report as \u201cequivocal.\u201d The disputed report by Dr. Cullin in <em>Paragon </em>alternately stated that claimant could and could not work. Katz, on the other hand, offers only one opinion on claimant\u2019s ability to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">Katz\u2019s report, however, while unequivocal, is so internally inconsistent that it cannot be \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting the commission\u2019s decision. Despite \u201cnormal\u201d physical findings, Katz assessed a high (fifty percent) degree of impairment. He then, however, concluded that claimant could perform heavy foundry labor. Being unable to reconcile these seeming contradictions, we find that the report is not \u201csome evidence\u201d on which to predicate a denial of permanent total disability compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">Contrary to claimant\u2019s suggestion, however, the removal of Katz\u2019s report from evidentiary consideration does not compel an award of permanent total disability compensation, since the only remaining medical evidence \u2014 Dr. Seltzer\u2019s report\u2014 is also severely flawed. Seltzer\u2019s opinion is grounded on a myriad of nonallowed conditions. His reference to the allowed condition is followed by references to \u201c[djegenerative arthritis of the hands, back, and legs. Chronic ulcers of the stomach and intestine\u201d \u2014 all nonallowed health problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Seltzer\u2019s opinion also improperly strays beyond the bounds of impairment into that of disability. His conclusion is expressly based, in part, on claimant\u2019s \u201cadditional history,\u201d which consists of Seltzer\u2019s discussion of claimant\u2019s nonmedical disability factors. Thus, like Dr. Katz\u2019s report, Seltzer\u2019s narrative lacks an opinion as to the amount of physical impairment alone that is attributable to claimant\u2019s allowed conditions. Relief consistent with <em>Haygood </em>or <em>Gay, supra, </em>is, therefore, inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Equally untenable is affirmation of the commission\u2019s order. While the flaws in Seltzer\u2019s report eliminate the possibility that such report <em>alone </em>could sustain a permanent total disability award, the report suggests the possibility of some degree of impairment attributable to the allowed conditions which could combine with claimant\u2019s nonmedical disability factors to produce permanent total disability. <em>State ex rel. LTV Steel Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 22, 599 N.E.2d 265, cannot, therefore, serve as a basis on which to uphold the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Moreover, even if the commission\u2019s order did reference medical evidence recognizing some degree of allowable impairment, its explanation as to how that impairment combined with claimant\u2019s nonmedical profile to produce an employable claimant falls short of <em>Noll, supra </em>Once again, the commission has failed to explain how the vocationally unfavorable factors that it cites support a conclusion that claimant can work. A return for further consideration and amended order is, therefore, appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">For the reasons cited above, the judgment of the appellate court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b636-9\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.

The facts in this case clearly indicate that there is a substantial likelihood that claimant is permanently and totally disabled. Pursuant to <em>State ex rel. Gay v. Mihm </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 315, 626 N.E.2d 666, benefits should be awarded. It serves no purpose to return this cause to the commission pursuant to <em>Noll.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b636-12\">Douglas and F.E.
