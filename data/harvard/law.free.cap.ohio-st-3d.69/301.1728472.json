Stark Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 290, 603 N.E.2d 981. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>The BTA did analyze the evidence and did set forth the reasons for its decision. The BTA reviewed Levine\u2019s evidence and the testimony of the county auditor\u2019s appraisers. The BTA found no explanation of how the board of revision had arrived at its valuation and no evidence to support it, but the BTA did focus on the question of \u201cwhether any other party established, by sufficient probative and competent evidence, that the value of the property is other than [that] established by the [board of revision].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The BTA\u2019s analysis continued with the correct observation that in the absence of a recent arm\u2019s-length sale, the true value in money of the subject property can be calculated by applying any of the three standard methods of appraisal. Levine compared fifteen recent sales he considered analogous to the subject property to develop a grid based on price per square foot, price per unit and gross rent multiplier. He then evaluated the comparables to determine \u201cwhere on the grid the subject property would fall,\u201d and from \u201cthese three indicators of value * * * selected a middle figure at $5.5 million [and] added $100,000 for a commercial building which is located on the property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Moreover, the BTA criticized the county auditor\u2019s appraisers because they were \u201cunaware that there were commercial enterprises on the first floor,\u201d did not obtain rental information about the separate commercial building, and used an income approach to value that considered only the apartments on the second through ninth floors.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">The BTA concluded that where an appellant has produced evidence sufficient to demonstrate that the property\u2019s value is different from that determined by the board of revision, \u201cit is incumbent upon the board of revision to rebut\u201d that evidence. The BTA found Levine\u2019s evidence \u201cto be the most credible and persuasive,\u201d because he \u201canchored his appraisal with actual marketplace transactions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Grandin House failed to sustain its burden of proving its right to a reduction in value by competent evidence. <em>Zindle v. Summit Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 202, 203, 542 N.E.2d 650, 651, and <em>Crow v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 55, 552 N.E.2d 892.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">The decision of the BTA is neither unreasonable nor unlawful and it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b489-11\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
