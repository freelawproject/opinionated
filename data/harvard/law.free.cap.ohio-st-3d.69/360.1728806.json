The success of claimant\u2019s application for permanent total disability compensation turned, therefore, on the commission\u2019s interpretation of nonmedical factors. In this case, the commission inherently concluded that the totality of claimant\u2019s nonmedical factors was vocationally favorable. Given our recent decision in <em>State ex rel. Gay v. Mihm </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 315, 626 N.E.2d 666, we find that the commission abused its discretion in so determining.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-13\">The commission cited three nonmedical factors in its 1991 order. Because claimant\u2019s age and education were seen as liabilities to successful retraining, the commission\u2019s decision rested exclusively on claimant\u2019s work history, which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>commission felt \u201creflected that] she retains the transferable skills to engage in sedentary job duties.\u201d This reasoning by the commission fails because claimant\u2019s work history has involved neither sedentary nor skilled labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">The commission looked to claimant\u2019s experience as a \u201cset up operator, farm worker, and assembly line operator,\u201d as examples of past skilled sedentary employment. However, the only evidence to address the nature of claimant\u2019s past work history characterized the positions as falling within the \u201clight exertion\u201d range of unskilled labor, according to Department of Labor guidelines. Claimant\u2019s work history, therefore, is not \u201csome evidence\u201d of a capacity for sedentary employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The lack of \u201csome evidence\u201d supporting a permanent total disability denial, however, does not automatically dictate its award. <em>State ex rel. Wilcox v. Ashtabula Cty. Hwy. Dept. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 190, 593 N.E.2d 1390. Traditionally, we have returned such matters to the commission for further consideration and amended order. Our decision in <em>Gay </em>\u2014 of which the appellate court did not have the benefit \u2014 now allows a reviewing court to issue a writ compelling a permanent total disability award in those limited situations where a return of the cause to the commission would serve no purpose, given the evidence of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The parallels between this case and <em>Gay </em>are striking, and persuade us that <em>Gay </em>should control. Both claimants; for example, were medically limited to sedentary work. Both were of advanced age and possessed a low level of education \u2014 Gay, 9th grade, Knox, 5th or 6th grade \u2014 with a work history devoid of any sedentary occupational experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">For these reasons, relief consistent with <em>Gay </em>is appropriate, dictating reversal of the decision of the court of appeals. The writ of mandamus is allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and writ allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b550-9\">Moyer, C.J., A.W. Sweeney, Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
