Limbach </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 121, 537 N.E.2d 1302, and <em>Alliance Towers, Ltd. v. Stark Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 16, 523 N.E.2d 826, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-7\">\u201cThe Board of Revision\u2019s determination of value of real property is presumptively correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-8\">The BTA has misinterpreted those cases. We have previously disabused the BTA regarding its conclusion that \u201c * * * \u2018the board [of revisiones finding of value is entitled to a presumption of validity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Springfield Local Bd. of Edn. v. Summit Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 493, 494, 628 N.E.2d 1365, 1366. In <em>Springfield Local, </em>we rejected the BTA\u2019s insistence that <em>R.R.Z. Assoc. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 198, 202, 527 N.E.2d 874, 878, and <em>Mentor Exempted Village Bd. of Edn. v. Lake Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 318, 319, 526 N.E.2d 64, 65, support this conclusion. Also, in <em>Springfield Local, </em>we deflected support for this conclusion from <em>Alliance Towers, Ltd., supra, stating </em>that that case \u201cdealt with the requirement that a board of revision \u2018perform its duty in good faith and in the exercise of sound judgment\u2019 [and that] * * * [t]he good faith and sound judgment questions in that case involved an administrative action, not a quasi-judicial valuation of the board of revision.\u201d <em>Springfield Local, </em>68 Ohio St.3d at 495, 628 N.E.2d at 1366-1367.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">Moreover, <em>Alcan Aluminum, supra, </em>does not establish the proposition attributed to it by the BTA. Rather, <em>Alcan Aluminum, </em>a franchise tax case, was concerned with the Tax Commissioner\u2019s finding that the involved property was physically located in Ohio. In <em>Alcan Aluminum, supra, </em>42 Ohio St.3d at 123, 537 N.E.2d at 1304, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-10\">\u201cAbsent a demonstration that the commissioner\u2019s findings are clearly unreasonable and unlawful, they are presumptively valid. Furthermore, it is error for the BTA to reverse the commissioner\u2019s determination when no competent and probative evidence is presented to show that the commissioner\u2019s determination is factually incorrect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>While a determination of the true value of real property by a board of revision is entitled to consideration by the BTA, such determination is not presumptively valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">As we have stated: \u201cThe Board of Tax Appeals is vested with wide discretion in determining the weight to be given to evidence and the credibility of witnesses * * *</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-7\">\u201cThe fair market value of property for tax purposes is a question of fact, the determination of which is primarily within the province of the taxing authorities, and this court will not disturb a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals with respect to such valuation unless it affirmatively appears from the record that such decision is unreasonable or unlawfid.\u201d <em>Cardinal Fed. S. &amp; L. Assn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1975), 44 Ohio St.2d 13, 73 O.O.2d 83, 336 N.E.2d 433, paragraphs three and four of the syllabus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">The BTA was correct in observing, as it did, that a taxpayer on appeal \u201cmay successfully challenge a determination of a Board of Revision only where the taxpayer produces competent and probative evidence to establish the correct value of the subject property.\u201d Here, the taxpayer did that. Amsdell presented evidence of an arm\u2019s-length transaction involving the purchase of the real property on which the facility was constructed, and evidence of the costs of renovation and construction of the improvements.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">The BTA found that Amsdell did not sustain his burden of proving that the decision of the board of revision was invalid. The BTA also found no appropriate support for Amsdell\u2019s evidence. Those findings are unreasonable and unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">Our holding in <em>Mentor Exempted Village Bd. of Edn. v. Lake Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 318, 319, 526 N.E.2d 64, 65, is pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-11\">\u201c * * * [The taxpayers] did not present any evidence to the BTA. Once the school board had presented evidence that the property\u2019s value was different from that determined by the board of revision, [the taxpayers] * * * should have rebutted the school board\u2019s evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-12\">In addition, Amsdell, as a principal owner, was competent to present testimony, including his opinion of the value of the real property. <em>Smith v. Padgett </em>(1991), 32 Ohio St.3d 344, 347-348, 513 N.E.2d 737, 740-741. That testimony, of course, is subject to the BTA\u2019s determination of the appropriate weight to be accorded it. <em>Smith, supra, </em>at 348, 513 N.E.2d at 741. The BTA, as the trier of fact, had the duty to evaluate and criticize an owner\u2019s testimony; it should not have rejected it completely. See <em>Tokles &amp; Son, Inc. v. Midwestern Indemn. Co. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 621, 605 N.E.2d 936, paragraph two of the syllabus. Amsdell, in addition to his testimony about the purchase of the land and the renovation of the facility, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>expressed his opinion, using the income approach to value, that the subject property was worth between $1,000,000 and $1,250,000 on January 1, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">The evidence before the BTA established that the true value of the subject property was no more than its acquisition and construction costs of $1,305,771. The BTA\u2019s failure to consider Amsdell\u2019s evidence, and its decision to affirm the board of revision, was unreasonable and unlawful. The decision of the BTA is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">\n<em>Decision reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b761-6\">Moyer, C.J., A.W. Sweeney, Wright, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b761-7\">Douglas, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b761-8\">Douglas, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Afq4\">dissenting. This case was submitted to this court on October 28, 1995. Not until March 23, 1994, did <em>we </em>decide <em>Springfield Local Bd. of Edn. v. Summit Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 493, 628 N.E.2d 1365. It is hardly fair to say that \u201c[w]e have previously disabused the BTA regarding its conclusion that \u2018 * * * \u201cthe board [of revisiones finding of value is entitled to a presumption of validity,\u201d \u2019 \u201d and then to cite, for that proposition, <em>Springfield </em>\u2014 a case that had not yet been decided by this court. Further, it is not unreasonable for the BTA to have reached, on this issue, the conclusion it did when the BTA had before it <em>Alcan Aluminum Corp. v. Limbach </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 121, 123, 537 N.E.2d 1302, 1304, where we said: \u201cAbsent a demonstration that the commissioner\u2019s findings are clearly unreasonable or unlawful, they are presumptively valid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">I also dissent on the merit finding of the majority. Time and again this court has said that: \u201cThe Board of Tax Appeals is not required to adopt the valuation fixed by any expert or witness * * * \u201d; \u201c[t]he Board of Tax Appeals is vested with wide discretion in determining the weight to be given to evidence and the credibility of witnesses which come before the board * * * and \u201c[t]he fair market value of property for tax purposes is a question of fact, the determination of which is primarily within the province of the taxing authorities, and this court will not disturb a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals with respect to such valuation unless it affirmatively appears from the record that such decision is unreasonable or unlawful. * * * \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Cardinal Fed. S. &amp; L. Assn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1975), 44 Ohio St.2d 13, 73 O.O.2d 83, 336 N.E.2d 433, paragraphs two, three and four of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">The majority says with regard to the owner\u2019s testimony that the BTA \u201c * * * should not have rejected it completely. * * * \u201d Just before that statement, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>majority concedes that the owner\u2019s \u201c * * * testimony, of course, is subject to the BTA\u2019s determination of the appropriate weight to be accorded it. * * * \u201d That is exactly what the BTA did. It heard the evidence, evaluated it and found it not to be persuasive. For doing that, we now say the BTA was wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">I would affirm the decision of the BTA. Because the majority decides otherwise, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
