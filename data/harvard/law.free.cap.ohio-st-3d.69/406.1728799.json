Gay v. Mihm </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 315, 626 N.E.2d 666. The commission objects to the appellate court\u2019s suggestion that claimant\u2019s nonallowed medical conditions must be factored into claimant\u2019s disability determination. Only the latter challenge has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">Preliminary to any discussion of <em>Gay\u2019s </em>applicability is a finding that the reasoning set forth in the commission\u2019s order falls short of <em>Noll, supra. </em>In this case, however, we cannot even reach the question of <em>Noll </em>sufficiency because of our inability to discern the basis for denial of permanent total disability compensation. On the one hand, the order suggests that the combination of claimant\u2019s allowed conditions and nonmedical factors did not prevent sustained remunerative employment. On the other hand, it also suggests that claimant may be permanently and totally disabled, but not as a result of the allowed medical conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">Clarification is crucial. If the commission\u2019s disability denial is premised on the latter and that conclusion is supported by \u201csome evidence,\u201d judicial inquiry ends. There is no need to delve into the sufficiency of the commission\u2019s nonmedical analysis where the inability to work is attributable exclusively to nonallowed conditions. <em>State ex rel. LTV Steel Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 22, 599 N.E.2d 265. However, if the first basis controls, <em>Noll </em>sufficiency becomes an issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-12\">Being unable to proceed to <em>Noll </em>review at this time, we find consideration of claimant\u2019s request for relief consistent with <em>Gay </em>to be premature. We, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>find that the appellate court properly ordered the commission to issue an amended order clarifying its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Accordingly, that portion of the appellate judgment ordering the commission to consider claimant\u2019s nonallowed medical condition is reversed. The balance of the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed in part and affirmed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b595-7\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
