In particular, respondent arranged for the appointment of Marie Henninger and for the signing of the consent judgment entry by her on behalf of the child. Therefore, we adopt the findings and fact and conclusions of law of the board. Nevertheless, we find the discipline recommended to be too severe under all the facts and circumstances of the case. We therefore reduce the discipline to a public reprimand.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-13\">Costs taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-14\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b660-15\">A.W.
