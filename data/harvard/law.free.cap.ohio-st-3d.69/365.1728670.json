In fact, respondent combined the two duties in this case, stating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>to relator that \u201c * * * I believe that the decision on whether to issue the subpoenas requested should be reserved until after both parties have had a full opportunity to present arguments on the necessity for such subpoenas. <em>I mil promptly issue subpoenas, if as a result of these arguments a need is demonstrated. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">As to protests, we have stated that we will not disturb the Secretary of State\u2019s or a board of elections\u2019 decision to place or remove a candidate or issue on or from the ballot absent \u201cfraud, corruption, abuse of discretion, or a clear disregard of statutes or applicable legal provisions * * <em>State ex rel. Beck v. Casey </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 79, 80, 554 N.E.2d 1284, 1285, citing <em>State ex rel. Senn v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 173, 175, 5 O.O.3d 381, 382, 367 N.E.2d 879, 880; <em>State ex rel. Ruehlmann v. Luken </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 1, 598 N.E.2d 1149; <em>State ex rel. White v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 5, 598 N.E.2d 1152.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">We have not addressed the Secretary of State\u2019s independent duty to investigate under R.C. 3501.05(N). However, in a somewhat analogous situation, we have stated that a prosecuting attorney will not be compelled to prosecute a complaint except when the failure to prosecute constitutes an abuse of discretion. <em>State ex rel. Murr v. Meyer </em>(1987), 34 Ohio St.3d 46, 516 N.E.2d 234. Thus, respondent\u2019s findings after a protest hearing and his independent duty to investigate under R.C. 3501.05(N) are both subject to mandamus, if there is an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Neither party has submitted a transcript of the protest hearing. However, from the complaint and the hearing officer\u2019s report, we find that relator presented the following evidence at the protest hearing:</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">1. The testimony of an investigator that he had interviewed ten or twelve persons, at least some of whom stated that McKelvey did not witness their signatures;</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">2. The investigator\u2019s opinion that McKelvey had not circulated the thirty-seven part-petitions he signed as circulator; and</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">3. Relator\u2019s testimony and affidavit that he had interviewed signers of petitions circulated by two persons other than McKelvey who informed him that those circulators did not personally witness their signatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">Relator did not support this evidence with direct testimony or affidavit of any signer of the petitions and, according to the hearing officer\u2019s report, even refused to disclose the identity of the persons who accused the two circulators other than McKelvey of not. having personally witnessed their signatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-12\">Respondent found the evidence submitted at the hearing insufficient to uphold the protest or to invoke his subpoena power in furtherance of an independent investigation. We find no abuse of discretion in this decision. Respondent has a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>duty under R.C. 3501.05(N) to investigate allegations of election fraud, and he did investigate relator\u2019s allegations through the protest hearing. His authority to issue subpoenas and other process under R.C. 3501.05 is discretionary, and he did not abuse that discretion by declining to use the authority after determining that relator\u2019s evidence lacked sufficient merit. Moreover, we find no fraud, corruption, or disregard of applicable law on which to otherwise reverse respondent\u2019s decision on relator\u2019s protest.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Additionally, after the hearing, relator sent to respondent further charges that McKelvey had committed election fraud concerning petition 2013. Relator\u2019s evidence in this instance was a tape recording, transcribed as Exhibit K filed with the complaint, made by a second investigator for relator, which elicits statements from some signers of the petition that McKelvey was not the circulator of the petition although he signed it as circulator. However, since the tape recording and transcript were not filed with respondent until March 29, 1994, they apparently played no part in respondent\u2019s findings concerning the protests.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">The record does not demonstrate that respondent has ever responded to this tape recording and transcript concerning petition 2013. However, we find that evidence of the same type as submitted at the hearing. While respondent has the authority to investigate based upon such evidence, we do not hold failure to do so an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">In his second proposition of law, relator states that fraud committed by a candidate/circulator invalidates the candidacy. Respondent takes the view that such fraud would eliminate only part-petitions on which the circulator\u2019s affidavit is fraudulently executed. However, having found that respondent committed no abuse of discretion or disregard of law by rejecting and not following up on relator\u2019s proffered evidence, we hold that what the proper sanction should be is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">Respondent also argues that the court should invoke the doctrine of laches because relator did not file the statutory protest until twelve days after McKelve/s declaration of candidacy and petition papers were filed and did not file this mandamus action until fourteen days after respondent\u2019s decision as to the protest. Respondent claims prejudice because the date to certify the ballot form, apparently March 4, 1994, and the date to provide absent voter, ballots, apparently March 29,1994, have passed. However, we decline to invoke laches, noting that the time required to both conduct the protest hearing and try this case would have exceeded these deadlines under the best of circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">For the reasons stated above, the writ of mandamus is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">\n<em>Writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b555-12\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
