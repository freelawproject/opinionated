Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936. Upon review, we find that the order is properly supported, and affirm the judgment of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-12\">Appellant\u2019s assault on the credibility of Dr. Loeb\u2019s report is unpersuasive. His opinion is neither equivocal nor improperly premised. Loeb made two distinct statements: (1) claimant\u2019s hip problem prevented a return to her former job <em>and </em>(2) her psychiatric and physical conditions together permanently and totally disabled her. These two opinions are complementary, not contradictory, and the latter establishes the requisite inability to perform sustained remunerative employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-13\">Loeb\u2019s report is also not fatally flawed by his conclusion that claimant is permanently and totally <em>disabled </em>as opposed to permanently and totally <em>impaired. </em>While doctors are indeed limited to evaluating claimants for medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>impairment, <em>State ex rel. Stephenson v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 167, 31 OBR 369, 509 N.E.2d 946, recognized that physicians, being medical not legal specialists, often use \u201cdisability\u201d and \u201cimpairment\u201d interchangeably. Accordingly, <em>Stephenson </em>held that the commission need not automatically discount such evidence, where it is clear that the examiner was not taking nonmedical factors into consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">In this case, there is no evidence that Dr. Loeb\u2019s opinion included nonmedical factors. To the contrary, he specifically indicated that age did not contribute to her inability to work. Loeb\u2019s report is not, therefore, deficient in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Similarly, Loeb\u2019s report is not undermined by his failure to employ the words \u201cunable to perform sustained remunerative employment\u201d rather than simply labelling claimant \u201cpermanently and totally disabled.\u201d The two phrases are often used interchangeably and as we have previously indicated, evidence is not to be excluded merely because a doctor does not use specific buzz words when the meaning is otherwise clear. <em>State ex rel. Hughes v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(1986), 26 Ohio St.3d 71, 26 OBR 61, 498 N.E.2d 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">Finally, that claimant\u2019s psychiatric condition was not allowed until after Loeb issued his report does not invalidate his combined-effects opinion. The chronology of the allowance is immaterial. That the psychiatric condition was ultimately allowed is all that matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">Accordingly, we find that Dr. Loeb\u2019s report is \u201csome evidence\u201d upon which the commission could rely. Moreover, because his opinion attests to a medical inability to do sustained remunerative employment, it is unnecessary for us to examine the commission\u2019s treatment of claimant\u2019s nonmedical factors. <em>State ex rel. Galion Mfg. Div., Dresser Industries, Inc. v. Haygood </em>(1991), 60 Ohio St.3d 38, 573 N.E.2d 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">For these reasons, the court of appeals\u2019 judgment is hereby affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b748-11\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
