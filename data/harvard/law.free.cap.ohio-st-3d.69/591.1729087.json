The court of appeals has filed a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The warden has filed a Civ.R. 12(C) motion for judgment on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">The court of appeals\u2019 Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion is improper for two reasons: (1) generally, Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motions attack the sufficiency of the complaint and may not be used to summarily review the merits of a cause of action in mandamus, <em>State ex re\u00ed Horwitz v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Common Pleas, Probate Div. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 323, 325, 603 N.E.2d 1005, 1007; and (2) the motion was not timely filed, see S.Ct.R.Prac. VIII, Section 1; Civ.R. 12(B). Nevertheless, we treat the untimely Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion as a Civ.R. 12(C) motion for judgment on the pleadings, since such motion \u201chas been characterized as merely a belated Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion.\u201d <em>Nelson v. Pleasant </em>(1991), 73 Ohio App.3d 479, 482, 597 N.E.2d 1137, 1139, citing 4 Anderson, Ohio Civil Practice (1987) 358, Section 152.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">In considering both motions as Civ.R. 12(C) motions for judgment on the pleadings, we have previously noted that Civ.R. 12(C) motions are also generally improper in mandamus cases because they \u201ccall for a decision on the merits of th[e] controversy.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Yiamouyiannis v. Taft </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 205, 206, 602 N.E.2d 644, 645. Nevertheless, <em>Yiamouyiannis </em>should be read as disapproving the delaying of resolution of motions of any kind in election cases, where the necessity of a prompt determination is self-evident. In applying the Civ.R. 12(C) standard, judgment on the pleadings may be granted where no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>material factual issue exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. McCormac, Ohio Civil Rules Practice (2 Ed.1992) 154, Section 6.31. The determination is restricted solely to the allegations of the pleadings and the nonmoving party is entitled to have all material allegations in the complaint, with all reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom, construed in her favor as true. <em>Peterson v. Teodosio </em>(1973), 34 Ohio St.2d 161, 165-166, 63 O.O.2d 262, 264, 297 N.E.2d 113, 117; <em>Bennett v. Ohio Dept. of Rehab. &amp; Corr. </em>(1991), 60 Ohio St.3d 107,108, 573 N.E.2d 633, 635; <em>Burling v. Zeller Corp. </em>(Dec. 27,1993), Defiance App. No. 4-93-9, unreported, 1993 WL 542480. Here, since the material facts are uncontroverted, the resolution of the purely legal issues involved are properly before the court on the Civ.R. 12(C) motions for judgment on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Respondents assert that Pirman\u2019s habeas corpus claim is barred by R.C. 2725.05<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because she was lawfully confined by a court having competent jurisdiction. R.C. 2725.01 provides that \u201c[w]hoever is unlawfully restrained of his liberty, or entitled to the custody of another, of which custody such person is unlawfully deprived, may prosecute a writ of habeas corpus, to inquire into the cause of such imprisonment, restraint, or deprivation.\u201d Despite the breadth of the foregoing statute, this court has generally limited issuance of the writ so as to preclude review of nonjurisdictional issues. <em>Flora v. Rogers </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 441, 619 N.E.2d 690; <em>State ex rel. Dotson v. Rogers </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 25, 607 N.E.2d 453; R.C. 2725.05. However, R.C. 2725.05 should not be construed as controlling the exercise of original jurisdiction in habeas corpus constitutionally granted to courts of appeals and this court. <em>Stahl v. Shoemaker </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 351, 354, 4 O.O.3d 485, 487, 364 N.E.2d 286, 288; see, also, Whiteside, Ohio Appellate Practice (1993) 134, Section T 10.07 (\u201c[T]he courts of appeals and Supreme Court tend to employ the statutes as guides only or to disregard them altogether, on the ground that the constitutional jurisdiction of the higher courts cannot be controlled by statute.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">We have implicitly recognized that in certain extraordinary circumstances where there is an unlawful restraint of a person\u2019s liberty, habeas corpus will lie notwithstanding the fact that only nonjurisdictional issues are involved, but only where there is no adequate legal remedy, <em>e.g., </em>appeal or postconviction relief. See, <em>e.g., Jenkins v. Billy </em>(1989), 43 Ohio St.3d 84, 538 N.E.2d 1045; <em>In re DeFronzo </em>(1977), 49 Ohio St.2d 271, 3 O.O.3d 408, 361 N.E.2d 448; and <em>State v. Bevacqua </em>(1946), 147 Ohio St.20, 33 O.0.186, 67 N.E.2d 786 (habeas corpus is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>proper remedy to raise the claim of excessive bail in pretrial release cases); see, also, <em>In re Petition for Mallory </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St.3d 34, 17 OBR 28, 476 N.E.2d 1045 (habeas corpus lies where probation revocation was premised on a judgment which later became a nullity); <em>In re Fisher </em>(1974), 39 Ohio St.2d 71, 68 O.O.2d 43, 313 N.E.2d 851 (habeas corpus is available to determine whether a person was not afforded counsel and thereby denied due process in noncriminal involuntary civil commitment proceedings where it is the only adequate remedy available for the vindication of the constitutional right of due process).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">In <em>Liberatore v. McKeen </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 175, 17 O.O.3d 107, 407 N.E.2d 23, this court recognized the availability of habeas corpus to challenge the failure to set bad following conviction. However, in <em>Dapice v. Stickrath </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 298, 533 N.E.2d 339, we overruled <em>Liberatore </em>and held that an allegation of excessive bail or failure to set bail after a judgment of conviction is not cognizable in habeas corpus because such allegation does not attack the jurisdiction of the court pursuant to R.C. 2725.05 and, unlike pretrial bail, there is no constitutional right to bail pending appeal. See, also, <em>Lessin v. McFaul </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 417, 583 N.E.2d 1306. In <em>Dapice </em>and <em>Lessin, </em>it was held that although habeas corpus was not available, a writ of mandamus would issue to compel compliance with the applicable bail rules following conviction. We now overrule <em>Dapice </em>and <em>Lessin </em>and hold that habeas corpus is the proper vehicle to challenge excessive bail or refusal to set bail after a judgment of conviction. In so holding, we emphasize that the \u201c Very nature of the writ [of habeas corpus] demands that it be administered with the initiative and flexibility essential to insure that miscarriages of justice within its reach are surfaced and corrected.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mallory, supra, </em>17 Ohio St.3d at 36-37,17 OBR at 30,476 N.E.2d at 1048, citing <em>Harris v. Nelson </em>(1969), 394 U.S. 286, 291, 89 S.Ct. 1082, 1086, 22 L.Ed.2d 281, 286. Therefore, mandamus is no longer available in these cases given the availability of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Pirman claims that the \u201cno contact\u201d provision is unrelated to the purpose of ensuring appearance and is therefore excessive. <em>State ex rel. Baker v. Troutman </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 270, 272, 553 N.E.2d 1053, 1056. However, <em>Baker </em>was a pretrial bail case which did not involve a challenge to a \u201cno contact\u201d provision. Although Pirman asserts in her brief that \u201c[t]here is no provision in the Revised Code, nor the Ohio Criminal Rules,\u201d which supports a \u201cno contact\u201d condition, Crim.R. 46(C)(2) specifically provides that the court may \u201c[p]lace <em>restrictions on the </em>travel, <em>association, </em>or place of abode <em>of the person during the period of release.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">Moreover, since there is no constitutional right to postconviction bail, the right to such bail exists by virtue of R.C. 2953.09, App.R. 8, and Grim.R. 46. See, <em>e.g., State ex rel. Faulkner v. State </em>(Sept. 20, 1993), Madison App. No. CA92-11-030, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>unreported, 1993 WL 369247. R.C. 2953.09(A)(2)(a) provides that a court may grant bail pending appeal consistent with App.R. 8 and Crim.R. 46. App.R. 8(A) specifies that the \u201cdiscretionary right of the trial court or the court of appeals to admit a defendant in a criminal action to bail and to suspend the execution of his sentence during the pendency of his appeal is as prescribed by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Crim.R. 46(E)(1) provides that in non-capital felony cases such as the case at bar, a person who has been convicted and is either awaiting sentence or has filed a notice of appeal \u201cshall be treated in accordance with the provision of division (C) unless the judge has reason to believe that no one or more conditions of release will reasonably assure that the person will not flee or pose a danger to any other person or the community.\u201d If a risk of flight or danger is believed to exist, the person \u201cmay be ordered detained.\u201d Crim.R. 46(E)(1). While the preeminent purpose of bail is to \u201cinsure that the defendant appears at all stages of the criminal proceedings,\u201d see Crim.R. 46(A) and <em>State ex rel. Jones v. Hendon </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 115, 118, 609 N.E.2d 541, 543-544, Crim.R. 46(E)(1) allows conditions of release related to \u201cdanger\u201d to the community \u201cin accordance with the provision of division (C).\u201d As discussed previously, Crim.R. 46(C)(2) specifies a condition restricting \u201cassociation\u201d of the convicted felon. Therefore, even assuming, as the court of appeals seems to readily admit, that its \u201cno contact\u201d condition was \u201cto ensure that petitioner did not pose a danger to others or the community,\u201d rather than to ensure her appearance, such condition was appropriate under Crim.R. 46(C)(2) and (E)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Pirman also claims that the \u201cno contact\u201d provision was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, since it applies not only to her but to her family and \u201cassociates\u201d as well. Although we agree with such assertion since Crim.R. 46(C)(2) allows restrictions only on the association \u201cof the person,\u201d cf., also, <em>Akron v. Rowland </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 374, 618 N.E.2d 138, and further question conditioning Pirman\u2019s bond upon the conduct of others, her bond was revoked because <em>she </em>personally violated the \u201cno contact\u201d condition. Therefore, the condition was not unconstitutional as applied to her. Consequently, Pirman is entitled to neither habeas corpus nor mandamus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we treat the court of appeals\u2019 Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion as a Civ.R. 12(C) motion, grant it as well as Money\u2019s Civ.R. 12(C) motion, and dismiss the complaint and petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">\n<em>Cause dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b781-9\">Moyer, C.J., AW.
