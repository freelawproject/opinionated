Appellant, however, misinterprets the commission\u2019s decision. The commission, contrary to appellant\u2019s representation, did not broadly rule that appellant\u2019s <em>farm </em>was a \u201cworkshop.\u201d It found that the farm contained a particular <em>building </em>that was a \u201cworkshop.\u201d Limiting our review to this narrower finding, we discern no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">\u201cWorkshop\u201d has not been defined statutorily, administratively or judicially by this court. As such, it must \u201cbe read in context and construed according to the rules of grammar and common usage.\u201d R.C. 1.42 and 1.41. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (4 Ed.Rev.1968) 1781, defines \u201cworkshop\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">\u201cWithin Workmen\u2019s Compensation Acts, a room or place wherein power-driven machinery is employed and manual labor is exercised by way of trade for gain or otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">Appellant does not dispute that claimant worked in a room where power-driven machinery was used and manual labor was \u201cexercised by way of trade for gain * * *.\u201d The commission, therefore, properly found that claimant was injured in a workshop.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-13\">The appellate court judgment is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-14\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b299-15\">Moyer, C.J., A.W.
