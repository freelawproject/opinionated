William Sweeney, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ahy\">In the cases before us, R.C. 2317.45 is assailed as being unconstitutional on the grounds that it violates the following provisions of the Ohio Constitution: Section 16, Article I (due process, right to a remedy and open courts), Section 2, Article I (equal protection), and Section 5, Article I (right to a jury trial). For the reasons that follow, we hold R.C. 2317.45 to be unconstitutional under all of the foregoing constitutional provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-15\">In determining the constitutionality of any statute, we begin our analysis with the principle that all legislative enactments enjoy a strong presumption of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>constitutionality. <em>State ex rel. Dickman v. Defenbacher </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 142, 57 O.O. 134, 128 N.E.2d 59, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>Mominee v.

While <em>some of </em>the arguments of the parties and <em>amici curiae </em>relate to the wisdom of abrogating the collateral source rule, this court\u2019s duty is to ignore such arguments and determine the constitutionality of R.C. 2317.45 as an exercise of legislative power. <em>State ex rel. Bishop v. Mt. Orab Village Bd. of Edn. </em>(1942), 139 Ohio St. 427, 438, 22 O.O. 494, 498, 40 N.E.2d 913, 919.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">R.C. 2317.45,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> part of the Tort Reform Act of 1987 (\u201cAct\u201d), was enacted by Am.Sub.H.B. No. 1, 142 Ohio Laws, Part I, 1661, 1694, and became effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>January 5, 1988. The purpose of the Act, as stated in its title, is \u201cto make changes in civil justice and insurance law, thereby reducing the causes of the current insurance crisis and preventing future crises, and ensuring the availability and affordability of insurance coverages required by charitable nonprofit organizations, public organizations, political subdivisions, individual proprietors, small businesses, and commercial enterprises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">One commentator noted that another purpose of the Act is to prevent double recoveries in tort actions. Darling, Ohio Civil Justice Reform Act (1987) 130-131; see, also, Note, The Constitutionality of Offsetting Collateral Benefits Under Ohio Revised Code Section 2317.45 (1992), 53 Ohio St.L.J. 587; <em>Baker v. Goldblatt </em>(C.A. 6, 1992), 955 F.2d 402, 407. However, opponents of the Act, including the Ohio Public Interest Campaign, claimed that the insurance industry had contrived an insurance crisis in order to promote and protect \u201corganized price <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>gouging\u201d by insurance underwriters.

Webber </em>(1970), 23 Ohio St.2d 104, 52 O.O.2d 395, 263 N.E.2d 235.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We turn now to evaluating R.C. 2317.45 in light of the aforementioned provisions of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">Jury Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">As this court stated in <em>Cleveland Ry. Co. v. Halliday </em>(1933), 127 Ohio St. 278, 284, 188 N.E. 1, 3: \u201cThe right to a jury trial does not involve merely a question of procedure. The right to jury trial derives from Magna Charta. It is reasserted both in the Constitution of the United States and in the Constitution of the State of Ohio. For centuries it has been held that the right of trial by jury is a fundamental constitutional right, a substantial right, and not a procedural privilege.\u201d Accord <em>Kneisley v. Lattimer-Stevens Co. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 354, 356, 533 N.E.2d 743, 746. It has also been held that \u201c[t]he right of trial by jury, being guaranteed to all our citizens by the constitution of the state, cannot be invaded or violated by either legislative act or judicial order or decree.\u201d <em>Gibbs v. Girard </em>(1913), 88 Ohio St. 34, 102 N.E. 299, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">Section 5, Article I of the Ohio Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-11\">\u201cThe right of trial by jury shall be <em>inviolate, </em>except that, in civil cases, laws may be passed to authorize the rendering of a verdict by the concurrence of not less than three-fourths of the jury.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-12\">However, this constitutional provision does not guarantee a jury trial in all cases, but only for those causes of actions where the right existed at common law at the time the Ohio Constitution was adopted. <em>Belding v. State ex rel. Heifner </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>(1929), 121 Ohio St. 393, 169 N.E. 301, paragraph one of the syllabus. Given that negligence actions, which evolved from the common-law action of trespass on the case, and battery actions existed at common law at the time of the adoption of our state Constitution, Section 5, Article I is an inviolate and fundamental right that applies to the actions herein. <em>Kneisley, supra, </em>40 Ohio St.3d at 357, 533 N.E.2d at 746.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">R.C. 2317.45 requires trial courts to deduct from a plaintiff\u2019s jury award collateral benefits which have been or will be received by the plaintiff, irrespective of whether the collateral benefits are actually duplicated in the jury\u2019s verdict. The statute does not require that damages be allocated between economic or noneconomic damages or even past or future economic damages. The statute merely directs the trial court to deduct the amount of the collateral benefit from the total jury award. In this respect, courts may, consistent with R.C. 2317.45, enter judgments in disregard of the jury\u2019s verdict and thus violate the plaintiffs right to have all facts determined by the jury, including damages. See <em>Miller v. Wikel Mfg. Co. </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 76, 81, 545 N.E.2d 76, 81 (Douglas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). As a result of R.C. 2317.45, plaintiff Sorrell in <em>case No. 92-2382 </em>has not been fully compensated for her injuries because the specific jury award for her pain and suffering is totally eliminated due to her receipt of workers\u2019 compensation benefits, even though workers\u2019 compensation allows no compensation whatsoever for pain and suffering. As plainly illustrated by Mrs. Sorrell\u2019s case, R.C. 2317.45 can -wipe out an entire jury award and essentially grant the tortfeasor a rebate for the damages he caused. See <em>Morris v. Savoy </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 684, 710, 576 N.E.2d 765, 784 (A.W. Sweeney, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Instead of eliminating a double recovery, as is one of the statute\u2019s ostensible goals, R.C. 2317.45 eliminated any recovery the jury found that Mrs. Sorrell was entitled to for her pain and suffering. In the case of Mr. Clark in <em>case No. 93-103*1, </em>the jury award could also be seriously curtailed by R.C. 2317.45.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">We hold that R.C. 2317.45 encroaches upon the fundamental and inviolate right to trial by jury, and therefore is unconstitutional under Section 5, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that every person who sustains a legal injury \u201cshall have remedy by due course of law.\u201d The \u201cdue course of law\u201d provision is the equivalent of the \u201cdue process of law\u201d provision in the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number><em>Direct Plumbing Supply Co. v. Dayton </em>(1941), 138 Ohio St. 540, 544, 21 O.O. 422, 424, 38 N.E.2d 70, 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Defendants contend that the rational basis test as applied in <em>Morris, supra, </em>is applicable here in determining whether R.C. 2317.45 is constitutional under the Due Process Clause. According to principles of due process, however, governmental action which limits the exercise of fundamental constitutional rights is subject to the highest level of judicial scrutiny. See, <em>e.g., Natl. Assn. for Advancement of Colored People v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson </em>(1958), 357 U.S. 449, 78 S.Ct. 1163, 2 L.Ed.2d 1488. Under the strict scrutiny standard for reviewing legislation which restricts the exercise of fundamental rights, a statute will be considered unconstitutional unless it is shown to be necessary to promote a compelling governmental interest. See <em>Shapiro v. Thompson </em>(1969), 394 U.S. 618, 634, 89 S.Ct. 1322, 1331, 22 L.Ed.2d 600, 615; and <em>Primes v. Tyler </em>(1975), 43 Ohio St.2d 195, 198-199, 72 O.O.2d 112, 114, 331 N.E.2d 723, 726 (equal protection cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">As pointed out earlier, the right to a jury trial in negligence and personal injury actions is a fundamental right. Thus, in order to determine whether R.C. 2317.45 violates the Due Process Clause of the Ohio Constitution, a strict scrutiny standard of review applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">In our view, R.C. 2317.45 has not been shown to be necessary to promote a compelling state interest that requires undermining the fundamental and inviolate right to a jury trial. Moreover, we believe that R.C. 2317.45 does not withstand scrutiny even under the less stringent rational basis standard employed in <em>Morris, supra, </em>because it does not bear a real and substantial relationship to the health, safety, morals or general welfare, and it is unreasonable and arbitrary. See <em>Mominee v. Scherbarth </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 270, 28 OBR 346, 503 N.E.2d 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">The question whether R.C. 2317.45 addresses its goal of reducing the causes of the so-called insurance crisis is debatable given the paucity of credible empirical evidence that a crisis existed, or that there is a relationship between tort reform legislation and the availability or affordability of insurance. Compare, <em>e.g., Natl. Underwriter </em>(Dec. 21, 1984); Insurance Services Office, <em>Chief Executive Circular </em>2 (ISO, Oct. 3, 1986); with Vilsack, Insurance Crisis: Fact and Fiction (1987), 36 Drake L.Rev. 745; <em>Consumer Reports </em>(Aug. 1986), \u201cThe Manufactured Crisis\u201d 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">However, with respect to the goal of R.C. 2317.45 of eliminating double recoveries, the means employed in the statute to attain the goal are both irrational and arbitrary. Of primary significance is that the statute requires deductions from jury verdicts irrespective of whether a collateral benefit defined in R.C. 2317.45(A)(1) is actually included in the verdict. While the goal of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>preventing double recoveries is not arbitrary or unreasonable, as the majority held in <em>Morris, supra, </em>R.C. 2317.45 fails to take into account whether the collateral benefits to be deducted are within the damages actually found by the jury, especially where there are no interrogatories to quantify the categories of damages that make up the general verdict. Thus, the statute can arbitrarily reduce damages that a jury awards a plaintiff, since under the statute it is irrelevant whether any collateral benefit actually represents any portion of the jury\u2019s award. In the case of Mrs. Sorrell, R.C. 2317.45 arbitrarily and unreasonably eliminated her entire jury award, since her workers\u2019 compensation benefits exceeded the jury verdict of damages, notwithstanding that workers\u2019 compensation pays nothing for pain and suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">In addition, <em>amicus curiae </em>Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers raises the persuasive argument that no double recovery from a tortfeasor occurs in the typical tort case involving collateral benefits, since ordinarily one of the supposed double recoveries is merely the plaintiff\u2019s benefit of his bargain with his own insurance company. In both of the causes <em>sub judice, </em>the benefit of the bargain is the employer-paid workers\u2019 compensation and disability compensation programs that are earned by the plaintiff-employees as an employment benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">In any event, regardless of whether the jury allocates damages to categories, R.C. 2317.45 does not accord due process to tort victims under either the strict scrutiny or rational basis test, and therefore we hold that it violates the Due Process Clause found in Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">Equal Protection</p>\n<p id=\"b610-9\">Section 2, Article I of the Ohio Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-10\">\u201cAll political power is inherent in the people. Government is instituted for their equal protection and benefit, and they have the right to alter, reform or abolish the same, whenever they may deem it necessary; and no special privileges or immunities shall ever be granted, that may not be altered, revoked, or repealed by the general assembly.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">The standard for determining whether a statutory classification involving a fundamental right violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Ohio Constitution is again the strict scrutiny test. <em>Shapiro, supra. </em>The limit placed upon governmental action by the Equal Protection Clauses of the Ohio and United States Constitutions are nearly identical. <em>Kinney v. Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chem. Corp. </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St.2d 120, 123, 70 O.O.2d 206, 207-208, 322 N.E.2d 880, 882. Thus, the statutory classifications of R.C. 2317.45 are unconstitutional unless it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>can be shown that they are necessary to promote a compelling governmental interest. <em>Shapiro, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">R.C. 2317.45 and 2305.27 establish two classifications of tort victims: medical malpractice tort victims and all other tort victims. In <em>Morris, supra, </em>the majority upheld the constitutionality of R.C. 2305.27 in setting off medical malpractice collateral benefits. However, the viability of that holding is questionable at best given our resolution of the causes <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Under R.C. 2305.27, jury awards in medical malpractice claims are subject to a collateral source rule different from the rule for awards in all other tort cases. R.C. 2305.27 does not require deduction of collateral benefits attributable to insurance proceeds where premiums were paid either by or for the plaintiff, or by the plaintiffs employer. <em>Savage v. Correlated Health Serv., Ltd. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 42, 591 N.E.2d 1216, and <em>Hodge v. Middletown Hosp. Assn. </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 236, 581 N.E.2d 529, held that the collateral source rule of R.C. 2305.27 does not require setoffs for benefits received from workers\u2019 compensation, Social Security or Medicare. However, under R.C. 2317.45, all non-medical-malpractice tort awards would be reduced by the amount of such benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">In our view, the ostensible purposes of R.C. 2317.45 do not withstand equal protection scrutiny under a strict scrutiny analysis. Given that one of the purposes of R.C. 2317.45 is to limit double recoveries, the different treatment for medical malpractice tort victims with regard to collateral recovery is not necessary to promote a compelling governmental interest, especially where the statutory classifications are established in response to a crisis that has not clearly been established to have existed. See <em>Morris, supra, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 710-711, 576 N.E.2d at 784 (AW. Sweeney, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Moreover, a statutory classification violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Ohio Constitution if it treats similarly situated people differently based upon an illogical and arbitrary basis. <em>Id. </em>See <em>State v. Buckley </em>(1968), 16 Ohio St.2d 128, 45 O.O.2d 469, 243 N.E.2d 66; and <em>Klepper v. Ohio Bd. of Regents </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 131, 570 N.E.2d 1124. The arbitrariness of R.C. 2317.45 in this regard is cogently pointed out by <em>amicus curiae, </em>Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-8\">\u201cIf there was an insurance crisis, it would be a crisis affecting all tort defendants. There is no rational reason for distinguishing between medical malpractice tort defendants and all other tort defendants. This disparate treatment can result in vastly different results involving the same injury. For example, two tort victims suffer the identical injury, the laceration of an artery resulting in death. One tort victim is injured by a piece of broken glass while driving a company truck within the scope of employment. The other tort victim is injured by the medical negligence of a physician who lacerates an artery during an elective surgery procedure. Both tort victims remain in the hospital for ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>days before their death. Due to the difference in the collateral source statutes, these two identical injuries may result in vastly different compensation for the victim. The Equal Protection Clause mandates that those similarly situated be similarly treated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">Thus, even under the less stringent rational basis test applied by the majority in <em>Morris, swpra, </em>we believe that R.C. 2317.45 is constitutionally infirm on equal protection grounds. Accordingly, we hold that R.C. 2317.45 also violates Section 2, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Right to a Remedy/Open Courts</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution provides in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-8\">\u201cAll courts shall be open, and every person, for an injury done him in his land, goods, person, or reputation, shall have remedy by due course of law, and shall have justice administered without denial or delay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">In construing this constitutional provision in <em>Hardy v. VerMeulen </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 45, 47, 512 N.E.2d 626, 628, we noted that \u201c[w]hen the Constitution speaks of remedy and injury to person, property, or reputation, it requires an opportunity granted at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u201d Accord <em>Gaines v. Preterm-Cleveland, Inc. </em>(1987), 33 Ohio St.3d 54, 60, 514 N.E.2d 709, 716: \u201cDenial of a remedy and denial of a <em>meaningful </em>remedy lead to the same result: an injured plaintiff without legal recourse.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">In the Sorrells\u2019 case, the statute not only denies plaintiffs a meaningful remedy, it completely obliterates the entire jury award. As discussed earlier, the statute treats all collateral sources the same and requires collateral benefits to be deducted from the total jury award regardless of whether the jury specifically awards damages in a category for which there were collateral benefits. Under these circumstances where the collateral source benefits reduce the entire jury award, the tortfeasor obtains a rebate for the damages he or she caused, and the victim\u2019s rights to a jury trial, a meaningful remedy and open courts become hollow rights hardly worth exercising. See <em>Morris, supra, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 710, 576 N.E.2d at 784 (A.W. Sweeney, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">While R.C. 2317.45 does not completely abolish the right to open courts for tort victims, its effect is to hinder the fundamental right of victims to obtain satisfaction for injuries or damages sustained. In our view, Section 16, Article I not only protects the right to file a lawsuit, but also protects the right to a judgment or verdict properly rendered in the suit, since obtaining damages is the ultimate goal of any tort action. <em>Id., </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 708, 576 N.E.2d at 782-783.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>In addition, certain tort victims will realize that R.C. 2317.45 could render their trip to court futile, since receipt of collateral benefits defined in the statute makes pursuit of a claim not worth the time and expense involved. For these tort victims, like plaintiffs herein, R.C. 2317.45 undermines the right to a jury trial, a meaningful remedy and open courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Based on all the foregoing, we hold that R.C. 2317.45 violates Sections 2, 5 and 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution, and is unconstitutional <em>in toto.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">Therefore, in case <em>No. 92-2382, </em>the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed and the judgment of the trial court is reinstated. In <em>case No. 93-1041, </em>the first certified question is answered in the affirmative, thereby rendering the remaining certified questions moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">\n<em>Judgments accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b613-10\">Douglas, Resnick, F.E.

Since I do not find R.C. 2317.45 to be unconstitutional, I dissent from the majority\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-13\">In <em>Morris v. Savoy </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 684, 576 N.E.2d 765, we upheld the setoff of collateral benefits in medical malpractice actions against equal protection and due process challenges. We held that the General Assembly\u2019s elimination of double recoveries to plaintiffs is not \u201cunreasonable or arbitrary,\u201d nor does it \u201coffend fundamental fairness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 693, 576 N.E.2d at 772. I find that same logic applicable given the context in which the issues now arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-14\">The majority holds that a plaintiff in a negligence case has rights to a remedy and a trial by jury that are violated by the setoff requirements of R.C. 2317.45. In both cases before us, as well as in every conceivable factual situation, the plaintiffs after the setoff will receive at least as much total compensation from all sources as the amount awarded by the jury. If the underlying purpose of tort law is to wholly compensate victims, due process is satisfied when the plaintiff recovers, from all sources, the amount that the jury deems a just and appropriate award. By disallowing a setoff for collateral benefits, the majority sanctions a windfall for the plaintiff at the expense of all insureds. One must ask, what purpose is served by such reasoning? The majority will allow a plaintiff to take substantially more than what a jury found to be full compensation. If a plaintiff\u2019s rights are violated by application of a collateral benefit setoff, then it follows that a defendant\u2019s rights are equally violated by abrogating the setoff provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>The majority asserts that R.C. 2317.45 creates circumstances in which a tortfeasor may receive a \u201crebate.\u201d The purpose of tort law is thwarted by denying double recovery only if we assume that that purpose is to punish the tortfeasor and not to compensate the victim. The alternative, as expressed by the majority, is to create two liabilities where there was only one before, thereby doubling exposure, the cost of which will be shared , by all who purchase liability insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Because I believe that the elimination of double recoveries is a rational exercise of the General Assembly\u2019s powers and that no fundamental right of the plaintiffs has been abridged, I dissent from the decision announced today.</p>\n<judges id=\"b614-6\">Wright, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
