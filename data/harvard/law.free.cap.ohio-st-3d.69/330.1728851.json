We must thus determine which of our previous deci<em>sions </em>\u2014 Noll or <em>State ex rel. Gay v. Mihm </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 315, 626 N.E.2d 666 \u2014 dictates the more appropriate relief in this case. For the reasons to follow, we select the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\"><em>Gay </em>permits a court to dispense with traditional <em>Noll </em>relief in those limited situations where the commission\u2019s decision so conflicts with the evidence as to render further consideration by the commission pointless. The stated medical evidence makes this case inappropriate for an order pursuant to <em>Gay, </em>because it is unclear what claimant is physically capable of doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">Claimant relies on the McCloud and Caulkins reports. Both doctors, however, based their conclusions of an inability to work largely on nonallowed conditions. Caulkins refers almost exclusively to \u201cherniated lumbar intervertebral disc\u201d and \u201ctraumatic fibrositis of her cervical, dorsal and lumbar back.\u201d Much of McCloud\u2019s report is devoted to radicular problems as well as the allowed conditions. It is thus unclear to what extent claimant\u2019s allowed conditions affected these doctors\u2019 opinions of her ability to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">Dr. Fallon\u2019s report is equally unenlightening, but for the opposite reason\u2014 while McCloud and Caulkins considered more than the allowed conditions, Fallon considered less. Fallon\u2019s report does not mention claimant\u2019s allowed arthritic condition, which is possibly her most significant problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>These flaws necessarily taint Dr. Dillahunt\u2019s report as well, since his opinion was based, not on personal observation, but on a review of the very evidence criticized above. So, too, with Riccio\u2019s vocational report, which, in opining on the extent of claimant\u2019s disability, necessarily considered the degree of physical impairment involved. Since the latter would have been derived from the enumerated medical reports, the report was not unaffected by these deficiencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Since the true extent of claimant\u2019s physical impairment attributable solely to the allowed conditions is unknown, <em>Gay </em>is inapplicable. Obviously, the impact of claimant\u2019s nonmedical factors will be much greater if her allowed conditions leave her with a capacity for sedentary work only. On the other hand, a residual ability to do moderately strenuous work may permit employment within the range of vocational skills that claimant possesses. For these reasons, claimant cannot at this point assert the clarity of permanent total disability that <em>Gay </em>demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Claimant also objects to the commission\u2019s physician\u2019s reliance on the AMA combined-values impairment chart to determine impairment percentage. We find this challenge unpersuasive, as is claimant\u2019s allegation of a due process violation arising from a lack of permanent total disability guidelines, the latter having already been rejected in <em>State ex rel. Blake v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 453, 605 N.E.2d 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Accordingly, the commission is ordered to further consider the claimant\u2019s motion and issue an amended order.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">The judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"Aj1-\">Moyer, C.J., AW.
