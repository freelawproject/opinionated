The complaint alleged that on January 26, 1994, defendant \u201cforced entry\u201d into plaintiffs home; \u201cpushed\u201d plaintiff and their child; stated, \u201cI\u2019ll bury you,\u201d and used \u201cextreme foul language.\u201d The complaint also alleged \u201cverbal harassment and assaults for the past two years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-14\">A hearing took place at which various matters were explored, including plaintiffs claim that on a single occasion over a year before defendant had pushed her into the refrigerator. Defendant denied this and the trial judge specifically found an \u201cabsence of any history of assaultive behavior on his part.\u201d Thus, the details of this testimony are unimportant.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>Plaintiff did testify that on January 26, when defendant came over to inspect water damage in the basement, he claimed that some of his personal property was missing and accused her of disposing of it. She stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">At that point he just goes on about I\u2019m selling marital items, I have no right to be doing this, and all I stated to him is, when you left I told you take what you want from here. At that time he took my daughter\u2019s hand, he\u2019s walking outside and he\u2019s telling me that him and I are beyond words, there\u2019s no more talking between us and that he\u2019ll bury me. And this is something that goes on non-stop.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">Q. After you indicate he made this remark, I\u2019ll bury you, what did he then do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1\">A. He took the kids and he left.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">Defendant moved to dismiss the complaint and plaintiff was allowed to make a statement in opposition. She said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-9\">I don\u2019t want him to be allowed in ... my residence because it is my residence and that to me is like a safe haven. I don\u2019t want to sit here and keep going back and forth over the arguments and the fights that we\u2019ve been having. I just feel they\u2019re uncalled for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-10\">And the reason I went for this is [I] just tried to avoid all this. If we have no contact, the kids won\u2019t be involved in any of this.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">Defendant testified that on January 26 when he went to inspect the water damage, he saw that his weight lifting machine was missing. According to his testimony, plaintiff said she got rid of it. He became angry and said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-12\">A. I told her that I will bury you, you know, with all the stuff that you are doing illegally to me, getting rid of all personal assets, that you know I was going to take care of it in some way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-13\">Q. Bury her, in what respect?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-14\">A. Not in the ground, just the Court will handle it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-15\">Q. Well when you make this comment about burying her, what other discussion did you have about the personal property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-16\">A. That she can\u2019t get rid of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-17\">Q. Did you threaten her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-18\">A. No, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-19\">Q. When you make the comment that you would buiy her, did you advance toward her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-20\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-21\">Q. Did you threaten her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-22\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-23\">Q. Did you push her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-6\">Q. Did you come into contact with her in any way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-7\">A. No, none at aii.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-8\">Q. And after you made that comment, what if anything did she say to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"At\">A. As I was walking out with my daughter, she was on the front steps, she says I want you out of my fn life, and I just kept on walking to my truck and left.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-\">Q. And was there any further contact with your wife.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-9\">A. No, I left.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-10\">Q. Just so that we have a clear understanding of this brief discussion where you make the comment that you would bury your wife, I\u2019d like you to indicate to the Court what your specific intention was when you made that statement to her? What message were you trying to give her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-11\">A. The message I was giving her is that the more stuff you do illegal the Court will take care of it, what you\u2019re doing to me. I\u2019m not going to bury you; the Court\u2019s going to bury you for everything you\u2019re doing to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-12\">Q. Was it with respect\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-13\">A. It\u2019s not intentional of bodily harm. It\u2019s just a phrase.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-14\">Q. Was it in connection with her removal of the materials?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-15\">A. Yes, it was. Yes, it was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-16\">Q. Was it in connection with anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-17\">A. No, no, it was just removing the stuff that was ours.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-18\">Q. Were you referring to the list of items that you had prepared?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-19\">A. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-20\">Q. What was the context of that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-21\">A. Of the list I had?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-22\">Q. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-23\">A. It\u2019s all kinds of \u2014 collector\u2019s items. I have some of them now but I have posters, you know, Super Bowl tickets and certain things like that. I have antiques in the attic. I have Lionel trains. I have stuff that is still at the marital residence and I want them to stay there until this is over. I want half of what\u2019s mine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-24\">I don\u2019t want her to get rid of them beforehand because these are stuff that my father gave me. The Lionel trains are for my son. Fine. But they\u2019re mine. I will give it to him at that time. It\u2019s not for her to get rid of.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-25\">The trial judge found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-26\">The issue here obviously centers around the meaning of the phrase, \u201cI\u2019ll bury you,\u201d as uttered by the defendant to the plaintiff on the afternoon of January 26th after he had been at the residence to inspect the damage and the repair to the piping, the damage due to the weather.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-27\">He observed certain items of personalty that he believes he\u2019s entitled to in equitable distribution to be missing and, as a result, became upset. Plaintiff indicates that he uttered the phrase, I\u2019ll bury you, just after indicating there will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>no further discussion with the plaintiff, and he then left the premises with the children. The plaintiff by her testimony indicates that she was upset. She describes herself as shaking given the conduct by the defendant in making this comment to her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-6\">And this incident, I\u2019m satisfied to find apparently has been indicative of the breakdown in the relationship between the parties through verbal arguments that have ensued since their separation. The defendant denies any intention to harm the plaintiff by uttering that phrase and he further denies having engaged in any assaultive conduct against his wife at any point in the past and indicates his intention not to engage in any alarming conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-7\">I believe from an objective standard though in evaluating this matter the phrase, I\u2019ll bury you, has to be considered in terms of the fear that the plaintiff describes to herself by reason of the comment being made by the defendant to her. While the intention of the defendant in making that comment would be to obtain his rights under the law with regard to the divorce proceeding and if the plaintiff was engaging in conduct to divert assets that could not be equitably distributed, and he was upset with that and I can understand that upsetment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\">That resulted though in him making this comment to the plaintiff. The plaintiff indicates though that she was upset and that upsetment is probably directly related to the history of verbal arguments engaged in by these parties over the past. It is in dispute though as to whether he ever pushed her against the refrigerator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-9\">Clearly there is an absence of any history of any assaultive behavior on his part and I\u2019m not satisfied he engaged in assaultive \u2014 terroristic threats, as that phrase is defined under Title 2C. But his comment about I\u2019ll bury you can be construed as alarming, certainly causing annoyance and alarm to the plaintiff in the context in which it was uttered and given the fact of the fear that she was experiencing by him making that comment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-10\">So on that basis the Court will enter a Final Restraining Order barring him from engaging in further acts of domestic violence and barring him from returning to the scene as well as barring him from engaging in further acts of harassment and from having any contact with the plaintiff in person, in writing or through third parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b84-11\">Defendant appeals. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-12\">Domestic violence is a term of art which defines a pattern of abusive and controlling behavior injurious to its victims. <em>See, e.g., </em>Marsha J. Kleinman, <em>Family Violence: It can be a killer, </em>41 <em>N.J. Psychologist </em>(1991); Courtney N. Esposito, <em>Abuse: Breaking the Cycle of Violence: The Victim\u2019s Perspective, 8 Trends in Health Care, Law and Ethics </em>(Spring 1993), <em>reprinted in Domestic Violence </em>(New Jersey Institute of Continuing Legal Education 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>The Prevention of Domestic Violence Act (repealed, L.1991, <em>c. </em>261 \u00a7 20, reenacting L.1991, c. 261 \u00a7 1), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-17 to -33, was New Jersey\u2019s response to this problem. The findings which undergird the act are set forth at <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:25-18 (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">The Legislature finds and declares that domestic violence is a serious crimes against society; that there are thousands of person in this State who are regularly <em>beaten, tortured and in some cases even killed </em>by their spouses or cohabitants; that a significant number of women who are assaulted are pregnant; that victims of domestic violence come from all social and economic backgrounds and ethnic groups; that there is a positive correlation between spousal abuse and child abuse; and that children, even when they are not themselves physically assaulted, suffer deep and lasting emotional effects from exposure to domestic violence. It is therefore, the intent of the Legislature to assure the victims of domestic violence the maximum protection from abuse the law can provide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-7\">The Legislature further finds and declares that even though many of the existing criminal statutes are applicable to acts of domestic violence, previous societal attitudes concerning domestic violence have affected the response of our law enforcement and judicial systems, resulting in these acts receiving different treatment from similar crimes when they occur in a domestic context. The Legislature finds that battered adults presently experience substantial difficulty in gaining access to protection from the judicial system, particularly due to that system\u2019s inability to generate a prompt response in an emergency situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-8\">It is the intent of the Legislature to stress that the primary duty of a law enforcement officer when responding to a domestic violence call is to enforce the laws allegedly violated and to protect the victim____ It is further intended that the official response to domestic violence shall communicate the attitude that violent behavior will not be excused or tolerated, and shall make clear the fact that the existing criminal laws and civil remedies created under this act will be enforced without regard to the fact that the violence grows out of a domestic situation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">These findings indicate that the focus of the Legislature was regular serious abuse between spouses. That this is so is underscored by the references to torture, battery, beatings, and killing in the findings. Likewise addressed was the long term damage suffered by children who observe such despicable acts. The way that the Legislature addressed these problems was to provide emergency and long-term protection to domestic violence victims whose complaints against their spouses had traditionally been treated cavalierly by law enforcement officers, solely because they arose in the domestic context. Among the domestic violence remedies provided are exclusion of defendant from the marital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>premises, suspension of visitation, monetary relief to plaintiff and mandatory counseling. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:25-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">In enacting the domestic violence law, the Legislature did not create a new class of offenses or interdict acts which otherwise were not addressed by the criminal law, but ensured that spouses who were subjected to criminal conduct had full access to the protections of the legal system. Instead of redefining classes of prohibited conduct, the domestic violence law simply incorporated the following criminal statutes:</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">(1) Homicide N.J.S. 2C:11-1 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"AJh\">(2) Assault N.J.S. 20:12-1</p>\n<p id=\"A6I\">(3) Terroristic threats N.J.S. 20:12-3</p>\n<p id=\"An\">(4) Kidnapping N.J.S. 20:13-1</p>\n<p id=\"AO\">(5) Criminal restraint N.J.S. 20:13-2</p>\n<p id=\"Al\">(6) False imprisonment N.J.S. 20:13-3</p>\n<p id=\"AQ\">(7) Sexual assault N.J.S. 20:14-2</p>\n<p id=\"AgU\">(8) Criminal sexual conduct N.J.S. 20:14-3</p>\n<p id=\"A0U\">(9) Lewdness N.J.S. 20:14-4</p>\n<p id=\"Aqk\">(10) Criminal mischief N.J.S. 20:17-3</p>\n<p id=\"AM\">(11) Burglary N.J.S. 20:18-2</p>\n<p id=\"A8\">(12) Criminal trespass N.J.S. 20:18-3</p>\n<p id=\"AS1\">(13) Harassment N.J.S. 20:33-4</p>\n<p id=\"b86-20\">[N.J.S.A. 2C:25-19.]</p>\n<p id=\"b86-21\">However, it is clear that the drafters of the law did not intend that the commission of any one of these acts automatically would warrant the issuance of a domestic violence order. The law mandates that acts claimed by a plaintiff to be domestic violence must be evaluated in light of the previous history of violence between the parties including previous threats, harassment and physical abuse, and in light of whether immediate danger to person or property is present. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-29a(1) and (2). This requirement reflects the reality that domestic violence is ordinarily more than an isolated aberrant act and incorporates the legislative intent to provide a vehicle to protect victims whose safety is threatened. This is the backdrop on which plaintiffs claim that defendant committed domestic violence when he said \u201cI\u2019ll bury you\u201d must be evaluated.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>Harassment, which is the focus of this case, is defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-4 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-6\">Except as provided in subsection d., a person commits a petty disorderly persons offense if, with purpose to harass another, he:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-7\">a. Makes, or causes to be made, a communication or communications anonymously or at extremely inconvenient hours, or in offensively coarse language, or any other manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-8\">b. Subjects another to striking, kicking, shoving, or other offensive touching, or threatens to do so; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-9\">c. Engages in any other course of alarming conduct or of repeatedly committed acts with purpose to alarm or seriously annoy such other person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-10\">A communication under subsection a. may be deemed to have been made either at the place where it originated or at the place where it was received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-11\">d. A person commits a crime of the fourth degree if in committing an offense under this section, he acted, at least in part, with ill will, hatred or bias toward, and with a purpose to intimidate, an individual or group of individuals because of race, color, religion, sexual orientation or ethnicity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-12\">The provision of the harassment statute relevant here is <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-4(c). Integral to a finding of harassment under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-4(c) is the establishment of the purpose to harass, <em>D.C. v. T.H., </em>269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>458, 461-62, 635 A.2d 1002 (App.Div.1994); <em>E.K. v. G.K., </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>567, 570, 575 A.2d 883 (App.Div.1990), along with a course of alarming conduct or repeated acts intended to alarm or seriously annoy another, <em>Grant v. Wright, </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. 191, </em>196, 536 A.2d 319 (App.Div.) <em>certif. denied, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>562, 546 A.2d 493 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-13\">None of these elements is present in this case. First, there was no finding that defendant intended to harass plaintiff. The trial judge appears to have found that defendant did not make the statement \u201cI\u2019ll bury you\u201d for harassing purposes, but that it was nevertheless objectively alarming to plaintiff. This finding is insufficient as a matter of law to meet the statutory standard. Second, even if the judge had found a purpose on defendant\u2019s part to harass plaintiff, that purpose, standing alone, would not have satisfied the definition of harassment under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-4c unless it was manifested by a course or repeated acts of alarming conduct. <em>See Grant v. Wright, supra, </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 196, 536 A.2d 319 (defendant\u2019s surreptitious removal of plaintiffs belong<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>ings from their apartment and one occasion of shouting and door slamming was held not to constitute a course of alarming conduct, regardless of defendant\u2019s purpose).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Separate and apart from these evidential insufficiencies which preclude a finding of the predicate act of harassment, defendant\u2019s conduct was plainly never contemplated by the Legislature as domestic violence. Here, there was absolutely no history of threats, harassment, physical or mental abuse or violence between parties, who were on the threshold of dissolving their marriage when a conflict over property occurred. What happened was that plaintiff and defendant, whose relationship the trial judge correctly characterized as broken down, had a disagreement. As a result, defendant said something to plaintiff in annoyance which upset and alarmed her. Why she was alarmed in light of the pacific history of the couple is hard to say. Although it can safely be observed that defendant\u2019s conduct was no model, application of the domestic violence law to it diminishes the suffering of true victims of domestic violence and misused the legislative vehicle which was developed to protect them. It also had a secondary negative effect: the potential for unfair advantage to a matrimonial litigant. As we said in <em>Murray v. Murray, </em>267 <em>N.J.Super. </em>406, 410, 631 A.2d 984 (App.Div.1993):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-7\">We are concerned, too, with the serious policy implications of permitting allegations of this nature to be branded as domestic violence and used by either spouse to secure rulings on critical issues such as support, exclusion from marital residence and property disposition, particularly when aware that a matrimonial action is pending or about to begin.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">While we are sympathetic with plaintiffs desire to shield her children from the bickering which took place between her and defendant during his visits (this was plainly one of the factors which fueled the filing of the domestic violence complaint), the fact of the matter is that the dissolution of a marriage is rarely a happy event. All parties suffer and even the most rational are hard pressed to avoid any emotional encounters. Our hope, like plaintiffs, is that all children of divorce can be spared arguments and recriminations. But this needs to come from the good inten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>tions of their parents and not from the misapplication of the domestic violence law, which law was intended to address matters of consequence, not ordinary domestic contretemps such as this.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
