Lipari, April Lipari, John J. Lipari and Elizabeth M. Lipari (the Liparis) on claims asserted against them as alleged guarantors of obligations owed to Midlantic by Nationwide Adjustment Corporation (Nationwide). Midlantic was also awarded partial summary judgment against Nationwide and the Liparis for attorneys fees and costs of $108,530.15. Nationwide and the Liparis appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b551-12\">Valley contracted with Nationwide, a debt-collection agency, to collect delinquent patient accounts. Monies collected by Nationwide were deposited in a trust account maintained by Nationwide at Midlantic. Checks received on delinquent accounts would be endorsed with both Nationwide and Valley endorsements and deposited into the Midlantic account. After the checks cleared, Nationwide would remit the full amount to Valley, which would then return a percentage to Nationwide as its collection fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Valley employed Gerald F. Juliano as its Director of Patient Accounting. According to Valley, Juliano stole checks from Valley and delivered them to persons at Nationwide, who fraudulently endorsed them with a Valley endorsement, deposited them into the Midlantic trust account and ultimately distributed the proceeds to Juliano and the Nationwide malefactors. Juliano pled guilty to federal criminal charges arising out of his participation in that scheme; at his deposition in this matter, Juliano identified Richard J. Lipari and Raymond De Filippis as Nationwide participants in the scheme, but whether or not they participated has not been adjudicated in this litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">In this action, Valley sought compensatory and punitive damages against Juliano, Nationwide, Richard J. Lipari and Raymond De Filippis, and others, for their alleged participation in the check diversions. Valley also joined Midlantic, seeking recovery for Midiantic\u2019s payments to Nationwide on false, forged or fraudulent Valley endorsements. Among a variety of crossclaims and counterclaims, Midlantic sued Nationwide for breach of its guarantees of prior endorsements and warranties of good title, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>12A:3-417, 4-207, and sued the Liparis on personal guarantees they had given Midlantic for \u201cthe payment, when due, of each and every obligation ... owing to Midlantic by Nationwide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">On Midiantic\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, the Law Division determined that the Liparis were liable to Midlantic under their personal guarantees for all monies to be found due and owing to Midlantic by Nationwide. On Midiantic\u2019s later motion, the court awarded the $108,530.15 attorneys fees against Nationwide, and also imposed that obligation against the Liparis as guarantors. Those determinations are the subjects of the appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After the appeal was filed, Valley settled and dismissed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>its claims against Midlantic, Nationwide, Richard J. Lipari and Raymond De Filippis.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">\n<em>II</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Commencing in 1980, the Liparis executed and delivered a succession of personal guarantees to Midlantic, the last group dated April 1,1986. Midlantic Branch Manager Galioto described the guarantees as having been given \u201cin connection with the ongoing business operations of Nationwide,\u201d but April Lipari\u2019s answering certification set forth \u2014 without subsequent contradiction \u2014 that they had been given to secure \u201ca $100,000.00 annually renewable line of credit account that Nationwide has with Midlantic.\u201d The April 1, 1986 guarantees all utilized a Midlantic printed form, which stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-8\">For Valuable Considerations, and to induce you to loan money and extend credit in reliance hereon, I hereby guarantee, unconditionally, the payment, when due, of each and every obligation, direct or contingent, now existing or hereafter arising, owing to you by Nationwide Adjustment Corporation hereinafter called the Borrower.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-9\">The Guaranty is a continuing guaranty, and shall remain in force until revoked by notice in writing to you, and revocation hereof shall not prejudice your claim hereunder with respect to any obligation arising prior to revocation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-10\">The Guaranty shall extend to and cover every extension or renewal of, and every obligation accepted in substitution for, any obligation guaranteed hereby, and I shall be bound hereby irrespective of the existence, value or condition of any collateral security you may at any time hold.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-11\">I hereby consent and agree that you may, without prejudice to any claim against me hereunder, at any time, or from time to time in your discretion, and without notice to me, (1) extend or change the time of payment, and the manner, place or terms of payment of any obligation hereby guaranteed, (2) exchange, release or surrender all or any collateral security which you may at any time hold in connection with any obligation hereby guaranteed, (3) sell, and yourself purchase, any such collateral at public or private sale or at any broker\u2019s board crediting net proceeds upon any obligation secured thereby, and (4) settle or compromise with the Borrower, or with any other person primarily or secondarily liable with the Borrower, any obligation hereby guaranteed, or subordinate the payment of any such obligation of the Borrower or other person to the payment of any other debt which may be owing to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>No delay on your part in exercising any right hereunder, or in taking any action to collect or enforce payment of any obligation hereby guaranteed, either as against the Borrower or any other person primarily or secondarily liable with the Borrower, shall operate as a waiver of any such right or in any manner prejudice your rights against me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">I agree that, if the maturity of any obligation hereby guaranteed is accelerated, by bankruptcy or otherwise, as against the Borrower, such maturity shall also be deemed accelerated for the purposes of the Guaranty, and without demand upon or notice to me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The Liparis argue that \u201cthe guarantees were intended to secure only the debt (ie., the line of credit account) for which they were delivered, and any extension or renewal thereof.\u201d Midlantic responds that \u201cthe express terms of the guarantees could not be clearer\u201d in specifying that they \u201care <em>not </em>limited to specific debts of Nationwide to Midlantic in <em>any </em>fashion.\u201d We conclude that the contractual language must be construed in the Liparis\u2019 favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">There can be no doubt \u2014 indeed, Midlantic does not dispute\u2014 that the guarantees were required and given solely in support of Midiantic\u2019s grant of a $100,000 line of credit to Nationwide. To be sime, the Liparis guaranteed \u201cunconditionally, the payment, when due, of each and every obligation, direct or contingent, now existing or hereafter arising, owing to [Midlantic] by Nationwide.\u201d That statement of the Liparis\u2019 obligation is all-encompassing, but the further language of the guarantees describes a narrower and more tailored undertaking. Each guarantee describes a singular purpose \u201cto induce [Midlantic] to loan money and extend credit in reliance hereon.\u201d Each guarantee particularizes its intent to \u201cextend to and cover every extension or renewal of, and every obligation accepted in substitution for, any obligation guaranteed hereby.\u201d Each guarantee concludes with an acceleration clause that is triggered \u201cif the maturity of any obligation hereby guaranteed is accelerated.\u201d Those provisions all confirm the parties\u2019 understanding that the guarantees were designed to secure payment of Nationwide loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">The guarantees thus describe contradictory obligations, one all-inclusive, the other limited. The ambiguity is appropriately resolved by interpreting the writings to impose only those obli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>gat\u00edons the parties in fact contemplated; stated conversely, the ambiguous language ought not be construed to extend the parties\u2019 rights and obligations beyond their common contemplation. <em>See, e.g., Communications Workers v. Monmouth Co. Bd., </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>442, 452, 476 A.2d 777 (1984) (\u201cthe circumstances that existed when the contract was made\u201d may shed light on the parties\u2019 intention; \u201conce the parties\u2019 intent is determined ... that intent may not be disregarded ... to add to, subtract from, modify, or alter any terms of the agreement\u201d); <em>Wheatly v. Sook Suh, </em>217 <em>N.J.Super. </em>233, 240, 525 A.2d 340 (App.Div.1987) (\u201ca subsidiary provision should not be interpreted in such a manner as to conflict with the obvious or dominant purpose of the contract\u201d). That resolution of the ambiguity is also consistent with our well-settled law that \u201cthe language of a guaranty agreement must be interpreted against the bank who prepared the form, and at whose insistence the language was included.\u201d <em>Housatonic Bank v. Fleming, </em>234 <em>N.J.Super. </em>79, 82, 560 A.2d 97 (App.Div.1989). We accordingly reverse the partial summary judgments entered against the Liparis.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">\n<em>III</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The $108,530.15 counsel fee award in favor of Midlantie against Nationwide was entered under the purported authority of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:4-207(3):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-7\">Damages for breach of such warranties or engagement to honor shall not exceed the consideration received by the customer or collecting- bank responsible plus finance charges and expenses related to the item, if any.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">In the trial court, Midlantie successfully urged that the phrase \u201cexpenses related to the item\u201d should be read to include its attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses in this litigation assertedly generated by Nationwide\u2019s breach of its warranties of good title to the cheeks in question. In support of its contrary argument that the statutory language ought not be so broadly interpreted, Nationwide relies on <em>McAdam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., </em>896 <em>F.</em>2d 750 (3d Cir.1990), where the court, called upon to \u201cpredict how the New <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Jersey Supreme Court would decide the question,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 774, concluded that \u201cwe do not believe that attorneys\u2019 fees are appropriate under New Jersey law in an action under \u00a7 4-207.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 777. Midiantic\u2019s reply is that <em>McAdam </em>(1) merely guesses at what the New Jersey Supreme Court might decide, (2) incorrectly focuses on New Jersey history and tradition and wrongly interprets the legislative history, and (3) \u201cdoes a disservice to the public policy of this State.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">,We find it unnecessary to recite and evaluate the conflicting arguments advanced by the parties with respect to <em>McAdam. </em>Having thoroughly considered those arguments, we are persuaded, substantially for the reasons fully expressed in <em>McAdam, </em>that the phrase \u201cexpenses related to the item\u201d cannot and should not be read as allowing for the award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses in an action brought under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>12A:4-207. The partial summary judgment in favor of Midlantic thus must be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The partial summary judgment orders dated October 27, 1993 and March 1, 1994 are reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b551-13\"> The order awarding counsel fees was certified as final pursuant to <em>R. </em>4:42-2. The order holding the Liparis liable as guarantors was not so certified, but we find it appropriate to grant leave to appeal <em>nunc pro tunc.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b552-7\"> The order awarding attorneys' fees also imposes a \"judicial lien\" on the assets of Nationwide, Richard J. Lipari and Raymond De Filippis. De Filippis has joined with Nationwide and the Liparis on the appeal, but no argument has been presented concerning the liens. We assume that all parties agree that the liens stand or fall together with the fee award.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b556-7\"> Midlantic also argues that the fee award can be justified as traditional breach of contract damages. <em>See, e.g.. Central Motor v. E.I. duPont de Nemours, 251 N.J.Super. </em>5, 9, 596 A.2d 759 (App.Div.1991); <em>Dorofee v. Pennsauken Tp. Planning Bd., </em>187 <em>N.J.Super. </em>141, 144, 453 A.2d 1341 (App.Div.1982). The motion judge was not asked to, nor did he, award fees on that theory. We therefore do not address the question.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
