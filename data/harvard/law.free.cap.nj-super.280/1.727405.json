The decision also concluded that the prospective budgeting method utilized to calculate eligibility, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:82-1.10, was valid and not contrary to federal law. We affirm both components of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">Pursuant to federal authority, 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396a, New Jersey has established its own Medicaid program, the Medical Assistance and Health Service Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4D-1 to -19. The program is administered by the Department of Human Services and particularly by the Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services. That department determines state income eligibility requirements. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4D-4, -5. The eligibility requirements of the Special Medicaid Program, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:72-4.1 to -4.5, include a prospective budgeting process in evaluating an applicant\u2019s monthly income, N.J<em>.A.C. </em>10:82-1.10(a). Those requirements are also based upon prescribed federal regulations, 45 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 233.33(a), 233.31(b)(1) (1993); <em>See </em>Medicaid Communication No. 93-12 (requiring use of a prospective budgeting method and an income multiplier to calculate gross monthly income). The state assistance handbook provides \u201c[t]he best estimate of income is based on the family\u2019s and agency\u2019s reasonable expectations and knowledge of current, past and future circumstances. In determining the best estimate of income, the CWA<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> shall use income averaging....\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:81-1:10(b).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-8\">The payment schedule of receipt of income by an AFDC individual occurs weekly, biweekly, or on a semi-monthly basis. The CWA shall convert the average income amount to a gross monthly amount by multiplying the averaged income amount by the appropriate conversion factor as follows: weekly amounts by 4.333; biweekly amounts by 2.167; and semi-monthly amounts by two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-9\"><em>[N.J.A.C. </em>10:82-1.10(b)(3).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>Petitioner\u2019s appeal focuses upon the following facts. Petitioner, her husband and child live together. On the date of petitioner\u2019s application, the only income received by the family unit was petitioner\u2019s biweekly unemployment insurance benefits check of $650. When she applied for medical benefits for her son, petitioner\u2019s weekly income, $325, was multiplied by the income multiplier, 4.333, resulting in a calculated gross monthly income of $1,408.23. At that time, the threshold for a family of three to qualify for medical benefits was income below $1,318 per week. 58 <em>Fed.Reg. </em>8286 (1993). Thus, petitioner\u2019s application was rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">Petitioner contends that an income multiplier should not have been used to determine her gross monthly income. There are only four weeks in ten months of each year. Her actual income in each of those ten months is $1,300. Petitioner argues that her son should be eligible for medical benefits in those ten months and should be disqualified in only two months of each year.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">An income multiplier neither falsely imputes financial support nor overvalues assets of an applicant. The income multiplier is simply an averaging device which permits an agency to calculate an applicant\u2019s average monthly income when the applicant receives regular, fixed payments. By multiplying a seven-day payment by the 4.333 factor, respondent calculates income for a thirty and one-third day month instead of a twenty-eight day month. The income multiplier, in fact, yields a more accurate gross monthly income than petitioner\u2019s proposed \u201cliterally received\u201d calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">The factor to be assessed in the review of each application is the applicant\u2019s \u201cavailable income.\u201d As noted in <em>Schweiker v. Gray Panthers, </em>453 <em>U.S. </em>34, 48, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>2633, 2642, 69 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>460, 472 (1981): \u201cavailable income\u201d is \u201cdifferent from [that] in hand.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We have previously utilized that concept, <em>Estate of G.E. v. Division of Medical Assistance and Health Servs., </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>229, 235, 638 A.2d 833 (App.Div.1994), and conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>that it aptly applies here. The question is not whether the income is received; it is when the income is received. The fact that petitioner does not have the money in hand each day of the month does not mean that the money is not received for that month; it is merely received a few days later. The income multiplier works to reasonably average biweekly payments over a monthly period. The multiplier assumes that the month has more than twenty-eight days by multiplying a weekly payment by 4.333. In this manner, all applicants are either eligible or ineligible for the twelve-month calendar year.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Title XIX confers on states authority to adopt reasonable standards to implement their Medicaid programs. <em>See, e.g., Dougherty v. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., Division of Medical Assistance and Health Servs., </em>179 <em>N.J.Super. </em>541, 546, 432 A.2d 943 (App.Div.), <em>certif. granted, 88 N.J. </em>495, 443 A.2d 709 (1981), <em>modified, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>1, 449 A.2d 1235 (1982). 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1396a(a)(17) confers to states the authority to provide \u201creasonable standards ... for determining eligibility.\u201d <em>Ibid. N.J.S.A. </em>30:4D-4 confers authority to the Division to perform \u201cadministrative and operational functions\u201d to implement the state Medicaid Act. <em>Ibid. </em>The income multiplier regulation, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:82-1.10(b)(3), was promulgated as a result of the clear chain of cited statutory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">We must determine whether the regulation in this instance is arbitrary or capricious. Administrative regulations are presumed valid and reasonable. <em>Bergen Pines County Hosp. v. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>456, 477, 476 A.2d 784 (1984) (citing <em>City of Newark v. Natural Resource Council, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>530, 539-40, 414 A.2d 1304, <em>cert. denied, </em>449 <em>U.S. </em>983, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>400, 66 L.Ed.2d 245 (1980); <em>New Jersey Guild of Hearing Aid Dispensers v. Long, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>544, 561, 384 A.2d 795 (1978); <em>Flanagan v. Civil Serv. Dep\u2019t, </em>29 <em>N.J. </em>1, 12, 148 A.2d 14 (1959)). <em>See also Boyle v. Riti, </em>175 <em>N.J.Super. </em>158, 166, 417 A.2d 1091 (App.Div.1980); <em>In re Matter of Public Hearings, </em>142 <em>N.J.Super. </em>136, 156, 361 A.2d 30 (App.Div.), cer<em>tif. denied, </em>72 <em>N.J. </em>457, 371 A.2d 62 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Agencies are delegated broad authority because of their expertise. \u201cThe basic purpose of establishing agencies to consider and promulgate rules is to delegate the primary authority of implementing policy in a specialized area to governmental bodies with the staff, resources and expertise to understand and solve those specialized problems.\u201d <em>Bergen Pines Hosp., supra, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>at 474, 476 A.2d 784. An agency\u2019s delegated authority is particularly broad where the agency is concerned with public health and welfare. <em>New Jersey Ass\u2019n of Health Care Facilities v. Finley, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>67, 79, 415 A.2d 1147, <em>cert. denied sub nom. Wayne Haven Nursing Home v. Finley, </em>449 <em>U.S. </em>944, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>342, 66 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>208 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">The burden, therefore, rests with petitioner to demonstrate that there is no reasonable basis for the Division\u2019s use of an income multiplier. She has failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">In reviewing the decision of an administrative agency, our scope of review is limited to inquiring whether the agency action violates the enabling act\u2019s express or implied legislative policies, whether there is substantial evidence in the record- to support the findings, and whether in applying the policy to the facts, there was clear error in reaching a conclusion that could not reasonably been reached upon the relevant facts. <em>Barone v. Department of Human Servs., </em>210 <em>N.J.Super. </em>276, 285, 509 A.2d 786 (App.Div.1986), <em>aff'd, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>355, 526 A.2d 1055 (1987). <em>See also Henry v. Rahway State Prison, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>571, 579-80, 410 A.2d 686 (1980); <em>Public Service Elec. and Gas Co. v. Department of Envtl. Protection, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>95, 103, 501 A.2d 125 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">We conclude that the decision on appeal meets these criteria.

We need not determine whether petitioner's claim was valid or ever cognizable as a component of this appeal. <em>Maisonet v.
