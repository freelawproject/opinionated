Hart, filed a complaint alleging that she was injured when she fell on premises owned and/or maintained by defendants. On March 9,1993, plaintiffs claim was arbitrated and the arbitrator found \u201cno cause for action.\u201d The attorney who was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>then handling the case for plaintiffs law firm did not attend the arbitration; rather, another associate in the law firm represented plaintiff at the hearing. After receiving a copy of the Report and Award of Arbitrator, the attorney returned plaintiffs case file to the attorney handling the matter, recounted what had occurred, and advised her of the need to file a demand for a trial <em>de novo. </em>None was ever filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">On June 9, 1993, defendants filed a motion to confirm the arbitration award and to dismiss plaintiffs complaint. Defendants sent a copy of this motion, which was returnable on June 25,1993, to plaintiffs law firm. By the time the motion was filed on June 9, 1993, the attorney who had been handling the plaintiffs case was no longer employed by the firm. The attorney who was \u201cresponsible for responding to this motion\u201d certified that he was unaware of the motion \u201cas it was not in the file nor was it listed on our [office] motion schedule.\u201d There is no direct denial that it was received by the firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">On June 18, 1993, an order was entered, granting defendants\u2019 motion and dismissing plaintiffs complaint. On July 2, 1993, defendants sent a copy of this order to plaintiffs law firm with a letter addressed to the attorney who had originally been handling the case. The newly assigned attorney\u2019s \u201cfirst contact\u201d with plaintiffs case file \u201coccurred in July 1993,\u201d when he received the letter and order of dismissal. It was not, however, until August 25, 1993, that the attorney filed a motion to vacate the order, asserting the presence of \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d On September 27,1993, plaintiffs motion was denied. Plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration, which was also denied. Plaintiff then filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:23A-26 provides for mandatory confirmation of the arbitration decision upon motion, unless one of the parties petitions the court for a trial <em>de novo </em>within thirty days of the filing of the arbitration decision. <em>Ibid. </em>The Legislature intended that this rule to be strictly enforced. <em>See Assembly Insurance Committee Statement, </em>Senate No. 2709, c. 329 (1987) (\u201cthe court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number><em>shall, </em>upon the motion of any of the parties, confirm the arbitration decision, ... unless one of the parties petitions the court within 30 days of the filing of the arbitration decision for a trial <em>de novo </em>...\u201d). <em>R. </em>4:21A-6(b)(1) was adopted to supplement the statute. This rule mandates dismissal of the action unless \u201cwithin 30 days after filing the arbitration award, a party thereto files with the civil case manager ... a notice of rejection of the award and demand for a trial <em>de </em>novo----\u201d <em>R. </em>4:21A-6(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">This court in <em>Mazakas v. Wray, </em>205 <em>N.J.Super. </em>367, 500 A.2d 1085 (App.Div.1985) interpreted the arbitration statute and court rules in deciding the standard to be applied in determining whether relaxation of the court rules was proper. <em>Ibid. </em>We stressed that the \u201cstated aim of the compulsory arbitration program is to bring speedy and inexpensive adjudication of disputes subject to the Act, \u2018and to ease the burdens and congestion of the State\u2019s courts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 371, 500 A.2d 1085 (citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-24). We noted \u201cthat the arbitration process, once accomplished, should ordinarily bring about an end to the litigation when neither party has made a timely motion for a trial <em>de novo.\u201d Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Although we concluded that the thirty day limitation for demanding a trial <em>de novo </em>is not jurisdictional and is subject to relaxation and enlargement of the time limitation, we pointed out that judges should only exercise this power in extraordinary circumstances. <em>Id. </em>We further stated in <em>Mazakas:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">Generally, when asked after the passage of 30 days to bypass the binding effect of this statutory arbitration, the trial courts should be guided by the same principles as they would apply in passing upon a motion for relief from an order or a judgment under if. 4:50-1. Of course, the one year limitation of if. 4:50-2 would not apply, since this proceeding has its own internal limitation. But, considering the intention of the arbitration program for finality in the proceeding, the passage of time should be a critical factor in a judge\u2019s consideration.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-8\"><em>[Mazakas, supra, </em>205 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 372, 500 A.2d 1085.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-9\"><em>R. </em>4:50-1 sets forth the grounds for granting a motion for relief from a judgement or order. <em>Ibid. </em>Among those grounds are \u201cmistake, inadvertence, ... or excusable neglect.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Any justification for relief under these grounds must be \u201c \u2018compatible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>with proper diligence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lawrence v. Matusewski, </em>210 <em>N.J.Super. </em>268, 272, 509 A.2d 327 (Law Div.1986) (quoting <em>Baumann v. Marinaro, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>380, 394, 471 A.2d 395 (1984)). The plaintiffs failures in the present case to petition for a trial <em>de novo </em>are not compatible with proper diligence. \u201cFailure to supervise one\u2019s secretary does not ordinarily present such \u201c\u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 \u201d as will permit an attorney to make a late demand for trial <em>de novo.\u201d Sprowl v. Kitselman, </em>267 <em>N.J.Super. </em>602, 609, 632 A.2d 540 (App.Div.1993). Further, the excuse of an attorney being too busy or of having too heavy a work load to properly handle litigation or to supervise staff must be rejected as insufficient to constitute extraordinary circumstances. <em>See Pybas v. Paolino, </em>73 Wash.App. 393, 869 P.2d 427 (1994). We can find no extraordinary circumstances at any stage of this saga as would entitle plaintiff to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
