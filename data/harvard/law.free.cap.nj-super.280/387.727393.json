The refund was not paid until 153 days after the entry of judgment. This delay gave rise to the question of the period and rate at which interest on the belated refund would be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:3-27.2 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-11\">In the event that a taxpayer is successful in an appeal from an assessment on real property, the respective taxing district shall refund any excess taxes paid, together with interest thereon from the date of payment at a rate of 5% per annum, less any amount of taxes, interest, or both, which may be applied against delinquencies pursuant to P.L.1983, c. 137 (C. 54:4-134), within 60 days of the date of final judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-12\">Plaintiff argued that the 5% interest rate applied only to the sixty-day period after judgment and that thereafter a greater than 5% rate could be imposed. Defendant urged a construction of the statute which would hold that the sixty-day period was a moratorium on the calculation of interest on refunds. Judge Small rejected both of these contentions and held that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:3-27.2 is the sole source of authority for the imposition of interest in a tax refund case and that interest on a local property tax refund is to be paid from the date of payment to the date of refund at 5% per annum.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>We affirm substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Small in his opinion of February 4, 1994, the relevant details of which are set forth below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-6\">\n<em>I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-7\"><em>R. </em>4:42-11(a) (emphasis added) provides that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-8\"><em>Except as otherwise </em>ordered by the court or <em>provided by law, judgments, </em>awards and orders <em>for the payment of money, </em>taxed costs and counsel fees shall bear simple interest as follows:____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-9\">Thus, by its own language, <em>R. </em>4:42-11(a) does not apply to local property tax refunds because</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-10\">(1) the law provides otherwise. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:3-27.2 quoted in full above and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-11\">(2) judgments reducing tax assessments are not judgments for the payment of money \u2014 they are judgments reducing tax assessments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-12\">In <em>9W Contractors, Inc. v. Englewood, Cliffs Borough, </em>1 <em>N.J.Tax </em>465 [424 A.2d 461] (Tax 1980), this court awarded interest on a tax refund in excess of the statutory rate of 5% provided in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:3-27.2. We relied in part on <em>713 Co. v. City of Jersey City, </em>94 <em>N.J.Super. </em>210 [227 A.2d 530] (Law Div.1967). That case antedated the Appellate Division\u2019s clear statement that \u201cinterest is not recoverable on an abatement of tax liability unless provision therefor is made by statute.\u201d <em>Frieman v. Township of Randolph, </em>185 <em>N.J.Super. </em>152, 163 [447 A.2d 927] (App.Div.1982).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-13\">Although this court\u2019s award of interest in excess of the statutory amount in <em>9W Contractors </em>may have been motivated by the dilatory behavior of the municipality and the then current interest rate environment, it was not authorized by law, and I believe was therefore in error. Even if the conclusion in <em>9W Contractors </em>was correct, this case is factually different from that case for at least three reasons:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-14\">(1) The municipality\u2019s cash flow problems were a reasonable explanation for its delay beyond the statutory 60-day requirement for paying refunds;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-15\">(2) The taxpayer failed to take advantage of its right to offset its May 1 tax payment obligation provided by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:4-8.2 and mitigate damages; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-16\">(3) The interest rate environment in 1993 made 5% \u2014 the statutory rate \u2014 a close approximation of the market rate. Whereas in <em>9W Contractors, </em>the court indicated that in the period with which it was dealing the statutory rate may have been below the market rate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-17\">In <em>Garden State Racing Ass\u2019n v. Township of Cherry Hill, </em>1 <em>N.J.Tax </em>569, 582-583 (Tax 1980), decided one month after <em>9W Contractors, supra, </em>this court made a distinction between pre- and post-judgment interest on tax refunds. There, too, I think we were in error. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:3-27.2 makes no such distinction. The provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2B:13-2, formerly <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:3A-4, are not authority for going beyond <em>N.J.S.A. </em>54:3-27.2\u2019s dear and exclusive authority for the payment of interest on local property tax refunds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>\n<em>II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-4\">The municipality argues that the 60-day period provided by N.J.S.A. 54:3-27.2 is a period during which there is a moratorium on the calculation of interest on refunds. There is simply no basis in logic or law for reaching that conclusion. Interest is paid at 5% per annum from the date of the payment of tax to the date of the payment of the refund. No more and no less.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">We agree with Judge Small that the statute is the sole source of authority for the imposition of interest in a case such as this. To the extent that the opinions in <em>9W Contractors, Inc. v. Englewood Cliffs Borough, </em>1 <em>N.J.Tax </em>465 (1980) and <em>Garden State Racing Ass\u2019n. v. Township of Cherry Hill, </em>1 <em>N.J.Tax </em>569 (1980) are contrary, they are disapproved.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Nothing in the recently decided case of <em>General Motors Corp. v. City of Linden, </em>279 <em>N.J.Super. </em>449, 653 A.2d 568 (App.Div.1995) supports a contrary view. That decision, which declared that tax assessors are not immune from suit under 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1983, is irrelevant to the issue <em>before </em>us which was not decided on any theory of immunity but on the basis of a lack of statutory or regulatory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">As to Judge Small\u2019s denial of counsel fees to plaintiff, we also affirm. There is simply no authority under the Tax Court rules or the Law Division rules for imposition of fees in a case such as this. <em>R. </em>8:9-2; <em>R. </em>4:42-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
