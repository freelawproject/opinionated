After a period of discovery, defendant moved for summary judgment. To that point plaintiff had alleged <em>only </em>orthopedic injuries that failed to satisfy the threshold standards of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a, as interpreted in <em>Oswin v. Shaw, </em>250 <em>N.J.Super. </em>461, 595 A.2d 522 (App.Div.1991), later affirmed by the Supreme Court, 129 <em>N.J. </em>290, 609 A.2d 415 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-12\">Prior to the hearing on the summary judgment motion, the parties concluded plaintiffs depositions. In fact, just two days before the return date of the motion, plaintiff first revealed in her deposition that she was making a \u201ccategory 5 claim,\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a, namely that she sustained a personal injury which caused the \u201closs of a fetus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Plaintiff submitted a supplemental affidavit at the hearing stating that on August 13, 1991, nearly two and one-half years following the accident, plaintiff was sent for a bone scan so that her orthopedic specialist could diagnose the cause of her \u201cpersistent, continued complaints of pain the left hip and both legs and low back with numbness.\u201d On the date of the bone scan, plaintiff did not know that she was approximately three weeks pregnant. Following the bone scan, when plaintiff discovered she was pregnant, her treating gynecologist \u201cstrongly recommended\u201d that plaintiff undergo a therapeutic abortion \u201cbecause of a high probability of a defective fetus.\u201d On November 27, 1991, plaintiffs twenty-fifth birthday, she underwent the therapeutic abortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Plaintiff urged in her submission to the trial judge that she felt that the \u201cabortion was directly caused by the [March 31, 1989] accident, since I had to undergo a [bone scan] test for the injuries sustained in the accident and had I not had the accident, the therapeutic abortion would not have to have been performed.\u201d Included in the record is an August 3, 1991 letter report of the orthopedic surgeon, Dr. David S. Wolkstein, stating that he had on July 29, 1991 examined plaintiff; that plaintiff described injuries in the March 31,1989 accident and her recurrent symptoms; and that he recommended that plaintiff have the \u201cbone scan with attention to the left hip and left femur.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">On January 10, 1992, the trial judge held a second hearing on defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion. The judge indicated that he was inclined to grant defendant\u2019s motion, but permitted plaintiff an \u201copportunity to submit additional documentation pertaining to the bone scan and the abortion.\u201d Plaintiff thereafter submitted the Muhlenberg Hospital records concerning an ultrasound examination in which the physician\u2019s notes stated that after an explanation of the problems by a physician, plaintiff \u201cdoes not desire to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>have abortion.\u201d Approximately two weeks later, however, plaintiff determined to have the abortion at the Eastern Women\u2019s Center in New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The trial judge\u2019s granting of defendant\u2019s motion was based in part upon his analysis of the bone scan as an intervening efficient cause breaking the chain of causation between the accident and the loss of the fetus. He agreed with defendant\u2019s contention that a blood test administered prior to the bone scan would have revealed the pregnancy, implying that it was the failure to accomplish this test that was the only substantial negligence factor in requiring the therapeutic abortion. The judge, however, was unaware that plaintiff did have a pre-scan pregnancy [blood] test prior to the bone scan. The test, however, yielded a negative result, and based upon that result, plaintiff agreed to submit to the two hour bone scan. The implication is that the blood test was inaccurate when administered when plaintiff was only three weeks pregnant. As she had not yet missed her first period, plaintiff herself was unaware of the pregnancy. Thus, there may not have been any intervening efficient cause, as assumed by the trial judge.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">This unhappy coincidence of the bone scan being performed in the narrow period before there was any awareness of plaintiffs pregnancy at least raised a fact issue concerning whether the accident remained a proximate cause of the loss of the fetus. The existence of proximate causes and intervening causes are factual issues which must be resolved by the jury. <em>Scafidi v. Seiler, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>93, 101, 574 A.2d 398 (1990); <em>Rappaport v. Nichols, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>188, 203, 156 A.2d 1 (1959); <em>Strumph v. Schering Corp., </em>256 <em>N.J.Super. </em>309, 319-320, 606 A.2d 1140 (App.Div.), <em>certif. granted, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>33, 626 A.2d 1090 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>There is no question that the loss of a fetus due to an unknown pregnancy and the administration of diagnostic x-rays is a proper element of damages in an automobile negligence action. <em>See Bendar v. Rosen, </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>219, 588 A.2d 1264 (App.Div.1991). The basic difference between <em>Bendar </em>and the case before us is that there the plaintiff was pregnant at the time of the automobile accident and had immediate diagnostic x-rays at the time when she thought she could not be pregnant because of a tubal-ligation sterilization procedure she had undergone sometime earlier. Although the plaintiff in the case before us incidentally was also pregnant at the time of her automobile accident, that pregnancy is irrelevant to this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The fact that she had diagnostic x-rays two years following the accident (to discover the cause of pain which allegedly had continued from the time of the accident through the date of the bone scan) provides a sufficient causal connection between the accident and the bone scan to bring this case within the reasoning in <em>Bendar.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Even if there had been some negligence on the part of the hospital in performing the pregnancy test prior to the bone scan, there is no requirement that either the accident or the alleged negligence of the hospital be the sole proximate cause of plaintiffs injury. As we noted in <em>Bendar, </em>a jury had \u201cdetermined that both the drivers\u2019 negligence and the negligence of Dr. Berman were proximate causes of plaintiffs injuries associated with the termination of her last pregnancy.\u201d 247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 239, 588 A.2d 1264. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">[T]o be a proximate cause, ... conduct need only be a cause which sets off <em>e </em>foreseeable sequence of consequences, unbroken by any superseding cause, and which is a substantial factor in producing the particular injury____ The tortfeasor need not foresee the precise injury; it is enough that the type of injury be with an objective \u2018realm of foreseeability.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-10\">[Pjlaintiff specifically testified that a significant consideration in her decision [to have the abortion] was the danger that the x-rays had deformed the fetus____ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>While causation certainly remained a fact issue, the jury could properly have resolved it against the automobile defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 229-230, 588 A.2d 1264.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">In <em>Bendar </em>as here, the defendants argued that they could not have anticipated that a plaintiff would be unaware of her pregnancy when she underwent diagnostic x-rays. <em>Id. </em>at 230, 588 A.2d 1264. We rejected this argument in <em>Bendar, </em>stating that \u201cit is foreseeable that an accident victim may seek medical treatment\u201d and a tortfeasor \u201cmay be liable for the damaging effect of the treatment even if it was performed negligently----\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">There is no question that there may be any number of causes intervening between a negligent act and a final injurious occurrence. If they are reasonably foreseeable, each intermediate cause may be deemed a proximate result of the first wrongful act. The original negligence is deemed to continue and operate contemporaneously with all intervening acts of negligence that might' reasonably be foreseeable, so that the original negligence is regarded as a concurrent cause of the final resulting injury. The causal connection may be broken by a superseding intervening cause. Such a cause must be one that so entirely supersedes the operation of the first tortfeasor\u2019s negligence that it alone caused the injury, without the first tortfeasor\u2019s negligence contributing thereto in any material way. But where the original tortfeasor\u2019s negligence is an essential link in the chain of causation, such a causal connection is not broken if the intervening cause is one which might, in the natural and ordinary course of things, be anticipated as not entirely improbable. <em>See generally Scafidi v. Seiler, supra, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>at 101, 574 A.2d 398; <em>Kelly v. Gwinnell, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>538, 543, 476 A.2d 1219 (1984); <em>Panas v. New Jersey Natural Gas Co., </em>59 <em>N.J. </em>255, 258-259, 281 A.2d 520 (1971); <em>Rappaport v. Nichols, supra, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>at 203, 156 A.2d 1; <em>Menth v. Breeze Corp., Inc., </em>4 <em>N.J. </em>428, 441-442, 73 A.2d 183 (1950); <em>Daniel v. Gielty Trucking Co., </em>116 <em>N.J.L. </em>172, 173-174, 182 A. 638 (E. &amp; A. 1936); <em>Daniel v. State of New Jersey, Dept. of Transp., </em>239 <em>N. J.Super. </em>563, 595, 571 A.2d 1329 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>325, 585 A.2d 343 (1990); <em>Skripek v. Bergamo, </em>200 <em>N.J.Super. </em>620, 634, 491 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>A.2d 1336 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>303, 508 A.2d 189 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Plaintiffs orthopedic injuries were clearly insufficient to satisfy the standards of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a. Under the interpretation of the statute in <em>Oswin v. Shaw, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>290, 319-320, 609 A.2d 415 (1992), there was <em>\u201cobjective, credible </em>evidence that could support a jury finding\u201d that there was a \u201cserious impact on plaintiffs life.\u201d The Court found that \u201cthe Legislature sought to guard against a finding of \u2018serious injury<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> when plaintiffs proofs are based solely on subjective complaints of pain.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>We might question whether the subjective complaints advanced by plaintiff in this case, recurring over a period of years and occasioning the bone scan, might not have satisfied the statutory standard, but the Supreme Court has settled this issue in <em>Oswin. </em>The orthopedic injuries do not satisfy the type 6, type 7, type 8, or type 9 injuries in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a. <em>See Oswin, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>at 315, 609 A.2d 415. A description of the symptoms experienced by plaintiff may well be admissible at trial but solely to support the reason for which the bone scan was prescribed by her physician and plaintiffs agreement to the procedure. There should, however, be a suitable limiting instruction. <em>See Evid.R. </em>6. Plaintiff has, however, properly alleged a type 5 injury (\u201closs of a fetus\u201d) for which an action is permitted under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-8a.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">The judgment appealed from is reversed as to a type 5 injury only and is otherwise affirmed. The matter is remanded to the Law Division.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b441-8\"> She stated that she was referred to him \u201cbecause of her persistent left-sided hip pain radiating into the left lower extremity that occurs when sitting for longer than one-half hour or standing for longer than twenty minutes,\u201d and that \"when sitting or standing for long periods of time, both of her legs \u2018go numb\u2019.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b442-7\"> The plaintiff has indicated, however, that she intends to file a separate suit against the laboratory that she contends negligently performed the pregnancy test.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b443-11\"> At the time of the accident plaintiff had been four months pregnant and delivered a normal, healthy baby.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
