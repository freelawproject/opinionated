The required fines, penalties and driver\u2019s license revocation were also imposed. On appeal, in addition to claiming without merit that his sentence is excessive, defendant contends that the inability he encountered before and during trial to obtain the address of co-defendant so that she could be compelled to appear and testify deprived him of his constitutional right to compulsory process and should have led to a granting of his motion to dismiss the indictment. Under the particular circumstances here, not the least of which consisted of less than enthusiastic prosecutorial cooperation, and despite the involvement of federal governmental officials and their outright refusal to assist, we are of the view that the prosecutor cannot have it both ways. If he wishes to pursue the charges against defendant, he cannot stonewall defendant\u2019s diligent efforts to obtain the presence of the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">The facts that led to defendant\u2019s drug arrest and subsequent convictions ai\u2019e the following. During police surveillance, defendant was seen engaging in an exchange of \u201cpaper money\u201d for a \u201csmall object\u201d with co-defendant. According to the officers\u2019 version, defendant was the seller. When co-defendant was arrested she had two bags of cocaine in a pocket. Before defendant was arrested and after the alleged transaction with co-defendant, the officers claimed that they saw him go into a building, come back out shortly thereafter and take a tissue paper out of his pocket. He purportedly dropped it on the ground and walked away. Just before he was arrested, defendant also dropped a cigarette box on the ground which contained eight baggies of marijuana. The cigarette box was retrieved but a search of the area where the tissue was dropped was unsuccessful. The surveillance officer, however, who had several weeks before been involved in an automobile accident with defendant resulting in damage to his police vehicle, asserted that when he went to the location he was able to find a rolled-up white tissue paper containing a baggie with crack cocaine. Defendant admitted the marijuana was his but denied possession or distribution of the cocaine. He admitted that he had met co-defendant in the street but denied selling her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>drugs. He said that as they were talking she had dropped a shopping bag which he picked up for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Long before his trial, defendant commenced extensive efforts to procure co-defendant as a witness. According to his public defender at the time of a preindietment hearing, co-defendant \u201cvehemently\u201d denied purchasing drugs from defendant. To say she was a crucial defense witness is to put it mildly.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">In early 1992, defendant and co-defendant both received a plea offer. Counsel asserts that based upon his experience with the Passaic County Prosecutor\u2019s office, the normal policy would be that both would be treated as a \u201cpackage\u201d so that neither could take advantage of the plea offer unless the other did. Interestingly, the prosecutor has never denied this policy. Counsel discovered, however, in the fall of 1992 that co-defendant had entered a plea and had received a probationary sentence. When he contacted the Passaic County Probation officer assigned to co-defendant, he discovered that she had not been reporting and that her whereabouts was not known. He was told that the probation officer had been contacted by a Federal Drug Enforcement Special Agent who claimed that co-defendant had been admitted to the Federal Witness Protection Program and that the trial court would be formally so advised so that her probationary status could be revised. Such notice was never received and, as far as we can tell, co-defendant\u2019s noncompliance with her probation has never been pursued by the probation officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Obtaining this information, defense counsel commenced further efforts to ascertain co-defendant\u2019s whereabouts, status, and/or appearance, including serving a subpoena upon the D.E.A. Cooperation with both federal and state officials was nonexistent, even to the extent of either confirming or denying co-defendant\u2019s status in the Federal Witness Protection program. In November 1992, counsel filed a motion seeking, among other relief, an order directing the State to produce the current address of co-defendant, to produce her at trial, and to explain the circumstances of her plea and her entry into the Federal Witness Protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>program. Counsel also, pursuant to the Uniform Act to Secure the Attendance of Witnesses From Within or Without a State in Criminal Proceedings (Uniform Witness Act), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:81-18 to 23, requested that co-defendant be certified as a material witness and that her production pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:81-20 be ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The following is an exchange that occurred between the trial judge and the prosecutor that is fairly reflective of the tenor of the prosecutor\u2019s position on the motion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: Of course, there\u2019s no authority for this request that the defense attorney is citing. He cites a general case of <em>Brady v. Maryland</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-7\">But there is no case that he dtes in his brief even come close to supporting the position he\u2019s asking for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">THE COURT: It\u2019s a probation officer. The probation officer knows this witness is in the Witness Protection Program. And you come up here and say, how can I know. Well, the Probation Department knows.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: Would you .like me to talk to the probation officer and verify\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-10\">THE COURT: That\u2019s a thought.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-11\">[PROSECUTOR]: Why should I, No. 1, why should I accept what the defense attorney is saying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-12\">THE COURT: Because lawyers try to settle cases, try to resolve cases. It seems to me that if this witness, if you know \u2014 maybe you know where this witness is, maybe.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-13\">[PROSECUTOR]: I don\u2019t know where this witness is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-14\">THE COURT: You\u2019re telling me that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-15\">[PROSECUTOR]: I\u2019m telling you that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-16\">THE COURT: What have you done to try and find out this witness\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-17\">[PROSECUTOR]: I have done nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-18\">THE COURT: How do you know? You don\u2019t know where the witness is?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-19\">[PROSECUTOR]: I can go to the last address. You would like me to do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-20\">THE COURT: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-21\">[PROSECUTOR]: Would you like me to find out the last employer that the witness had?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-22\">THE COURT: The point I\u2019m making\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-23\">[PROSECUTOR]: Talk to the probation officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-24\">Can I represent the probation officer knows what somebody told that officer? It\u2019s hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-25\">Is that proof your Honor \u2014 I\u2019m assuming arguendo that that statement is accurate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>THE COURT: The problem is, the problem is you\u2019ve done nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: Why should I do anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">THE COURT: Because that\u2019s what lawyers do, things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: I don\u2019t want to settle this. There\u2019s nothing to settle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">The defense attorney\u2019s requests are outrageous. There\u2019s no case law to support it. They never even notified the Federal authorities, which I think he should do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-10\">Don\u2019t you think the interested party might be the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office; don\u2019t you think they might have something, an interest in this? There is a Federal statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-11\">Does the Court know very much \u2014 I don\u2019t know very much about the Federal statute. I don\u2019t deal with it at all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">The prosecutor\u2019s position was that he did not know anything about the matter and that he had no obligation to find out.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-13\">Defendant\u2019s motion was granted to the extent that the prosecutor was directed in part to provide co-defendant\u2019s last known address, determine whether she was in the Witness Protection Program and if so whether that was a factor in her plea offer. The trial judge declined to declare her a material witness pursuant to the Uniform Witness Act. He did, however, recognize that if she were not in the Witness Protection program \u201cthat\u2019s a whole different situation\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-14\">In response to the order that was entered in connection with the motion, the State\u2019s only response was that it had no information as to co-defendant\u2019s whereabouts, that as far as the prosecutor knew the State had not been involved in co-defendant\u2019s placement in the Witness Protection program and that her entry into that program could not be confirmed or denied. Defense counsel\u2019s subsequent subpoena upon the D.E.A. and request for the production of co-defendant for trial and production of her present address pursuant to 28 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 16.21, <em>et seq., </em>providing for the production or disclosure of information contained in the Department of Justice files, was equally fruitless. He thus moved to dismiss the indictment or alternatively for a hearing to ascertain the efforts of the State and/or an explanation for its inability to obtain the presence of the witness. Although we do not have a transcript of the argument, if any, on that motion or an order disposing of it, we are told it was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>At the <em>beginning of </em>the trial in September 1993, the motion was renewed. During the arguments thereon, the prosecutor for the first time represented that it had been determined that co-defendant was not in the Federal Witness Protection program or in \u201cany program\u201d but that she \u201chappens to be working for the D.E.A. out of state in Maryland and ... is not intending to come back to the State of New Jersey and the agents refuse to supply any current address to us at this point.\u201d In response to this, the trial judge observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">So, at this point she\u2019s out of state based upon the information that you gained, she is cooperating in some manner with some agency of the Federal Government.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-6\">So, she\u2019s no more available to you than she would be ... to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">He then denied the motion to dismiss the indictment. Despite the fact that Maryland has adopted the Uniform Witness Act, the trial judge did not consider the availability of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:81-20 to obtain her presence. <em>See Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc. </em>\u00a7 9-301. In this respect, we are convinced the trial judge erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">Up to the time of trial, and throughout the extensive efforts to locate co-defendant, defense counsel and the court had been led to believe that co-defendant was under the jurisdiction of the federal government pursuant to the Federal Witness Protection program. Although it plainly was early on within the power of the prosecutor to ascertain this, he made no effort to do so. Even when directed by the trial court to do so in response to defendant\u2019s initial motion, the response was equivocal \u2014 that is he could neither confirm nor deny her entry into the program. It was not until the day the trial commenced that the prosecutor verified that co-defendant was not in \u201cany\u201d federal program. At this point, we do not tarry long with admonitions upon the prosecutor\u2019s delay in obtaining that information.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">We concede that a potential witness placement in the Federal Witness Protection program poses substantial jurisdictional problems with the enforcement of a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to compulsory process. <em>See Commonwealth of Pa. v. Lahoud, </em>339 <em>Pa.Super. </em>59, 488 A.2d 307, 311-12 (1985). But co-defendant is in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>no such program. As the trial judge recognized, but did not act on, that changes the picture.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The prosecutor contends that, although not within the protection of the federal program, the trial court had no authority to compel out-of-state co-defendant\u2019s attendance and no authority to declare a mistrial. Our rejection of this contention is colored by the fact that her testimony was crucial to defendant\u2019s defense coupled with what we consider to be a clear lack of any good-faith diligence on the prosecutor\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">Preliminarily, we observe that the inherent power of the court to fashion needed and appropriate remedies to meet particular circumstances is without question and is as expansive as the need and circumstances require. <em>State v. Abbati, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>418, 427-29, 493 A.2d 513 (1985). Included in such remedies is the dismissal of criminal charges. \u201cIt has long been recognized that the judiciary has the inherent power to dismiss criminal charges, particularly where the prosecution of charges would violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d <em>State v. Gaffey, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>374, 383-84, 456 A.2d 511 (1983). <em>And see State v. Laganella, </em>144 <em>N.J.Super. </em>268, 365 A.2d 224 (App.Div.), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>256, 377 A.2d 652 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">We recognize that this power is not limitless. <em>See United States v. Santtini, </em>963 <em>F.</em>2d 585, 596-97 (3rd Cir.1992) (the judiciary may not impose its personal and private notions of \u201c \u2018fairness\u2019 on law enforcement officials, but does have a limited authority to affect prosecutorial actions when those actions are taken in viola tion of the Constitution ... [But] [a]s a general matter, even when actions by the prosecutor appear to deprive a criminal defendant of his constitutional right to present a defense, no remedy will lie for such infringement absent a showing that the government has caused unavailability of material evidence and has done so in bad faith.\u201d). <em>And see United States v. Valenzuela-Bernal, </em>458 <em>U.S. </em>858, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>3440, 73 L.Ed.2d 1193 (1982) (government\u2019s deportation of two witnesses who were illegal aliens did not warrant dismissal of indictment where government\u2019s determination that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>the witnesses did not possess evidence favorable to defendant was not made in bad-faith).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Our courts have, however, recognized the paramount importance of a criminal defendant\u2019s federal and state constitutional right of compulsory process and have not been shy in fashioning remedies for perceived deprivations thereof. <em>See State v. Fort, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>123, 131-32, 501 A.2d 140 (1985). There the Supreme Court reversed a conviction where co-defendants could not be called as witnesses for defendant because of a \u201cno testimony\u201d plea agreement imposed by the prosecutor as a condition of co-defendants\u2019 plea. In concluding that the \u201cno testimony\u201d agreement violated defendant\u2019s constitutional rights to due process and to present witnesses in his favor, the Supreme Court observed that \u201c[u]nderlying this conclusion is our belief that the trial, although inevitably an adversarial proceeding, is above all else a search for truth. That quest is better served when the State does not suppress the truth by sealing the lips of witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">And we have observed that the constitutional right to compulsory process must be \u201cexpansively applied\u201d and \u201chence that \u2018[t]he defendant\u2019s right of compulsory process is not limited to the subpoena power alone but extends to other coercive processes at the State\u2019s disposal ...\u2019\u201d <em>State v. King, </em>164 <em>N.J.Super. </em>330, 337, 396 A.2d 354 (App.Div.1978), <em>certif. denied, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>54, 404 A.2d 1154 (1979) (quoting Westen, <em>Confrontation and Compulsory Process: A Unified Theory of Evidence for Criminal Cases, </em>91 <em>Harv.L.Rev. </em>567, 588 (1978)). We there held that \u201cimplementation of defendant\u2019s constitutional right here required not only his right to subpoena the witness but also the exercise of the court\u2019s power to enforce the subpoena,\u201d <em>ibid, </em>and concluded that the trial judge erred in refusing to issue an arrest warrant for a material defense witness who refused to comply with defendant\u2019s subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">Here we are dealing with an out-of-state witness. But, critically, one that is not subject to the federal witness protection program. We need not, then, concern ourselves with the jurisdictional limitations that might be posed by that program. <em>N.J.S.A. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>2A:81-20 provides a procedure pursuant to which defendant can exercise his constitutional right without jurisdictional proscription. Application of that statute requires that the witness be material and that her address be known. <em>See State v. Smith, </em>87 <em>N.J.Super. </em>98, 103-04, 208 A.2d 171 (App.Div.1965). It is undisputed that co-defendant is a material witness. The real dilemma is defendant\u2019s inability to obtain her address so that the process required under the Uniform Witness Act can be served. And we place that dilemma directly at the feet of the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">We do not necessarily do so because the record reveals any misconduct or intentional withholding of information within the parameter of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 <em>U.S. </em>83, 83 <em>S.Ct. </em>1194, 10 <em>L.Ed.</em>2d 215 (1963). But as we have repeatedly stated, a prosecutor is not an advocate. His primary function is \u201cis not to convict, but to see that justice is done.\u201d <em>E.g. State v. Farrell, </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>99, 104-05, 293 A.2d 176 (1972). <em>See State v. Smith, </em>269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>86, 92, 634 A.2d 576 (App.Div.1993), <em>certif. denied, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>164, 644 A.2d 612 (1994). Once it was determined that co-defendant was not subject to the witness protection program and determined so late in the proceeding, we can discern of no reason why the prosecutor, in response to the earlier order that it ascertain her whereabouts, could do no more than ascertain that she was in Maryland and did not intend to return to New Jersey. At the very least, her absconding from probation should have triggered some more effort to ascertain her actual address. Regardless of whether she was cooperating with the D.E.A., nothing that has been presented to us would suggest the prosecutor is somehow legally precluded from ascertaining co-defendant\u2019s address so that defendant at the least can use the Uniform Witness Act to obtain her presence. <em>Cf. State v. Florez, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>570, 580-81, 636 A.2d 1040 (1994) (identity and address of informant who was an active participant in drug offense and material witness must be disclosed); <em>State v. Hunt, </em>184 <em>N.J.Super. </em>304, 310, 445 A.2d 1186 (Law Div.1981) (State\u2019s failure to provide address of informant who was crucial to the defense and then responding that it no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>longer possessed the information, along with other discovery misconduct, required dismissal of indictment). <em>But see Ferrari v. U.S., </em>244 <em>F.2d </em>132, 141-42 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, sub nom. </em>355 <em>U.S. </em>873, 78 <em>S.Ct. </em>124, 2 L.Ed.2d 78 (1957) (government was not obligated to find defendant\u2019s witness where witness\u2019 unavailability was not the result of government\u2019s \u201csuggestion, procurement, or negligence____\u201d); <em>State v. Stewart, </em>641 P.2d 895, 897 (Ariz.App.Ct.1982) (unavailability of deputy sheriff as a result of a previously scheduled leave of absence with no forwarding address did not deny defendant constitutional right to compulsory process where the sheriffs absence was not caused by.the State); <em>State v. Davis, </em>293 <em>N.W.2d </em>885, 887-88 (S.D.1980) (State\u2019s good-faith effort to obtain witness\u2019 testimony was not negated by failure to use Uniform Act where witness\u2019 address was unknown and witness\u2019 prior testimony was, therefore, admissible); <em>State v. Smith, </em>87 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 102-03, 208 A.2d 171 (constitutional right of compulsory process does not obligate State to compel witness\u2019 attendance who cannot be located within its jurisdiction and is not a guarantee that a witness requested by defendant will be produced at trial); <em>State v. Jones, </em>57 <em>N.J.Super. </em>260, 266-67, 154 A.2d 640 (App.Div.1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Compelling the prosecutor to engage in good-faith diligence to ascertain the whereabouts of a material out-of-state witness is not without precedence in this State. In <em>State v. Hamilton, </em>217 <em>N.J.Super. </em>51, 524 A.2d 1281 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>581, 531 A.2d 1355 (1987), we reversed an armed robbery conviction following a prior reversal and retrial. At the retrial, the State was permitted to use the prior testimony of a critical witness claiming the witness was \u201csomewhere in Virginia\u201d and unavailable. Efforts of the State consisted of its investigator contacting the witness\u2019 mother who would not provide his address and when it was learned that he was receiving welfare, contacting the Richmond Social Service Department which refused to disclose the address. On the basis of this, the State asserted that the witness was beyond the jurisdiction of the trial court and that the State was not able to procure his attendance. We disagreed. Pointing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>to the Uniform Witness Act, we noted that the State failed to invoke its provisions to obtain the presence of the witness. The State claimed that it could not do so because \u201cit had no information as to [the witness\u2019s] exact whereabouts.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 55, 524 A.2d 1281. In response to this, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">We are unpersuaded that the State acted with due diligence to procure Bunn\u2019s attendance. It appears to us that it did little more than make a number of telephone inquiries in New Jersey and of people in Virginia as to Bunn\u2019s whereabouts and thereafter acquiesced in their refusal to cooperate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">The State\u2019s investigation should not have been so easily thwarted. No effort was made to enlist the aid of local police or prosecuting authorities in the area of Richmond, Virginia to locate the witness or to secure the needed information from the witness\u2019 mother by any form of testimonial compulsion. Nor was any attempt made to locate Bunn through the Richmond public school authorities. Indeed, the State\u2019s investigator never even visited Virginia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">... The Supreme Court [of the United States] has also said that there are \u201cfew subjects, perhaps, upon which this Court and other courts have been more nearly unanimous than in their expressions of belief that the right of confrontation and cross-examination is an essential and fundamental requirement for the kind of fair trial which is this country\u2019s constitutional goal.\u201d <em>Pointer v. Texas, </em>380 <em>U.S. </em>400, 404, 85 <em>S.Ct. </em>1065, 1068, 13 L.Ed.2d 923, 927 (1965).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-9\">[Id.].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-10\"><em>And see State v. Maben, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>487, 501-02, 626 A.2d 63 (1993); <em>State v.

Page, </em>390 <em>U.S. </em>719, 723, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>1318, 1321, 20 L.Ed.2d 255 (1968) (while the fact that a witness was outside a court\u2019s jurisdiction may at one time have excused the prosecutor from producing the witness, \u201cdevelopments like the uniform act\u201d have \u201cincreased cooperation between the states themselves and between the states and the federal government\u201d requiring prosecutors to engage in diligent efforts to produce witnesses that may be beyond the court\u2019s jurisdiction). <em>See McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 253 at 756-57 (3d Ed.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">We recognize that these cases deal with the State\u2019s burden to locate out-of-state witnesses where it seeks to use their unavailability to justify admission of hearsay evidence. And we further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>recognize that generally a prosecutor does not have an obligation to obtain witnesses for a defendant \u201cin the absence of a showing that such witnesses were made unavailable through the suggestion, procurement, or negligence of the [prosecutor].\u201d <em>Ferrari, supra, </em>244 F.2d at 141. That burden is, however, appropriate when, as we view the circumstances here, the State seeks to pursue charges against a defendant after it has, even if by inaction, permitted a crucial defense witness to leave the State\u2019s jurisdiction. And by inaction, we point not only to the prosecutor\u2019s total lack of effort even to ascertain whether the witness was protected by a governmental program, but to what is plainly an acquiescence in the co-defendant\u2019s absconding from her probationary conditions. That acquiescence is as much a \u201csealing the lips of [the] witness\u201d as was the \u201cno testimony\u201d agreement in <em>State v. Fort, supra, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>at 131, 501 A.2d 140. Moreover, co-defendant\u2019s absconding from probation impinges upon the trial court\u2019s sentencing integrity. Most certainly her return to New Jersey could have been triggered by a violation of probation proceeding, a form of relief that defense counsel had requested. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:45-3a(1). Within that context, we see no reason why the prosecutor could not have been directed to exercise sufficient diligence to ascertain her whereabouts so that defendant\u2019s constitutional rights would not have been so easily trammelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">Finally, we briefly touch upon the State\u2019s contention that defendant was not harmed because the substance of the co-defendant\u2019s exculpatory statement was presented to \u2019 the jury through the testimony of defendant\u2019s then attorney to whom the statement was made and to which the prosecutor did not object. But as the defense counsel exclaimed when presented with this substitute and asked to consent: \u201c... it\u2019s like inviting a hungry man to a banquet and giving him the appetizer and sending him out the door.\u201d One needs only to read the transcript of the attorney\u2019s trial testimony to realize just how poor a substitute it was. When, for instance, the witness attempted to describe co-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>defendant\u2019s demeanor at the time she made the statement and explain that \u201cshe was quite irate,\u201d the trial judge interjected, \u201cNo, forget that\u201d and sustained the prosecutor\u2019s objection to the subsequent question \u201cwas there any indication you had either in her voice or demeanor that she was forced or being coerced?\u201d Further, although objected to and sustained, the prosecutor blatantly confronted the public defender with the proverbial \u201cdo you beat your wife question\u201d by asking \u201cMa\u2019am, do your clients normally tell you the truth?\u201d It was, moreover, fairly effectively brought out that her conversation with co-defendant was all of five minutes and that the conversation was not in the form of testimony in court or under oath. One needs little imagination to know what weight the jury gave to this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">That is not to say that co-defendant\u2019s own testimony would have produced any better results. But the point is that defendant has a constitutional right to take that chance. We can see no countervailing prosecutorial or State interests that would override that right. More particularly, under the circumstances here, we do not think it is enough for the prosecutor to take the position that he does not know of co-defendant\u2019s address and will not engage in good-faith efforts to obtain it to the end that the Uniform Witness Act cannot be utilized.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">We take note of the possibility that co-defendant is an informant for the D.E.A. and that disclosure of her address may raise some safety concerns. Based upon what has been presented to us, and considering the materiality of her testimony to the defense, we do not think such concerns would override the defendant\u2019s rights. <em>Cf. State v. Florez, supra, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>570, 636 A.2d 1040. But we also note the procedural protection that is afforded an out-of-state witness in the foreign state, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>2A:81-19; <em>Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc. </em>\u00a7 9-302.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings. If the prosecutor wishes to retry defendant, co-defendant\u2019s current address must be provided so that her presence can be compelled under the Uniform Witness Act. Since the prosecutor has never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>taken the position that there is some viable impediment to her production, aside from the Federal Witness Protection Program, which turns out not to be the ease, we will not address that event. Simply stated, the prosecutor has the choice of obtaining the necessary information to produce her at retrial, or accept a dismissal of the charges.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
