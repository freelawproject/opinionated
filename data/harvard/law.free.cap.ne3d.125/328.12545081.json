Finding that genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether Mills was unjustly enriched and, if so, the extent to which she was unjustly enriched, we reverse the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Cleveland Central Catholic on its unjust enrichment claim and remand the case for further proceedings on that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual Background and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Mills is the mother of Kayla Anderson. In August 2013, Mills enrolled\n   Anderson at Cleveland Central Catholic for the 2013-2014 school year, Anderson's freshman year of high school. In connection with Anderson's enrollment at Cleveland Central Catholic, Mills paid a $150 registration fee and executed a registration deposit form for the 2013-2014 school year (the \"registration deposit form\") that stated: \"I acknowledge that I am financially responsible for all costs incurred while my student is enrolled at Cleveland Central Catholic High School.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In August 2013, Mills executed an \"Educational Contract (Newly Enrolled Student)\" (the \"educational contract\"), which provided, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Tuition for the 2013-2014 school year is $7,590 plus a non-refundable registration fee. I (We) acknowledge that my (our) financial obligation for the tuition of my (our) son/daughter during the 2013-2014 school year at Cleveland Central Catholic High School is payable as designated in the\n   <em>\n    Parent-Student Handbook\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   With respect to a parent's \"financial obligations,\" the school's 2013-2014 parent-student handbook states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   In order for the school to be a good financial steward, tuition and fees must be paid on time. All payments will be made directly to Cleveland Central Catholic High School. Tuition payments are due by the 10th of each month, as stated in your Tuition Loan Contract. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Holdout Policy\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   A student whose tuition account is in arrears will be excluded from the following: class attendance, participation in all sporting activities, participation in school sponsored events until the account becomes current or payment arrangements are made. An account is considered in arrears if a parent/guardian is negligent in fulfilling their tuition obligation as stated in their Tuition Loan Contract by more than one month from their last payment due date. Parent/guardians will be informed in advance when their account becomes delinquent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Financial Awards\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   All assistance given from the school, Diocese of Cleveland, Cleveland Scholarship and Tutoring Program, and other outside sources is based on the student's attendance for a full year. The school reserves the right to adjust or rescind completely any and all financial aid at any time. Grants and scholarships are non-refundable and non-transferable. Financial awards are based on need, academics, student behavior, and school involvement.

The Cleveland Scholarship Program is a program administered by the Ohio Department of Education, through which the state awards scholarships or \"vouchers\" to parents of low income students (who would otherwise attend a public school in the Cleveland Metropolitan School District) towards the cost of tuition to attend a private school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Mills testified that when Anderson was finishing her eighth grade year at St. Stanislaus, she began looking at private high schools. Mills stated that she wanted her daughter to attend a private high school rather than a public high school because \"[s]he did pretty well in school\" and Mills \"thought it was more of a challenge for her.\" Mills testified that she could not have afforded the tuition at Cleveland Central Catholic without a voucher and would not have enrolled her daughter at the school had she known that she did not have a voucher that covered Anderson's tuition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 7} According to Mills, no one at Cleveland Central Catholic spoke to her about paying Anderson's tuition before she enrolled Anderson at the school. She, therefore, believed the school had all of the information it needed to ensure that Anderson's tuition voucher would carry over from her eighth grade year at St. Stanislaus to her freshman year at Cleveland Central Catholic. Mills testified that she first learned that there was a problem with her voucher \"at some point well into [Anderson's] freshman year\" when one of the school's secretaries contacted Mills regarding Anderson's unpaid tuition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Richard Goodrich, the director of finance and facilities for Cleveland Central Catholic,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   testified that \"roughly 85 percent\" of students attend the school on a voucher from the Cleveland Scholarship Program and that parents have to file an application to renew their vouchers every year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Goodrich stated that because Anderson had a voucher as an eighth grade student, Mills needed to renew the voucher for the 2013-2014 school year for it to apply to Anderson's freshman year at Cleveland Central Catholic. The deadline for requesting a voucher renewal for the 2013-2014 school year was in April 2013 - several months before Anderson applied to Cleveland Central Catholic. To renew her voucher, Mills needed to give her completed renewal application to a school (the school Anderson was then attending, Cleveland Central Catholic or another school that was willing to process the paperwork for her) that could submit the paperwork to the state on her behalf. Goodrich stated that because Mills did not timely submit the paperwork to renew her voucher for the 2013-2014 school year, she \"lost\" it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Goodrich could not state whether anyone at the school spoke with Mills about the status of her voucher prior to Anderson's enrollment; he could only say that all new students are given information regarding what needs to be done to obtain\n   a voucher and that \"[w]hether they follow through on that is up to them.\" He stated that if a parent forgets to turn in the necessary paperwork prior to the voucher deadline, the parent \"will be chased down, plain and simple,\" but that if a parent comes in after the state's voucher deadline, there is nothing the school can do. Goodrich stated that \"[t]he fact that [Mills] registered late caused her to miss the deadline.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 11} With respect to what the school told Mills about the payment of tuition for Anderson's freshman year, given that she had missed the voucher deadline, Goodrich testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Q. [A]s the rep for Cleveland Central Catholic High School, * * * you don't know whether anyone ever disclosed to Arvella Mills the fact that the deadline had passed and that she would owe full tuition to Cleveland Central Catholic; is that right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   A. No, she was informed of what the tuition was. She was also informed what the value of the voucher was. And so she was informed of that verbally. And she was also given a handbook that states that she is responsible for tuition. She is responsible for all of the tuition, whether she has a voucher or not. A voucher is just a means to help pay the tuition. She is still responsible because the voucher is given to her, it is not given to the school. So yes, she was told she would be responsible for the tuition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Q. * * * You don't know whether anyone disclosed to Arvella these two facts: One, that the deadline had passed and as a consequence of that * * * she would owe full tuition?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   A. She was given a handbook which states that she is responsible for tuition. So, yes, she was informed that she was responsible for tuition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Q. Does the handbook say that the deadline for the scholarship -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   A. No, because the deadline changes from year to year based on the State of Ohio. Again, that is not our deadline. That is not our - you know.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Q. I understand you don't set the deadline. What I'm asking, when Cleveland Central Catholic first met Ms. Mills, did they inform her that the deadline for the Cleveland Scholarship and Tutoring program had passed?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   A. That I can't answer. I don't know.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 12} According to Goodrich, the school knew in August 2013 that Mills did not have a voucher for the 2013-2014 school year. Goodrich testified that when a parent does not pay tuition in full, he or she is put on a monthly payment plan. Under the monthly payment plan, \"[t]here is no billing per se\"; parents are given their monthly payment information at the beginning of the school year and expected to make the monthly payments or earn tuition credits by performing volunteer service hours under the school's work program to pay the tuition. Under the school's work program, parents or students can earn tuition credit at a rate of $10 per hour, up to a maximum of 200 hours ($2,000) per year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Although he had no personal knowledge of such a conversation, Goodrich \"assumed\" that the admissions director or principal discussed the fact that she did not have a voucher with Mills at the time she signed the educational contract and that she would have been told at that time \"what she needs to pay on a monthly basis\" towards Anderson's tuition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Although Mills did not have a tuition voucher for the 2013-2014 school year, she did receive $1,500 in diocesan tuition assistance towards Anderson's tuition. Anderson also performed four hours of volunteer service in 2014, resulting in a $40 credit toward her tuition. At the end of\n   the 2013-2014 school year, the school's records showed that Mills owed $6,200 in tuition for 2013-2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Despite her unpaid tuition balance, Anderson continued to attend Cleveland Central Catholic during the 2014-2015 school year. Her tuition for that year was $7,990, plus a $150 registration fee. Mills timely completed the voucher application for 2014-2015 and Anderson was awarded a $5,700 voucher toward her 2014-2015 tuition from the Cleveland Scholarship Program. Mills also received $300 in diocesan tuition assistance, leaving a balance due of $1,940 ($1,790 tuition plus the $150 registration fee) for the 2014-2015 school year. In October 2014, Mills signed a form accepting the voucher for 2014-2015. In accepting the voucher, she agreed \"to abide by the regulations * * * governing the Cleveland Scholarship Program,\" including that \"[t]he scholarship amount shall only be applied toward school tuition,\" that she may be required to pay other fees and costs as prescribed in school policies\" and that she would \"be responsible for paying any difference between the scholarship amount and the school's tuition.\" There is no evidence in the record that Mills executed any registration forms, educational contracts or tuition contracts with Cleveland Central Catholic relating to Anderson's tuition for the 2014-2015 school year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 16} In the fall of 2014, the school placed Anderson on a tuition \"hold-out.\" Mills testified that she received a call from the school and was told that she owed approximately $8,000 and needed to start making payments towards Anderson's tuition. In December 2014, Mills made a $40 payment. In 2015, Anderson performed 27 hours of volunteer service, resulting in a $270 credit toward her tuition. At the conclusion of the 2014-2015 school year, Anderson's account showed a balance due of $7,888.19, consisting of $6,200 in unpaid tuition costs for 2013-2014, $1,670 in unpaid tuition/registration costs for 2014-2015 and a lost book fee of $18.19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Anderson did not return to Cleveland Central Catholic the following year. She attended Glenville High School, a public school, her junior and senior years and graduated from Glenville High School.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 18} On September 16, 2016, Cleveland Central Catholic filed suit against Mills in the Cleveland Municipal Court. The school alleged (1) that Mills was responsible for the balance of Anderson's tuition costs for the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 school years under R.C. 3103.03 and (2) that the school had demanded that Mills pay the amount owed and Mills had refused to do so. A \"tuition statement,\" dated March 30, 2016, was attached to the complaint showing an account balance of $7,888.19. A year later, the school filed an amended complaint, asserting an additional claim for unjust enrichment against Mills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Mills filed an answer denying liability for Anderson's tuition under R.C. 3103.03 and denying that she had been unjustly enriched by the school's education of Anderson. Mills asserted waiver, estoppel, unclean hands and the statute of frauds as affirmative defenses to the school's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 20} In January 2018, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Cleveland Central Catholic argued that it was entitled to summary judgment because (1) education is a \"necessary\" a parent is obligated to provide for his or her child under R.C. 3103.03, (2) Cleveland Central Catholic had conferred a known benefit upon Mills by educating her daughter for two years and (3) it would be unjust for Mills to retain that\n   benefit without paying for the education her daughter received.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Mills, in turn, argued that she was entitled to summary judgment because (1) a private school education is not a \"necessary\" under R.C. 3103.03 and (2) there was no genuine issue of material fact that Mills had not engaged in fraud, misrepresentation or bad faith - conduct Mills claimed was necessary in order for the school to prevail on its unjust enrichment claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 23} The trial court granted the school's motion for summary judgment, denied Mills' motion and entered judgment for the school in the amount of $7,888.19 plus postjudgment interest and costs. The trial court did not explain the reasoning for its decision other than to state that it found no genuine issue of material fact and concluded that Cleveland Central Catholic was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Mills appealed, raising the following two assignments of error for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 1:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   The trial court erred in granting CCCH's motion for summary judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 2:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   The trial court erred in denying Ms. Mills' motion for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 25} We review summary judgment rulings de novo, applying the same standard as the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Grafton v.

R.C. 3103.03(A) (\"The biological or adoptive parent of a minor child must support the parent's minor children out of the parent's property or by the parent's labor.\"). Where a third party provides \"necessaries\" for the support of an unemancipated minor, the third party may recover the reasonable value of those necessaries from the parent in accordance with R.C. 3103.03(D). That provision states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   If a parent neglects to support the parent's minor child in accordance with this section and if the minor child in question is unemancipated, any other person, in good faith, may supply the minor child with necessaries for the support of the minor child and recover the reasonable value of the necessaries supplied from the parent who neglected to support the minor child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Thus, a party who seeks to hold the parent of an unemancipated minor child liable for services rendered to that child under R.C. 3103.03(D) must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the party provided services to the child in good faith, that the services were necessary for the support of the child, that the parent neglected to provide those necessary services for the child and that the charges for those services were reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Child &amp; Adolescent Serv.

Distinguishing\n   <em>\n    Murton\n   </em>\n   , the court held that because the father specifically agreed to pay for his son's college education and no mention was made in the agreement regarding whether that education was to be at a public or private college, the father was obligated to pay for his son's education at the private college.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Mills argues that private school tuition can never be a \"necessary\" where \"a public school option exists.\" The school argues that once Mills chose to enroll Anderson at Cleveland Central Catholic, she effectively took away the public school option as a means of educating Anderson and was, therefore, responsible for reimbursing Cleveland Central Catholic for the cost of the private school education it provided to Anderson under R.C. 3103.03(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 37} A K-12 education is one of a child's basic needs. We cannot say, as a matter of law, that private school tuition could never qualify as a \"necessary\" for the support of a child under R.C. 3103.03(D). Depending on the public school options available in a given community and the particular needs and circumstances of a specific child in that community, there are certainly circumstances in which a private school education could constitute a \"necessary\" for a child's support. Upon our review of the record in this case, however, Cleveland Central Catholic did not meet its burden of presenting evidence of specific facts establishing each of the elements of a necessaries claim, including that (1) the private school education it provided to Anderson was a \"necessar[y] for [her] support\" under R.C. 3103.03(D) and (2) Mills had neglected to provide educational support for Anderson at the time it provided that education.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Civ.R. 56(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Cleveland Central Catholic presented no evidence that the public school education available to Anderson would not have met her needs. Mills testified that when she enrolled Anderson at Cleveland Central Catholic, she believed that Anderson's tuition costs would be covered by a tuition voucher - not that she would be required to personally pay Anderson's tuition costs. She further testified that if she had known she would not have a voucher to cover Anderson's tuition at Cleveland Central Catholic costs, she would have sent Anderson to public school.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Accordingly, the trial court erred in entering summary judgment in favor of Cleveland Central Catholic on its necessaries claim under R.C. 3103.03(D) and in denying summary judgment in favor of Mills on that claim.

In determining whether it was unjust to permit a defendant to retain a benefit conferred upon it by the plaintiff (and, if so, the appropriate relief to be awarded as a result of the unjust enrichment), \"the sum of the circumstances, as well as the equities involved in the case\" must be considered.\n   <em>\n    U.S. Health Practices\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20WL%20277291\">\n    2001 WL 277291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   {\u00b6 51} On the record before us, considering the totality of the circumstances and the equities involved in the case, we believe reasonable fact finders could disagree\n   at to whether Mills was unjustly enriched and, if so, the extent to which she was unjustly enriched. Accordingly, the trial court erred in entering summary judgment on Cleveland Central Catholic's unjust enrichment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   {\u00b6 52} In reaching this conclusion, we note that the circumstances and equities surrounding Anderson's tuition for 2013-2014 tuition and her tuition for 2014-2015 differ. With respect to Anderson's tuition for the 2013-2014 school year, Mills testified that she did not expect to be financially responsible for the cost of Anderson's tuition because she believed - albeit incorrectly - that the voucher she had received for Anderson's tuition the prior year would carry over to Cleveland Central Catholic.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Goodrich, the school knew Mills did not have a voucher in August 2013. However, there is no evidence the school notified Mills of that fact prior to Anderson's enrollment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mills testified that she first learned that there was a problem with Anderson's tuition voucher \"at some point well into [Anderson's] freshman year\" when one of the school's secretaries \"approached [her] about tuition payments.\" Although the school's parent-student handbook indicates that monthly tuition payments are to be made in accordance with \"your Tuition Loan Contract,\" there is no evidence that Mills was ever asked to execute a tuition loan contract for Anderson's tuition or was given any other information regarding expected payments towards Anderson's tuition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   {\u00b6 53} On the other hand, although Mills claimed that she would not have enrolled Anderson at Cleveland Central Catholic had she known that her tuition costs were not covered by a voucher, Mills did not withdraw Anderson from Cleveland Central Catholic once she learned that \"at some point well into [Anderson's] freshman year\" she did not have a voucher that covered Anderson's tuition at Cleveland Central Catholic. Rather, Anderson finished her freshman year at Cleveland Central Catholic and Mills applied for (and received) a voucher covering part of the tuition costs for Anderson's sophomore year at Cleveland Central Catholic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   {\u00b6 54} With respect to Anderson's tuition for the 2014-2015 school year, there is evidence that when Mills accepted the Cleveland Scholarship for 2014-2015, she knew the voucher she received would cover only part of Anderson's tuition costs and that she or Anderson would have to either pay the balance due on her tuition ($1,940) or perform volunteer services hours through the school's work program to make up the difference. Although Mills or Anderson could have performed sufficient volunteer service hours to cover the balance due on Anderson's tuition for 2014-2015, Anderson performed only 27 volunteer service hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   {\u00b6 55} Given that genuine issues of material fact remain as to whether Mills was unjustly enriched and, if so, the extent to which she was unjustly enriched, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment\n   in favor of Cleveland Central Catholic on its unjust enrichment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   {\u00b6 56} We sustain Mills' first and second assignments of error in part and overrule them in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   {\u00b6 57} Judgment reversed; case remanded for further proceedings on Cleveland Central Catholic's unjust enrichment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   ANITA LASTER MAYS, J., and LARRY A.

However, the document was an exhibit to the deposition of Richard Goodrich that was filed with the trial court along with the deposition transcript.
