(\"JCI\"), for lack of personal jurisdiction. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background and Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Hall, a resident of the city of Bloomingdale, Jefferson County, Ohio from 1965 to 2009, was allegedly exposed to asbestos during his 31 years of employment (1965 to 1996) at National Steel Corporation, Weirton Steel Division (\"Weirton\"), located in the city of Weirton, Hancock County, West Virginia.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hall was also exposed to asbestos while performing personal automobile brake repairs and home remodeling projects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Hall developed malignant mesothelioma and, on March 2, 2010, filed a product liability suit against multiple parties including JCI. Hall alleged that the parties manufactured or distributed asbestos-containing products that were used in Weirton's operations during Hall's employment. Hall died on July 31, 2010, and Case was substituted as the representative of the estate and heirs in the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The case was placed on the specialized asbestos docket of the Cuyahoga Common Pleas Court. JCI filed notices of appearance on April 12, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Case argues that JCI actively participated in the litigation for more than seven years by filing over 30 notices, motions, and replies as well as exchanging correspondence. On June 1, 2012, JCI moved to transfer the case to Hancock County, West Virginia or Jefferson County, Ohio based on the doctrine of forum non conveniens. The trial court denied the request. JCI remained active in the case and participated in discovery as well as\n   designated experts, witnesses, and exhibits for the May 3, 2017 trial date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On March 9, 2017, JCI moved to continue the trial to conduct destructive testing of pathology materials and asserted that the parties were diligently working toward trial preparation. JCI's attorneys obtained pro hac vice admission and collaborated on joint motions, case management orders, and amendments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On August 3, 2017, JCI filed a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. JCI argued that it is incorporated in Delaware with a principal place of business in Illinois and that it does not reside in Ohio. The trial court granted leave for JCI to develop the jurisdictional challenge and entertained oral arguments on August 30 and August 31, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On November 7, 2017, the trial court entered a final order granting the motion to dismiss without prejudice, finding that JCI\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [p]reserved its right to raise all affirmative defenses by the filing of counsel's notice of appearance (per this [c]ourt's Standing Order No. 7), and further that participation in the defense of this lawsuit did not waive the defense of lack of in personam jurisdiction (\n   <em>\n    per\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gliozzo v.

We find that\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable.

The court observed that Harris (1) failed to request an independent psychiatric examination or competency hearing; (2) filed a notice of alibi that directly conflicts with an insanity defense;\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (3) objected to the testimony of the court psychiatrist.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30-32.
