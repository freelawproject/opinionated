The Department raises five assignments of error for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   1. R.C. 5160.37(P) deprived the court of subject matter jurisdiction to proceed or certify a class.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   2. The court erred by including individuals in the class who repaid money before April 6, 2009.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   3. The court erred by finding that Civ.R. 23(B)(2) applied despite the fact that Plaintiffs' primary goal was monetary relief.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   4. The court erred by failing, while reviewing Civ.R. 23(B)(2) and (3), to examine whether any damage calculations would be made class-wide or would require mini-trials.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   5. The court erred by failing to determine whether class certification was clearly superior to the administrative proceedings under R.C. 5160.37(L).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Finding no merit to the Department's assignments of error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural History and Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On April 5, 2013, Michael Pivonka and Lisa Rijos, plaintiffs-appellees, filed a class action complaint for equitable relief in the court of common pleas against the Department. Prior to the instant litigation, plaintiffs separately recovered money from tort litigation against third parties, and the Department received a portion of plaintiffs' recoveries due to the fact that plaintiffs received Medicaid benefits in the form of payments for medical expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Specifically, in September 2005, Pivonka reached a settlement agreement with a third party whose negligence injured him. Pivonka received Medicaid benefits for his injuries. The Department collected $7,108.74 from Pivonka's settlement. In 2013, Rijos received a jury verdict based on injuries she suffered as the result of a negligent third party. She received Medicaid benefits that paid for her medical expenses. The Department collected $703.16 from that judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Plaintiffs' complaint alleged that they \"were forced to forfeit a portion of their tort recover[ies] to [the Department] pursuant to a demand by [the Department] of a right of subrogation pursuant to Section 5101.58 of the Ohio Revised Code.\" Plaintiffs' complaint alleged that the Department was unjustly enriched because the Department \"wrongfully collected\" monies from them as well as \"a class of similarly situated tort victims\" under R.C. 5101.58, which they argued was invalid according to two United States Supreme Court cases,\n   <em>\n    Arkansas Dept. of Health &amp; Human Servs. v.

As a result, the Department subsequently filed an answer, denying the allegations and asserting affirmative defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 9} In August 2013, the Department moved for summary judgment and opposed plaintiffs' motion for class certification. The Department argued that (1) plaintiffs did not meet the \"need requirement,\" (2) \"the proposed class does not distinguish between various types of potential class members[,]\" (3) plaintiffs failed to attach evidence to their motion, (4) plaintiffs \"will not be adequate class representatives because they do not have meritorious claims[,]\" and (5) \"the class is improperly defined because there is only a four year statute of limitations.\" The Department also argued that\n   <em>\n    Wos\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ahlborn\n   </em>\n   were distinguishable, pointed to statutory interpretation rules related to R.C. 5101.58 that supported its position, and argued that R.C. 5101.58 is constitutional and that plaintiffs were not entitled to restitution. It additionally argued that Pivonka was barred from recovery because he settled his claim with the Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The plaintiffs filed a reply brief in support of their motion for class certification and filed a separate motion opposing the Department's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 11} In September 2015, the Department moved for a judgment on the pleadings. Plaintiffs opposed this motion as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The trial court denied the Department's motion for summary judgment and motion for judgment on the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The Department then filed a supplemental brief in opposition to class certification based on \"two significant developments that impact class certification: (1) the General Assembly has added an administrative process that permits individuals to request a hearing to challenge the default allocation in R.C. 5160.37 and former R.C. 5101.58,\" and (2) the Ohio Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Cullen v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3854109\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/137/373/\">\n    137 Ohio St.3d 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013-Ohio-4733\">\n    2013-Ohio-4733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=999%20N.E.2d%20614\">\n    999 N.E.2d 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 14} In December 2017, the trial court granted plaintiffs' motion for class certification. As to the Department's argument that plaintiffs' motion for class certification should be denied for lack of evidence, the trial court stated, \" Civil Rule 23 does not explicitly require evidence on a motion to certify a class.\" The trial court continued,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Here, there appear to be no material issues of fact about the course of the named plaintiffs' dealings with the [Department] and the dispute turns on the purely legal question of whether the department had any legal right to put a lien on tort recoveries of the named plaintiffs and the rest of the class. Other than the numerosity requirement of Civil Rule 23(A)(1), it is hard to see what evidence would make a difference to a determination of the other threshold class requirements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Turning to the Department's argument that the validity of the subrogation statute must be decided before class certification, the trial court stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [T]he essence of this lawsuit - the claim that the subrogation statute is invalid and thus anything collected under it must be restituted - is exactly what makes it suitable for class action status because it will settle the issue once in\n   one case for all class members. If anything, a determination on the merits is best made only after a class is certified, not before.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 16} The trial court then analyzed the requirements for maintaining a class action under Civ.R. 23(C) and the Department's arguments in opposition. The trial court found that plaintiffs' proposed class satisfied the identifiability, numerosity, commonality, and typicality requirements, that Pivonka and Rijos were adequate class representatives, and that there was adequacy of representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The trial court also rejected the Department's argument that plaintiffs' proposed class failed to distinguish between members who settled their claims and who paid upon request, stating, \"[I]f the money was collected under the authority of an illegal law then those distinctions do not matter because no payment was truly voluntary even if it was less than the department demanded.\" It also stated that if discovery revealed a reason to separate class members based on those factors, then it would create a subclass.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The trial court also addressed the Department's argument that plaintiffs' proposed class was ill-defined because it included members whose claims were barred by the four-year statute of limitations. The trial court rejected that argument, saying,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [T]he statute of limitations is an affirmative defense. If the defendant proves that the correct statute of limitations is four years, and not the six-year statute of limitations for the claim of unjust enrichment[,] then the class definition can be appropriately modified. * * * It would be unjust to exclude one-third of the class before the statute of limitations defense is proved.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Finally, the trial court found that plaintiffs satisfied the requirements in Civ.R. 23(B)(2) and (3). Noting plaintiffs' complaint sought a declaration \"that Ohio Revised Code 5101.58 is preempted by the federal Medicaid statute's anti-lien provision and is unconstitutional as violating the Supremacy Clause\" and \"a restitution Order in equity requiring Defendant to repay all amounts collected by Defendant pursuant to the invalid and unconstitutional Subrogation Statute[,]\" the trial court found that the plaintiffs satisfied Civ.R. 23(B)(2), which permits a class action when final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate. The trial court also found that plaintiffs satisfied the predominance and superiority requirements in Civ.R. 23(B)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 20} As a result, the trial court granted plaintiffs' motion for class certification, stating that the certified class includes \"[a]ll persons who paid any amount to defendant pursuant to O.R.C. 5101.58 from April 6, 2007, until April 5, 2013 [the date the lawsuit was filed], without requirement of court order.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 21} The Department now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Law and Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    A. A Background on Medicaid, R.C. 5101.58, and 5160.37\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 22} A background on Ohio's Medicaid structure is necessary before addressing the merits of this appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   The Medicaid program provides joint federal and state funding of medical care for individuals who cannot afford to pay their own medical costs. Although federal law does not compel states to participate in Medicaid, all states have chosen to join the program. Participating in Medicaid subjects the states to certain statutory requirements. Among those requirements is that the state agency charged with managing Medicaid must take reasonable measures to determine\n   the liability of third parties to pay for medical services and, if such liability is determined after the state has made payments for medical services, the agency must seek reimbursement for those payments to the extent of such liability.\n   <em>\n    Ahlborn\n   </em>\n   at 275-76 [\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276324\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/268/\">\n    126 S.Ct. 1752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ], citing 42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(25)(A) and (B) ;\n   <em>\n    Mulk v.

No. 707. Since its enactment, R.C. 5101.58 has been amended numerous times. There are three versions of the statute that are relevant to the present appeal: (1) the pre-September 2007 version; (2) the post-September 2007 version; and (3) the 2013 version.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Prior to September 2007, R.C. 5101.58 stated that \"the entire amount of any settlement or compromise of the action or claim, or any court award or judgment, is subject to the recovery right of the [D]epartment[.]\" 2003 Am.Sub.H.B. 95.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 26} In 2007, the General Assembly amended R.C. 5101.58's language, changing the amount that was subject to the Department's recovery. 2007 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 119. This version of the statute said that \"[a]fter fees, costs, and other expenses are deducted from the total judgment [or] settlement, * * * the [D]epartment * * * shall receive no less than one-half of the remaining amount, or the actual amount of medical assistance paid, whichever is less.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 27} In 2013, R.C. 5101.58 was amended again and renumbered as R.C. 5160.37. 2013 Am.Sub.H.B. No. 59. R.C. 5160.37 still gave the Department an \"automatic right of recovery * * * against the liability of a third party for the cost of medical assistance paid on behalf of the recipient.\" However, the statute stated that the Department's \"claim shall not exceed the amount of medical assistance paid * * * on behalf of the recipient.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Regarding the major amendments, R.C. 5160.37 also created a rebuttable presumption as to the amount that the Department could recover from an award or settlement. Subsection (G)(2) of the statute provided, \"After fees, costs, and other expenses are deducted from the total judgment, award, settlement, or compromise, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the [D]epartment * * * shall receive no less than one-half of the remaining amount, or the actual amount of medical assistance paid, whichever is less.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 29} The 2013 changes to R.C. 5160.37 also set forth the method for rebutting that presumption. To do so, a recipient must request a hearing and present \"clear and convincing evidence that a different allocation is warranted.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276324\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/268/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Additionally, R.C. 5160.37(M) added language providing a recipient the right to appeal a decision from the hearing examiner to the director of Medicaid as well as the right to file an appeal with the court of common pleas.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276324\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/268/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 30} R.C. 5160.37(P) further explained that subsections (L) and (N), which \"specify the sole remedy available to a party who claims the department * * * has received or is to receive more money than entitled to receive[,]\" \"are remedial in nature and [should] be liberally construed by the courts[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 31} With the above in mind, we now turn to the merits of this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 32} In its first assignment of error, the Department argues that the trial court (1) failed to review whether it had subject matter jurisdiction, (2) improperly ruled on class certification before addressing a challenge to its subject matter jurisdiction, and (3) lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The Department points to R.C. 5160.37(P), which states that subsections (L) and (N) - providing individuals a right to a hearing before the Department and a right to appeal the Department's decision to a court of common pleas - \"specify the sole remedy available to a party who claims the department * * * has received or is to receive more money than entitled to receive[.]\" In other words, the Department argues that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because R.C. 5160.37(P) gives the Department jurisdiction to hold a hearing on the matter and that the court of common pleas only has jurisdiction to hear an appeal from the Department's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 33} In response, plaintiffs argue in relevant part that failure to exhaust an administrative remedy is an affirmative defense and does not divest the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction. Plaintiffs also argue that the Department lacked the power to consider their constitutional challenge of the statute and, therefore, that they were not required to exhaust the administrative process set forth in R.C. 5160.37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Foremost, the Department's argument is that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the Department had exclusive jurisdiction, not that plaintiffs failed to exhaust administrative remedies. \"[F]ailure to exhaust administrative remedies does not effect [sic] a court's subject matter jurisdiction, but is an affirmative defense which must be timely asserted in an action or it will be considered waived.\"\n   <em>\n    Cleveland v.

R.C. 5160.37 amended R.C. 5101.58 to provide Medicaid beneficiaries with the opportunity for an administrative hearing to dispute the amount of recovery sought by the department, and R.C. 5160.37(F) provides that the hearing is \"the sole remedy available to party who claims the department has received or is to receive more money than entitled to receive.\" But the plaintiffs don't claim the department received more money than it was entitled to receive: they claim the department was not entitled to receive any money because it was demanded under an unlawful statute. Yet even if the new statutory administrative process is a bar to subject matter jurisdiction, that is in the nature of an affirmative defense and would apply across the class to bar both this class action lawsuit and individual lawsuits by the class members. As such, the claimed defect in subject matter jurisdiction may be a defense to the lawsuit itself but not to certification of class.

Moreover, after its above findings, the trial court stated that the Department's \"general arguments[,]\" including lack of subject matter jurisdiction, were \"not persuasive\" and then proceeded with analyzing class certification under Civ.R. 23.

The Department argues that the trial court erred because it should have addressed the applicable statute of limitations before certifying the class. In conjunction, the Department argues that the statute of limitations for plaintiffs' action is four years pursuant to R.C. 2305.07 because plaintiffs' claim seeks restitution, and therefore, the class should be limited to individuals who repaid money to Medicaid after April 6, 2009, which is within the four years of plaintiffs' filing of the complaint. Finally, the Department argues that the class the trial court certified was too broad and should not include individuals who repaid money to Medicaid between April 6 and September 28, 2007, because the version of R.C. 5101.58 that plaintiffs challenge did not exist at that time. It argues that because plaintiffs did not challenge the former version of R.C. 5101.58, any individuals who paid under the former statute should not be included in the class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   {\u00b6 53} In response, plaintiffs argue that the trial court was not required to consider or decide the statute of limitations issue before certifying their proposed class. They also argue that because they set forth a claim for unjust enrichment, the statute of limitations is six years pursuant to R.C. 2305.09.

To review, prior to September 2007, the statute stated that \"the entire amount of any settlement or compromise of the action or claim, or any court award or judgment, is subject to the recovery right of the department[.]\" 2003 Am.Sub.H.B. 95. In September 2007, the General Assembly amended the statute's language, changing the amount that was subject to the Department's recovery. 2007 Am.Sub.H.B. 119. In subsection (G)(2) of the revised version, the statute said that \"[a]fter fees, costs, and other expenses are deducted from the total judgment [or] settlement, * * * the department * * * shall receive no less than one-half of the remaining amount, or the actual amount of medical assistance paid, whichever is less.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   {\u00b6 67} While the Department is correct that plaintiffs' complaint references R.C. 5101.58(G)(2), the complaint also includes a number of broad statements referring only to R.C. 5101.58 without identifying a specific subsection. We will not nitpick plaintiffs' complaint and construe it as only challenging the constitutionality of the R.C. 5101.58 as amended in September 2007. We find that the trial court did not err in including individuals who paid under the pre-September 2007 version of R.C. 5101.58 in the class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   {\u00b6 68} As a result, we overrule the Department's second assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

The Department's third assignment of error argues that the trial court erred in finding that Civ.R. 23(B)(2) applied because the class was not cohesive.

If the trial court finds that R.C. 5101.58 is unconstitutional, then the Department lacked the necessary statutory authority to collect from plaintiffs, and disgorgement may be appropriate. This remedy may be appropriate regardless of the fact that the Department may be entitled to the funds under federal law. Hypothetically, this just means that the Department may simply have to disgorge the funds and then seek to recollect the funds under a valid statute.

Here, the Department's contention that the method for calculating damages - whether on a case-by-case or complete disgorgement basis -\n   should have occurred before class certification is without merit. The method of calculating damages will largely depend on the trial court's determination as to R.C. 5101.58's constitutionality.

The Department maintains that based on those reasons, the class is no longer cohesive because the trial court will need to hold individual evidentiary hearings to \"determine what the appropriate amount of the Medicaid lien would be in each case [or], at a minimum, to provide each class member an opportunity to request a hearing.\" In response, plaintiffs argue that federal law does not authorize the Department to collect on its liens without statutory authority. They also argue that complete disgorgement is proper because monies collected under unlawful statutes must be returned in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   {\u00b6 77} The Department's general statement that federal law authorizes it to collect on its liens is not entirely true. While \"Congress has directed [s]tates, in administering their Medicaid programs, to seek reimbursement for medical expenses incurred on behalf of beneficiaries[,] * * * [s]tates receiving Medicaid funds must also 'have in effect laws under which, * * * the [s]tate is considered to have acquired the rights of such individual[.]' \"\n   <em>\n    Wos\n   </em>\n   at 633,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407746\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/627/\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Put simply, the Department cannot solely rely on the federal Medicaid statute, 42 U.S.C. 1396, to collect on its liens. Instead, the Department also needs statutory authority for that collection. As a result, we reject the Department's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   {\u00b6 78} Further, we already addressed and rejected the Department's disgorgement argument above, finding that disgorgement may be a proper remedy and does not destroy cohesiveness. Accordingly, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that plaintiffs' proposed class satisfied Civ.R. 23(B)(2) and (3), and we overrule the Department's third and fourth assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Superiority to Administrative Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   {\u00b6 79} Finally, the Department argues in its fifth assigned error that the trial court failed to \"determine whether class certification was clearly superior to the administrative proceedings under R.C. 5160.37(L).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   {\u00b6 80} In response, plaintiffs argue that the administrative process set forth in R.C. 5160.37(L) did not exist at the time the Department demanded the payments from plaintiffs and that the statute, which they allege is substantive, cannot be applied retroactively. They also argue that it would be \"improper to demand [individuals to] produce evidence from years ago of the amount they received from Medicaid, the amounts they repaid, what portion of the amounts they received from third-parties were for medical expenses versus other types of damages, etc.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   {\u00b6 81} Under Civ.R. 23(B)(3), a class action must be \"superior to other available methods for the fair and efficient adjudication of the controversy.\" The factors used\n   to evaluate superiority of a class action include the interest of members of the class in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions; extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already commenced by or against members of the class; desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum; and difficulties likely to be encountered in the management of a class action. Civ.R. 23(B)(3)(a)-(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   {\u00b6 82} In finding superiority, the trial court stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   It is unlikely that there would be much individual interest by the class members in controlling separate actions. The class would be comprised mainly, if not completely, of low income Medicaid recipients who would not likely recognize cause of action and hire an attorney to pursue individual actions against sophisticated defendant. There is no evidence that there is similar litigation ongoing. Additionally, it seems desirable to concentrate the litigation in one forum and there are no peculiar difficulties that have been alleged that would affect the management of this action as class action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   {\u00b6 83} We agree with the trial court's findings. A class action is clearly the superior method to adjudicating the instant controversy based on the factors above, including the nonexistence of similar litigation, the strong likelihood that low income Medicaid recipients would not be likely or able to pursue separate actions, and the desirability of handling the controversy - the constitutionality of R.C. 5101.58 - in one adjudication. Class action treatment of this controversy would \"eliminate any potential danger of varying or inconsistent judgments, while providing a forum for the vindication of rights of groups of people who individually would be without effective strength to litigate their claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Hamilton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1323438\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/82/67/#p70\">\n    82 Ohio St.3d at 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=694%20N.E.2d%20442\">\n    694 N.E.2d 442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   {\u00b6 84} Further, as we explained in the above section addressing subject matter jurisdiction, the administrative process would not be superior to a class action lawsuit because the administrative body - in this case, the Department - lacks the ability to address the central issue of the case, the constitutionality of R.C. 5101.58.
