And based on the facts presented by the parties in their memoranda, this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    State v. Earley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4239378\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/145/281/\">\n    145 Ohio St.3d 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-4615\">\n    2015-Ohio-4615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20N.E.3d%20266\">\n    49 N.E.3d 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , probably applies to prevent merger of the aggravated-vehicular-homicide and driving-while-under-the-influence charges against appellee, Mario Wiley. I must dissent, however, from the majority's judgment summarily reversing the judgment of the Eighth District Court of Appeals based solely on\n   <em>\n    Earley\n   </em>\n   due to the other issues that are likely present in this appeal. Instead, I would grant jurisdiction over the state's appeal and allow the cause to be briefed before issuing a final decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 2}\n   </strong>\n   By summarily reversing the Eighth District's judgment based on\n   <em>\n    Earley\n   </em>\n   , this court in essence determines that the state's purported concession at Wiley's plea hearing that the aggravated-vehicular-homicide offense and the driving-while-under-the-influence offense may well be allied offenses of similar import, see\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018-Ohio-5352\">\n    2018-Ohio-5352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 24, has no effect on the trial court's allied-offenses analysis. While I believe that this court's decisions in\n   <em>\n    State v. Ruff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354463\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/143/114/\">\n    143 Ohio St.3d 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-995\">\n    2015-Ohio-995\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20N.E.3d%20892\">\n    34 N.E.3d 892\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Earley\n   </em>\n   make clear what the trial court is to consider in an allied-offenses analysis and that the state's purported concession likely makes no difference in that analysis, this court has not yet ruled on that specific issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 3}\n   </strong>\n   Furthermore, summarily reversing the Eighth District's judgment forecloses the possibility of addressing other issues that are affected by the application of\n   <em>\n    Earley\n   </em>\n   to this case, such as Wiley's ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. While there is certainly an argument that the applicability of\n   <em>\n    Earley\n   </em>\n   resolves Wiley's ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, as Wiley likely cannot show prejudice as required by\n   <em>\n    State v. Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1090819\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/89/323/#p327\">\n    89 Ohio St.3d 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 327,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=731%20N.E.2d%20645\">\n    731 N.E.2d 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000), this court should not make that determination summarily. Because of this issue, and perhaps others, this case should have the benefit of briefing and further review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    {\u00b6 4}\n   </strong>\n   In jurisdictional appeals, this court does not receive the record until we accept the cause for review. At this stage in the proceedings, I am not comfortable in this case, given the limited record, with simply reversing based on\n   <em>\n    Earley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4239378\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/145/281/\">\n    145 Ohio St.3d 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-4615\">\n    2015-Ohio-4615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20N.E.3d%20266\">\n    49 N.E.3d 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At the very least, the court should remand the cause to the court of appeals to reconsider Wiley's ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim in light of this court's determination that Earley indeed applies in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <author id=\"p-10\">\n    <strong>\n     {\u00b6 5}\n    </strong>\n    In order to give full consideration to the issues in this appeal, I would grant jurisdiction and allow the cause to be briefed before making a final decision. Therefore, I concur in the majority's judgment accepting jurisdiction over this cause, but I respectfully dissent from its summary reversal.\n   </author>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
