Const. art. 8, \u00a7 1. To help finance this lofty goal, our constitutional framers established a \"Common School fund,\" the principal of which \"may be increased, but shall never be diminished.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3. Among other sources of revenue, this Fund \"shall consist\" of \"all forfeitures which may accrue.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In implementing this constitutional command, Indiana's Civil Forfeiture Statute directs the transfer of proceeds from seized property \"to the treasurer of state for deposit in the common school fund.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2034-24-1-4\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7 34-24-1-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) (2018). But before these proceeds accrue to the Fund, the Statute permits the allocation of forfeiture revenue to reimburse law enforcement costs. Whether this cost offsetting is constitutional under article 8, section 2 has been \"an unresolved question\" by this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Serrano v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=946%20N.E.2d%201139\">\n    946 N.E.2d 1139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1142 n.3 (Ind. 2011). Today, however, we answer that question in the affirmative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2013, law-enforcement personnel seized two vehicles from Jeana and Jack Horner. The Marion County Prosecutor's Office filed a forfeiture action against the vehicles, claiming they had been used to transport marijuana. The Horners eventually recovered their vehicles after the underlying criminal charges were dismissed. Two and a half years later, the Horners and others sued, as \"Indiana citizens and taxpayers,\" to \"redress Marion County's profit-driven forfeiture program and to vindicate the public rights secured by Article 8 of the Indiana Constitution and the Civil Forfeiture Statute.\" Appellees' Supp. App. Vol. II, p. 6. In their claim against the Consolidated\n   <strong>\n    City\n   </strong>\n   of Indianapolis and Marion County and the Marion County\n   <strong>\n    Prosecutors Office,\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Taxpayers sought declaratory and injunctive relief, specifically alleging that the Indiana Civil Forfeiture\n   <strong>\n    Statute\n   </strong>\n   unconstitutionally diverts forfeiture revenue from the Common School Fund (or simply,\n   <strong>\n    the Fund\n   </strong>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Statute in force when Taxpayers sued authorized the prosecutor to file a complaint requesting the court to offset forfeiture revenue for reimbursement of case-specific \"law enforcement costs.\" I.C. \u00a7 34-24-1-3(a) (2011). If the prosecutor succeeded in showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the property was subject to forfeiture, the court would \"determine the amount of law enforcement costs\" and then order any remaining proceeds which exceeded those costs to \"be forfeited and transferred to the treasurer of state for deposit in the common school fund.\" I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 34-24-1-4(a), (d) (2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2018, however, the Indiana General Assembly amended the Statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pub. L. No. 47-2018, \u00a7 3,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20Ind.%20Acts%20270\">\n    2018 Ind. Acts 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 273-76 (pertinent section codified at I.C. \u00a7 34-24-1-4(d)(3) ). Under the new Statute-which became effective July 1, 2018-the prosecutor need not submit a formal request for the reimbursement of forfeiture-execution costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   I.C. \u00a7 34-24-1-3. And instead of using the case-specific reimbursement scheme, as under the former law, the new Statute outlines a specific formula for distributing these costs. First, if the prosecutor's office employs \"outside counsel\" to handle the forfeiture, the proceeds pay for any attorneys' fees accrued. I.C. \u00a7 34-24-1-4(d)(3)(A). Next, one-third of the remaining proceeds \"shall be deposited into the forfeiture fund established by the prosecuting attorney.\" I.C. \u00a7 34-24-1-4(d)(3)(B). Eighty-five percent of the residual balance then goes to either the law-enforcement office that executed the forfeiture or the state's general fund. I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 34-24-1-4(d)(3)(C), (D). The remaining ten percent is \"forfeited and transferred to the treasurer of state for deposit in the common school fund.\" I.C. \u00a7 34-24-1-4(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After the Governor signed the new Statute into law, but before it went into effect, Taxpayers moved to \"amend or supplement their complaint\" with a challenge to the new Statute. Appellant's App. Vol. II, p. 159. Both versions of the law, they argued, violated article 8, section 2 by offsetting\n   <strong>\n    any\n   </strong>\n   forfeiture proceeds intended for the Fund. The trial court denied this request and later granted summary judgment for the City, concluding that the Statute was constitutional because civil forfeitures \"were unknown in 1851 when Article 8, Section 2, was added to the Indiana Constitution.\" Appellant's App. Vol. II, p. 172.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Taxpayers appealed, requesting direct transfer to this Court under Appellate Rule 56(A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because this \"appeal involves a substantial question of law of great public importance,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20Ind.%20Acts%20270\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , we accepted jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The constitutionality of an Indiana statute is a pure question of law we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    City of Hammond v.

City's Br. at 16. The Prosecutor's Office adds that the scope of article 8, section 2 does not include civil forfeitures and that, even if it did, it confers no private right of enforcement.

By requiring a party to show a specific injury, the doctrine limits the judiciary to resolving concrete disputes between private litigants while leaving questions of public policy to the legislature and the executive. Indeed, standing \"precludes courts from becoming involved ... too far into the provinces of the other branches.\" Jon Laramore,\n   <em>\n    Indiana Constitutional Developments\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20Ind.%20L.%20Rev.%20929\">\n    37 Ind.

III,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Ind. Const. art. 7. But the express distribution-of-powers clause in our fundamental law performs a similar function, serving as a principal justification for judicial restraint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ind. Const. art. 3, \u00a7 1 (dividing the \"powers of the Government ... into three separate departments; the Legislative, the Executive including the Administrative, and the Judicial\").

With the courts, or through the franchise? With judges, or with our politically-accountable elected officials? Not every case discusses these broad questions, but they're always present in the pondering.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Here, the Prosecutor's Office and the City both argue that our constitutional framers intended no private right to enforce article 8. Because the Common School Fund is \" 'held by the State,' \" they insist, Prosecutor's Br. at 14 (quoting Ind. Const. art. 8, \u00a7 7 ), the State alone may enforce article 8's constitutional obligations,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-21.

From the mid-nineteenth century through today, our standing jurisprudence reveals a gradual shift toward judicial restraint.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On first impression, the early precedent on which the City and the Prosecutor's Office rely would seem to bolster their argument that the state alone may enforce article 8.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

For example, from 1836 to 1847, as the General Assembly incorporated various cities and towns across the state, legislation consistently permitted the payment of \"[a]ll\n   <strong>\n    expenses incurred\n   </strong>\n   in prosecuting for the recovery of any penalty or forfeiture.\" Act of Feb. 8, 1836, ch. 3, \u00a7 34,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1835%20Ind.%20Acts%208\">\n    1835 Ind.

Const. of 1816, art. XII, \u00a7 2 (emphasis added), only those proceeds remaining after this offset were \"paid to the treasurer for the use of said city,\" Act of Feb. 8, 1836, ch. 3, sec. 34, 1835 Ind. at 16. This section of the 1816 Constitution, as with its modern counterpart, contained no express language permitting the offsetting of costs. But, like the statute at issue in\n   <em>\n    Elliott\n   </em>\n   , these incorporation statutes-effective at the time of the 1850-51 Constitutional Convention-exhibit the framers' understanding that, even without express language permitting offset, the legislature can direct when and how forfeiture proceeds \"accrue\" or \"inure\" to the state. Indeed, this view tracks historical descriptions of certain revenue sources under section 2-forfeitures, criminal fines, and escheated estates-as \"incidental,\" or, \"contingent.\" Ind. Dep't of Public Instruction,\n   <em>\n    First Annual Report\n   </em>\n   45 (1852); Ind.

History surrounding article 8.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The history surrounding article 8 bolsters our plain reading of the text. In constitutional historical inquiries, we \"examine the state of things existing when the constitution or any part thereof was framed and adopted, to ascertain the old law, the mischief, and the remedy.\"\n   <em>\n    Bayh v.

Indeed, as Taxpayers maintain, the history of article 8 confirms that our constitutional framers \"created a dedicated school fund to stop government actors from siphoning money from educational objectives.\" Appellants' Br. at 32. But Taxpayers' view of the history surrounding article 8 omits important context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Following the passage of Indiana's first comprehensive school law in 1824, \"school revenue was inconsiderable\" due to the \"mismanagement of funds.\"\n   <em>\n    History of Education\n   </em>\n   at 26. Compounded by \"local indifference and sometimes legislative evasion,\" the school law \"was doomed to failure for lack of funds.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27. And despite \"very elaborate\" reform in 1833, \"progress was discouragingly slow.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32, 34. Even as Hoosiers approached mid-century, further attempts to safeguard school funding proved \"far from satisfactory.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38-39. In his address to the House of Representatives at the Twenty-Eighth Indiana General Assembly, Governor Samuel Bigger lamented that \"our school funds were not producing the fruits which we had a right to expect, but were in danger in many cases of being irretrievably lost.\" Indiana House Journal at 18 (Dec. 5, 1843). According to the governor, accountability measures were necessary to ensure \"the various education funds will be rendered much more secure and productive.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   And this concern carried over into the debates over our 1851 constitution. Delegate John I. Morrison, chairman of the committee on education, reported to the convention that, \"[i]n the present state of affairs, we have no means of ascertaining accurately, the true conditions\" of the state's school fund. 2\n   <em>\n    Report of the Debates and Proceedings of the Convention for the Revision of the Constitution of the State of Indiana\n   </em>\n   1860 (1851). According to Delegate Morrison, \"abundant evidence\" showed \"the danger to which the several educational funds are exposed,\" with thousands of dollars \"lost beyond recovery.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Still, despite the frustration shown by leaders during this period, we find no evidence of any steadfast commitment by the framers against the offsetting of proceeds collected from forfeitures or other contingent sources of revenue under section 2. To the contrary, the pre-accrual allocation of proceeds from these sources acted as a financial incentive to\n   <strong>\n    stimulate\n   </strong>\n   the Fund's growth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Just two years after the framers completed their work, William C. Larrabee, Indiana's first State Superintendent of Public Instruction, cited allegations in his second annual report to the General Assembly that public officers responsible for imposing \"fines for breaches of the penal laws of the State\" had \"fail[ed] to issue process for the collection of such fines,\" thus depriving the Fund of significant resources.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ind. Dep't of Public Instruction,\n   <em>\n    Second Annual Report of the Superintendent of Public Instruction for the State of Indiana\n   </em>\n   18 (1853).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Little had changed in the years that followed. In his 1865 report to the General Assembly, Superintendent Samuel L. Rugg speculated that, of the fines and forfeitures collected, there had \"probably been but little added\" to the Fund. Ind. Dep't of Public Instruction,\n   <em>\n    Thirteenth (Second Biennial) Report of the Superintendent of Public Instruction for the State of Indiana\n   </em>\n   17 (1865). The reason for this, he suggests, was the lack of a \"statute in force requiring officers to pay over or add to the school fund, the money collected upon forfeited recognizances, or upon any other kind of forfeitures.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18. Additional forfeiture proceeds, he concluded, would be unlikely, \"unless there is some provision of law giving it that direction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   By 1872, the pressing need to incentivize the collection of fines, forfeitures, and other contingent revenue sources had become a priority. That year, Superintendent Milton Hopkins pled with the General Assembly for some \"means of increasing\" the Common School Fund. Ind. Dep't of Public Instruction,\n   <em>\n    Twentieth (Sixth Biennial) Report of the Superintendent of Public Instruction for the State of Indiana\n   </em>\n   33 (1872). \"There is a wide spread belief ... among school officers and many others,\" he wrote, \"that the fines, forfeitures and unclaimed witness fees, that are the parts of both fund and revenue are not faithfully reported.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   To Hopkins, the dismal revenue stream at the time suggested that \"justice [was] not so faithfully administered.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In a circular issued that same year, Attorney General Bayless Hanna reminded the county commissioners \"that all fines assessed for breeches of the penal laws of the State, together with all forfeiture\n   which may accrue, and all unclaimed fees, constitute a part of the Common School fund.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34. Income from these sources, he concluded, should \"have resulted in vast revenues for the use of the State and the counties.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But an accounting by the state auditor revealed that \"a vast sum of money\" had either \"not been ... collected according to law\" or had \"been appropriated to personal gain.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   To correct this \"malfeasance,\" he urged the county commissioners to \"employ a competent Attorney, at reasonable compensation,\" to determine the extent to which \"fines, forfeitures and unclaimed fees ... belonging to the School Fund\" had \"not been accounted for.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34-35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The General Assembly responded to these pleas at its following legislative session in 1873. At the behest of Governor Conrad Baker, lawmakers adopted a measure requiring \"the Clerks of the several Circuit Courts\" to, among other things, \"forward to the Attorney General,\" at the close of each term, \"a statement of all fines assessed and forfeitures entered during such term.\" Act of Mar. 10, 1873, ch. 7, \u00a7 4,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1873%20Ind.%20Acts%2018\">\n    1873 Ind. Acts 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 19; 14 Brevier Legis. Rep. App., pp. 6-7 (1873) (message of Governor Baker to the General Assembly). The Act also required the attorney general to \"ascertain from time to time the amounts paid to any public officer\" for, among other revenue sources, \"money unclaimed in estates or guardianships, fines or forfeitures, or moneys that escheat to the State for want of heirs.\" Act of Mar. 10, 1873, ch. 7, \u00a7 9, 1873 Ind. Acts at 20. Should any public officer \"fail, neglect or refuse\" to collect those revenue proceeds, the Act authorized the attorney general to prosecute \"all necessary proceedings to compel the[ir] payment ... or recovery.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And to enable the attorney general \"to ascertain the facts,\" the Act required a full accounting from every public officer with \"custody of any such moneys.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   To measure progress, \"annual reports to the Secretary of State\" were to include statistics on \"[a]ll fines assessed and forfeitures entered in the State.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 10, 1873 Ind. Acts at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   As an incentive to prosecute these actions, the Act allocated to the attorney general, for \"all collections made or property recovered,\" a \"commission of twenty per cent. on the first thousand dollars, ten per cent. on sums not exceeding two thousand dollars, and on all sums exceeding two thousand dollars five per cent.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And to \"aid him in the discharge of his duties,\" the Act permitted the attorney general to employ assistants and to \"pay to them\n   <strong>\n    out of the sums so collected\n   </strong>\n   \" a commission \"not exceeding ten per cent.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 11, 1873 Ind. Acts at 20 (emphasis added). While the Act was expected to result in a \"considerable increase in the salary of the Attorney General,\" Governor Baker reasoned that such expense \"would be compensated fifty-fold by the increase of the school fund, by the collection of fines\n   and forfeitures that are lost to the State under the present system.\" 14 Brevier Legis. Rep. App., p. 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In 1879, this Court upheld the Act's compensation scheme. In\n   <em>\n    State v.

Second, I disagree that the current civil-forfeiture statute is constitutional. If the legislature enacts a civil-forfeiture scheme, the amount collected above the cost of obtaining the forfeiture must grow the Common School Fund.

Ultimately, I see no \"doctrinal obfuscation\" in these cases-they indicate that taxpayer standing is a category of public standing, and that public standing applies only when cautious judicial restraint is outweighed by the need for the Court to ensure government actors stay within the confines of their authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Under this Court's decisions in\n   <em>\n    Cittadine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Embry\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Meredith\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiffs here have public standing under the taxpayer category: they are taxpayers who have alleged a public harm caused by legislative action that exceeds a specific constitutional limit on the legislature's authority over the purse-a limit this Court is responsible for safeguarding against legislative overreach. Since the plaintiffs have standing under that category, the lead opinion's broader discussion of the public-standing doctrine is dicta. And it is dicta that imprudently drives a knife into not only the heart of the judiciary's duty to ensure that each branch of government stays within its assigned lane, but also this Court's precedent and integrity as a decision-making institution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Constitutionality of the Civil-Forfeiture Statute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   In my view, Article 8, Section 2 imposes a condition on civil-forfeiture legislation: all forfeitures, save offset costs, must go to the Common School Fund. And because the current civil-forfeiture statute does not designate to the Fund all forfeitures, above the costs of obtaining them, it is unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   My colleagues reason that since the legislature may enact no civil-forfeiture statute at all, it must have unlimited authority to determine whether, when, and how a forfeiture \"accrues\" under Article 8, Section 2. But that reasoning doesn't add up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   A constitutional provision that is \"not self acting\" can still limit governmental action. Put differently, the legislature may refrain from enacting a civil-forfeiture statute-but if it chooses to enact one, the Constitution may limit the legislature's authority in drawing the statute's contours. I believe Article 8, Section 2 does just that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The text, structure, and history of Article 8, Section 2 suggest that only the portion of a forfeiture that exceeds the cost of\n   collecting it accrues to the Fund. So, I would hold that \"all forfeitures which may accrue\" in Article 8, Section 2 is all civil forfeitures minus offset costs necessary to obtain each forfeiture. In other words, to the extent my colleagues hold that expenses incurred in obtaining the forfeiture are not part of a forfeiture that accrues, I agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   But Article 8, Section 2 does not permit allocations\n   <strong>\n    apart from\n   </strong>\n   offset costs. To the contrary, offset costs, including incentives necessary to collect the forfeiture, prevailed in Indiana's past\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   because they were a means to increase the Fund.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Act of Mar. 10, 1873, ch. 7, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 9, 11, 1873 Ind. Laws 18, 18-20. This Court has never held that a civil-forfeiture statute is constitutional even though the allocations bear no correlation to expenses incurred in obtaining the forfeiture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Here, under the current civil-forfeiture statute, any contributions to the Fund are not guaranteed and are capped at ten percent of the collected forfeiture. Without any showing that the allocations are offset costs of obtaining each forfeiture and that those offset costs serve to grow the Fund, the permissibility of offset costs does not save the statute from constitutional infirmity. Therefore, because the statute's allocation scheme does not increase the Fund or demonstrate a tie to expenses incurred in obtaining each forfeiture, the statute is unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   True, the plaintiffs here argue that Article 8, Section 2 permits no diversions from forfeitures, including offset costs. This argument goes too far. But the legislature also went too far. And it is our duty to ensure that each branch of government stays within the constitutional bounds of its authority. The majority's holding-that Article 8, Section 2 permits the legislature to essentially define \"accrue\"-not only makes that portion of the Constitution hollow; it also upsets the judiciary's vital role to interpret the Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   I therefore concur in part and dissent in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   David, J., joins in Part A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Slaughter, J., concurring in the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   I agree with the Court that the judgment below for Defendants and against Plaintiffs must be affirmed. But I reach that result for different reasons. I would hold that Plaintiffs lack standing under the\n   only standard consistent with our Constitution's mandate of separate governmental powers. In my view, Article 3, Section 1 requires, among other things, that a plaintiff suffer individualized injury in fact and not a generalized harm indistinct from the public at large. Our prevailing judicial doctrines that permit taxpayer and citizen (also known as public-interest) standing are incompatible with this constitutional command.

It also is central to separation of powers-the disbursal of governmental power among the three separate branches. A correct view of standing ensures that the complaining party is invoking the \"judicial power\", properly understood, and not asking the judiciary to ignore our constitutional structure or perform functions belonging to another branch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   As James Madison explained in The Federalist No. 47, the principal reason for separating governmental power was to protect liberty and avoid tyranny. \"The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.\" In the same essay, Madison addressed the threat to liberty if courts did not confine themselves to exercising judicial power. \"[T]here can be no liberty ... if the power of judging[ ] be not separated from the legislative and executive powers[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Madison's concerns are reflected in our own Indiana Constitution, which divides state government into \"three separate departments\": \"the Legislative, the Executive including the Administrative, and the Judicial\".

This delegation of the judicial power prompts this central question: What, precisely, are the contours of the \"judicial power\", which only courts may exercise?

Public standing refers to a private litigant's enforcement of a public right-often challenging governmental action believed to be illegal or unconstitutional. Taxpayer standing refers to a private litigant's specific kind of legal challenge-usually to an allegedly unlawful appropriation or expenditure of public funds. See\n   <em>\n    Embry v.

In\n   <em>\n    Pence\n   </em>\n   , we recognized a narrow exception to injury-in-fact standing in \"extreme circumstances\",\n   <extracted-citation index=\"289\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=652%20N.E.2d%20486\">\n    652 N.E.2d at 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , without specifying what that means or how it applies. More recently, in\n   <em>\n    Cittadine\n   </em>\n   , we relaxed that standard further and held that exceptions to traditional standing are not limited to extreme circumstances but reflect \"our exercise of judicial discretion with cautious restraint under the circumstances.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9119001\" index=\"290\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/790/978/\">\n    790 N.E.2d at 983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The assurance that we will exercise our discretion \"with cautious restraint\" is no restraint at all. Such a standardless benchmark for exercising the judicial power undermines the rule of law and amounts to an elastic, \"we-know-it-when-we-see-it\" yardstick that leaves standing principles open to the pleasure of courts. Yet courts are as susceptible as other human institutions to self-aggrandizement and the temptation to arrogate to ourselves power that properly belongs with others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Our fundamental law, ratified by the People in 1816 and again in 1851, recognized these risks. That is why these charters imposed strict limits on the exercise of governmental power, including the judicial power. And the only permissible exceptions to these strict limits were those each Constitution specifically authorized. Because courts have ultimate responsibility to say what the law is, we must be especially vigilant in resisting the allure of expanding our own authority by encroaching upon the power that the People committed to another branch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Our prevailing \"come-one-come-all\" approach to public and taxpayer standing does not, contrary to the Chief Justice's view, \"maintain\" separate governmental powers but undermines them. Our precedent authorizing generalized-injury standing, which the Chief Justice defends, proceeds from the erroneous premise that the only remedy for reining in an executive or legislature that has \"overstepped\" its legal authority lies with the courts. But not every legal wrong has a corresponding judicial remedy. Courts have no business entertaining suits to enforce the law brought by claimants lacking an actual, particularized injury. The recourse for such persons lies not in the courts but in the court of public opinion-meaning the electoral process and, ultimately, the ballot box. Such persons must make their case elsewhere-before politically accountable officials. As just one example, if unconstitutional legislation is threatened, those seeking to vindicate the public interest can petition the legislature not to enact it; they can persuade the governor not to enforce it; they can lobby the attorney general not to defend it. What they cannot do-unless the legislation aggrieves them personally-is obtain relief from the courts. This limitation on the role of courts is not a weakness of our system but one of its central strengths.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   I take seriously the strong pull of\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   . But if a prior decision is clearly wrong, we have no legitimate basis for perpetuating the error. Our obligation as state judges is to support, among other things, the \"Constitution of the State of Indiana\", not the erroneous judicial decisions interpreting it. I would revisit our standing precedent to the extent it permits claimants alleging only a generalized injury to vindicate public rights. That precedent cannot be reconciled with the system of divided governmental powers the People ratified in both our 1816 and 1851 Constitutions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Applying these principles here requires that we dismiss Plaintiffs' complaint. Police initially seized two of Plaintiffs' vehicles, belonging to the Horners, and the local prosecutor sought to forfeit them, claiming the Horners had used them to transport marijuana. The vehicles were eventually returned after the prosecutor dismissed the underlying criminal charges. The Horners and others later sued, alleging that Indiana's civil-forfeiture statute unlawfully diverts forfeiture proceeds from the common-school fund. Plaintiffs do not claim to have sustained an actual, particularized\n   injury from the allegedly unlawful diversion of forfeiture revenues. To the contrary, they acknowledge their standing is based on their status as \"citizens and taxpayers\" of Indiana, meaning their purported injury is indistinct from that of the public at large. The judicial power, properly understood, does not extend to such generalized grievances. We should dismiss Plaintiffs' complaint and not reach the merits of their constitutional claim.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-219\">\n    As I understand the public-standing doctrine, \"extreme circumstances\" include situations in which dispensing the general standing requirements serves to maintain the separation of powers or is necessary to check whether a government actor has overstepped a specific boundary to its authority.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-220\">\n    My colleagues appear to treat Part I of Justice Dickson's opinion in\n    <em>\n     Embry\n    </em>\n    as a two-justice plurality: Justice Dickson joined by Justice Rucker. But Justice Sullivan explicitly concurred with this part.\n    <em>\n     Embry v. O'Bannon\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9050908\" index=\"291\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/798/157/#p158\">\n     798 N.E.2d 157\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 167 (Ind. 2003) (Sullivan, J., concurring in part 1 and concurring in result in part 2) (\"I concur in part 1 of the Court's opinion[.]\"). True, Justice Sullivan wrote separately. But his separate concurrence did not alter his concurring vote with Justice Dickson's opinion on standing; it simply gave \"more detailed attention\" to that issue.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9050908\" index=\"292\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/798/157/#p158\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    And although Justice Boehm voted \"concur in result\" for the opinion as a whole, he wrote, \"I agree with the majority in the portion of its opinion concluding that plaintiffs have standing to assert their claims.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9050908\" index=\"293\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/798/157/#p158\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9050908\" index=\"293\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/798/157/#p158\">\n     at 169\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Boehm, J., concurring in result). So, the standing portion of Justice Dickson's\n    <em>\n     Embry\n    </em>\n    opinion garnered a majority with at least three-and possibly four-votes.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-221\">\n    Whether each of those allocation schemes was constitutional is less clear to me than to the majority. This Court never decided the constitutionality of those schemes. For example, in\n    <em>\n     State ex rel. Attorney General v. Denny\n    </em>\n    , the constitutionality of the statute was not before the Court.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1521031\" index=\"294\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ind/67/148/#p148\">\n     67 Ind. 148\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1879). Rather, the plaintiffs contended that the former attorney general's actions violated the statute, and the Court addressed only that contention.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1521031\" index=\"295\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ind/67/148/#p148\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Similarly,\n    <em>\n     State v. Elliott\n    </em>\n    was a divided opinion in the Court of Appeals, not a decision of the Indiana Supreme Court, and it did not directly address the statute's constitutionality under Article 8, Section 2.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1488034\" index=\"296\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ind-app/171/389/#p392\">\n     171 Ind. App. 389\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"297\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=357%20N.E.2d%20276\">\n     357 N.E.2d 276\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1976). That case concerned a plaintiff's attempt to recover funds that a judge had determined were mistakenly forfeited in the first place.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"298\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=357%20N.E.2d%20276\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"298\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=357%20N.E.2d%20276\">\n     at 390\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 357 N.E.2d at 277. The disagreement in the court was about whether that judicial determination permitted the plaintiff to recover the funds after they had arrived at their final destination, in the Treasurer's hands.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 391-93, 357 N.E.2d at 277-79. The majority determined that was too late, because by the time the Treasurer had the funds, \"such funds had clearly accrued to the Common School fund and could not properly be recovered,\"\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 393, 357 N.E.2d at 279. This conclusion, like the Court's decision in\n    <em>\n     Denny\n    </em>\n    , did not establish the statute's constitutionality under Article 8, Section 2. And each decision is far from a determination by this Court that the legislature has unlimited authority to define whether, when, and how accrual of a forfeiture occurs.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
