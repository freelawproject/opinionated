The trial court erred to the prejudice of appellants by granting appellee's motion for summary judgment based upon the presence of genuine issues of material fact regarding appellee's failure to provide sufficient evidence of entitlement to foreclosure and damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 2} After careful review of the record and relevant case law, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural and Factual History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On January 22, 2004, appellants executed a note payable to Wilmington Finance, a division of AIG Federal Savings Bank in the principal amount of $140,000. To secure payment of the note, appellants executed a mortgage on real property located in Euclid, Ohio (the \"property\") in favor of Wilmington Finance, a division of AIG Federal Savings Bank (the \"mortgage\"). The mortgage was recorded in the Cuyahoga County Recorder's Office on January 27, 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The note contains an undated allonge, which specifically endorses the note from Wilmington Finance to MorEquity. A second allonge attached to the note contains an endorsement in blank that is signed by a representative of MorEquity. On January 29, 2004, Wilmington Finance assigned the mortgage to MorEquity. The assignment of the mortgage was recorded on June 18, 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On January 21, 2012, appellants entered into a Home Affordable Modification Agreement. The agreement modified\n   certain terms of the loan and reflected an unpaid principal balance of $132,870.82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On March 17, 2017, MorEquity commenced this foreclosure action as a result of appellants' default under the terms of the note and mortgage due to nonpayment. The complaint did not seek a personal judgment against appellants because the note was discharged in bankruptcy proceedings. Rather, MorEquity sought to enforce its security interest and recover from the sale of the property the remaining principal amount due. Appellants filed an answer and raised numerous defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On August 9, 2017, MorEquity filed a motion for summary judgment. MorEquity asserted that \"as provided in the Note and Mortgage, Plaintiff has an absolute legal right, upon default, to accelerate and call due the balance due thereon.\" Attached to its motion was the affidavit of Yvonne Aguirre, a document execution specialist at Nationstar Mortgage L.L.C. (\"Nationstar\"). Aguirre averred that (1) Nationstar is the authorized loan servicer for MorEquity, Inc.; (2) she has personal knowledge of the facts set forth in her affidavit based upon a review of Nationstar's business records and her knowledge of Nationstar's procedures for creating those records; (3) MorEquity had possession of the note when the foreclosure complaint was filed; (4) appellants had defaulted on the note; (5) Nationstar mailed appellants a letter on October 29, 2015, that notified them of the default and their right to cure; (6) the appellants failed to cure the default; and (7) appellants owed $115,457.78 on the principal balance, plus interest, as of August 1, 2015. Attached to Aguirre's affidavit were verified and authenticated copies of the note, the mortgage, assignments of the mortgage, the loan modification agreement, the demand letter and notice of acceleration sent to appellants, and appellants' payment history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On September 8, 2017, appellants filed a brief in opposition to summary judgment, arguing that MorEquity (1) failed to comply with U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") regulations prior to initiating the foreclosure action, (2) failed to present sufficient evidence that it had standing to enforce the note and mortgage, and (3) failed to submit any specific evidence of compensable damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On October 18, 2017, a magistrate granted MorEquity's motion for summary judgment and issued a decision with findings of fact and conclusions of law. The magistrate's decision provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   There is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion which is adverse to the Defendants, Anthony R. Gombita and Rhonda Gombita, and that Plaintiff is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and therefore Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is granted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 10} On November 1, 2017, appellants filed objections to the magistrate's decision. On November 13, 2017, the trial court denied the appellants' objections and adopted the magistrate's decision granting summary judgment in favor of MorEquity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Appellants now appeal the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Under Civ.R. 56, summary judgment is appropriate when (1) no genuine issue as to any material fact exists, (2) the party moving for summary judgment is entitled to judgment as a matter of law and (3) viewing the evidence most strongly\n   in favor of the nonmoving party, reasonable minds can reach only one conclusion that is adverse to the nonmoving party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 13} On a motion for summary judgment, the moving party carries an initial burden of identifying specific facts in the record that demonstrate its entitlement to summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Dresher v.

Evidence of Default and Amount Due\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 40} In their third assignment of error, appellants argue that there remain genuine issues of material fact precluding summary judgment \"as to whether the account was truly in default\" and regarding \"the alleged amount due.\" Appellants contend that by failing to submit a complete \"competent, credible 'payment history' \" showing \"payments made, payments delinquent or otherwise,\" MorEquity failed to prove compensable damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 41} In support of their position, appellants direct this court's attention to\n   <em>\n    Charter One Bank, F.S.B. v. Kobenald Corp.\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist. Franklin No. 01AP-886,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2002%20WL%20433621\">\n    2002 WL 433621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mar. 21, 2002), for the proposition that Aguirre's \"vague statement of money due could not suffice as competent, credible evidence.\" After careful review, however, we find\n   <em>\n    Kobenald,\n   </em>\n   to be distinguishable from this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 42} In\n   <em>\n    Kobenald\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff-bank argued that the subject account was in\n   default based on the defendant's failure to make the December 1999 payment. Despite these allegations, however, the payment record submitted by the plaintiff only went through March 1999. The deficiencies in the payment record were material because an affiant for the defendant stated that defendant had made regular payments through the end of 1999.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. The defendant's affiant further stated that the defendant had two loans with the plaintiff that it paid with a single check each month.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, there was evidence from the bank's records that a payment had been received for the second loan in December 1999.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3. Given this conflicting evidence, the court concluded that summary judgment was not appropriate because the record was \"confusing and incomplete.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 43} By contrast, there is no conflicting evidence present in this case. MorEquity submitted a payment history that spanned from the time of the loan's origination until after the complaint for foreclosure was filed. Moreover, appellants' affidavit does not dispute that the loan was in default and appellants have not presented any evidence to suggest that loan payments were made, but not credited, during the relevant time period. Accordingly, we find appellants' reliance on\n   <em>\n    Kobenald\n   </em>\n   to be unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 44} This court has consistently held that \"[t]here is no requirement that a plaintiff provide a complete 'payment history' in order to establish its entitlement to summary judgment in a foreclosure action.\n   <em>\n    \"\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Matthews\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist.

Under these circumstances, we find the affidavit and supporting documents were sufficient to meet MorEquity's burden of establishing the amount due on the note. Moreover, beyond conclusory assertions, appellants have produced no evidence to controvert MorEquity's evidence regarding the amount due.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 46} We note that appellants' third assignment of error also sets forth various statements of law regarding compensatory damages and contract formation. However, appellants do not explain how these general legal principles apply to the facts of\n   their case. Rather, they simply make the conclusory assertions that \"[MorEquity] failed to prove compensable damages\" and \"[the] essential elements [for contract formation] were not proven by the appellee in the instant matter.\" The appellants do not further develop these arguments or point to any evidence in the record to support their conclusions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   App.R. 16(A)(7) and Loc.

Collectively, the documents incorporated into the affidavit attached to MorEquity's motion for summary judgment demonstrated (1) that MorEquity is the holder of the note and mortgage, (2) the chain of assignments and transfers, (3) that the mortgagor is in default, (4) that all conditions precedent have been satisfied, and (5) the amount of principal and interest due. In contrast, appellants did not submit Civ.R. 56(E) evidence setting forth specific facts demonstrating a genuine issue of material fact. Although appellants filed objections to the magistrate's decision, they failed to identify any evidence to support their claims and defenses. Because no genuine issues of material fact remain, the trial court did not err in adopting the magistrate's decision granting summary judgment in favor of MorEquity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 49} Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   EILEEN A.
