After a thorough review of the record and law, this court affirms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On March 27, 2017, K.A. was charged in a seven-count complaint in the juvenile court with the following crimes: Count 1, aggravated robbery in violation of R.C. 2911.01(A)(1), with three-year and one-year firearm specifications, a first-degree felony; Count 2, kidnapping in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(2), with three-year and one-year firearm specifications, a first-degree felony; Count 3, robbery in violation of R.C. 2911.02(A)(2), with three-year and one-year firearm specifications, a second-degree felony; Count 4, felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11(A)(2), with three-year and one-year firearm specifications, a second-degree felony; Count 5, tampering with evidence in violation of R.C. 2921.12(A)(1), a third-degree felony; Count 6, breaking and entering in violation of R.C. 2911.13(B), a fifth-degree felony; and Count 7, obstructing official business in violation of R.C. 2921.31(A), a second-degree misdemeanor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   K.A. was arraigned on the same day as the filing of the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Thereafter, on March 29, 2017, the state filed a motion in the juvenile court to have the matter transferred to the trial court pursuant to R.C. 2152.10(B). The juvenile court held a hearing, commonly known as a \"bind-over hearing,\" on the state's motion on June 12, and July 17, 2017. On August 14, 2017, the juvenile court issued a journal entry denying the state's motion. In particular, the juvenile court noted that the state provided insufficient evidence that K.A. was 16 years old at the time of the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On September 20, 2017, the state appealed the juvenile court's denial of the transfer motion pursuant to R.C. 2152.10(B). However, on December 13, 2017, the state filed a motion in this court voluntarily dismissing its appeal pursuant to App.R. 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Thereafter, the state sought an indictment against K.A. in adult court. On February 23, 2018, a grand jury returned an indictment for the alleged crimes. The indictment contained the same offenses as the juvenile complaint; however, Counts 1 and 2 contained \"mandatory\" and \"discretionary\" SYO specifications, and Counts 3, 4, and 5 contained only \"discretionary\" SYO specifications. K.A. then moved to have the indictment dismissed in the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Also, on March 9, 2018, a hearing was scheduled in the juvenile court on K.A.'s previously filed motion to suppress. The motion to suppress hearing was not held on that date; however, the juvenile court heard arguments related to K.A.'s motion to dismiss the indictment filed in the trial court. K.A. argued that because the complaint was filed in juvenile court without SYO specifications, the state could only seek a SYO through written notice pursuant to R.C. 2152.13(A)(4). The state however, argued that it could seek a SYO through an indictment at any time pursuant to R.C. 2152.13(A)(1). The juvenile court agreed with K.A., and dismissed the indictment finding that the state was required to file a written notice of intent to seek a SYO within 20 days of the bindover hearing. It is from that decision that the\n   state brings the instant appeal. The state assigns a sole assignment of error for our review.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   I.

Cuyahoga,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12536880\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/108/1287/\">\n    2018-Ohio-3680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12536880\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/108/1287/\">\n    108 N.E.3d 1287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The procedural facts in the instant matter are identical to the procedural facts in\n   <em>\n    T.S.\n   </em>\n   , namely that the complaint initially filed in juvenile court did not contain SYO specifications pursuant to R.C. 2152.13(A)(3) ; a subsequent grand jury indictment did contain SYO specifications; and thereafter, the juvenile court dismissed the indictment because the state failed to comply with the 20-day written notice of intent to seek a SYO pursuant to R.C. 2152.13(A)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 12} In the instant case, the state argues, as it did in\n   <em>\n    T.S.\n   </em>\n   , that it is not bound by the 20-day written notice requirement pursuant to R.C. 2152.13(A)(4) because it elected to pursue an indictment under division (A)(1). More specifically, the state argues that the \"notice provision of R.C. 2152.13(A)(4) is unnecessary in situations where an indictment is obtained.\" State's brief at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 13} In support of its argument, the state relies upon a case out of the Twelfth District,\n   <em>\n    In re J.B.\n   </em>\n   , 12th Dist. Butler No. CA2004-09-226,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005-Ohio-7029\">\n    2005-Ohio-7029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%203610482\">\n    2005 WL 3610482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which shared the same procedural facts of the instant case. In\n   <em>\n    J.B.\n   </em>\n   , the juvenile was charged with murder in the juvenile court in June 2003 and was thereafter indicted in July 2003. The complaint in the juvenile court did not contain SYO specifications. The indictment included SYO specifications. Thereafter, the juvenile filed a motion in the juvenile court to dismiss the indictment, arguing \"that because the state initiated the case by a complaint and not a grand jury indictment, the state was subject to certain statutory requirements\" which it failed to follow.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The Twelfth District denied the juvenile's motion. The court stated that \" R.C. 2152.021 and R.C. 2152.13 grant prosecutors the discretion to initiate serious youthful offender proceedings in four ways: via a grand jury indictment, a bill of information, a complaint, or a written notice of intent.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27. The Twelfth District also noted that \"nothing in R.C. 2152.021 or R.C. 2152.13 prohibits a prosecutor from initiating serious youthful offender proceedings via an indictment when a complaint has previously been filed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Twelfth District stated that because the prosecutor \"obtained an indictment under R.C. 2152.13(A)(1), R.C. 2152.13(A)(3) and (4) were not applicable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 15} To the extent that the state argues that this court should adopt the ruling by the Twelfth District in\n   <em>\n    J.B.\n   </em>\n   , we note that we are not bound by that court's ruling. Undeniably, the ruling in\n   <em>\n    J.B.\n   </em>\n   completely invalidates the plain reading of R.C. 2152.13(A)(3), (4) and (B). If we were to adopt the state's interpretation of R.C. 2152.13, the state would be able to \"initiate\" the process under (A)(4) and then yet again \"initiate\" the process under (A)(1), (2), or (3), if (A)(4) failed in any regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 16} In the instant case, we find, as this court did in\n   <em>\n    T.S.\n   </em>\n   , that if the state elects to initiate the SYO process by way of R.C. 2152.13(A)(4) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [T]he state must provide notice to the alleged delinquent child of its intent to pursue an indictment of the child as a serious youthful offender within 20 days of the juvenile court's determination to deny transfer. To hold otherwise would render divisions (A)(3), (A)(4) and (B) of R.C. 2152.13 superfluous. The point of both (A)(3) and (A)(4) is to provide notice to the child that the state intends to seek a SYO disposition. Once this occurs, the juvenile court is required, under\n   R.C. 2152.13(B) to \"hold a preliminary hearing to determine if there is probable cause that the child committed the act charged and is by age eligible for, or required to receive, a serious youthful offender dispositional sentence.\" If the court finds that such probable cause exists, the child is entitled to a speedy trial right pursuant to division (C).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    T.S.,\n   </em>\n   8th Dist.

Given the procedural facts of the instant matter, the state, pursuant to R.C. 2152.13(A)(4)(b), had 20 days from August 14, 2017, to file a timely written notice of intent to seek a SYO dispositional sentence. The statute is painfully clear in this regard, and \"[t]o hold otherwise would render divisions (A)(3), (A)(4) and (B) of R.C. 2152.13 superfluous.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Accordingly, because the state did not request a SYO dispositional sentence in the complaint pursuant to R.C. 2152.13(A)(3), or file a timely notice of its intent to do so pursuant to R.C. 2152.13(A)(4), the juvenile court did not error in dismissing the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The state's sole assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   MARY EILEEN KILBANE, P.J., and MARY J.
