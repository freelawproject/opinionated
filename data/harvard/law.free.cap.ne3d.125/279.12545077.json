(\"Dunlop\") and Fidelity and Deposit Company of Maryland (\"Fidelity\"), appeal a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas that granted in part and denied in part Dunlop and Fidelity's motion to stay the proceedings pending arbitration. For the following reasons, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In December 2014, the Columbus City Schools hired Dunlop to serve as the general contractor for the construction of the Columbus Africentric Early College K12 School.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 20, 2015, Dunlop and Intertech Security, LLC (\"Intertech\") entered into a contract in which Intertech agreed to perform the electrical work for the school construction project and Dunlop agreed to pay Intertech a specified sum for that work. That contract contained an arbitration provision, which in relevant part stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   Any and all claims, disputes, controversies, demands, and causes of action of whatever nature, kind or description arising from or relating to this Agreement, including without limitation contract, equity, tort or legal claims, and further including without limitation claims relating to rights of payment or interpretations hereof, between [Dunlop] and [Intertech] that are not resolved, as provided for in this Agreement, shall be subject to mandatory and binding arbitration, governed by RC Chapter 2711\n   and the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   (Ex. A, Mot. to Stay Pending Arbitration, at Article 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} After Intertech secured its position as the electrical subcontractor on the school construction project, it hired Wood &amp; Sons Electric, LLC (\"Wood\") to perform a portion of the electrical work. Wood's work, however, proved unsatisfactory, so Intertech asked plaintiff-appellee, Settle-Muter Electric Ltd. (\"SME\"), to replace Wood and perform the work originally allocated to Wood. SME refused. Dunlop then approached SME and promised that: (1) it would oversee administration of the submissions of SME's applications for payment to the Columbus City Schools; (2) it would ensure that SME would be paid on time every month for all work it performed; (3) SME would not have to correct any of Wood's completed work, which included the installation of wiring, boxes, fixture mounts, and subpanels; (4) SME would not be penalized for any additional work required due to Wood's unworkmanlike work; and (5) SME would report directly to Dunlop regardless of any contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Based on these representations, SME agreed to undertake the work and become a second-tier subcontractor on the school construction project. On August 21, 2015, Intertech and SME entered into contract setting forth the scope of SME's work and the amount Intertech would pay SME for that work. Intertech, however, did not comply with the contractual terms governing payment for SME's work. SME sought recourse from Dunlop, which assured SME that it would pay SME for its work.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Ultimately, according to SME, Intertech wrongfully withheld and failed to pay SME $466,933.11. SME filed and served claims against Dunlop's payment bond and Intertech's payment bond. Both Dunlop and Intertech refused to pay SME the money SME claimed was due and owed to it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On May 3, 2017, SME filed suit against Intertech and Dunlop, as well as RLI Insurance Company (\"RLI\"), which issued Intertech a payment bond, and Fidelity, which issued Dunlop a payment bond. Against Intertech, SME asserted claims for breach of contract, breach of the duties of good faith and fair dealing, breach of express and implied warranties, \"unjust enrichment/quantum meruit,\" \"fraud in the inducement/promissory fraud,\" and violation of the Prompt Payment Act, R.C. 4113.61. (Compl. at 9, 10.) Against Dunlop, SME asserted claims for breach of express and implied warranties, \"unjust enrichment/quantum meruit,\" \"fraud in the inducement/promissory fraud,\" and violation of the Prompt Payment Act, R.C. 4113.61.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Against RLI and Fidelity, SME sought recovery from the payment bonds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} All defendants answered the complaint. Additionally, Intertech filed a counterclaim against SME and a cross-claim against Dunlop. In the counterclaim, Intertech contended that SME had breached its contract with Intertech by refusing to complete all the contracted-for work, which forced Intertech to hire another contractor to do the work. Intertech also alleged that SME engaged in fraud when it misrepresented that (1) it had completed\n   100 percent of the contracted-for work, and (2) Intertech had approved a proposed change order that increased the contract price by $227,390.63. In the cross-claim, Intertech alleged that Dunlop owed it $764,109.84 for its work on the school construction project. Based on this allegation, Intertech asserted against Dunlop claims for breach of contract and violation of the Prompt Payment Act, R.C. 4113.61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On July 31, 2017, Dunlop and Fidelity moved pursuant to R.C. 2711.02(B) to stay all proceedings pending arbitration. In a judgment issued October 11, 2017, the trial court granted a stay of the litigation of Intertech's cross-claim against Dunlop, but denied a stay of the remainder of the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Dunlop and Fidelity (hereinafter \"appellants\") now appeal the October 11, 2017 judgment, and they assign the following error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The trial court erred as a matter of law in denying Appellants' Motion to Stay Proceedings in Part and failing to stay all claims and proceedings pending mandatory and binding arbitration between two of the parties, in accordance with Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2711.02(B) and Ohio law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 10} The standard under which a court of appeals reviews a judgment granting or denying a stay pending arbitration depends on the nature of the issues involved.\n   <em>\n    Hunter v.

Consequently, we will apply the de novo standard in reviewing the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The only arbitration provision at issue in this case is contained in the contract between Dunlop, the general contractor, and Intertech, the electrical subcontractor. The trial court concluded that Intertech's claims against Dunlop, asserted in the cross-claim, are arbitrable under that provision. The trial court, therefore, stayed litigation of Intertech's cross-claim. Intertech has not appealed this determination, so we do not review it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 12} In this appeal, appellants challenge the partial denial of their motion to stay, arguing that the stay issued did not go far enough. According to appellants, the trial court should have stayed the entire proceeding, including all SME's claims and Intertech's counterclaim, even though none of those claims is subject to the arbitration provision. In so arguing, appellants rely on R.C. 2711.02(B), which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   If any action is brought upon any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for arbitration, the court in which the action is pending, upon being satisfied that the issue involved in the action is referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for arbitration, shall on application of one of the\n   parties stay the trial of the action until the arbitration of the issue has been had in accordance with the agreement, provided the applicant for the stay is not in default in proceeding with arbitration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 13} As appellants point out, several Ohio courts have held that under R.C. 2711.02(B), when an action includes an arbitrable claim, a trial court must stay the entire action, regardless of whether the action also involves non-arbitrable claims and/or parties who cannot be compelled to arbitrate.\n   <em>\n    Harrison v. Winchester Place Nursing &amp; Rehab. Ctr.\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist.,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013-Ohio-3163\">\n    2013-Ohio-3163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=996%20N.E.2d%201001\">\n    996 N.E.2d 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 20-24 (summarizing relevant precedent). Appellants contend that, because Intertech asserted arbitrable claims against Dunlop in the cross-claim, R.C. 2711.02(B) requires a stay of the entirety of the case. This argument assumes that by authorizing a stay of an \"action,\" R.C. 2711.02(B) entitles a trial court to stay an entire case. Appellants' assumption, however, is incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Pursuant to R.C. 2307.01, \"[a]n action is an ordinary proceeding in a court of justice, involving process, pleadings, and ending in a judgment or decree, by which a party prosecutes another for the redress of a legal wrong, enforcement of a legal right, or the punishment of a public offense.\" Under this definition, an action arises whenever a party uses the process and procedures of the Ohio judicial system to seek a legal remedy from or against another party. Consequently, the filing and prosecution of a counterclaim constitutes an action.\n   <em>\n    Stults &amp; Assocs. v. United Mobile Homes, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 3d Dist. No. 9-97-66,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1998%20WL%20720471\">\n    1998 WL 720471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Oct. 14, 1998). Likewise, the filing and prosecution of a cross-claim constitutes an action.\n   <em>\n    P.K. Springfield, Inc. v. Hogan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1692048\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/86/764/#p769\">\n    86 Ohio App.3d 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 769,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=621%20N.E.2d%201253\">\n    621 N.E.2d 1253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Dist.1993).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Applying the definition of \"action\" set forth in R.C. 2307.01, this case consists of three actions: (1) SME's action against the four defendants, initiated by the complaint; (2) Intertech's action against SME, initiated by the counterclaim; and (3) Intertech's action against Dunlop, initiated by the cross-claim. Undisputedly, the issues involved in the cross-claim Intertech filed against Dunlop are \"referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for arbitration.\" As we stated above, Intertech and Dunlop are both parties to a contract containing an arbitration provision that covers Intertech's breach-of-contract and prompt-payment claims against Dunlop. Thus, R.C. 2711.02(B) compels the stay of litigation of the cross-claim until the completion of arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 16} However, nothing in R.C. 2711.02(B) requires the stay of the other two pending actions during the arbitration of the claims contained in the cross-claim. R.C. 2711.02(B) only obligates a trial court to stay the litigation of non-arbitrable claims if those claims are encompassed in the action stayed. SME's claims and Intertech's claims against SME are not part of the action instituted by the cross-claim. Consequently, the trial court did not err in concluding that R.C. 2711.02(B) did not mandate the stay of SME's claims or Intertech's claims against SME.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 17} We recognize that no court has interpreted R.C. 2711.02(B) using the definition of \"action\" found in R.C. 2307.01. However, \"it is well-settled 'that the General Assembly's own construction of its language, as provided by definitions, controls in the application of a statute.' \"\n   <em>\n    Montgomery Cty.
