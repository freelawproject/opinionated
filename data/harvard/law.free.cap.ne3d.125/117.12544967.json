Because defendant was provided with meaningful representation under this State's well-settled ineffective assistance of counsel standard, we conclude that the Appellate Division correctly denied his application. We, therefore, affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   In 1996, defendant was convicted, upon a jury verdict, of conspiracy in the first degree, murder in the second degree, two counts of attempted murder in the second degree, assault in the first and second degrees, criminal possession of a weapon in the second and third degrees, and criminal sale of a controlled substance in the second and third degrees. These convictions arose from defendant's membership in a narcotics trafficking organization, which enforced its control over its drug territory with extreme acts of violence. Defendant, who sold large quantities of crack cocaine to undercover police officers on multiple occasions, fulfilled the role of a \"manager,\" whose duties included enforcing discipline among the organization's workers, using physical force to protect the organization and its assets, and supervising street dealers for that organization. In one instance, defendant, together with his codefendants, fired approximately thirty bullets in a drive-by shooting, hitting three teenagers-a 14-year-old and two 15-year-olds. The shooting killed the 14-year-old and caused one of the surviving victims to suffer permanent disabilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   At sentencing, defendant denied responsibility for the shooting, expressly refused to apologize to the deceased victim's family, and laughed while the Court explained its sentencing determination. The court ultimately imposed consecutive sentences, whereby defendant received an aggregate term of 66\n   <sup>\n    2\n   </sup>\n   /\n   <sub>\n    3\n   </sub>\n   years to life in prison.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On his direct appeal to the Appellate Division, defendant was represented by assigned counsel, who raised four reviewable issues in a brief submitted on defendant's behalf. Specifically, appellate counsel argued that: at the time of defendant's arrest, the police conducted an illegal search, resulting in recovery of a loaded weapon and drugs that should have been suppressed; the trial court erroneously denied defendant's request for an adjournment to review certain evidence with his counsel before trial; the court illegally sealed the witness list, interfering with his ability to prepare for cross-examination of the People's witnesses; and the verdict on the conspiracy count was against the weight of the evidence. The Appellate Division affirmed the judgment of conviction, after considering and rejecting each of appellate counsel's arguments on the merits (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"505988,5348228,5350837,5347382,5353272\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/275/679/\">\n    275 A.D.2d 679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 680,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"505988\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/275/679/505988/\">\n    713 N.Y.S.2d 529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1st Dept. 2000] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Nearly two decades later, in 2017, defendant commenced this proceeding seeking a writ of error coram nobis and vacatur of the Appellate Division order affirming his conviction, based on his claim that appellate counsel's performance was constitutionally defective.

Indeed, appellate counsel raised four reviewable issues that triggered plenary review by the Appellate Division, which ultimately addressed each issue on the merits.

Our holding in this case does not change any of these well-settled precepts. Here, Judge Rivera's dissent emphasizes such things as appellate counsel's inferior writing style, punctuation, pagination, and the \"inexplicabl[e]\" ... insert[ion] ... of a six-page letter from trial counsel to the judge requesting an adjournment\" (Rivera, J., dissenting op. at 301, 101 N.Y.S.3d at 714, 125 N.E.3d at 129). That our colleagues quibble over such minuscule issues, largely exalting form over substance, is telling. Further, even their more substantive criticisms do not stand up to scrutiny. For example, Judge Rivera's dissent criticizes appellate counsel's failure to distinguish between legal sufficiency and weight of the evidence. Notably, inasmuch as the Appellate Division has authority to review both legal sufficiency and weight of the evidence, the discussion of both issues in an appellate brief directed to that Court does not demonstrate counsel's ineffectiveness. Moreover, defendant concedes that, even if the same preserved issues raised in the appellate brief filed on his behalf had been championed more effectively, they would have fared no better. Indeed, the only relief defendant sought on his\n   error coram nobis application was the opportunity to argue that his sentence was unduly harsh and severe. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that the Appellate Division erred in determining that the quality of the brief did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel (\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4371492\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/47/606/#p611\">\n    47 N.Y.2d at 609-611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=419%20N.Y.S.2d%20913\">\n    419 N.Y.S.2d 913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=393%20N.E.2d%20987\">\n    393 N.E.2d 987\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Finally, insofar as defendant faults appellate counsel for failing to file a criminal leave application to this Court, such an omission does not, on its own, constitute ineffective assistance of counsel under either the Federal or State Constitutions (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v.

They did not argue, as they do now, that defendant failed to exercise due diligence in pursuing relief.

It goes to the essence of appellate advocacy - the ability to present a coherent argument intended to persuade through its rhetorical and analytical power.

The majority does not even address this failure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Second, counsel failed to communicate at all with his client in the three years following his appointment to represent defendant, and only as a late-day response to the Dismissal Calendar notification. Even then, the correspondence was cursory - a mere two sentence letter stating, \"Enclosed please find a copy of your transcript which has been separated from the transcript of your co-defendants'. I am presently preparing your appeal brief and it will be submitted as soon as it has been completed.\" The majority concludes that defendant's allegations are unsupported and thus fail to establish this lack of client contact (majority op. at 291, 101 N.Y.S.3d at 706-07, 125 N.E.3d at 121-22). I disagree and conclude that appellate counsel's on-the-record conduct supports defendant's claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Appellate counsel waited over three years to take any action on defendant's appeal, and only after prompted by the Appellate Division's notice of potential dismissal. Even still, counsel's letter to defendant was nothing more than an announcement of belated work. Its perfunctory content is telling in what it lacks. The letter does not reference prior correspondence or communication with defendant, so it cannot be viewed as a follow-up\n   to prior contact. It nowhere explains why counsel is sending defendant transcripts three years into his representation. The letter does not discuss the Appellate Division dismissal calendar notification, even though the court copied defendant on the letter and any reasonable attorney would expect the client to be curious or even concerned about a potential dismissal. Perhaps most revealing, counsel announces that he is working on the brief and will submit it when completed, without any suggestion of prior attorney-client discussions or the opportunity to discuss the contents of the brief, pre-filing. Of course, there is the additional matter of counsel's failure to file a request for leave to appeal to this Court when the Appellate Division affirmed his conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   This track record is sufficient to support defendant's claims that counsel failed to communicate with defendant about the status of his appeal or otherwise engage with defendant about the issues counsel chose to raise in his brief. Counsel's failure to communicate with defendant is a basic violation of counsel's professional obligation to discuss the representation with his client, thus depriving defendant a voice in his appeal (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   New York Rules of Professional Conduct - Rule 1.4 \"Communication\" [a lawyer shall \"reasonably consult with the client about the means by which the client's objectives are to\n   be accomplished\" and \"(a) lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation\"] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Third, defendant complains of the poor quality of appellate counsel's advocacy. As the record establishes, counsel took an inexplicably long time to file the brief, over four years, delaying defendant's appeal. Once filed, the brief was, according to defendant, a \"pathetic mockery of competent advocacy.\" There was no possibility any of the points raised could have persuaded the Appellate Division to reverse the conviction, and counsel's failure to raise an excessive sentence claim was inexplicable and inexcusable. Defendant submitted the brief in support of this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The failings of the brief are substantial. Indeed, it is beyond understatement to declare, as the majority does here, that this \"is not a model to be emulated\" (majority op. at 292, 101 N.Y.S.3d at 707, 125 N.E.3d at 122). The brief fails to meet the basic criteria we have identified as fundamental\n   to meaningful appellate advocacy. It does not \"reflect[ ] a competent grasp of the facts, the law and appellate procedure\" (\n   <em>\n    Stultz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2%20N.Y.3d%20277\">\n    2 N.Y.3d at 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2175745\" index=\"255\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny/2/277/\">\n    778 N.Y.S.2d 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2175745\" index=\"256\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny/2/277/\">\n    810 N.E.2d 883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The brief is barely 20 double-spaced pages, including separate pages for the cover, tables of contents and cases, CPLR 5531 statement, and issues presented.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Inexplicably, at the\n   end of the facts section, appellate counsel inserted a photocopy of a six-page letter from trial counsel to the judge requesting an adjournment. The factual recitation consists of two pages and six lines of text. There is not a single citation in this section to the record on appeal, as required by the First Department's Local Rule \u00a7 120.8 (b)(4) which requires an appellant's brief to include a statement of facts \"with appropriate citations to the ... record.\" This hardly seems adequate given defendant appealed from a judgment following a three-month joint trial with two co-defendants, resulting in a trial transcript spanning over 4,000 pages, and involving multiple serious counts, including murder. In contrast, the People submitted a brief over 175 pages long, with 60 pages solely devoted to the facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Appellate counsel's brief contained four argument points. Point one is titled: \"Once the defendant is under police control\n   was the search of the immediate area controlled by the defendant, illegal.\" The argument is just barely over three pages, with several single sentence paragraphs, and a vague reference to a \"recent\" case (but rather than cite or even name the case, appellate counsel appears to cite a three-year-old law journal article without a title). In contrast, the People responded with 15 pages of legal analysis, focused on both defendant's standing and the merits of his claim. Point two, titled \"Did the Court's denial of an adjournment violate the defendant's 14th Amendment right of due proces [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ]\" is a page and a half long. The People's brief on this point was 11 pages in length, with a full discussion of the constitutional standard. Counsel's point three, titled \"Did the Court's sealing of the witness list deny the defendant effect [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] assistance of counsel\" is one paragraph long, a mere six sentences, and does not contain even a single citation to any legal authority.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The People responded with five pages of argument with over 11 legal citations. All of the People's points in response contain thorough and repeated citations to\n   the record. Point four, \"The verdict is against the weight of the evidence\" is a page and a half and, likewise, fails to contain a single citation to any legal authority. Not even to the standard of review. This is especially notable because, despite the point heading being labelled \"weight of the evidence,\" counsel then argues there was not enough \"legally sufficient\" evidence. Legal sufficiency has a different, much more limited standard of review than weight of the evidence (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v.

None of the points raised contain a citation to the facts or trial transcript; nowhere in the brief is the record ever cited. It appears counsel was not even certain of the standard as, for example, in support of his purported \"weight of the evidence\" argument, counsel invokes his personal opinion: \"so I feel that the possibility of YTC setting Omar up to take the fall is very probable since they are the only ones to testify against him in the conspiracy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The brief violates every rule about effective appellate advocacy taught to law students across the country. These rules are well-known and found in numerous academic and practice-oriented texts used in classrooms to assist future generations of lawyers in developing the skills recognized by the profession as essential to effective appellate lawyering: (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Mary Beth Beazley,\n   <em>\n    A Practical Guide to Appellate Advocacy\n   </em>\n   [4th ed 2014]; Daniel P. Selmi,\n   <em>\n    Principles of Appellate Advocacy\n   </em>\n   , [1st ed 2013]; Ursula Bentele, Eve Cary &amp; Mary R. Falk,\n   <em>\n    Appellate Advocacy: Principles and Practice\n   </em>\n   [5th ed 2012] ). One commentator summarized the skills necessary for appellate counsel as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \"First, counsel must be familiar with and follow the court's rules for protecting the defendant's right to appeal, such as the rules of procedure for filing the notice of appeal and any related statements and for ordering the transcript. Second, counsel must review the record for possible appellate issues. Third, counsel must determine what issues to raise in light of the facts, the law, the standard of review, and the scope of review. Fourth, counsel must decide how to formulate those issues. Fifth, counsel must find and use the most persuasive authority available. And sixth, counsel must write persuasively - including marshalling the facts, analyzing the law, and applying it to the facts\" (Griffin, Lisa.\n   <em>\n    The Right to Effective Assistance of Appellate Counsel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"269\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20W.%20Va.%20L.%20Rev.%201\">\n    97 W Va L Rev 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 37 [1994] ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Although not of the same significance, in addition to its substantive shortcomings, the brief is also riddled with grammatical and typographical errors. For example, counsel starts\n   the brief by incorrectly identifying the parties on the cover - referring to the People as \"Plaintiff-appellee,\" (which makes little sense in a criminal case) and referring to the defendant as both the \"defendant-Appellant\" and \"Defendant Appellee.\" Point two refers in its heading to \"Due Proces.\" The first sentence uses the contraction \"it's\" for the possessive. The same type of error is repeated later when the brief incorrectly refers to \"defendants\" in the plural rather than the singular possessive \"defendant's,\" and uses the singular possessive \"court's\"\n   when the sentence clearly intends to refer to the plural \"courts.\" The second sentence is barely coherent: \"The court in this matter appeared in the denial of an adjournment to Omar to view the tapes and discuss them [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] with his counsel prior to starting trial as if starting trial on that day was more important than the defendant being properly prepared for trial.\" There is also this sentence: \"The defendant had to proceed to trial without adequately preparing himself with the tapes that were an obstacle he had to traverse in his defense.\" Ironically, the point ends with appellate counsel's assertion that a defendant has a fundamental right to an adequately prepared counsel, and it is an abuse of discretion for the court to deny defendant the\n   opportunity to consult with counsel. If only appellate counsel had been so self-aware.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   There is more. The heading for point three posits the question \"did the Court's sealing of the witness list deny the defendant effect [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] assistance of counsel.\" The argument is one paragraph long and the penultimate sentence refers to \"treats\" instead of \"threats\"-not once but twice in the same sentence. The final sentence argues about the need for a hearing \"before the witness list are sealed.\" The point four heading refers to the weight of the evidence but in the very first sentence states that \"there is not enough legally sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction on the conspiracy count.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As this summary reveals, appellate counsel's brief fails to cite cases in support of the argument, lacks appropriate discussion of the facts, fails to comply with the filing rules of the Appellate Division, and violates basic rules of syntax and grammar. To the further detriment of defendant, this was the only advocacy on his behalf presented to the Appellate Division, as appellate counsel chose to submit the appeal and did not argue in person before that court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The majority attempts to trivialize the deficiencies in this brief and suggests that I have focused on style rather than\n   substance (majority op. at 293, 101 N.Y.S.3d at 707-08, 125 N.E.3d at 122-23). The majority's fixation on the grammatical and structural errors I describe elides critique of the fundamental problems with the writing. As is obvious from my analysis, my primary concern is with appellate counsel's failure to file a brief that \"reflect[ed] a competent grasp of the facts, the law and appellate procedure supported by appropriate authority and argument\" (\n   <em>\n    Stultz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"270\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2%20N.Y.3d%20277\">\n    2 N.Y.3d at 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2175745\" index=\"271\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny/2/277/\">\n    778 N.Y.S.2d 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2175745\" index=\"272\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny/2/277/\">\n    810 N.E.2d 883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). That counsel could not even proofread his brief is further evidence that he failed to meet the minimum threshold for satisfactory appellate work. For all the majority's efforts to normalize these numerous deficiencies, the majority cannot make a silk purse out of this sow's ear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Faced with an obviously inadequate writing, the majority clings to the view that the brief satisfies our standard of meaningful representation, as long as the brief \"raised four reviewable issues that \"triggered plenary review by the Appellate Division\" (majority op. at 292, 101 N.Y.S.3d at 707, 125 N.E.3d at 122). However, it is not enough for appellate counsel to raise an issue; counsel must advocate in support of the issue and serve as defendant's champion. According to the majority all appellate counsel need do to provide meaningful representation is prepare a document populated with a list of issues, unsupported by facts and law, and then leave it to the judiciary to work through the record and the law to determine whether there is a meritorious claim hidden somewhere in this substandard brief. This is not advocacy but abdication of the\n   professional obligation to prepare a quality work product on behalf of the client.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Of course, the brief speaks for itself, and so for the reader's convenience, the brief is immediately available to view here:\n   <em>\n    http://www.nycourts.gov/ctapps/reference/Alvarez%20Brief.pdf.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Practitioners, educators, and law students may assess whether this brief comports with our standard of effective legal assistance. To the organized bar, I ask: Is this an acceptable work product? Would any one of your members submit this on behalf of a client?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As for defendant's claim that appellate counsel was ineffective because he failed to challenge the sentence as harsh and excessive, I agree that on the facts of this case, there appears\n   to be no strategic reason to fail to assert this claim. While \"[e]ffective appellate representation by no means requires counsel to brief or argue every issue that may have merit [and] appellate lawyers have latitude in deciding which points to advance and how to order them,\" there is no hard and fast rule and counsel's representation must be measured in light of the circumstances (\n   <em>\n    Stultz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"273\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2%20N.Y.3d%20277\">\n    2 N.Y.3d at 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2175745\" index=\"274\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny/2/277/\">\n    778 N.Y.S.2d 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2175745\" index=\"275\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny/2/277/\">\n    810 N.E.2d 883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). I would not adopt a per se rule that every appellate counsel who fails to challenge the sentence as excessive is ineffective as a matter of law. However, here, defendant's sentence was 66 2/3 years to life. This effectively turns the minimum term of incarceration into a life sentence without the possibility of parole. Under these circumstances, there was no strategic advantage to be gained by failing to request the Appellate Division exercise its interest of justice power to consider whether defendant-who at the time of the crime was 19 years old-was potentially redeemable and should have the opportunity to persuade the Parole Board of such in the future. After all, if paroled, defendant would still serve a lengthy sentence and would walk out of prison an old man. Still, the possibility of parole would provide him hope of spending his last days free. As Judge Wilson persuasively argues in his dissent (Wilson, J., dissenting op. at 313-314, 101 N.Y.S.3d at 721-22, 125 N.E.3d at 137-38 ), defendant's conduct during his incarceration should remind us why we cannot simply write off young people who violate the law, even those who commit heinous crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The majority's conclusion that appellate counsel was effective because there is no claim upon which defendant would have prevailed ignores that, under our state standard, prejudice to defendant is \"not [an] indispensable element in assessing 'meaningful representation' \" (\n   <em>\n    Stultz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"276\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2%20N.Y.3d%20277\">\n    2 N.Y.3d at 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2175745\" index=\"277\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny/2/277/\">\n    778 N.Y.S.2d 431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2175745\" index=\"278\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny/2/277/\">\n    810 N.E.2d 883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Benevento\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"525149\" index=\"279\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/91/708/#p712\">\n    91 N.Y.2d at 712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"525149\" index=\"280\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/91/708/#p712\">\n    674 N.Y.S.2d 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"525149\" index=\"281\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/91/708/#p712\">\n    697 N.E.2d 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Baldi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1577801,2342716\" index=\"282\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/54/137/\">\n    54 N.Y.2d at 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1577801\" index=\"283\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nys2d/444/893/\">\n    444 N.Y.S.2d 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1577801\" index=\"284\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nys2d/444/893/\">\n    429 N.E.2d 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The reason is because our standard does not solely protect against errors that may have adversely affected a defendant. If that were the case, we would have adopted the federal test which requires \"a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different\" (\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

We are powerless to review the Appellate Division's exercise of that jurisdiction, and indeed we cannot even prescribe factors to be taken into account by the Appellate Division when exercising it. We can, however, review an attorney's failure to petition the Appellate Division to reduce a sentence in the interest of justice, and decide whether, in a given case, that failure falls below what a minimally competent attorney would do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    II.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Ninteen-year-old Omar Alvarez was convicted of 9 counts of an indictment broadly charging him and others as members of a drug-dealing conspiracy known as the Yellow Top Crew, YTC, or Young Talented Children; one count was for first-degree homicide of a 14-year-old bystander. He was sentenced to 66 and 2/3 years in prison, meaning that he would be eligible for parole at the age of 87. His was, in reality, a life sentence without the possibility of parole. Indeed, at sentencing, the trial court made clear that was its goal. The court explained that Mr. Alvarez was \"beyond rehabilitation\" and that he \"[needed] to be removed from the streets indefinitely, so that you can never return to the streets of our city[.]\" The court also asked\n   the Parole Board to \"not let these defendants out. Please make them serve their maximum sentence under law[.]\"\n   Both now and when Mr. Alvarez appealed, the People contended the points raised on appeal were meritless. What strategic reason, then, might a competent lawyer have to refrain from asking the Appellate Division to reduce the lower end of his sentence, say, to 40 years to life so that, at age 59, the Parole Board would have the opportunity to consider whether Mr. Alvarez had been rehabilitated, would not pose a danger to society if released, had been sufficiently punished, and should not continue to be imprisoned at a substantial cost to taxpayers?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Here, the People have two answers. The first is to list some reasons the Appellate Division would have denied his request. But those are not a reason to refrain from\n   making the request: whether the argument would have changed the outcome is not the proper inquiry (\n   <em>\n    People v. Borrell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3734961\" index=\"328\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/12/365/#p368\">\n    12 N.Y.3d 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 368,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3734961\" index=\"329\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/12/365/#p368\">\n    881 N.Y.S.2d 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3734961\" index=\"330\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/12/365/#p368\">\n    909 N.E.2d 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2009] ). The question is whether counsel's choices are consistent with those of a minimally competent attorney. That question is answered by the old saw, \"nothing ventured, nothing gained.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The People's second answer is that Mr. Alvarez's appellate lawyer may have made the strategic decision not to dilute his merits arguments by making a plea in the interest of justice. That answer is particularly unsatisfactory in light of the wholly frivolous arguments counsel did raise. For example, Point 1 of the appellate brief argued the police were not permitted to search the immediate area \"controlled by\" Mr. Alvarez upon his arrest. Even leaving aside the argument's utter lack of merit, had Mr. Alvarez miraculously prevailed on that argument, it would have, at most, resulted in a reversal on the weapons possession charge, which, because that sentence ran concurrently with the others, would not have shortened Mr. Alvarez's prison term by a day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    III.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Because I have great faith in the commitment of the Justices of our Appellate Division to the interests of justice, I do not conclude that a request by Mr. Alvarez to reduce the minimum term of his sentence would have been doomed to failure. Had that relief been granted, Mr. Alvarez might still have spent the rest of his life in prison if the circumstances warranted, but we would not be forced to keep him incarcerated if the circumstances sufficiently changed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The United States Supreme Court has articulated three key differences between youthful offenders and their adult counterparts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   First, children have a \"lack of maturity and an underdeveloped sense of responsibility,\" leading to recklessness, impulsivity, and heedless risk-taking.

The degree of retribution appropriate for an adult is not appropriate for youthful offenders, because the parts of the brain concerned with behavior control have not yet fully developed in them (\n   <em>\n    Graham v. Florida\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"340\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    560 U.S. 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 68,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"341\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"342\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 825\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2010] ). \"Whether viewed as an attempt to express the community's moral outrage or as an attempt to right the balance for the wrong to the victim, the case for retribution is not as strong with a minor as with an adult\" (\n   <em>\n    Roper v.

Likewise, the state's interest in deterrence is significantly diminished when punishing a young offender, who is unlikely to be deterred by the threat of stiff punishments for transgressions (\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"346\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    560 U.S. 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 72,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"347\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12448995,3641893\" index=\"348\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/48/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 825\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The state interests in incapacitation and rehabilitation are also different when dealing with young defendants, because, compared to fully-formed adults, youths have a greater capacity for change. Thus, sentencing schemes that mandate life in prison without the possibility of parole are unconstitutional when applied to juveniles (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Alabama\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"349\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/#p471\">\n    567 U.S. 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 473,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"350\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/#p471\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"351\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/#p471\">\n    183 L.Ed.2d 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Supreme Court made the above points with respect to juveniles under the age of 18, but that line, like all such lines, is necessarily arbitrary and cannot account for variations in the maturation of individuals. The scientific conclusions about brain development for adolescents entering adulthood present\n   similar concerns for young adults entering their early 20's. Researchers examining brain development in the years immediately after 18 suggest that \"young adulthood is a time when cognitive control is still vulnerable to negative emotional influences, in part as a result of continued development of lateral and medial prefrontal circuitry\" (Alexandra O. Cohen et al.,\n   <em>\n    When is an Adolescent an Adult? Assessing Cognitive Control in Emotional and Nonemotional Contexts\n   </em>\n   , 27 Psychol Sci [Issue 4] 549, 559 [Apr. 2016] ). Indeed, the areas of brain development that concerned the Supreme Court in its discussion of criminal penalties for young offenders - those that govern impulsivity, risk-taking, and susceptibility to social coercion - are also those that typically develop later, including into young adulthood (Laurence Steinberg et al.,\n   <em>\n    Are Adolescents Less Mature Than Adults? Minors' Access to Abortion, the Juvenile Death Penalty, and the Alleged APA \"Flip-Flop,\"\n   </em>\n   64 Am Psychol [Issue 7] 583, 587 [Oct. 2009] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Many other countries have adapted their legal systems to account for the scientific evidence. In Austria, Belgium, England and Wales, France, Hungary, Italy, Germany, Portugal, Sweden, and Switzerland, governments have put in place special rules mitigating penalties for young adults over the age of 18 (T2A: Transition to Adulthood,\n   <em>\n    Better in Europe? European responses to young adult offending\n   </em>\n   [Mar. 2, 2015],\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   https://www.t2a.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/T2A_Better-in-Europe.pdf [accessed March 7, 2019] ). Those rules are widespread enough, that in 2007 the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child \"note[d] with appreciation that some States parties allow for the application of the rules and regulations of juvenile justice to persons aged 18 and older, usually till the age of 21, either as a general rule or by way of exception\" (UN Committee on the Rights of the Child [CRC], General comment No. 10 [2007]: Children's Rights in Juvenile Justice, 25 April 2007, CRC/C/GC/10,\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   : https://www.refworld.org/docid/4670fca12.html [accessed 7 March 2019] ). Although the Supreme Court's decisions, international policies, and much of the scientific research proving that young people should not be held to the same standard as adults postdates Mr. Alvarez's conviction, the Appellate Division never has been constrained to accept the proposition that sentencing a 19-year-old to life without parole (or a functionally equivalent minimum term of years) is in the interest of justice (\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   Oscar Wilde,\n   <em>\n    Children in Prison and Other Cruelties of Prison\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Life\n   </em>\n   , Murdoch &amp; Co., London, 1897 at 6 [\"The present treatment of children is terrible, primarily from people not understanding the peculiar psychology of a child's nature. A child can understand a punishment inflicted by an individual, such as a parent or guardian, and bear it with a certain amount of acquiescence. What it cannot understand is a\n   punishment inflicted by Society. It cannot realise what Society is\"] ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Supreme Court, and indeed much of the rest of the world, considers the youth of a defendant to be an important factor when considering the appropriate punishment. Our jurisprudence should do the same. The majority, in contrast, does not mention Mr. Alvarez's age when he committed his crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    IV.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Mr. Alvarez's life graphically illustrates why it is morally wrong to prejudge the entire future of a 19-year-old. Mr. Alvarez has been incarcerated almost 25 years, during which time he has completed rehabilitative programs including Alternatives to Violence, Action for Personal Choice, Substance Abuse Counseling, a Pre-GED Class, Computer Technology, Computer Lab, Computer Repair, and Barber Shop training. In those programs, Mr. Alvarez has received uniformly positive reviews. He also has a positive disciplinary record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   While in prison, Mr. Alvarez has also become gravely ill. He suffers from Hodgkin's Lymphoma. His cancer was not diagnosed until it had already metastasized and caused compression around his spinal cord. As a result, Mr. Alvarez is a paraplegic. He does not have the use of his lower extremities, and he cannot control his bladder or bowels. He is wheelchair bound, in constant pain, and under full-time medical care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Mr. Alvarez's rehabilitation as a father and husband is also extraordinary. While in prison he reconnected with Diana Alvarez, an old acquaintance; they were married in 2006. With Ms. Alvarez, he has a daughter, and he has been a loving father and stepfather to her and Ms. Alvarez's daughter from a prior relationship. Before his illness, he was able to have\n   regular weekend trailer visits with his family, thanks to his good conduct in prison. His family is also the reason this case is even before us. It was Diana Alvarez who helped Mr. Alvarez research his appeal and discover it had concluded without his knowledge. She wishes to care for him at home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The majority does not mention those facts. It would be worth dissenting if only to acknowledge them, but that is not my point in so doing. Of course, those facts were unknowable at the time Mr. Alvarez was sentenced, and most were unknowable at the time his appeal was denied, 4 years later. But all knew he was 19 years old when he committed his crimes. The possibility of a transformation like Mr. Alvarez's is precisely why our system should rarely if ever sentence young people to life without some realistic opportunity to seek parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   On this appeal, Mr. Alvarez has not asked to be granted parole. He has not even asked to be granted a chance to ask the Parole Board to consider paroling him. Instead, he has asked for permission to ask the Appellate Division what his patently ineffective counsel neglected to ask: that, while leaving the maximum life term of his sentence in place, the Appellate Division reduce the minimum 66 2/3-year term in the interest of justice, so that someday he might be able to prove to the Parole Board that both he and society would be better off terminating his incarceration short of his death. Had we granted Mr. Alvarez's coram nobis petition, allowing him to ask the Appellate Division to reduce his sentence in the interest of justice, the Appellate Division could have considered all the facts I outline above, or others. As discussed, we have no power to review the Appellate Division's exercise of its interest-of-justice jurisdiction or to limit the factors it might consider in exercising its discretion to reduce a sentence in the interest of justice. It would be entirely up to the Appellate Division to determine whether facts that occurred after Mr. Alvarez's original appeal could be considered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <em>\n    V.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   A holding that the failure to seek a sentence reduction in the interest of justice automatically renders appellate representation\n   ineffective would, contend the People, open a Pandora's Box. They are right. I advocate no such rule. The law advances one case at a time; granting Mr. Alvarez's petition would be just one of Holmes' \"sybelline leaves\": a 19-year-old with no viable merits-based argument, effectively sentenced to life without parole, living in a state in which the legislature has empowered its intermediate appellate Justices to live up to their titles, has a constitutional right to a lawyer who will ask those Justices for a measure of mercy, be it only the chance at age 60 to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Parole Board that further imprisonment is unjustified. Where we draw the line can await the next case; here, the lawyer's defalcation in failing to ask for a reduction of the minimum sentence, to allow for the consideration of parole at some point within Mr. Alvarez's lifetime, is patently ineffective assistance of counsel. Were you Mr. Alvarez's lawyer, would you believe you competently represented him, as required by the ethical rules ( 22 NYCRR 1200.0 [Rule 1.1] )? Were Mr. Alvarez your son, would you have instructed his lawyer not to ask the Appellate Division to exercise its interest of justice jurisdiction to give him the chance to prove he had earned parole? I, for one, believe he should have such a chance someday. Even poor Pandora was left, in the end, with the aid of the one deity the majority today denies Mr. Alvarez.\n   For the reasons expressed in Judge Rivera's dissent and here, I too dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Chief Judge DiFiore and Judges Fahey, Garcia and Feinman concur; Judge Rivera dissents in an opinion, in which Judge Wilson concurs in a separate dissenting opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Order affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    The brief that defendant's counsel filed on his behalf in his original appeal is available here:\n    <em>\n     http://www.nycourts.gov/ctapps/reference/Alvarez%20Brief.pdf\n    </em>\n    . The brief is also permanently available for viewing at the New York State Library.

The majority ignores the totality of my analysis, which focuses on several key factors: counsel's dilatory conduct was established by the Appellate Division's warning letter that defendant's appeal was at risk of dismissal for counsel's failure to perfect; counsel's hurried reaction which consisted of a cursory letter to defendant, one that lacked even a semblance of an attorney-client relationship as it failed to acknowledge any prior communication and did not explain why the appeal was noticed for the dismissal calendar; and the eventual submission of a slapdash writing that counsel had the temerity to represent as an appellate brief. If what the majority means by speculation is an unjustified assumption, then it is the majority that has faltered in its analysis by assuming that appellate counsel conducted himself in a professional manner when all evidence is to the contrary.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
