Upon review, the Court affirms the Indiana Board's final determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On September 2, 2014, Holdings was formed as a limited liability company pursuant to the Indiana Business Flexibility Act. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 11 -45.)\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , IND. CODE \u00a7 23-18-2-4(a) (2019) (providing that a person \"may form a limited liability company by causing articles of organization to be executed and filed for record with the office of the secretary of state\"). That same day, Holdings, the Anderson Community School Corporation, and the City of Anderson Department of Redevelopment executed a series of interrelated agreements by which Holdings acquired four parcels of land in Anderson, Indiana. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. 193, 273-92.) Only one of those parcels is at issue in this case: an 8.56 acre parcel containing a 220,000 square foot building with, among other things, an 8,996 seat basketball facility (the \"Wigwam\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 189, 218-20, 473-76.) For the 2015 tax year, the Madison County Assessor assigned the parcel an assessed value of $ 11,415,000 ($ 428,000 for land and $ 10,987,000 for improvements).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 12, 2015, Holdings appealed the 2015 assessment to the Madison County Property Tax Assessment Board of Appeals (PTABOA). On September 19, 2016, after a hearing, the PTABOA reclassified the entire property as utility/storage and reassessed it based on that use type under Indiana's assessment guidelines, reducing its assessed value to $ 2,115,200 ($ 423,700 for land and $ 1,691,500 for improvements). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 74-77, 298-301, 682-84.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Unsatisfied with the reduction, Holdings sought review with the Indiana Board on November 3, 2016. The Indiana Board conducted a hearing on April 18, 2017, during which Holdings presented an Appraisal that was completed in conformance with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 187-267.) The Appraisal, which valued the property at only $ 68,500 as of May 30, 2014, provided in substance that the Wigwam's \"highest and best use\" was as vacant land because its building was \"functionally and economically obsolete\" due to a variety of physical deficiencies. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 243-47 (indicating, among other things, that portions of the building contained asbestos, were not ADA compliant, lacked air conditioning, and lacked a sprinkler system).) (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 477-80.) Holdings also presented the documentation associated with its acquisition of the property and explained that it 1) acquired the property for $ 0 on September 2, 2014, in a \"fair, arm's length [market] transaction[;]\" 2) agreed to repair, restore, and maintain the gymnasium by December 31, 2018; and 3) received access to an escrow account containing $ 630,000 to use to restore the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 273-92, 396-97, 605-16.) In addition, one of the\n   Appraisal's preparers testified that the assessment was incorrect because the property was classified under the wrong use type (\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   utility/storage) and did not account for abnormal obsolescence\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   in its cost approach.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 508-10, 761-66, 777-78.) Holdings asserted that the totality of its evidence demonstrated that the 2015 assessment should be reduced to $ 68,500. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 395-401, 460.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In response, the Assessor asserted that Holdings' Appraisal should be disregarded because it estimated the property's market value rather than its market value-in-use, even though the two standards were not equivalent in this case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 378-84, 701-06.) The Assessor also claimed that the Appraisal had \"issues\" because it valued the property as vacant land, ignoring the restriction in Holdings' acquisition documentation that required the Wigwam gymnasium to be restored. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 709, 717-18, 723-25.) Moreover, the Assessor asserted that the September 2014 sale was not a market transaction because the seller, a governmental entity, was atypically motivated by its desire to restore the Wigwam for the community's future use. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 378 n.2, 706-09.) Finally, the Assessor maintained that assessing the property as utility/storage under the cost approach was proper because 1) the Wigwam is a special purpose property and 2) the cost approach methodology typically produced the lowest possible assessment for unoccupied commercial properties like the Wigwam. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 710-18, 729.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 29, 2018, the Indiana Board issued its final determination, finding that Holdings \"failed to make a\n   <em>\n    prima\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    facie\n   </em>\n   case for reducing its assessment\" because it did not support its claim with probative evidence. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 421 \u00b6 52 (emphasis added).) Accordingly, the Indiana Board upheld the property's assessment of $ 2,115,200. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 422 \u00b6 53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 11, 2018, Holdings initiated an original tax appeal and filed a Petition to Enjoin the Collection of Tax pursuant to Indiana Code \u00a7 33-26-6-2. On December 14, 2018, after holding a hearing, the Court denied Holdings' Petition to Enjoin.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wigwam Holdings LLC v. Madison Cty. Assessor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12540613\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/115/531/\">\n    115 N.E.3d 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ind. Tax Ct. 2018). After the matter was fully briefed on March 1, 2019, the Court took the case under advisement. Additional facts will be supplied when necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The party seeking to overturn an Indiana Board final determination bears the burden of demonstrating its invalidity.\n   <em>\n    Osolo Twp.

Tax Ct. 2003). Accordingly, Holdings must demonstrate to the Court that the Indiana Board's final determination is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law; contrary\n   to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity; in excess of or short of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations; without observance of the procedure required by law; or unsupported by substantial or reliable evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   IND. CODE \u00a7 33-26-6-6(e)(1)-(5) (2019).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On appeal, Holdings asks the Court to reverse the Indiana Board's final determination, claiming it is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, unsupported by substantial evidence, and in excess of its statutory authority. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pet'r Br. at 7.) More specifically, Holdings contends that the Indiana Board erred in upholding the Wigwam's assessment because it: 1) made a\n   <em>\n    prima\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    facie\n   </em>\n   case by introducing into evidence a USPAP-compliant appraisal; 2) established that it acquired the property for $ 0 in a market transaction in September 2014; and 3) demonstrated that the assessment failed to account for the significant abnormal obsolescence that diminished the value of its property. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Br. at 7-23; Pet'r Reply Br. at 2-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Prima\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Facie\n    </em>\n    Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Holdings first maintains that for purposes of Indiana's property tax assessment system, the law of the land is that a taxpayer's \"[p]resentation of a USPAP-compliant appraisal establishes a\n   <em>\n    prima\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    facie\n   </em>\n   case of [the property's] true tax value\" and triggers an assessing official's duty to rebut the appraisal with his own market-based evidence. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Br. at 7-12 (emphasis added); Pet'r Reply Br. at 2-4.) Holdings therefore claims that because it presented a USPAP-compliant appraisal and the Assessor did not present any market-based evidence to rebut the appraised values of both its land and improvements, the Indiana Board erred in concluding that its Appraisal lacked probative value. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Br. at 8-9, 11-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Holdings cites nine cases as authority for its proposition that a taxpayer makes a\n   <em>\n    prima\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    facie\n   </em>\n   case for reducing an assessment merely by presenting an appraisal completed in conformance with USPAP.

Consequently, when the Indiana Board evaluates the probative value of the parties' evidence, including appraisals, it is merely performing its statutory duty as the finder of fact by determining how much weight, if any, should be afforded to the parties' evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   IND.

Indeed, Holdings sought to establish that its 2015 assessment should be reduced to $ 68,500 by presenting an Appraisal that provided an estimate of the property's\n   <em>\n    market\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    value\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin.

During the 2015 tax year, however, Indiana assessed real property on the basis of its\n   <em>\n    market value-in-use\n   </em>\n   :\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   the value of the property \"for its current use, as reflected by the utility received by the owner or by a similar user, from the property.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   IND. CODE \u00a7 6-1.1-31-6(c) (2015) (amended 2016); 2011 REAL PROPERTY ASSESSMENT MANUAL (\"Manual\") (incorporated by reference at 50 IND. ADMIN. CODE 2.4-1-2 (2011) ) at 2. \"Most of the time, a property's market\n   value-in-use will be equivalent to its market value; nonetheless, there are certain instances where a property's market value-in-use will not be equal it its market value[:]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [W]hen a property's current use is consistent with its highest and best use and there are regular exchanges within its market so that ask and offer prices converge, a property's market value-in-use will equal its market value because the sales price fully captures the property's utility. When, however, a property's current use is inconsistent with its highest and best use, then market value-in-use will not equal market value because the sales price will not reflect the property's utility. The [Department of Local Government Finance] has explained that the latter occurs with respect to 1) properties \"where owners are motivated by non-market factors such as the maintenance of a farming lifestyle even in the face of a higher use value for some other purpose\" or 2)\n   <em>\n    special purpose properties\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Howard Cty.

In this case, the parties agreed during the administrative proceedings that the Wigwam is a special purpose property.

Therefore, Holdings' Appraisal that estimated the Wigwam's market value, without something more, simply does not constitute probative evidence of the property's market value-in-use.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kohl's\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6776306,12324972\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/57/913/\">\n    57 N.E.3d at 917\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Consequently, the Court will not reverse the Indiana Board's final determination on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    2. September 2014 Sale\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Next, Holdings maintains that the Indiana Board erred in finding that the September 2014 sale lacked probative value because the seller was atypically motivated, and therefore, the sale was not a market transaction. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pet'r Br. at 21-23.) (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 420-21 \u00b6\u00b6 47, 49.) More specifically, Holdings contends the Indiana Board's finding is erroneous because 1) the seller's status as a governmental entity does not, by itself, establish that the seller was atypically motivated; and 2) the Indiana Board's finding was not supported by substantial evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Br. at 21-23; Pet'r Reply Br. at 9-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   During the administrative hearing, both parties successfully offered into evidence Holdings' acquisition documentation and a variety of newspaper articles regarding the sale of the Wigwam. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 273-92, 295-96, 339-75, 516, 585-87.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Holdings' witness testified that the seller, a governmental entity, was typically motivated despite the fact that Holdings paid zero dollars and received access to $ 630,000 in return for the property. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 533-35.) The Assessor's witness, on the other hand, testified that those same facts, along with the restrictions in Holdings' acquisition documentation, actually indicated that the seller was not typically motivated, and therefore, the sale was not a market transaction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 706-09.) That testimony was not subsequently retracted, clarified, or rebutted. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 710-790.) Consequently, the certified administrative record reveals that the Indiana Board considered and weighed the competing evidence, making its finding based on the facts and circumstances before it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   When the Court evaluates the Indiana Board's review of conflicting evidence, as here, it will defer to the Indiana Board's findings so long as a reasonable mind could find substantial evidence in the record to support those findings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hamilton Cty. Prop. Tax Assessment Bd. of Appeals v. Oaken Bucket Partners, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7186142\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/938/654/#p657\">\n    938 N.E.2d 654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 657-58 (Ind. 2010). Based on its reasoning above, the Court finds that a reasonable mind could find that the Indiana Board's final determination with respect to this issue is supported by substantial evidence in the record. Accordingly, the Court cannot say that the Indiana Board's final determination should be reversed on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Abnormal Obsolescence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, Holdings claims that the Indiana Board's final determination should be reversed because it demonstrated that the assessment was incorrect by showing that it failed to account for abnormal obsolescence. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Br. at 19-21.) Holdings maintains that because its witness identified the causes of obsolescence\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   quantified the amount of obsolescence to be applied to the Wigwam's building during the administrative hearing, the Indiana Board erred when it rejected Holdings' claim for an abnormal obsolescence adjustment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Br. 19-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   It is well-established that when a taxpayer claims that abnormal obsolescence has diminished the value of its property, the taxpayer must present probative evidence to the Indiana Board that 1) identifies the causes of the alleged obsolescence\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   2) quantifies the amount of obsolescence to be applied to its improvements.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Idris v. Marion Cty. Assessor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6925633\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/12/331/#p334\">\n    12 N.E.3d 331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 334 (Ind. Tax Ct. 2014) ;\n   <em>\n    Hometowne Assocs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8432931\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/839/269/#p277\">\n    839 N.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   273-74 ;\n   <em>\n    Canal Square\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11830559\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/694/801/#p807\">\n    694 N.E.2d at 806-07\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Contrary to Holdings' claims, however, the certified administrative record reveals that Holdings' evidentiary presentation did not affirmatively identify the causes of the obsolescence that purportedly diminished the value of its property nor did it quantify the amount of obsolescence to be applied to the property. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 187-267, 388-89, 391-92, 759-78.) As the Indiana Board explained in its final determination, Holdings merely \"attacked the [assessment] methodology based on its own interpretation of the property record card and assumption of what [the Assessor or PTABOA may have] considered.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 421 \u00b6 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Nonetheless, Holdings maintains that the Court found in its order on Holding's Petition to Enjoin that Holdings identified the causes of obsolescence that allegedly caused its property to suffer a loss of value. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Br. at 19-20; Pet'r Reply Br. at 9.) A closer reading of that order, however, indicates that the Court did not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wigwam Holdings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12540613\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/115/531/\">\n    115 N.E.3d at 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that \"[a]lthough Allardt's testimony identified several causes of\n   <em>\n    alleged\n   </em>\n   obsolescence that may have diminished the value of the Wigwam, Holdings did not provide evidence to quantify their negative effect on the value of its property\") (emphasis added). Moreover, Holdings provided no evidence to quantify the purported obsolescence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12540613\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/115/531/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the Court will not reverse the Indiana Board's final determination on this basis either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Holdings has not demonstrated that the Indiana Board's final determination is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, unsupported by substantial evidence, or in excess of its statutory authority.
