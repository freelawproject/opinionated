For the following reasons, we affirm, in part, and reverse, in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Sixteen-year-old L.S. was adjudicated delinquent in connection with the rape of his friend, 17-year-old R.J. According to the evidence presented at his delinquency hearing, on April 20, 2016, L.S. and R.J. went to a friend's house after school to smoke marijuana with other teens. R.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   was on probation for truancy, so she took only one hit. The group disbanded and made plans to meet later that night, and L.S. told R.J. that he would find someone to help him get a bottle of Southern Comfort since she could not smoke marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Around 7:30 or 8:00 that night, L.S. and R.J. met up again at the home of R.J.'s boyfriend. As promised, L.S. brought a large bottle of Southern Comfort, and the teenagers started doing shots. R.J. estimated that she consumed two or three shots. They left her boyfriend's house and went over to her cousin's to continue drinking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} At her cousin's, R.J. drank two glasses of Southern Comfort. She was stumbling and feeling woozy and at around 10:30 or 11:00 p.m., she began getting nervous about her probation-mandated curfew. L.S. walked her home around 11:15 p.m., and they continued to drink Southern Comfort out of a water bottle on the way home. As they walked, L.S. held on to R.J. to steady her. But L.S. was also reaching up R.J.'s shirt, trying to grab her breasts. R.J. told him to stop because she had a boyfriend, and L.S. tried to persuade R.J. to leave her boyfriend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} When they got to R.J.'s home, R.J. and L.S. rolled some cigarettes. R.J. described feeling very drunk by this time. The next thing she remembered was her mother putting her to bed beside her 16-year-old brother, J.A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} R.J. awoke the next morning just after 7:00 a.m. L.S. was there and was preparing to leave, but they did not speak to each other. As the morning progressed, R.J. \"[came] to the realization that something had happened\" with L.S. during the night. She remembered L.S. being on top of her. He performed oral sex on her, then flipped her over and penetrated her anally. R.J. recalled telling him \"no\" two or three times and described that she was blacking in and out while this was happening. R.J. called L.S. on Facebook and told him not to tell anyone what had happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} R.J. continued to recall \"bits and pieces\" of what had happened the night before, and she \"knew something bad had happened that [she] did not agree to.\" She went to her aunt's house crying. While there, R.J. took a shower. She noticed that her \"butt\" hurt. She told her aunt what had happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} R.J. and her aunt were unsure whether to report the incident. R.J. called her boyfriend's mother who encouraged R.J. to tell her probation officer. R.J. also talked to her mom. Her mother initially did not want her to report the incident. For one, R.J.'s mother \"thought it was good\" if something had happened with L.S. because she did not like R.J.'s boyfriend. In addition to that, she did not immediately believe R.J. She thought that R.J. had simply cheated on her boyfriend with L.S. and was afraid her boyfriend would find out. Despite her initial misgivings, R.J.'s mother eventually agreed that the incident needed to be reported.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} R.J. went to the Toledo Hospital where she underwent a sexual assault nurse examination (\"SANE\") and a rape kit was performed. The SANE nurse observed multiple small tears to R.J.'s anus. Her clothing and DNA samples were collected for testing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} R.J. came to learn that she had been sexually assaulted by L.S. and by Jordan Carrisales, the 20-year-old son of a family friend who was staying at her home. Detective Corbin Carpenter of the Port Clinton Police Department interviewed both Carrisales and L.S.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Carrisales said that he, L.S., R.J., and J.A. all slept in the same bed that night. According to Carrisales, R.J. was \"really drunk,\" but L.S. \"seemed all right.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Carrisales said that he saw L.S. and R.J. having sex, and R.J. was awake. R.J. did not tell L.S. no, but she said, \"I don't think I can do this.\" It did not appear to Carrisales that R.J. was being forced to have sex against her will. Carrisales also claimed that R.J. put her hand down his pants and \"tried jacking [him] off,\" so Carrisales \"ended up having sex with her\" too.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 12} L.S., on the other hand, denied having sex with R.J. He said that Carrisales had sex with R.J. and R.J. tried to initiate sexual contact with L.S., but L.S. refused her and moved from the bed to the floor. L.S. provided a timeline of the evening that differed in some respects from R.J.'s timeline and omitted certain events. L.S. did, however, voluntarily provide a sample of his DNA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 13} DNA analysis revealed the presence of L.S.'s semen in R.J.'s vagina and on the front and back panels of her underwear. Carrisales's semen was also identified on the front and back panels of R.J.'s underwear. Carrisales ultimately entered a plea of guilty to sexual battery in connection with this incident, conceding that it had been wrong for him to have had sex with R.J. in the state she was in.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Complaints were filed against L.S. in the Ottawa County Common Pleas Court, Juvenile Division, on June 17, 2016, charging him with rape under R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(c), rape under R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), and kidnapping under R.C. 2905.01(A)(4). The juvenile court adjudicated L.S. delinquent of one count of rape in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(c), a felony of the first degree if committed by an adult, and dismissed the other two charges. It committed L.S. to the legal custody of DYS for a minimum period of one year and a maximum period not to exceed L.S.'s attainment of age 21. The court suspended the commitment subject to a number of conditions, including that L.S. undergo treatment at the Juvenile Residential Center of Northwest Ohio. The disposition was memorialized in a judgment entry filed on November 21, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The trial court later granted a motion to impose the suspended DYS commitment after L.S. failed to undergo the required treatment. The court's decision was memorialized in a judgment entry journalized on June 8, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 16} L.S. appealed and assigns the following errors for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Assignment of Error I: The Ottawa County Juvenile Court violated L.S., Jr.'s right to due process of law, because its finding of delinquency lacked sufficient, credible, and reliable evidentiary support.

Sufficiency and Manifest Weight of the Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 17} L.S. was convicted of rape under R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(c), which prohibits a person from engaging in sexual conduct with another when \"[t]he other person's ability to resist or consent is substantially impaired because of a mental or physical condition * * * and the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the other person's ability to resist or consent is substantially impaired because of a mental or physical condition * * *.\" In his first assignment of error, L.S. argues that the trial court's adjudication of delinquency lacked sufficient evidence and was against the manifest weight of the evidence because the state failed to prove that R.J.'s ability to resist or consent was \"substantially impaired,\" or that L.S. knew or should have known that R.J.'s ability to resist or consent was substantially impaired. While he concedes that R.J. was intoxicated, L.S. argues that the state did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that her voluntary intoxication \"crippled her ability to consent or resist.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 18} It is well-recognized by Ohio courts that voluntary intoxication can constitute a mental or physical condition that substantially impairs a person's ability to resist or consent to sexual conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re J.J.\n   </em>\n   , 6th Dist.

While L.S. does not dispute this point, he argues that the state did not present sufficient evidence that R.J.'s voluntary intoxication rose to such a level here. L.S. also claims that the state failed to offer any evidence of his observations regarding R.J.'s ability to resist or consent, which he insists was particularly important given that he too had been drinking and smoking marijuana and was functioning at diminished capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Whether there is sufficient evidence to support a conviction is a question of law.\n   <em>\n    State v.

It may be shown by the testimony of people who interacted with the victim and by the trier of fact's assessment of the person's ability to control his or her conduct.\n   <em>\n    Canterbury\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 22} R.J. testified at L.S.'s delinquency hearing. She said that she rarely drinks alcohol, but on the night of this incident, she consumed two to three shots of Southern Comfort and two rocks glasses of the same liquor. She was sipping on a bottle of the alcohol as she walked home. She described that as she and L.S. walked to her house, she was stumbling to the point that L.S. needed to hold on to her. She said she felt \"really, really drunk.\" Once home, her mother had to \"put\" her to bed. R.J. also explained that she blacked out \"as soon as she got to [her] house.\" She said that while L.S. performed oral sex on her and penetrated her anally, she \"was blacking in and out of it and I couldn't really understand what was going on.\" She described that she \"couldn't really move. It was like flashbacks, in and out of it, black out.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Carrisales and R.J.'s mother also testified. Carrisales described that R.J. could barely talk, had fallen over, and \"got sick\" outside. And R.J.'s mother testified that R.J. could not walk straight, she was falling down, and she fell out of a chair and had to be helped up by Carrisales and L.S.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 24} We find that this testimony was sufficient evidence that R.J.'s ability to resist or consent to sexual conduct was substantially impaired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 25} As for L.S.'s awareness of R.J.'s substantial impairment, it is clear that L.S. was also drinking alcohol and had smoked marijuana that day. But the state presented evidence that could support a finding that L.S. remained able to recognize that R.J. was intoxicated to the point that her ability to resist or consent was substantially impaired. For one, R.J.'s mother described that L.S. was coherent and did not show signs of being intoxicated. He was not stumbling, he did not slur his speech, his eyes were not glassy, and she was able to have a coherent conversation with him. Carrisales also described that L.S. \"seemed all right.\" In addition to this, L.S. helped steady R.J. as she walked home, helped her when she fell out of the chair at her house, and assisted R.J.'s mother in putting her to bed, all of which suggest that L.S. remained capable of recognizing the extent of R.J.'s level of intoxication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 26} We find that this testimony constituted sufficient evidence that L.S. knew or should have known that R.J.'s ability to resist or consent to sexual conduct was substantially impaired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 27} We next turn to L.S.'s claim that the juvenile court's adjudication of delinquency was against the manifest weight of the evidence. When reviewing a claim that a verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence, the appellate court must weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, consider the credibility of witnesses, and determine whether the fact-finder clearly lost its way in resolving evidentiary conflicts so as to create such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\n   <em>\n    Thompkins,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"375127\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/78/380/#p386\">\n    78 Ohio St.3d 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 387,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=678%20N.E.2d%20541\">\n    678 N.E.2d 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Ohio Supreme Court found that \"[a]s applied to children under the age of 13 who engage in sexual conduct with other children under the age of 13, R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b) is unconstitutionally vague because the statute authorizes and encourages arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24.

As in In re D.B., the juvenile argued that it was unconstitutional for the state to charge him with gross sexual imposition for nonforcible sexual contact with someone under the age of 13 where he too was under the age of 13. We rejected this argument. We observed that gross sexual imposition under R.C. 2907.05(A)(4) is not a strict-liability offense, and the mens rea element of the offense provides a way to differentiate between the victim and the offender.\n   <em>\n    We held that\n   </em>\n   \"the victim and the offender in these cases are not treated alike because they are not similarly situated.

R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(c) is not a strict-liability statute. A violation occurs where (1) one person's ability to resist or\n   consent to sexual conduct is substantially impaired, (2) the second person is aware of the other's substantial impairment, and (3) the second person engages in sexual conduct with the first person despite this awareness. The statute clearly delineates who is a victim and who is an offender. And as we determined in considering L.S.'s first assignment of error, L.S. was or should have been aware that R.J.'s ability to resist or consent was substantially impaired here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 41} We find L.S.'s second assignment of error not well-taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

On May 25, 2017, the state filed a motion to impose the suspended DYS commitment, and on May 30, 2017, the trial court held a hearing on the motion. The court heard testimony from Dean Hall, a counselor from Juvenile Residential Center of Northwest Ohio, and Jay Farris, the chief probation officer for the Ottawa County Juvenile Court. These witnesses provided evidence concerning L.S.'s non-compliance with the conditions of his suspended commitment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 43} L.S., through his attorney, indicated that he had no objection to the state's motion to impose the suspended DYS commitment, and in a judgment entry journalized on June 8, 2017, the trial court granted the state's motion. Despite requesting that his suspended commitment be imposed, and despite offering through his attorney that he had no objection to the state's motion, L.S. in his third assignment of error claims that the juvenile court violated his right to due process when it failed to follow Juv.R. 29 and 35 before imposing the suspended commitment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 44} As in the preceding assignment of error, the state points out that this issue was not raised in the lower court. It also counters that \"the due process requirements which attach to probation revocation proceedings pursuant to Juv.R. 35(D) do not apply to proceedings in which a suspended commitment to DYS is lifted, thereby resulting in the child's commitment.\" To that end, it seeks to characterize the conditions placed upon L.S. by the court as something other than probation conditions-it calls them \"condition[s] of the stay itself.\" The state also argues that the imposition of L.S.'s suspended commitment did not arise out of the filing of a complaint or a probation violation, rather it arose from L.S.'s own request that he serve the rest of his sentence in DYS. It disputes that the proceeding was an adjudicatory hearing requiring compliance with Juv.R. 29.
