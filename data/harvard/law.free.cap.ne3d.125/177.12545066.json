Christopher Young, defendant below and appellant herein, assigns the following error for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-8\">\n   \"THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED PLAIN ERROR BY ACCEPTING A GUILTY PLEA THAT IS MANIFESTLY UNJUST BECAUSE THE RECORD SHOWS THAT NO REASONABLE JURY WOULD FIND CHRISTOPHER YOUNG GUILTY OF FAILING TO NOTIFY THE SHERIFF OF HIS CHANGE IN HIS ADDRESS.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 2} On May 23, 2017, a Lawrence County grand jury returned an indictment that charged appellant with one count of failure to notify a change of address, in violation of R.C. 2950.05(F)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After appellant agreed to plead guilty, the trial court found appellant guilty of failure to notify a change of address and sentenced him to serve seven months in prison. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In his sole assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court plainly erred by accepting his guilty plea to the offense of failing to notify the sheriff of a change of address. In particular, appellant contends the trial court plainly erred by accepting his plea when no reasonable juror would have found appellant guilty of the offense for the following reason: a prior juvenile adjudication cannot serve as a predicate for the offense of failing to notify under R.C. 2950.05(F)(1). Appellant thus contends that permitting a prior juvenile adjudication to serve as an element of an offense committed as an adult violates his right to due process of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 4} First, we note that appellant did not raise this issue during the trial court proceedings. Thus, appellant forfeited the right to raise the issue on appeal. It is well-established that \" ' \"an appellate court will not consider any error which counsel for a party complaining of the trial court's judgment could have called but did not call to the trial court's attention at a time when such error could have been\n   avoided or corrected by the trial court.\" ' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

We do not agree. In\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   , the Ohio Supreme Court held that R.C. 2901.08(A) violates due process by \"treat[ing] a juvenile adjudication as the equivalent of an adult conviction for purposes of enhancing a penalty for a later crime.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1. In\n   <em>\n    Hand\n   </em>\n   , the adult-defendant pleaded guilty to three offenses. At sentencing, the trial court used the defendant's prior juvenile adjudication to enhance the sentence imposed for his adult convictions. The trial court determined that R.C. 2929.13 and R.C. 2901.08(A) authorized it to use the defendant's prior juvenile adjudication as an enhancing element. The court noted that R.C. 2929.13(F)(6) required the court to impose a mandatory prison term if the defendant had a prior first- or second-degree felony conviction. The statute did not define \"convicted,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   however. The trial court thus looked to R.C. 2901.08(A), entitled \"Delinquency adjudications deemed convictions.\" The statute stated that a prior delinquency adjudication \"is a conviction\" for purposes of determining the offense to be charged and the sentence to be imposed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9. The trial court essentially determined that the two statutes meant that \"a juvenile adjudication counts as a previous conviction that can enhance either the degree of a later offense or a subsequent sentence to include mandatory prison time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9. The defendant appealed, and the Second District Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court, the defendant asserted that using a prior juvenile adjudication to enhance his sentence violated his due process rights. The Ohio Supreme Court agreed.

Rather, \"[r]egardless of the predicate conduct, a violation of the statute is a third-degree felony.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. The court additionally rejected the defendant's claim that using a juvenile adjudication as an element of an adult criminal offense \"is more consequential\" than using it as a sentence enhancement. The court observed that \" 'only the existence of a disability * * * is at issue in the statute.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

Nothing in the text of R.C. 2950.05(F)(1) indicates that courts must treat a juvenile adjudication as an adult conviction. The failure-to-notify provision states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   No person who is required to notify a sheriff of a change of address pursuant to division (A) of this section or a change in vehicle information or identifiers pursuant to division (D) of this section shall fail to notify the appropriate sheriff in accordance with that division.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   R.C. 2950.05(F)(1). None of the language in this statute suggests that a juvenile adjudication constitutes an adult conviction. In fact, the provision does not mention the word \"juvenile\" or \"adjudication.\" Although we recognize that a juvenile adjudication gives rise to the duty to notify,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2950.05(B), the duty-to-notify provision does not equate a juvenile adjudication to an adult conviction and it does not enhance the failure-to-notify penalty due to a prior juvenile adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Moreover, R.C. Chapter 2950, including the failure-to-notify provision, reflects a legislative policy decision that individuals labeled as juvenile sex offenders pose an increased risk to public safety and that requiring these individuals to comply with the registration and notification provisions attempts to minimize that risk.

In\n   <em>\n    Buttery\n   </em>\n   , the state indicted the defendant for failing to register under R.C. 2950.04. The defendant's duty to register arose from a juvenile sex-offense adjudication.

The court did not agree. The court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   In this case, R.C. 2950.04 distinguishes between an adult offender convicted of a sexually-oriented offense and a juvenile adjudicated delinquent and classified for having committed a sexually-oriented offense. While both are required to register under the statute, the registration requirements are based on either an adult conviction or a juvenile adjudication. The statute does not treat a juvenile adjudication as a conviction; the juvenile is required to register based upon the juvenile adjudication and classification. The registration requirement does not depend on an adult conviction. Like the juvenile adjudication constituting the disability element in the weapons-under-disability cases, the juvenile adjudication for a sexually-oriented offense requires registration in its own right. The juvenile adjudication is not a penalty-enhancing element; it is an element of the crime of failing to register.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20.
