Upon review, the Court affirms the Indiana Board's final determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Kokomo Urban owns a moderate-income apartment complex in Kokomo, Indiana.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 146-52.) Given the property's location in an economic revitalization area (\"ERA\"), Kokomo Urban was entitled to receive a 100% \"property\n   tax deduction\" for the 2015 tax year and a 50% deduction for the 2016 tax year. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert. Admin. R. at 62-79, 113-14 \u00b6\u00b6 4-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   With the 100% deduction, Kokomo Urban owed no property tax for the 2015 tax year. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 113 \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, 184.) For the 2016 tax year, the Howard County Auditor calculated Kokomo Urban's property tax liability as $ 47,720.46. (Cert. Admin. R. at 114 \u00b6 9, 184.) The Auditor calculated that amount as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   1) $ 2,424,200 (gross assessed value of Kokomo Urban's improvements) x 50% (ERA deduction) = $ 1,212,100;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   2) $ 1,212,100 + $ 32,500 (gross assessed value of Kokomo Urban's land)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   = $ 1,244,600;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   3) $ 1,244,600 x 3.8342% (tax rate) = $ 47,720.46\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 113-14 \u00b6\u00b6 2-3, 6-9.) The Auditor determined that no adjustments to her calculation were necessary because the computed property tax liability did not exceed the property's maximum 2% property tax cap as set forth in Indiana Code \u00a7 6-1.1-20.6-7.5. (Cert. Admin. R. at 113-14 \u00b6\u00b6 2, 7, 9-10.) Her calculation of the property's 2% tax cap amount was:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   1) $ 2,424,200 (gross assessed value of Kokomo Urban's improvements) + $ 32,500 (gross assessed value of Kokomo Urban's land) = $ 2,456,700;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   2) $ 2,456,700 x 2% = $ 49,134\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (Cert. Admin. R. at 114 \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Kokomo Urban challenged the computation of its 2016 property tax liability, first with the Howard County Property Tax Assessment Board of Appeals and then with the Indiana Board. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 1 - 5.) Throughout those appeals, Kokomo Urban argued that under Indiana Code \u00a7 6-1.1-20.6-7.5, its maximum property tax liability was capped at approximately $ 25,000, calculated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   1) $ 2,424,200 (gross assessed value of Kokomo Urban's improvements) x 50% (ERA deduction) = $ 1,212,100;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   2) $ 1,212,100 + $ 32,500 (gross assessed value of Kokomo Urban's land) = $ 1,244,600;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   3) $ 1,244,600 x 2% = $ 24,892\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Cert.

Rather, at the parties' request, it decided the case based on their written briefs and designated evidence. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cert. Admin. R. at 15 - 16.) On June 20, 2018, the Indiana Board issued a final determination ruling against Kokomo Urban. Kokomo Urban initiated an original tax appeal on August 2, 2018. The Court heard the parties' oral arguments on\n   January 14, 2019. Additional facts will be supplied when necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The party seeking to overturn an Indiana Board final determination bears the burden of demonstrating its invalidity.\n   <em>\n    Osolo Twp.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Corrected Br. at 4.) Kokomo Urban\n   has advanced two alternative arguments to support its contention, both of which focus on the definition of \"gross assessed value\" in Indiana Code \u00a7 6-1.1-20.6-1.6. (\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Oral Arg. Tr. at 5-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Kokomo Urban first argues that in defining \"gross assessed value\" under Indiana Code \u00a7 6-1.1-20.6-1.6, the Legislature intended the term \"exemptions\" to include \"deductions.\" As Kokomo Urban explains more fully in its brief:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   in defining \"gross assessed value,\" [ Indiana Code \u00a7 6-1.1-20.6-1.6 ] specifically says that it refers to assessed value of property after all \"exemptions\" under that chapter or any other provision are applied. ... [T]he Indiana Code, for purposes of Article 1.1[,] explicitly define[s] the term \"exemption\" broadly. Specifically, Ind[iana] Code \u00a7 6-1.1-1-6 ... provides that\n   <em>\n    \"['e]xemption means a situation where a certain type of property, or the property of a certain kind of taxpayer, is not taxable under this article.' \"\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%206-1.1-1\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7 6-1.1-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -6 (emphasis added). The term exemption [therefore] means any provision or situation where property is not taxable - this clearly includes ...\n   <em>\n    property that is abated or subject to deductions,\n   </em>\n   and therefore is exempt, i.e.,\n   <em>\n    not taxable.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   (Pet'r Corrected Br. at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   When construing a statute, the primary goal is to determine and apply the intent of the Legislature in enacting that statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hamilton Square Inv., LLC v.

Consequently, meaning must be given to each and every word used in a statute because it will not be presumed that the Legislature intended to enact a statutory provision that is superfluous, meaningless, or a nullity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hamilton Square Inv.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12327728,12144446\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/60/313/\">\n    60 N.E.3d at 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Tax Ct. 2010). Finally, the words of a statute must be read within the context of the whole statutory act of which they are a part as well as in harmony with other statutes applicable to the same subject matter.\n   <em>\n    Johnson Cty.

Indeed, for purposes of Indiana's\n   <em>\n    whole\n   </em>\n   property tax statutory system, the Legislature provided\n   <em>\n    discrete\n   </em>\n   statutory definitions for the terms \"exemption\" and \"deduction.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   IND. CODE \u00a7\u00a7 6-1.1-1-5, -6 (2016) (defining \"deduction\" as \"a situation where a taxpayer is permitted to subtract a fixed dollar amount from the assessed value of his property\" and \"exemption\" as \"a situation where a certain type of property, or the property of a certain kind of taxpayer, is not taxable\"). Given these independent and\n   substantively distinct definitions, the Legislature could not have intended the term \"exemptions\" to include the differently defined term \"deductions\" or to use the two terms interchangeably for purposes of Indiana Code \u00a7 6-1.1-20.6-1.6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   This conclusion is supported by the principle of\n   <em>\n    expressio unius est exclusio alterius\n   </em>\n   , which instructs that the enumeration of certain things in a statute implies the exclusion of all others.\n   <em>\n    Caylor-Nickel Clinic, P.C. v. Indiana Dep't of State Revenue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10990604\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/569/765/#p772\">\n    569 N.E.2d 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 772 (Ind.

Thus, with its specific reference in Indiana Code \u00a7 6-1.1-20.6-1.6 to exemptions, but not to deductions, the Legislature's plain language demonstrates its intent to exclude deductions from the formula for calculating \"gross assessed value\" and thus from the resulting maximum property tax to be imposed under Indiana Code \u00a7 6-1.1-20.6-7.5. Accordingly, the Court will not reverse the Indiana Board's final determination on the basis of this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In the alternative, Kokomo Urban argues that in defining \"gross assessed value\" under Indiana Code \u00a7 6-1.1-20.6-1.6, the Legislature intended the phrase \"or any other provision\" to mean \"any other provision\n   <em>\n    that reduces a property's gross\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    assessed value\n   </em>\n   ,\" which would necessarily include deductions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Corrected Br. at 8; Oral Arg. Tr. at 7.) More specifically, Kokomo Urban states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   the language \"any other provision\" should include deductions because ... it states \"After the application,\" if you take that out, if you take out the middle clause there of \"all exemptions,\" it basically says \"After the application of any other provision,\" it doesn't go on to clarify any further. It doesn't say ... \"any other exemption provision,\" it doesn't say \"any other provision regarding exemptions,\" it just says \"any other provision,\" which ... would include deductions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   (Oral Arg. Tr. at 7-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Kokomo Urban's alternative argument\n   <em>\n    adds\n   </em>\n   words to the definition of \"gross assessed value\" as used in Indiana Code \u00a7 6-1.1-20.6-1.6 to arrive at the result it desires. Specifically, Kokomo Urban asks the Court to find that \"gross assessed value\" means \"the assessed value of property after the application of all exemptions under IC 6-1.1-10 or any other provision\n   <em>\n    that reduces a property's gross assessed\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    value\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Corrected Br. at 8.) As previously noted, however, words will not be read into a statute that simply are not there.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DeKalb Cty. E. Cmty. Sch.

This construction accounts for the fact that, as Kokomo Urban has acknowledged, not all of Indiana's property tax exemptions are codified in Indiana Code \u00a7 6-1.1-10. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet'r Corrected Br. at 7 n.2.) Indeed, Indiana Code \u00a7 6-1.1-10-38 provides a lengthy list of Indiana Code citations that contain property tax exemptions in addition to those delineated in Indiana Code \u00a7 6-1.1-10. IND. CODE \u00a7 6-1.1-10-38 (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Kokomo Urban's second argument has not convinced the Court that in defining\n   \"gross assessed value\" under Indiana Code \u00a7 6-1.1-20.6-1.6, the Legislature intended the phrase \"any other provision\" to mean \"any other provision that reduces a property's gross assessed value.\" Accordingly, the Court will not reverse the Indiana Board's final determination on this basis either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Kokomo Urban has not demonstrated to the Court that the Indiana Board's final determination is in error.

(\n    <em>\n     See,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Cert. Admin. R. at 2, 138-39, 191.) The Indiana Board attributed the variance in Kokomo Urban's results to whether the ERA deduction was to be applied to the gross assessed value of the land. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Cert. Admin. R. at 272 n.3.) Ultimately, given the Court's holding in this opinion, the variance between Kokomo Urban's calculations is of no consequence.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Indiana Code \u00a7 6-1.1-10 contains over 30 specific property exemptions.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%206-1.1-10\">\n     Ind.

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Cert. Admin. R. at 138 n.3.) The Court will not address that claim having found no misapplication of the property tax cap. In addition, Kokomo Urban asserted during the oral argument that its contract rights had been impaired \"because [it] negotiated a tax benefit with the City [of Kokomo] that it thought it was entitled to ... [but was] denied[.]\" (Oral Arg. Tr. at 17-18.) The contract between Kokomo Urban and the City of Kokomo specifically states that the terms of the agreement \"shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Indiana.\" (Cert. Admin. R. at 172.) Thus, the benefit Kokomo Urban mistakenly thought it was entitled to is irrelevant: it is not entitled to a windfall merely because it relied on its own misinterpretation of the law that governed its agreement and the benefit it thought it would receive.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
