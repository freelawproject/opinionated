All the charges were felonies, and firearm specifications attached to many of the charges. Appellant was sentenced to an aggregate sentence of twenty and one-half years in prison. We appointed counsel to represent Appellant on appeal. Counsel filed a no merit brief and a motion to withdraw as counsel pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State v.

If the court, in its independent review, determines that a possible issue exists, it must discharge current counsel and appoint new counsel to prosecute the appeal.

Courts have read this requirement as requiring appellate courts to comb the entire record for possible errors.\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   , 4th Dist.,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017-Ohio-5772\">\n    2017-Ohio-5772\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20N.E.3d%20942\">\n    83 N.E.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at \u00b6 16. Often, the result of this procedure is that a case with no nonfrivolous issues receives a much more extensive review than a case in which specific assignments of error are raised by counsel. This review by the appellate court places the court in a position of advocate on behalf of the indigent defendant, which is not the role of the courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b613} We are aware that some courts, such as the Eighth District Court of Appeals, have found that\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   does not require the appellate court to comb the entire record for error, but rather, only requires an independent appellate review of the points raised in the\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   no merit brief and any additional points raised by the pro se defendant.\n   <em>\n    State v. Taylor\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist. No. 101368,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-420\">\n    2015-Ohio-420\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%20479063\">\n    2015 WL 479063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To us, this interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   does not assist our review and may even hinder it. Any suggestion of error regarding the manifest weight of the evidence, which is one of the most common arguments made on appeal when a trial or fact-finding hearing is involved, will inevitably require us to examine the entire factual record. Any claim that a guilty or no contest plea is somehow problematic will inevitably require a complete and thorough review of the plea process from beginning to end, which entails a review of the entire record. On the other hand, if neither counsel nor the pro se defendant points to anything specific that might be a potential error, then it would seem the Eighth District approach would require no review at all. We do not believe that was\n   the intent of\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   . Therefore, we conclude that the Eighth District approach is not a viable solution for this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b614} We agree with the Fourth District that our past\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   procedure essentially required the court of appeals to act as the defendant's counsel by identifying issues that should have been argued by appointed counsel. The defendant, in effect, has not one appellate counsel but several-his original appointed counsel who filed the\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief; a three-judge panel of this court; and new substitute counsel. If substitute counsel also finds no meritorious issues, then the process occurs again with another review of the entire record and the possible appointment of another attorney. This gives the indigent defendant more than he could expect had counsel (whether retained or appointed) decided to simply argue the appeal on its merits. The\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   procedure attempts to protect the Sixth Amendment right to have reasonably effective professional representation on appeal, rather than a right \"to have a committee of counsel including judges of the court of appeals.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b615} Typically, trial counsel has filed the appeal rather than appointed appellate counsel. Therefore, it is imperative that appellate counsel discuss the case with the defendant and decide whether to continue the appeal based on counsel's examination of the case. If counsel believes the appeal is frivolous, counsel should inform the defendant and explain why the appeal should be abandoned. If the defendant decides that there are specific issues that he or she wishes to raise on appeal, counsel must file a merit brief and argue the defendant's appeal as persuasively as possible regardless of any personal belief that the appeal is frivolous. This does not mean counsel must argue every issue the defendant believes meritorious. Counsel, as has always been the case, may exercise strategic judgment in the presentation of the issues in the brief. See\n   <em>\n    Jones v. Barnes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6199647\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/745/#p751\">\n    463 U.S. 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 751,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6199647\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/745/#p751\">\n    103 S.Ct. 3308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6199647\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/745/#p751\">\n    77 L.Ed.2d 987\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983). We believe that requiring counsel to file a merit brief is \"simpler, more effective, fairer, and less taxing on counsel and the courts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b616} Therefore, we hold that in any criminal appeal as a matter of right, it is no longer an acceptable practice in this court for counsel to file an\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   no merit brief, or as we have designated it in this court, a\n   <em>\n    Toney\n   </em>\n   brief. This also means that counsel may not file a motion to withdraw on the grounds that the appeal is frivolous. If the defendant does not wish to dismiss the appeal after consulting with counsel, then counsel must file a merit brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b617} We hereby overrule paragraphs two, three, four, five, six, and seven of\n   <em>\n    State v.
