For the following reasons, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and\n   remand the matter for further proceedings related to the statutory negligence claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In October 2015, appellant moved into an apartment in a 64-unit complex owned and managed by appellees. Appellant's daughter also lived in the apartment and both women are on the lease. The apartment complex includes an uncovered, surface parking lot. Residents of the apartment complex are not assigned a parking spot; tenants and their guests are allowed to park in any open spot. A grassy area lies between appellant's apartment and the parking lot, and a walkway provides access from the apartment to the lot. \"[Ninety] percent of the time,\" appellant would park her car in the first parking spot next to the walkway, which was the closest spot to her apartment. (Rawlings Dep. at 8, 9.) That parking spot was fronted by a concrete block parking barrier, also called a \"wheel stop,\" centered and wholly contained within the lateral confines of that one parking space. (Rawlings Aff. at 1.) The other ten percent of the time appellant would park in \"whichever space was available\" in the lot. (Rawlings Dep. at 9.) According to appellant, some of those other spaces had a wheel stop and some did not, but she knew there were wheel stops at the parking lot of her apartment complex spaces generally and believed \"[t]here are parking blocks in every parking lot.\" (Rawlings Dep. at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On March 1, 2016, appellant's car was parked not in her usual first spot next to the walkway but in the second spot over from the walkway. The second spot from the walkway was also fronted by a wheel stop, but, unlike the first spot, it sat halfway in the second spot and halfway in the third spot, essentially forming a \"T\" with the white painted line that divided spot two from spot three. Another person's car was parked next to her in spot three.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Appellant had parked her car in the second spot. In doing so, appellant had not noticed there was a wheel stop in front of the second spot at all and explained that in getting out of her car from the driver's side, she would not have noticed it because of where the wheel stop was situated. Appellant agreed that had she been looking straight ahead when she was pulling her car into the second spot, she would have been able to see the wheel stop; in other words, nothing prevented her from seeing the wheel stop while pulling in.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} At approximately 6:00 p.m. that evening, appellant and her daughter left their apartment to go to dinner. Because her daughter was going to drive appellant's car, appellant headed to the passenger side of the vehicle. Due to flooding in the parking lot behind her car, appellant cut through the grassy area to get to her car instead of taking the walkway and going around the back of her car. It was dark outside. According to appellant, while the grassy area on the other side of the walkway had lighting, the parking lot did not. Before she got to the passenger side door, appellant's right leg caught the wheel stop and she fell to the ground, sustaining numerous physical injuries including a broken arm, a lacerated knee, and injuries to her nose and teeth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} According to appellant, she was looking \"towards the white line,\" which she could see, and \"towards the passenger side\" of her car at the time of the fall. (Rawlings Dep. at 14.) At one point in her deposition, appellant stated \"[i]f you walked with your head straight down * * *, I probably would've noticed [the wheel stop]\" but then separately stated either she \"[didn't] know\" or was \"not really sure\" if she would have been able to see the wheel stop had she been looking in\n   front of her while walking or that \"shadows from the car\" would have prevented her from seeing the wheel stop. (Rawlings Dep. at 14-15.) Appellant added she \"would imagine * * * I would've noticed it probably about the time I hit it.\" (Rawlings Dep. at 15.) Appellant said she still lives at the apartment and is able to see the wheel stop she tripped over.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} The day following the accident, appellant's daughter informed Latearia Drumgo (\"Drumgo\"), the property manager for Elon, of the fall, and Drumgo viewed the area where the fall occurred, completed an incident report, and sent the report to her district manager. According to Drumgo and the service manager for Elon at the time, Alfred Riley (\"Riley\"), they make rounds of the property daily; Drumgo did not think the parking lot was flooded on the day of the accident. Both Drumgo and Riley believed there is lighting in the parking lot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} According to Elon's District Manager Michael Bagby (\"Bagby\"), appellees were not the original owners and managers of the complex, but, rather, the property had been bought and sold multiple times since its initial construction in 1984. Riley and Drumgo were not sure about the exact history of the wheel stops, but both stated the wheel stops were in place since they began working at the property (which preceded appellant's arrival as a tenant), and at no point had wheel stops been removed or added during their tenures. Both Riley and Drumgo also believed the position of the wheel stops-half in one space and half in another space-is consistent throughout the property. Drumgo, Riley, and Bagby stated the purpose of a wheel stop is to prevent cars from rolling onto the grass or into buildings. Appellant had never complained or expressed concern about the positioning of the wheel stops previously, and appellees never received any complaint about the wheel stops and never had an instance where someone was injured because of one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On November 1, 2016, appellant filed a complaint alleging common law and Ohio landlord-tenant statutory negligence claims against appellees arising out of a \"misplaced cement parking barrier\" that caused her to fall and fracture her upper arm and have severe injuries to her teeth, knee, and head including a concussion, contusion of the voice box, and facial lacerations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Nov. 1, 2016 Compl. at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} After appellant was deposed, appellees filed a motion for summary judgment on January 24, 2018 arguing: (1) appellant's negligence claim fails because the wheel stop was open and obvious; (2) there were no attendant circumstances, such as a shadow from a car or the general darkness outside, to prevent the open and obvious nature of the wheel stop; and (3) Ohio's landlord-tenant law is inapplicable since \"there are no sections in R.C. 5321.01(A) that can be applied to a 'misplaced' cement parking barrier.\" (Jan. 24, 2018 Mot. for Summ. Jgmt. at 8.) Appellees\n   pointed to appellant's deposition in support of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On March 14, 2018, appellant filed a memorandum in opposition to appellees' motion for summary judgment arguing appellees were negligent by positioning a wheel stop, a known tripping hazard, in the aisle between adjacent parking spots where pedestrians are expected to walk. According to appellant, there is a genuine issue of material fact present as to whether there were attendant circumstances contributing to appellant's fall that would rebut an open and obvious defense, including:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (1) It was 6:00 p.m. and dark out.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (2) There was an absence of artificial light in the parking lot.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (3) There were shadows from the parked vehicle cast onto the ground.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (4) There was a vehicle parked next to [appellant's] vehicle which permitted only a small portion of the wheel stop to protrude out from under the parked cars.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (5) The wheel stop was not painted or marked in contrast with its surroundings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (6) There was flooding in the parking lot behind [appellant's] vehicle which restricted her options as to where she could walk.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (7) [Appellant] had never parked her vehicle in a situation like this before where a wheel stop was half in her parking space and half in another parking space.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (8) [Appellant] was looking down at the painted white stall line in order to assure herself of a safe path of travel and did not see anything.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (9) The wheel stop was improperly placed in the natural aisle between adjacent vehicles, rather than fronting the parking space.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (Mar. 14, 2018 Memo. in Opp. at 10-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Appellant further argued the open-and-obvious doctrine does not preclude liability under Ohio landlord-tenant law, and there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether appellees violated their duty to keep common areas in a safe condition pursuant to R.C. 5321.01(A)(3). Appellant pointed to her own deposition and affidavit, the depositions of Drumgo, Riley, and Bagby, photographs of the parking space and lot, and the affidavit of Catherine Peterman, a forensic architect for Robson Forensic, Inc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 13} According to Peterman's affidavit, her education, training, and experience includes the design, construction, and maintenance of multi-family residential developments, including apartment housing, and she is often called on to evaluate the safety and compliance of multi-family residential development, including apartment housing, with respect to applicable building and property maintenance codes and relevant industry standards. Peterman described the applicable standard of care as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   18. It is well established for at least four decades that parking lot wheel stops are a pedestrian trip-and-fall hazard. The standard of care for parking lots at residential housing developments requires that wheel stops should not be used where pedestrians are expected to be walking.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   27. * * * The standard of care for safe parking lots requires that low features such as wheel stops be painted to make them more conspicuous. Since pedestrians will assume that walkways do not have hazards, property owners must either eliminate hazards, or at least take\n   the less effective step of making sure they are conspicuous. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   28. This requires painting with appropriate warning colors. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   32. The standard of care for a property owner and property manager of a multi-family housing complex includes maintaining safe premises for residents and guests. It includes ensuring that reasonable periodic inspections are conducted to identify hazards, and correcting those hazards in a prompt manner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   33. It is the property owner's responsibility to maintain safe premises at all times. When dangerous conditions exist, such as the wheel stops, reasonable efforts should be made to remove them or prevent them from being encountered in a manner that could cause harm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   (Peterman Aff. at 3-5.) She then opined:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   37. Within the bounds of reasonable architectural and technical certainty, and subject to change if additional information becomes available * * *:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   a. The location of the wheel stop where [appellant] fell was a tripping hazard along a foreseeable pedestrian path that violated applicable code and standards for safe parking lots and was dangerous in a manner that caused her fall and injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   b. The placement of wheel stops in a foreseeable pedestrian path, as existed at Springwood Apartments, created a dangerous tripping hazard in the means of egress that caused [appellant] to trip and fall.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   c. Elan Property Management should have reasonably known that wheel stops installed on the painted lines in the natural aisle between parking spaces, where pedestrians walk between parked cars are hazardous.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   d. The lack of conspicuous marking on the wheel stops impaired the ability of pedestrians like [appellant] to identify and avoid them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   e. Placing wheel stops in an area specifically designed and intended for pedestrians violated the standard of care and created the dangerous condition that caused [appellant's] fall and injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   (Peterman Aff. at 6.) In support of her opinion, Peterman cited to an array of \"nationally accepted\" guides and standards, including: \"ASTM Standard F 1637-10, '\n   <em>\n    Standard Practice for Safe Walking Surfaces\n   </em>\n   ,' ASTM International, West Conshohocken, PA, 2010\"; American National Standards Institute; International Property Maintenance Code, Section 301.3; Dov Zohar,\n   <em>\n    Why Do We Bump Into Things While Walking\n   </em>\n   (The Human Factors Society, 1978); Kevin Lynch,\n   <em>\n    Site Planning\n   </em>\n   (The M.I.T. Press, Cambridge, MA, 1962); Ramsey/Sleeper,\n   <em>\n    Architectural Graphic Standards\n   </em>\n   , 10th Ed. (John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 2000);\n   <em>\n    Parking Principles\n   </em>\n   (National Academy of Engineering, Washington, D.C., 1971);\n   <em>\n    The Dimensions of Parking\n   </em>\n   (The Urban Land Institute and the National Parking Association, 1993); and Wesley E. Woodson,\n   <em>\n    Human Factors Design Handbook\n   </em>\n   , 2d Edition (McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York, 1992). (Peterman Aff. at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 14} In their reply in support of summary judgment, appellees contended that Peterman's affidavit should be stricken because appellant failed to timely identify her as an expert witness and because her opinions are immaterial to open-and-obvious hazards. Appellees additionally contended that the attendant circumstances identified by appellant are not adequate to create an issue of material fact as to the open-and-obvious doctrine and that the concrete parking barrier is not in violation of Ohio's landlord-tenant law under\n   R.C. 5321.04(A)(3) because no evidence shows appellees knew and or should have known of the factual circumstances that caused any alleged violation of the landlord-tenant act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 15} On April 23, 2018, the trial court granted appellees' motion for summary judgment. Regarding the statutory negligence claim, the trial court found \"[t]he fact that [appellees] knew parking barriers in the lot extended over two spaces in and of itself is insufficient to invoke liability under R.C. 5321.04(A)(3) [sic],\" and the \"relevant inquiry is whether [appellees] had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous nature of the condition or hazard.\" (Apr. 23, 2018 Trial Ct. Decision &amp; Entry at 6.) The trial court noted that it \"would have been inclined to strike Peterman's affidavit\" had appellees submitted a \"motion to strike or exclude Peterman on the basis of the improper disclosure\" of an expert witness. (Trial Ct. Decision &amp; Entry at 7.) Nevertheless, to the trial court, Peterman's affidavit was immaterial on the issues of whether the wheel stop barrier was open and obvious and whether appellees had \"notice of the hazard.\" (Trial Ct. Decision &amp; Entry at 7.) Rather:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   The uncontroverted facts, even when construed in favor of [appellant], establish [appellees] had no actual or constructive notice that the position of its parking barrier posed a hazard to pedestrians at its premises. [Appellees] maintained the half and half parking barriers at its lot for several years prior [to appellant's] fall. Prior to the incident, neither [appellant], nor any other tenant, complained to [appellees] or its employees about the positioning of the barriers being unsafe. Nothing within Peterman's affidavit contradicts these facts, or provided a sufficient basis for the Court to impute knowledge upon [appellees].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   (Trial Ct. Decision &amp; Entry at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Thus, the trial court found appellant failed to present evidence demonstrating the placement of the wheel stop was a hazardous condition appellees knew or should have known about, and appellant \"cannot establish an essential element of the statutory claim (i.e. the landlord or premises owner's notice of the hazard)\" to hold appellees liable under R.C. 5321.04(A)(3). (Trial Ct. Decision &amp; Entry at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Regarding the common-law negligence claim, the trial court found the hazard presented by the wheel stop to be open and obvious with none of the nine attendant circumstances presented by appellant \"significant enough to obviate application of the open and obvious doctrine, or create an issue of fact about the obvious nature of the hazard created by a parking barrier.\" (Trial Ct. Decision &amp; Entry at 12.) As a result, the trial court found appellees owed appellant no duty to warn or protect her from the open-and-obvious nature of the wheel stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Appellant filed a timely appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Appellant assigns the following as trial court error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   The Trial Court Erred in Granting Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Whether the open-and-obvious nature of a hazard presents a question of law for the court or a question of fact for the jury will depend largely on the facts of each particular case.\n   <em>\n    Cooper\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 28} In this case, appellant first argues that the wheel stop at issue was not open and obvious because, similar to the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   case, the wheel stop was placed in an unusual position, and the position was not customary with her experience of parking in the lot. We disagree with appellant's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 29} In\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , while attending a golf event at a country club she had never been to before, the plaintiff tripped and fell over a concrete curb located between a grass surface and an artificial turf surface. The plaintiff argued the curb was obscured by overgrown grass and, as an experienced golfer, she would not anticipate a concrete curb in that location. This court found a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the curb was open and obvious. In doing so, we noted competing photographs in the record-some with a visible curb and some with an obscured curb-and the plaintiff's testimony about the unusual location of the curb raised a question of\n   whether the curb was so obvious and apparent the plaintiff may reasonably be expected to discover and protect herself from it. We likewise found a question remained as to whether an attendant circumstance (golfers warming up) created an exception to the open-and-obvious doctrine. We found, for purposes of summary judgment, the trial court impermissibly weighed the evidence and drew its own conclusion amid the competing evidence, thereby committing an error of law. Therefore, we found summary judgment granted in favor of the defendant to be in error and reversed the decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 30} The\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   decision does not demand reversal here. First, generally, appellate courts consider wheel stops an open-and-obvious tripping hazard.\n   <em>\n    Furano v. Sunrise Inn of Warren, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 11th Dist. No. 2008-T-0132,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009-Ohio-3150\">\n    2009-Ohio-3150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%201845228\">\n    2009 WL 1845228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18 (\"The hazard presented by a tire stop * * * is so open and obvious that anyone exiting a vehicle which has just pulled into a parking spot fronted by a tire stop is reasonably expected to take precautions and negotiate his or her steps around the elevation.\");\n   <em>\n    Cash v.

Second, in regard to the open-and-obvious doctrine, the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   opinion rested on more than the location of the curb and particularly focused on competing evidence regarding whether the curb was covered by overgrown grass. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , uncontroverted photographic evidence in the instant case shows the wheel stop is observable and not hidden or concealed from view. In fact, appellant testified that had she been looking straight ahead when she was pulling her car into the second spot, she would have been able to see the wheel stop and nothing prevented her from seeing the wheel stop while pulling in. Appellant also testified that since the accident she was able to observe the wheel stop. Third, we note the allegedly \"unusual\" location of the wheel stop in this case (spanning two parking spots) makes the curb more, rather than less, visible within a pedestrian's path. (Appellant's Brief at 25.) Therefore, barring attendant circumstances, we find the wheel stop in this case to be open and obvious as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Appellant argues the exception for attendant circumstances should nonetheless apply in this case because it was dark out, the absence of lighting in the parking lot created shadows from the vehicles, the wheel stop was a \"dark cement color\" that was difficult to distinguish from the black pavement, appellant was forced to approach the car by way of the grassy area instead of through the parking lot due to flooding, and appellant was unfamiliar with the wheel stop in the second parking space from the walkway and the usual spot she parked had a centered wheel stop. (Appellant's Brief at 28.) Citing\n   <em>\n    Furano\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Cash\n   </em>\n   , both of which found no attendant circumstances to overcome the open-and-obvious doctrine, appellant acknowledges that \"Ohio courts have repeatedly held that the previously mentioned circumstances are ordinarily not enough to be considered adequate attendant circumstances.\" (Appellant's Brief at 28.) However, appellant believes the additional circumstance present here-the \"unexpected and improper\" location of the wheel stop across the foreseeable pedestrian pathway-distinguishes this case from the likes of\n   <em>\n    Furano\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Cash\n   </em>\n   and creates an issue of material fact based on the attendant circumstances doctrine. (Appellant's Brief at 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Appellate courts typically view darkness as a circumstance that increases, rather than decreases, the degree of care an ordinary person would exercise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    Jeswald v.

Thus, in this case, appellant has not demonstrated the unpainted wheel stop fits within the definition of an attendant circumstance.\n   <em>\n    Haller\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10 ;\n   <em>\n    Esterman\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11 ;\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Appellant's next arguments likewise do not fit within the parameters of the attendant circumstances doctrine. Regarding the position of the wheel stop, generally speaking, a wheel stop that protrudes beyond a vehicle's tire does \"not reflect any distraction or diversion that would warrant an application of the doctrine of attendant circumstances.\" (Emphasis omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Furano\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cash\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32 (protrusion of parking bumper six to nine inches beyond the passenger side of the vehicle is not an attendant circumstance and has no bearing on the open-and-obvious nature of the hazard);\n   <em>\n    Zambo v.

While appellant argues the distinction from\n   <em>\n    Furano\n   </em>\n   here is that the wheel stop spanned the entire pedestrian path, appellant did not testify (and does not argue) the position of the wheel stop distracted her or diverted her attention; she essentially testified in the opposite.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, despite the distinction between the location of the wheel stop here and\n   <em>\n    Furano\n   </em>\n   , we are not persuaded the trial court erred in declining to deem the location of the wheel stop an attendant circumstance in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Appellant's flooding argument similarly fails. This court has determined a plaintiff's belief that only one walking route is available is immaterial to whether the hazard itself was open and obvious.\n   <em>\n    Jenkins\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15 (\"even if the inmate believed he had only one route available, his inability to select his route of travel does not mean the hazard was not an open and obvious condition\"). Moreover, appellant discussed flooding as the reason she chose a particular pathway but did not testify (and does not argue) that flooding distracted her and was the reason she did not look down so as to fit within the attendant circumstances doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Considering all the above, we find the wheel stop in this case to be an open-and-obvious hazard, and appellant has not demonstrated attendant circumstances, viewed individually and collectively, warrant an exception to the open-and-obvious doctrine. On reviewing the evidence, we believe the trial court correctly concluded that appellees have shown there to be no genuine issue of material fact for trial in this regard. Therefore, we overrule appellant's assignment of error as it relates to common-law negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

We note the trial court did not actually determine whether a statutory violation occurred since it determined appellant could not prove appellants had notice of a hazard. Regardless, in\n   <em>\n    Lilly\n   </em>\n   , this court addressed a similar argument. There, we stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   [C]ontrary to appellants' suggestion, the Ohio Supreme Court did not hold in\n   <em>\n    Robinson\n   </em>\n   that all claims against a landlord for breach of a landlord's statutory duty must be submitted to a jury. Rather, the Ohio Supreme Court examined the record before it and concluded that, \"[f]rom the testimony, it is clear that a jury should have been allowed to consider whether [the landlord] exercised reasonable diligence and care in [a repair] * * * or instead breached her statutory duty to repair.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23. Thus, appellant's argument, which suggests the question of whether a landlord violated Ohio landlord-tenant law is always a question for the jury, is unsupported under this court's precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   {\u00b6 43} The remainder of appellant's argument centers on whether the trial court misinterpreted the notice requirement and erred in finding the expert affidavit immaterial. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellees on the statutory negligence claim solely because appellant failed to present evidence that appellees had \"actual or constructive notice\n   <em>\n    of the dangerous nature of the condition or hazard\n   </em>\n   \"; in other words, \"that the positioning of its parking barriers posed a hazard to pedestrians at its premises.\" (Emphasis added.) (Trial Ct. Decision &amp; Entry at 6, 7.) The trial court found the fact appellees knew parking barriers in the lot extended over two spaces in and of itself is insufficient to invoke liability under R.C. 5321.04(A)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Citing primarily to\n   <em>\n    Sikora\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Wochele\n   </em>\n   , appellant contends the notice requirement simply \"requires landlords have notice\n   <em>\n    of the condition\n   </em>\n   \" causing the statutory violation and \"does not require landlords have notice of the dangerous nature of the condition.\" (Emphasis added.) (Appellant's Brief at 18.) Appellant contends\n   <em>\n    Wochele\n   </em>\n   is consistent with\n   <em>\n    Sikora\n   </em>\n   in looking for evidence the landlord knew about a fallen cinderblock rather than whether the landlord knew the cinderblock was dangerous. To appellant, in light of the expert affidavit, \"common sense\" that the wheel stop position across the pedestrian pathway is a tripping hazard and appellees' knowledge of the position of the wheel stops, a reasonable juror could find appellees had notice of the condition causing a violation of R.C. 5321.04(A)(3).
