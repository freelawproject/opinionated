This action is to recover a brokerage of 5 per cent, for causing the sale of defendants\u2019 saloon for $15,750. It was conceded that plaintiff was entitled to this commission of $787.50, if to anything, but liability by defendants was denied. The evidence for plaintiff shows that he took the purchaser to the saloon, and introduced him to one partner, and he informed him that he had brought him to buy the saloon, and the purchaser then offered, first, $10,000, and afterwards $15,000, this offer to stand until Monday night; that this partner refused to accept until he had consulted his copartner, and bade the purchaser and plaintiff return; that at the appointed time and place both partners, the purchaser, and plaintiff met, and the negotiations were renewed by plaintiff, who said the purchaser would pay $15,500, but this the purchaser refused to pay at first, but finally consented, and plaintiff testified: \u201cThen I had a conversation with defendant Englehard, and he said to me: \u2018 You see Quirk [the purchaser] again, and see if he won\u2019t go $250. Tell him I will split the difference with him.\u2019 So I went out and saw Mr. Quirk, and told him what Mr. Englehard said. Mr. Quirk said $250 would not stand in the way of his getting the saloon. Then I saw Mr. Englehard, and told him what Mr. Quirk said, and I asked him what he thought of me as a broker, and he said I was the best go-between he ever saw.\u201d And Mr. Englehard, on cross-examination, was asked: <em>\u201cQuestion. </em>Mr. Meislahn didn\u2019t propose to buy this store as principal? <em>Answer. </em>He said, the first night, *My client,\u2019 referring to Mr. Quirk. \u201d The evidence as shown by the record was ample\" to carry the case to the jury, and the judgment and order appealed from must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
