(2) Was there the special agreement between the parties as to the ejectment suit following the action for the award as set up in the counterclaim? The trial resulted in a verdict for defendants in the sumof $5,639.54, the amount set up in defendants\u2019 answer as a counterclaim, the sum admitted by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney upon the trial to be the value of the services claimed by defendants, in case the jury found that the defendants were entitled to recover upon such counterclaim. The jury, by their verdict, disallowed plaintiff\u2019s claim, finding that the defendants were not indebted to the plaintiff in the sum of $475, as claimed in plaintiff\u2019s complaint. Upon the trial, the court, among other questionsleft by it to the jury, charged at therequest of plaintiff\u2019sattorney as follows: \u201c(3) Before the jury can find averdict for the defendants, they must find that the plaintiff agreed on November 11, 1886, to pay them a proportionate sum in the ejectment suit, namely, $5,639.54.\u201d The attorney for the plaintiff in his moving affidavit claims that the jury did not consider at all the directions of the trial justice, above cited. The presumption is that the jury, in its proper discharge of its duty, followed the instructions of the court, and it is clear that it followed such instructions from the fact that it rendered its verdict (after disallowing plaintiff\u2019s claim) for the identical amount named by the trial justice in his charge, and thus found that the plaintiff made the agreement referred to in the charge. The affidavits of the jurors attached to plaintiff\u2019s moving papers were evidently disregarded by the justice before whom the motion was made, and properly so, as the principle is well established that jurors cannot be heard by affidavits or otherwise to impeach their verdict. See <em>Clum </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>5 Hill, 560; <em>Williams v. Montgomery, </em>60 N. Y. 648. Order appealed from must be affirmed, with costs to the respondents. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
