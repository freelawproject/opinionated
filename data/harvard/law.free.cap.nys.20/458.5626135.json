From a judgment for plaintiffs at special term, defendant appeals. Affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-14\">The following opinion was delivered by Mr. Justice Adams, who tried the case:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b478-15\">\u201cThe evidence in this case establishes with reasonable certainty that the plaintiffs are the owners of a farm in the town of Phelps, Ontario county, containing about 100 acres of land; that the defendant is a railroad corporation organized under chapter 140 of the Laws of 1850; and that by condemnation proceedings it has acquired title, for the use of the railroad, to a strip-of land about 2,300 feet in length, running through the plaintiffs\u2019 farm in an easterly and westerly direction, dividing the farm into two nearly equal parts 4 that such strip is about 99 feet in width at the east end, and continues through the greater portion of the farm at that width, but, as it approaches the west line, the width increases to nearly 150 feet; that the entire strip contains-about 6 acres of land, and the compensation awarded the plaintiffs therefor,, and for the damage to the remaining premises, in such condemnation proceedings, was the sum' of $3,590; that the plaintiffs\u2019 barns and other farm buildings are on the north side of the line of the railroad, and there is also on-the same side an inexhaustible spring of water; that the lands- upon the south side are in a state of cultivation, and are often used for pasturing large numbers of sheep and cattle, after the crops are removed, but in the latter -part of the season there is no supply of water upon these lands, and the sheep and cattle there pastured are watered at the spring upon the north side; that for a distance of about 1;800 feet the defendant\u2019s railroad, when completed, will be in a cut or excavation of from 2 to 13 feet below the surface, which for most of the way will be impassable for teams and cattle by reason of the depth; that at a point a few hundred feet east of the west line of the farm there is a natural depression or hollow, that is crossed by the railroad, and the plaintiffs have been accustomed to use this depression as- an easy and direct passageway for teams in going to and from the north and south parts of the farm, in their farming operations, and also for the use of their cattle, pastured upon the south side, in going to and from the spring upon the north <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>side; that the defendant\u2019s road is being constructed across this depression at a grade of about 12 feet above the surface of the ground, and the defendant intends to fill in such depression to that depth in order to carry its tracks over the same, and that, when this is accomplished, there will be an impassible barrier to the passage of teams or cattle through this depression. In the construction of its road over the plaintiffs\u2019 farm upon the proposed route the defendant has offered to provide two crossings at grade for the use of the plaintiffs, one of them being about 300 feet west of the depression, and the other about 200 feet east; or, in lieu of either one of these, one at the extreme eastern end of the farm; but either of the proposed crossings in \"the vicinity of the depression will involve the necessity of overcoming a considerable grade in the use of the same, and there is some doubt whether they could be used, when constructed, without great inconvenience to the plaintiffs. Before this action was commenced, the plaintiffs requested of the defendant that they be allowed an under-grade crossing through the depression, which request was refused, the principal reason assigned for such refusal being that there was not sufficient room therefor; and thereupon the defendant proceeded to fill in such depression, but had not finished the same when this action was brought, restraining it from so doing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-5\">\u201cUpon these facts it must be assumed, I think, that the depression referred to has afforded to the plaintiffs the natural and most convenient means of passing to and from the north and south portions of their farm, and that it lias been generally, though not always, used for that purpose. It may likewise be assumed that when the defendant\u2019s road is constructed across such depression there will be ample room for an under-grade crossing, which can be easily provided, although, as is testified to by the defendant\u2019s engineer, this will involve an additional cost of about $2,600. The question, therefore, which fairly presents itself to the court is, shall the defendant be required to incur this expense, in order to provide the plaintiffs with a convenient means of crossing its tracks ? That tips court has the power to compel a railroad corporation to construct such farm crossings as it deems proper and necessary in a given case has been frequently held, and I do not understand that the proposition is now questioned by the defendant. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Seligman, </em>16 Hun, 230, affirmed, 81 N. Y. 190; <em>Wademan </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>51 N. Y. 568; <em>Post </em>v. <em>Railway Co., </em>123 N. Y. 580, 591, 26 N. E. Rep. 7. On the other hand, it is equally well settled that under the provisions of the act of 1850, requiring corporations organized under that act to erect and maintain suitable farm crossings for the use of the proprietors of lands adjoining the railroad, it is the right of the corporation, in the first instance, to locate the crossings. <em>Wademan </em>v. <em>Raili'oad Co., supra. </em>But in the exercise of this right it is nevertheless the duty of the corporation to consult the convenience of both parties; and it will not be permitted to locate such a crossing as will subject the proprietor to needless and unreasonable injury or inconvenience. In reaching a conclusion upon the question which presents itself for consideration, it will be necessary, therefore, to determine whether or not the defendant has made right use of its discretionary powers, and this, of course, depends entirely upon the circumstances peculiar to the case in hand. Ordinarily, grade crossings are all that can be reasonably required of a railroad corporation for farm purposes, and, unless there is something to take this case out of the ordinary rule, they are all that ought to be required of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b479-6\">\u201cWhat, then, are the extraordinary features of the case under consideration? Hot the fact that the defendant\u2019s railroad cuts the plaintiffs\u2019 farm in twain, for it is the doing of this very thing which the statute contemplates in requiring that suitable crossings shall be constructed, which requirement is, as has been said, ordinarily fulfilled by providing crossings at grade. Hor do I think that the fact that an under-grade crossing would prove more convenient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>the plaintiffs in their farming operations,- or in watering their stock, would, of itself, furnish a sufficient reason for departing from the rule generally adopted in these cases; but such a reason is furnished, if at all, by the combination of these facts with the further fact that a grade crossing at either of the two places near the depression selected and proposed by the defendant cannot be used without compelling plaintiffs to overcome a steep grade, which would necessarily be attended not only with great inconvenience, but likewise with greatly increased labor to themselves and their teams; and that it would also involve the necessity of either drawing small loads or incurring the risk of tipping over, to say nothing of the danger to be apprehended from passing trains. None of these objections operate against the under-grade crossing. As has already been shown, this is the natural and customary route taken by the plaintiffs. Its use is attended by none of the dangers or disadvantages above mentioned, and it is likewise much more convenient and accessible. But, over and above all these considerations, it would seem as though it were the one means of communication between the two portions of the plaintiffs\u2019 farm which would suggest itself to any person or tribunal which was endeavoring to consult the convenience and interest of both these parties, for here is a depression to be crossed by a track 12 feet above the surface of the ground, and this elevation the defendant designs filling in so as to make a solid embankment; but if, instead of doing this, an aperture should be left, sufficient in size to permit teams and wagons to pass through, which could easily be accomplished without very great additional expense, how incomparably better it would be for all concerned. To the plaintiffs it would prove convenient and easy as a driveway, and it is equally clear that to the defendant it would, in the end, be much less expensive than a crossing at grade, where the danger to be apprehended from collisions with cattle and teams is certainly much greater than that which counsel imagines would attend the passage of cars over a bridge 14 feet in length.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b480-5\">\u201cIt is a fact which, I believe, appears in this case, but if it does not the court will take judicial notice of it, that the defendant, in constructing its line of road through this state, has adopted an overhead or underground grade crossing as the best means of getting over every public highway, where such means was found practicable. In adopting this course, which was purely voluntary, it is to be commended, and all that the plaintiffs seek by this action is to require that the same policy be pursued towards them as individuals which the defendant, by its own acts, concedes is proper towards the public at large; and, while it is not designed by this decision to establish a precedent for under-grade farm crossings as a rule, it does seem as though, for the reasons here given, it would be the only suitable crossing in this particular case. In reaching this conclusion the court has not been unmindful of the contention made by the defendant\u2019s counsel that the inconveniences and disadvantages of a grade crossing were considered in the condemnation proceedings, and that they constituted an important element of the damages awarded the plaintiffs in that proceeding. This contention would, at first glance, seem to possess some weight, for it certainly does appear that several of the witnesses sworn for the landowners did, to some extent at least, base their estimate of damage upon the fact that the south part of the farm was to be cut off from the spring upon the north part; but a careful analysis of the whole testimony will show that the witnesses who appeared to take this fact into consideration placed the damages at a sum lower than did others who did not mention this as an element of damages, while the average estimate made by all the witnesses on both sides was nearly a thousand dollars in excess of the award. It cannot be assumed that the award was made in contemplation of the inconvenience or damage to be apprehended from one or more crossings, <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>63 N. Y. 58;) and in the case of <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Seligman, </em>heretofore cited, it was said by Miller, J., (81 N. Y. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>198:) \u2018 We think such an item is not a proper subject o\u00ed consideration in estimating damages for land taken for railroad purposes, arid that they have once been made cannot affect the right of the owner to additional ones, where these are insufficient. \u2019 It follows, therefore, that this contention of defendant\u2019s counsel is not sustained by either the facts or the law of the case. I am consequently of the opinion that the plaintiffs are entitled to the relief sought in this action, with costs.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b481-5\">Argued before Dwight, P.

It is impossible, therefore, to characterize any of his findings of fact as unwarranted by the evidence. His opinion, given above, seems to us to justify the conclusions of law drawn from those findings. The only exception taken on the trial which is argued here relates to the admission in evidence of the opinions of witnesses in regard to the damage to the farm which would result from-the want of an underground crossing proposed. The evidence was no doubt offered for the purpose of a comparison between the loss to be sustained on the one hand, if the crossing were not constructed, and the expense to be incurred on the other hand, in its construction, as bearing upon the question of the form of the relief to be granted. But there was no finding or request \u00a1to find on that subject, so that the evidence, if not strictly admissible, was not to the prejudice of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
