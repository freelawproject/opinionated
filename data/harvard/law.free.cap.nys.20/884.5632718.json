On April 16, 1891, the following agreement was made by defendant with plaintiff: \u201cIn consideration of the sum of one dollar to me in, hand paid by the within-named Central Gas &amp; Electric Fixture Company, the receipt of which is admitted, and of the sum of one hundred and ten dollars to be\u00b0paid to me, and of other good and sufficient considerations me hereunto moving, I hereby guaranty the payment of the within-named sum of $1,350.00 by the said Carey to the said eompanyfor said fixtures, when hung as therein stated, and promise and agree to pay the same to the said company on the 15th day of May, 1891, unless the said Carey shall, on or before said date, pay the same to the said company in full.\u201d The failure of Carey to have the buildings mentioned in a condition so as to permit plaintiff to hang the fixtures on or before May 1st, and the fact that such fixtures were only partially put up at that time, and that subsequently nearly all the remainder were placed in position, does not free defendant from his obligation to pay therefor, as that was the fault of Carey, not the fault of plaintiff. Plaintiff is entitled to'a recovery against defendant, even though the contract made with Carey was only substantially performed. The plaintiff was not required to actually pay the $110, mentioned in the guaranty, to defendant before he received the $1,350 provided for in such guaranty. The performance of these several acts was independent of each other, and it was only necessary for plaintiff to tender <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>said $110 at most. The defendant was then required to perform his part of the contract, and his failure to do so entitled plaintiff to institute against him this cause of action. We find no error. Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">Ehrlich, C. J., concurs in result.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b905-6\">Newburger, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AQTB\"><em>(dissenting.) </em>This is an appeal from a judgment entered upon a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. The plaintiff, in writing, offered to place gas fixtures in certain apartment houses in this city, which offer was accepted by the then owner, one John J. Carey. Subsequently the defendant executed a guaranty, as follows: \u201cIn consideration of the sum of one dollar to me in hand paid by the within-named Central Gas &amp; Electric Fixture Company, the receipt of which is admitted, and of the sum of $110 to be paid to me, and of other good and sufficient considerations me hereunto moving, I hereby guaranty the payment of the within sum of $1,350.00 by the said Carey to the said company for the said fixtures, when hung as therein stated, and promise and agree to pay the same to the said company on the 15th day of May, 1891, unless the said Carey shall, on or before the said day, pay the same to the said company in full. \u201d On the trial of this action, at the close of plaintiff\u2019s case, defendant moved to dismiss the complaint, on the ground, among others, of the invalidity of the tender made by the witness Coles on behalf of the defendant, which motion was denied and exception taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">It appears that the guaranty was signed and delivered on or about the 16th day of April, 1891, and that the sum of $110, agreed to be paid by plaintiff to the defendant, was not then paid. On October 13, 1891, more than six months thereafter, Coles offered the defendant $110 in greenbacks, and asked the defendant to carry out his contract. He did not leave the $110 with the defendant, although said defendant was willing to accept the sum. The complaint should therefore have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">Before the plaintiff can recover, it is necessary for it to show that the consideration referred to in the guaranty was fully paid, and, as it appears uncontradicted that the amount of the consideration referred to in the guaranty was not paid, the trial justice erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion. For these reasons, the judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to abide, the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
