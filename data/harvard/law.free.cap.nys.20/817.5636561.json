These statements were supported by the affidavit of an expert accountant, who had previously made a partial inspection of plaintiff\u2019s books. <em>Held, </em>that sufficient cause was shown for a discovery, and that a statement of other facts upon information and belief, in defendant\u2019s petition, was not fatal thereto.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b837-8\">Appeal from special term, New York county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b837-9\">Suit on a note by the Kings County Bank of Brooklyn against Edward J.

The objection that the petition is in part based upon information and belief is not fatal, for the reason that the essential averments are stated positively, and receive support from the accountant, who, in the examination already made in action No. 1, states the condition of the account of Giulia Brand\u00e9is with the bank, and the necessity for requiring, in order that the defendant .might obtain the information requisite for his defense, a further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>examination than that accorded by the former order of discovery, which limited the period over which the examination should extend. We think, therefore, that the order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and upon the settlement of the order counsel will be afforded an opportunity of presenting their views as to the extent of the examination.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
