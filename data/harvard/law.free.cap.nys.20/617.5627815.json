The bringing of the suit was a sufficient demand for the money claimed. The price had been agreed, upon, and it was the defendant\u2019s duty to have found the plaintiff, and tendered the specific sum due. In this respect the case differs from <em>Bunn </em>v. <em>Lett, </em>(Sup.) 19 N. Y. Supp. 728, which is therefore inapplicable. Yo error was committed at the trial, and the judgment appealed from must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
