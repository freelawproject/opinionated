Appeal\u2014Review\u2014Discretion op Trial Court.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b672-9\">It is discretionary with the trial court to strike out improperly admitted testimony of a so-called expert, where the competency of such expert was not challenged by a sufficient objection.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b672-10\">3. Pleading\u2014Bill op Particulars\u2014Variance.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b672-11\">Where a letter of plaintiff\u2019s attorney was treated on trial as a bill of particulars, it was error for the court, against defendant\u2019s protest, to allow a material variation from the letter in the proof of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b672-12\">3. Elevated Railroad Companies\u2014Pires\u2014Evidence.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b672-13\">In an action against an elevated railroad company for burning plaintiff\u2019s awning by a spark from one of its engines, the evidence \u00f3f a member of the board of examiners was material and relevant to show the qualification of the man in charge of the engine from which the spark probably came.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b672-14\">4. Same\u2014Evidence\u2014Refreshing Memory.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b672-15\">Defendant proposed to prove that the engines which' passed plaintiff\u2019s premises just before the injury had been examined and found in good order, but the witness could not recollect which engines he had inspected, and so defendant inquired if he had a memorandum by which he could tell. <em>Held, </em>that the exclusion of the question was error, as it is assumed that the witness had a memorandum, and could have used it to refresh his memory.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-16\">Appeal from district court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b672-17\">Action by Peter Flynn against the Manhattan Bailway Company for damages for negligently burning plaintiff\u2019s awning by sparks from defendant\u2019s engine.

'</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b672-19\"><em>Julien T.

Thereupon defendant inquired if he had a memorandum by which he could tell what engines he examined, but the question was excluded. We are to assume that the witness had such memorandum, and that he could have used it to refresh his memory, if not, indeed, have introduced it in evidence as a paper correctly recording a fact since escaped the recollection of the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Upon examination of the evidence, we are convinced that it will be in the interest of justice to direct a retrial of the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, costs to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
