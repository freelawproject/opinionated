I can see no reason for an opinion. I do not see that the special term abused its discretion. I very much doubt if I should not have made the order if I had been holding the special term; and when I cannot clearly see that the special term erred, I think the order should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
