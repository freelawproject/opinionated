The defendants sought to introduce evidence of the existence of such trade custom, which evidence was properly rejected by the trial justice. The contract in question was clear, unequivocal, and free from any ambiguity or doubt as to the meaning of the language therein used. The size of the paper was therein stated to be 20x30 inches, thus clearly indicating the size of the paper ordered and required by the plaintiff, and there is no evidence of any conversation between the parties, at the time of or prior to the signing of the contract, wherein paper of the size of 15x20 was mentioned or referred to. There was no evidence of any fraud on the part of the plaintiff in procuring Arnold\u2019s signature to the contract to be submitted to the jury, and no errors committed by the trial justice in the rulings made by him. Judgment appealed from must be affirmed, with costs to the plaintiff and respondent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
