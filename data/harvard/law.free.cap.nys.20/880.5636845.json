The fact that it also stat\u00e9s that he did so \u201cmaliciously\u201d does not change this action from false imprisonment to malicious, prosecution. False imprisonment is clearly the <em>gravamen </em>of the action. Upon this appeal the appellant relies mainly upon the proposition that plaintiff failed to show notice and want of probable cause upon defendant\u2019s behalf in causing plaintiff\u2019s arrest. The plaintiff, at most, was required to prove that in causing his arrest the defendant acted without probable cause. His testimony shows that hp was walking peacefully along Twenty-Sixth street. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>a public highway, and was arrested by a police officer, who acted at defend* ant\u2019s instigation; and was compelled to go along with the officer to the station house, where defendant made a complaint to the officer in charge; was locked up in a cell all night, (11 hours;) next morning was again compelled to accompany \u2018the officer through the public street to the police court, where defendant charged him in a written complaint, made before the police justice, with threatening, abusive, and insulting behavior, with intent to provoke a breach of the peace; that such offense occurred in Twenty-Fourth street, in this city, and there followed defendant, causing a crowd to collect. The plaintiff was discharged by the police justice. In view of plaintiff\u2019s testimony upon the trial, and the criminal proceedings, and their termination as above delated, the trial justice did right in submitting the question \u201cwhether or not the defendant in such proceedings acted without probable cause\u201d to the jury. Their negative finding is based upon very strong evidence, and is conclusive. The discharge alone by the police justice of the plaintiff is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the want of probable cause, sufficient to throw upon defendant the burden of proving the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Conceding that this is an action for malicious prosecution, and the plaintiff was, therefore, required to prove malice, we find ample justification in the evidence for the refusal of the trial justice to dismiss the complaint upon defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss upon the ground that malice was not proved. The testimony submitted by plaintiff, and the proceedings taken 'upon the criminal charge, show that defendant acted therein in a wanton and reckless manner, and willfully and knowingly preferred a false charge against plaintiff. These circumstances alone establish that want of probable cause from which malice will be inferred, <em>(Dorendinger </em>v. <em>Tachechtelin, 12 </em>Daly, 34; <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Nesbitt, </em>24 How. 544,) and entitled a submission thereof to the jury. They determined that defendant acted with malice, and the testimony justifies that finding. We find no errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">\u2022 The judgment must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
