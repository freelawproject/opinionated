This testimony was admitted, under objection aifd exception, respecting its competency, by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel; and when the introduction of evidence was concluded it remained substantially unchallenged. Thereupon, on motion of defendant\u2019s counsel, and again under objection and exception by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, the court directed the jury to find for defendant. We are of the opinion that the testimony objected to and admitted was competent for the purpose for which it was offered, under the ruling of the court of appeals in <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>110 N. Y. 654, 18 N. E. Rep. 127, but that the trial justice erred in withdrawing the case from the jury\u2019s consideration. Defendant\u2019s testimony was that of a party in interest, whose credibility should be determined by the jury, though it remained otherwise unimpeached. Heal\u2019s testimony, by which defendant was sought to be corroborated, falls short of having that effect. He heard confessedly only part \u25a0of what defendant said immediately after the execution and delivery of the paper, so that it does not appear from his testimony that defendant\u2019s proposition was assented to by plaintiffs. <em>Elwood </em>v. <em>Telegraph Co., </em>45 N. Y. 549; <em>Gildersleeve </em>v. <em>Landon, </em>73 N. Y. 609; <em>Honegger </em>v. <em>Wettstein, </em>94 N. Y. 252; <em>Kavanagh </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>70 N. Y. 177; <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Diefendorf, </em>123 N. Y. 191, 200, 25 N. E. Rep. 402. The judgment appealed from must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
