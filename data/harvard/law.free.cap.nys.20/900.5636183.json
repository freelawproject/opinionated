We think that the rights of both parties can be more accurately determined and adjudicated upon the trial of the action than upon a hearing on affidavits, and are therefore of the opinion that the order below should be affirmed, with costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
