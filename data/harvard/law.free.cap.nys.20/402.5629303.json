Y. Supp. 594. And our appellate authority, in deciding the appeal from this judgment of affirmance, said: \u201cDefendants insist that the amount of wharfage .was payable from them to plaintiff, and plaintiff contends that it was payable from defendants to the wharf owner. Had the defendants\u2019 engagement been to pay the amount of the wharfage to the wharf owner, thus satisfying the latter\u2019s lien upon the boat, then the nonperformance of that engagement would have imposed upon the defendants a liability towards the plaintiff to recompense him for the loss of the use of his boat while it was necessarily in the custody of the United States marshal under his seizure in the wharf owner\u2019s proceedings, for the enforcement of his lien, together with the costs of such proceedings, and the amount of wharfage necessarily paid by plaintiff to enable him to recover possession of his boat. Such, however, was not the defendants\u2019 agreement, as will appear by reference to the complaint and the testimony.\u201d See 16 N. Y. Supp. 524. The original complaint alleged that \u201cdefendants agreed to pay to plaintiff, as freight, 18 cents per ton alongside and all wharf-age at the place of consignment, \u201d and this was not a direct allegation that defendants agreed to pay to the wharfinger all wharfage at place of consignment, and the testimony, read in connection with this allegation, may not have shown an express agreement to pay the wharfinger all wharfage for which plaintiff\u2019s boat could certainly have been held liable, and this court should, upon the former hearing of appeal, have amended the complaint so as to conform to the proof; hence our appellate authority properly reversed the judgment, and ordered a new trial. The plaintiff, in obedience to this decision upon the former final appeal herein, moved at special term of this court, before the-new trial was had, and was permitted, upon payment of $50 costs, to amend his complaint, so as to allege \u201cthat defendants agreed to pay to the wharf owner or lessee of the dock all wharfage at place of consignment;\u201d and upon such new trial, under this amended complaint and the answer to the same, much evidence was given by both parties, the one to prove the truth of this new or amended allegation and the other to disprove the same; and this disputed question of fact, thus raised and contested, was by the trial judge fairly and clearly submitted to the jury, and especially so in charging the following request of defendants\u2019 counsel: \u201cI ask the court to charge that the jury cannot find a verdict against the defendants for a larger sum than $10, unless they find that there was an express contract on the part of the defendants to pay wharfage to the wharfinger at the port of destination. \u201d The jury found with the plaintiff upon this and the other disputed questions of ' fact, and the verdict is not against the weight of evidence, and it would seem that this verdict, upon the new trial on the new evidence given under the amended complaint and the answer thereto, is a complete answer to the objections successfully made by the defendants on the hearing of the first final appeal herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">Now as to defendants\u2019 plea of the statute of limitation in bar of the action. If this court and its appellate authority have rightly comprehended the nature of defendants\u2019 liability, and the consequent measure of damages, then it follows that plaintiff\u2019s cause of action did not arise until he had paid the wharfage and the necessary expenses of the seizure of his boat in order to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>gain possession thereof, and all of this he did within six years of the commencement of his action. The judgment appealed from is affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
