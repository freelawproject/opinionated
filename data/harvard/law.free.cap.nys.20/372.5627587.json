The defendant did not interpose any opposing affidavits, but merely moved to vacate the order on the papers upon which it was granted, and this appeal is from the order refusing to vacate. The rule with regard to the examination of a party before trial is one of discretion. <em>Herbage </em>v. <em>City of Utica, </em>109 N. Y. 81, 16 N. E. Rep. 62. It is therefore flexible, and must be adapted to and controlled by the facts and circumstances of each case, considered with reference to the relations existing between the parties. <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Good, </em>(Sup.) 10 N. Y. Supp. 647. If the information sought is necessarily wholly within or more within the knowledge of one party than the other, an order for the examination of such other should be granted, and especially so when the party seeking the examination of his adversary is suing, as this plaintiff, in a representative capacity. In the case of <em>Raymond </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>59 How. Pr. 383, where the plaintiff was suing as an administrator, the court said, in sustaining an order for examination of the defendant; \u201c The plaintiff suing in a representative capacity, and not having personally participated in the matters concerning, which inquiry is sought, properly enough asks that he may be allowed to examine one of the defendants, who is reasonably supposed to have the knowledge to ascertain the facts.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s affidavit is sufficient to sustain the order, and the same is affirmed, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
