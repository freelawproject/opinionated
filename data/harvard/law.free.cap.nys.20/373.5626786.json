Upon the record it is certain that neither the corporation nor its receiver could now maintain an action against the defendants upon the note. At the close of the testimony both parties requested the court to direct a verdict, and neither requested to be allowed to go to the jury upon any question, and thus the court became the trior of the facts as well as of the law, and his direction of judgment for plaintiff is supported by the evidence, and was not against the weight of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">The judgment is to be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
