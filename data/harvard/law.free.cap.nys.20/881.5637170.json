It appears from the affidavit upon which said order (for defendant\u2019s examination) was granted that the testimony desired is solely within the defendant\u2019s control and knowledge, and that the same is necessary to enable the plaintiff to maintain this action upon the trial. Justice Danforth, in <em>Herbage </em>v. <em>City of Utica, </em>109 N. Y. 82, 16 N. E. Rep. 62, says \u201cthat a party litigant may, in the discretion of the judge to whom application under sections 870, 872, 873 of the Code, have a general examination of his adversary as a witness in the cause, as well before as at the trial.\u201d A careful examination of the appeal book convinces us that the order appealed from was properly granted, and must therefore be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
