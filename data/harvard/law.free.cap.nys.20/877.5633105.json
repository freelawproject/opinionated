J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ahdi\">Without considering the technical objection as to the sufficiency of the notice of appeal to entitle the appellants to a review on the merits, it is clear that the judgment below is right. The action is on an indenture of lease executed by the plaintiff, \u201c as executor of the last will and testament of Hester A. Gregory, deceased,\u201d as landlord, to the defendants as tenants. By joining in the execution of the lease, the defendants admitted the representative character of the plaintiff, and his right to sue upon the contract, and are estopped now from disputing the authority. <em>Farnham </em>v. <em>Mallory, </em>2 Abb. Dec. 100, *42 N. Y. 527, 5 Abb. Pr. (N. S.) 380; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Luther, </em>13 Wend. 491; <em>Tilyou </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>108 N. Y. 558, 15 N. E. Rep. 534. This, upon the same principle that a person contracting with a corporation is estopped from questioning the corporate existence. <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>Stietz, </em>2 City Ct. R. 77. The defendants, having admitted by their contract the representative character of the plaintiff, cannot question it now, nor require the court to indulge in the presumptions against the lessor\u2019s right to contract or sue upon its covenants. For these reasons the judgment appealed from must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
