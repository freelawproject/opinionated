The county judge certified that there was \u201ca reasonable doubt whether the judgment of conviction should stand.\u201d \u2019 Judgment was entered, and the defendant appeals from the judgment and the order entered on the 19th day of October, 1891, denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. The people gave evidence tending to establish the crime alleged in the indictment. Thereupon the defendant was sworn as a witness, and denied the essential parts of the testimony given by the complainant, and denied the threats testified to by the complainant, and testified: \u201cI never uttered such a word in my life, That if you don\u2019t give me the farm I intend to have your heart\u2019s blood,\u2019 and I never used anything like it. There was nothing of the kind occurred between us. He has told a falsehood when he tells any such thing as that. At that interview I didn\u2019t use any such language as that. I never used it in my life to any one,\u2014 to him or any one else. * * * I never had a pistol, when I was up in the woods, in my pocket. I never had a pistol in my pocket. I don\u2019t carry any at all, for nothing. I have not had in my possession within the last year or eighteen months a revolver. Mr. Dickenson is mistaken when he says I had a pistol in my pocket in the woods. I did not have such a revolver, pistol, or firearm. I never went armed in my life. * * * I did not have in my possession a firearm, revolver, or pistol, I had my fan. * * * That day that I met Mr. Dickenson on the walk, I had that fan with me. I did not have my shawl on my arm that day. I did not take out a revolver and point at him. I did not point a loaded revolver. I didn\u2019t have any shawl and no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>revolver that day. I did not take a revolver from under my shawl and point it at him. What I had in my hand was that rubber cloak and that fan. I did not say to him, \u2018 Mow, I am going to kill you.\u2019 I did not use that language to Mr. Dickenson, or anything like it. I made no threats on his life that day, or at any other time. \u201d She was asked, on her cross-examination, if she ever carried a pistol, and her answer was, \u201cMo.\u201d She was asked if about the month of June she \u201cthreatened to shoot Johnny Fee with a pistol or \u25a0revolver;\u201d and, upon that question being objected to, the court allowed, over an objection and exception, the witness to answer the following question: <em>\u201cQuestion. </em>Did you not, in about the month of June or July, this past summer, 1891, have in your possession a revolver or pistol?\u201d She answered, \u201cI did not.\u201d She was also asked: <em>\u201cQuestion. </em>Did you not draw a pistol and threaten to shoot James Murphy some time during the past year?\u201d Thequestion was objected to, an exception was taken, and the witness answered, \u201cI did not.\u201d She was also asked: <em>\u201cQuestion. </em>Did you draw a pistol and threaten to shoot this man Hanyon some time during this present year?\u201d The question was objected to, an exception, was taken, and the witness answered, \u201cI did not. \u201d She was asked, \u201cDidn\u2019t you draw a pistol and threaten to shoot Stephen Pettis?\u201d Objection and exception taken, and she answered, \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d She was asked, \u201cDid you go to Caleb Gage\u2019s blacksmith shop in Hawleyton with a loaded revolver in your hand, and threaten to shoot his dog?\u201d Upon objections being taken to the question, the court observed, \u201cI will admit this question as bearing simply upon the fact as to whether she had a pistol in her hand and possession. \u201d Defendant took an exception to the ruling, arid the witness answered, \u201cI did not.\u201d Then a question was put: \u201c <em>Question. </em>Did you draw a revolver or pistol to shoot A. B. Hayden on your premises or in your barn within three years?\u201d Upon the objections being slated to the question, the court observed, \u201cI will admit that only as I have before, as merely upon the question as to whether she had a revolver in her possession; simply bearing upon that question.\u201d An exception was taken, and the witness answered, \u201cI did not.\u201d She was also asked: <em>\u201cQuestion. </em>Did you riot about three years ago meet John Giblin and his hired man, Murphy, in Hawleyton, and draw a pistol, and. threaten to shoot him, John Giblin?\u201d Upon objections being stated to the question, the court observed, \u201cAdmitted upon the question as to whether she had a pistol in her possession at that time only.\u201d An exception was taken by the defendant, and she answered, \u201cI did not.\u201d By way of reply to the defendant\u2019s evidence, the people called Caleb .Gage, and put to him the following\"question: <em>\u201cQuestion. </em>Do you remember an occasion of her going past your shop and having a revolver in her hand?\u201d The witness answered, \u201cIda.\u201d <em>\u201cQuestion. </em>Threateningto shoot your dog?\u201d <em>Answer. </em>Yes, sir. <em>Q. </em>State, if you can, what it was, and when it was.\u201d This was objected to, and the court observed: \u201cYou may ask the witness the question that you put to Mrs. Drake. \u201d Defendant took an exception. <em>\u201cA. </em>That was some five or six years ago. I could give the exact time.\u201d It was again objected to, and overruled, and an exception taken by the defendant, and the court observed: \u201cIt is distinctly understood that this evidence is admitted only upon the question as to whether this defendant ever had a pistol in her possession. <em>Q. </em>At that time did she have a pistol in. her hand, and threaten to shoot your dog?\u201d Objections were again stated, and the court observed, \u201cThe objection is overruled, within the ruling already laid down by the court.\u201d An exception was taken, and the witness answered, \u201cShe did.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A7DO\">Peter Yosburg was called as a witness for the people, and he was asked: <em>\u201cQuestion. </em>State whether on that occasion Mrs. Drake had a pistol and threatened to shoot his dog.\u201d Objections were taken,'and an exception, and the witness answered, \u201cYes, sir; she did.\u201d John Giblin was called for the people, and testified: <em>\u201cQuestion. </em>Did Mrs. Drake, about three years ago, meet you. and your hired man, Murphy, in Hawleyton, and draw a pistol, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>threaten to shoot you ?\u201d Objections were stated, and exception taken, and the witness allowed to answer: \u201cIt is a mistake; there is no such talk. <em>Question. </em>I refer to a conversation at her house; not in'the streets of Hawleyton, but in her house at Hawleyton. <em>Answer. </em>That was in the summer of 1885 or 1886.\u201d This was objected to by the defendant on the further ground \u201cthat her attention was not called to the time and place.\u201d Julia Stewart was called as a witness for the people, and asked: <em>\u201cQuestion. </em>I will repeat the question: Did you in May last see Mrs. Drake and' John Fee on Pennsylvania avenue, in this city, and at that time did you see Mrs. Drake draw a revolver and threaten to shoot John Fee?\u201d Objections were stated and overruled, and the defendant took an exception, and the witness answered, \u201cI saw her draw a revolver. <em>Question. </em>\u2022 Threaten to shoot him? <em>Answer. </em>Whether she said she would shoot him or not, I couldn\u2019t say, but she said she would fix him. <em>Q. </em>You saw her draw a revolver and make that remark? <em>A. </em>Yes, sir.\u201d Laura Thiele was called by the people, and the fol-' lowing question was put to her: <em>\u201cQuestion. </em>At this time in May did you see Mrs. Drake on Pennsylvania avenue, in this city, draw a revolver or pistol, and threaten to shoot John Fee?\u201d Objected to.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AS7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Gibbs, </em>93 N. Y. 470, it was held, viz.: \u201cUpon trial of an indictment for assault -with intent to kill, evidence shewing the commission by the prisoner of another similar assault, at a different time and place, and upon a different person, is not competent.\u201d In the course of the opinion delivered in that case it was said: \u201cThe effect of the evidence Was to present to the jury testimony relating to another assault, and to an entirely different transaction, which might well tend to prejudice their minds against the defendant in reference to the charge for which he was on trial.\u201d In <em>People </em>v. <em>Sharp, </em>107 N. Y. 467, 14 N. E. Rep. 319, Peckham, J., said: \u201cThe general rule is that, when a man is put upon trial for one offense, beds to be convicted, if at all, by evidence which shows that he is guilty of that offensd <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>alone, and that, under ordinary circumstances, proof of his guilt of one or a score of other offenses in his lifetime is wholly excluded.\u201d In <em>Com. v. Jackson, </em>132 Mass. 16, in the course of the opinion, it was said: \u201cEvidence of the commission of other crimes by a defendant may deeply prejudice him with the jury, while it does not legally bear upon his case. It certainly would not be competent, in order to show the intent with which one entered a house or took an article of personal property, to prove that he had committed a burglary or larceny at another time. * * * Such evidence compels the defendant to meet charges of which the indictment gives him no information, confuses him in his defense, raises a variety of issues, and thus diverts the attention-of the jury from the one immediately before it; and, by showing the defendant to have been a knave on other occasions,, creates a prejudice which may cause injustice to be done him.\u201d In <em>People </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>3 Parker, Crim. R. 684, it was said: \u201cIt is quite true that the prosecution cannot prove the commission of another and distinct felony by the prisoner for the purpose of establishing the fact directly that he committed the one for which he is then on trial, or for the purpose of raising any direct inference in the affirmative of the principal issue. * * * The common law, with more humanity and better logic, forbids such evidence in support of the principal issue, and limits its admission to minor issues, such as motive and <em>scienter, </em>and even then confines it to cases where there is some apparent connection or relation between the imputed motive or guilty knowledge and the felony proposed to be proved. \u201d In <em>People </em>v. <em>Greenwall, </em>108 N. Y. 296, 15 N. E. Rep. 404, the defendant was called as a witness in his own behalf, and, upon being cross-examined as to' his connection with another burglary at the house of one Mohring, and in the cross-examination as well as in the re-examinatian, he denied that he'had ever entered any man\u2019s house in the nighttime with intent to steal. Subsequently Mohring was called to the stand by the prosecution, and permitted to testify, under objection, to evidence showing that the defendant did burglariously enter his house in the nighttime. The ruling admitting such evidence was held to be erroneous; and it was also held in that case that the incompetent evidence was damaging in its nature, and could not be said to have been harmless, and therefore its reception required a reversal. In the course of the opinion in that case it was said: \u201cIt is never competent upon a criminal trial to show that the defendant was guilty of an independent crime not connected with or leading up to the crime for which he is on trial, except for the purpose of showing motive, interest, or guilty knowledge, and this evidence was not proper or competent for that purpose. * * * It is never proper for the purpose of impeaching the character of a party or a witness to call witnesses to prove specific acts of dishonesty, immorality, or crime.\u201d Under the rulings made by the court, threats made by the defendant upon other occasions, to other parties, had no such connection with the crime alleged in the indictment as to render them admissible upon the issue before the court, nor can their reception be justified upon the assumption that they tended to impeach the character or standing of the defendant as a witness. Independent and specific acts and deeds of a party are not admissible for the purpose of. impeaching a witness. The testimony thus improperly received may have had a potential influence upon the jury. While the testimony offered for the prosecution tended quite strongly to support the allegations in the indictment,, the testimony in behalf of the defendant contradicted the evidence of the prosecution, and left a close question of fact to be considered by the jury. Under such circumstances, we may not say that improper evidence was not prejudicial to the rights of the defendant. <em>People </em>v. <em>Loftus, </em>decided by this court in November 1890, as appears in 11 N. Y. Supp. 905. The foregoing views lead to a reversal. Conviction, order, and judgment of the court of sessions of Broome county reversed, and the clerk directed to enter judgment, and remit certified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>copy thereof, with the return and.decision of this court, to the court of sessions of Broome county, pursuant to sections 547 and 548 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
