Under such circumstances, we must have proof that the p-ople have lost no rights by the failure to originally produce the prisoner for trial. The appeal may be upon questions of fact, and we must know that there was no lack of evidence through the delay caused by, the default. There is not even the ordinary certificate of the district attorney to that effect, much less the proofs required in <em>People </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>5 Daly, 533, to which we refer the petitioner\u2019s counsel. Application denied, with leave to renew upon further proofs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
