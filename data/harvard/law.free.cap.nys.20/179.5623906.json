Y. While a trust company may be something unique among the banking institutions of the \u2022 southern tier \u2019 of counties, its organization is. intended to-supply a need that has long existed. East of Binghamton there is none nearer than Hew York; north, none nearer than Syracuse; west, none nearer than Buffalo; while south, a large section of Pennsylvania is unsupplied with a similar institution. In this extensive territory there is a large amount of capital held by its owners without earning any return, which, through the medium of a trust company, can be made to realize a definite income. The large capital employed, and the restrictions to which the trust companies are subjected by the laws of the state, render them the safest kind of depositories, and, as the name implies, are institutions that the people may trust with their savings. The Binghamton Trust Company has a paid-in capital stock of $400,000, and its lists of stockholders is a directory of the wealth of Binghamton. Each stockholder being liable to the amount of his stock, and every stockholder being abundantly responsible, the actual security afforded the depositor in the Binghamton Trust Company is $800,000, in addition to the assets in which the deposits are invested. The capital of the company is required.by law to be invested in bonds arid mortgages on unincumbered real estate in the state of Hew York, worth at least double the amount loaned - <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>thereon, in stocks of New York state, or in stocks and bonds of incorporated cities or counties of the state, duly authorized to be issued; thus placing the capital in securities of undoubted safety, of fixed value, and of a kind unaffected by stock manipulations. By its charter the Binghamton Trust Company has authority, and is prepared, to loan money on real or personal security ; to act as fiscal or transfer agent, as trustee, guardian, or receiver, as executor or administrator, as committee of the estate of persons of unsound mind; to act as agent in the collection of income or rents; to accept and execute trusts of married women in respect to their separate property; to take, accept, and execute any and all trusts that may be committed to it; to receive \u2022deposits in trust; to receive deposits of money, in active account, subject to check at sight without notice; to receive deposits, and issue therefor certificates transferable and payable on demand, with interest at the rate of 4 per cent, per annum, if left three months, and special rates for other definite periods. An interest department has been organized, and deposits therein will be governed by the following rules, [which were the same as set forth in the second statement of fact.] This trust company differs from a savings bank, in that it has a large capital, safely invested, that is pledged as security to its depositors. This pledge, with the liability of the stockholders, amounts to $800,000. Ei^ht hundred thousand dollars, therefore, stand between a depositor in this \u25a0company and any possible loss. Interest is paid at a fixed rate, and is not dependent upon earnings. There being no stated dividend period, deposits can be withdrawn at any time after three months, and full interest will be paid to date of withdrawal. The trustees are well-known business men. Successful in their personal affairs, they bring to the management of the trust company \u2022experience and sound judgment that are sufficient guaranties that any trust committed to the company will be faithfully and honestly executed. The trust company is free from the contingency of death, which is so often a disastrous feature in the selection and appointment of an individual as trustee. When \u25a0a person selects it to act as his trustee, he has the assurance that it will be in continuance as long as the trusts lasts.. Securities will be cared for aud receipts given. A special room will be assigned to the patrons of the company desiring to look over their securities, or for the transaction of private business. A suitable room, when desired, will be assigned corporations for holding meetings. To ladies, in particular, the trust company is expected to be a benefit and convenience. Their patronage is especially solicited, and they will receive every attention and consideration. A room is provided for their exclusive use, and also a separate pay window. Any assistance or advice they may wish in regard to the transaction of their business will be gladly given by the officers of the company. Competent and courteous clerks In charge will give information and render all assistance desired for the prompt and satisfactory transaction of business. By courteous treatment and honorable dealing, the company hope to merit and receive your confidence and patronage. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-5\"><em>Fourth. </em>That the defendant inserts in the papers published in the city of Binghamton and surrounding country the following advertisement:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-6\">\u201cThe Binghamton Trust Company, corner State and Henry streets, Binghamton.

It will receive active deposit accounts subject to check at sight. This company is a legal depository for moneys paid into court, and is authorized to act as guardian, trustee, executor, and administrator; also as registrar, trustee, transfer agent, and fiscal agent for states, cities, towns, railroads, and other corporations; collects rents, coupons, and dividends.

The only actual relief which the plaintiff asks is (1) to restrain the defendant from continuing business in the manner mentioned; and (2) to recover the penalty provided for by section 283. The former cannot be awarded. Ho relief by injunction can be granted in a proceeding like this.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>so far as this proceeding is for an injunction, it should be dismissed. <em>Steamship Co. </em>v. <em>Voorhis, </em>104 N. Y. 525, 11 N. E. Rep. 49; <em>Patterson v. Association, </em>(Super. N. Y) 11 N. Y. Supp. 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">6This leaves for consideration the question whether the plaintiff is entitled.! to recover a penalty under the statute, which provides: \u201cIt shall not be lawful for any bank, banking association, or individual banker, firm, association,, corporation, person or persons, to advertise or put forth a sign as a savings, bank, or in any way to solicit or receive deposits as a savings bank; and any bank, banking association, or individual banker, firm, association, corporation, person or persons, which shall offend against these provisions, shall forfeit and pay, for every such offense, the sum of one hundred dollars for every day such offense shall be continued, to be sued for and recovered in the name of the people of this state, by the district attorneys of the several counties, in any court having cognizance thereof, for the use of the poor, chargeable to said county in which such offense shall be committed.\u201d Laws 1882, c. 409, \u00a7 283. Whether or not such recovery can be had depends upon the construction to be given to this statute. If the purpose of the statute was to. prohibit any person, firm, corporation, or association from either soliciting- or receiving deposits in the manner in which they are usually solicited and received by savings banks, it would seem that the plaintiff would be entitled\" to a judgment for the penalty demanded; for, when we consider the facte, stipulated as to the nature of the business transacted by the defendant, the-manner in which it was performed, the circulars the defendant distributed, and the advertisements it published, it is quite manifest that the defendant-solicited and received deposits in substantially the same manner as they are-solicited and received by savings banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Thus, the question is presented whether the legislature intended to confer upon savings banks a monopoly of the class of business usually transacted by them, or whether the intent and purpose of the statute was to protect the-public against deception or imposition by prohibiting the receiving and soliciting deposits by any person, firm, corporation, or association under the claimr. or pretense of being a savings bank. We think the latter was the purpose-of the statute. This becomes quite obvious when we read all the provisions-of that section. The manifest purpose of the section was to render it unlawful to advertise, put forth a sign, solicit or receive deposits, claiming or pretending to be a savings bank. If such is the proper construction of the statute under consideration, and we think it is, it follows that the plaintiff is not, entitled to recover the penalty sought to be recovered in this action, as the-statement of facts is insufficient to justify us in holding that the defendant:, in any manner held itself out as a savings bank, or solicited or received deposits claiming or pretending to be such. These considerations lead us to the-conclusion that this action, so far as it is for an injunction to restrain the-defendant from carrying on its business in the manner mentioned, should be-dismissed, and, so far as it seeks to recover a penalty, judgment should be entered in favor of the defendant upon the merits, with costs. Judgment is? directed accordingly; the form of judgment, if not agreed upon, to be settled: before Martin, J. All concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b202-14\"> Code Civil Proc. \u00a7 1381, provides that an injunction shall not be granted in a controversy submitted on an agreed statement of facts, without process, under section 1279.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
