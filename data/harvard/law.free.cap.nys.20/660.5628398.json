The appellant contends that the order is conditional upon the production of one Butler for examination, and that the court cannot declare in advance, on mere suspicion, the judgment debtor to be guilty of contempt. I have read the order complained of carefully, and cannot agree with the appellant in his construction of the same. On the contrary, the judge, in rendering his decision, declares, in effect, that from the facts presented the judgment debtor has disposed of the $200 as testified to by him since the service of the order, and that those moneys so disposed of were his personal property, and therefore he is guilty of contempt. And although he was already convinced of the foregoing, yet (and I presume on the suggestion of the attorney for the judgment debtor) he says: \u201cHowever, for the purpose of allowing him to show the latter statement is the true one, [meaning that the property was not his,] I will permit him to produce for examination Mr. Butler.\u201d If he fails to do so, the order made to punish him for contempt will be granted. It was an additional opportunity granted to the judgment debtor by the court to change, if he could, its opinion. The order was within the sound discretion of the court, and was properly granted, and should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
