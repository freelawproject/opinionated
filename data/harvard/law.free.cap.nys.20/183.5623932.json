Morss was the owner of about 900 acres of Hand situated in the town of Tompkins, Delaware county, N. Y. On the '.29th of that month he entered into a contract in writing and under seal with one Chace, whereby he agreed to peel all the hemlock bark on said premises, and to deliver the same on the cars at Bock Bift station, for which Morss was. to pay three dollars per ton. Chace also agreed to cut and manufacture all \"the hemlock, basswood, and chestnut timber on the premises into lumber, \u2022and deliver the same on the cars at the same station, for which he was to receive six dollars per thousand; and was to cut and manufacture into lumber, and load on the cars at the station, all the birch, ash, and cherry timber thereon, for seven dollars a thousand. On November 18,1881, while the contract between Morss and Chace was still in force, the plaintiffs, one Shufeit, and Morss entered into a written contract under seal, wherein it was recited that Morss was the owner of the premises mentioned; that he had entered into a contract with Chace for cutting the timber and peeling the bark thereon; that Chace had erected buildings on the land, and was in occupation of part of it in performance of his contract; and that Morss desired to sell, and the plaintiffs to purchase, the said lands, subject to the performance by 3aid Chace of the contract first mentioned, and to the rights of Chace in and to- his erections' thereon. The contract then contained an agreement by Morss <em>to </em>sell, and by the plaintiffs and Shufeit to purchase, the premises described, \u00a1being the 900 acres above referred to, \u201cexcepting and reserving unto the first party [Morss] all the hemlock, ash, basswood, cherry, and chestnut timber now standing or being on the said land; and reserving also unto first party \u2022the right, either for himself or his agents, to go upon the said land, and cut and peel the said timber, and remove the said timber and bark therefrom, using such teams, men, or machinery as may be necessary therefor; and reserving also unto said Chace the use of the buildings and erections now on said land, and of the mill yard, and suitable space for piling logs and timber during the carrying out of this contract with said first party; and the right also \u00a1unto said Chace, at the completion of his said contract, to remove from said \u00a1land all of the erections that may be on said land, for the purpose of carrying \u25a0out his contract with first party, including dwelling house, sheds, barns, sawmill, and mill fixtures.\u201d It then provided that the contract with Chace should be modified by excepting therefrom so much \u201cas provides for the cutting and \u00a1\u00a1manufacture of the hard wood on said land, which hard wood, except as above provided, it is intended to convey unto second parties, [plaintiffs and Shufeit.]\u201d It also provided that the plaintiffs and Shufeit should pay therefor $4,000, $800 of which was to be paid on the delivery of the contract, and the remainder in six equal annual payments from date, with interest annually on all sums unpaid, payable at the time of each annual payment. At the \u25a0time of the\" last payment Morss was to execute to plaintiffs and Shufeit a \u25a0deed, with covenants against all acts on his part. The contract provided in -express terms that the plaintiffs and Shufeit were to have the immediate possession of the premises; the contract, however, not to take effect or be operative unless Chace consented to modify his contract to conform to that contract, and to continue his contract as modified. Then followed this provision: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>\u201cIt is further agreed that said first party or said Chace shall have the period of four years in which to cut and remove the timber herein reserved, at the end of which time said reservation of timber shall cease to be operative. It is also agreed that said Chace shall have the right to continue all erections on said land made by him, and to enjoy the use of the mill yard, piling ground, and garden and yard adjoining said dwelling house, so long as he shall use the mill for sawmill purposes, and shall then have the right to remove said erections from said land, it being expressly understood that said erections are not and shall not become fixtures on said land.\u201d Subsequently Chace agreed to modify his contract with Morss so as to make it correspond with the contract between him (Morss) and the plaintiffs and Shufelt, and agreed to carry out and continue the performance of the contract as modified.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-5\">On January 13, 1882, Chace haying previously consented in writing to modify his contract with Morss to conform with the contract between Morss and plaintiffs and Shufelt, the plaintiffs paid Morss $800, whereupon the following paper was made and signed by Morss:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-6\">\u201cSyracuse, Jan. 13, 1882.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b205-7\">\u201cRec\u2019d on contract between D.

Ho other cause of action was set forth in the complaint. The main controversy between the parties was whether the plaintiffs had sufficient interest in the property in question to enable them to maintain the action. By virtue of their contract with Morss, the plaintiffs became the equitable owners of the land described therein, together with all the timber and trees growing thereon, except so far as the same was therein reserved and excepted. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Burrows, </em>34 Barb. 173; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Green, </em>Id. 176; <em>Hathaway </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>34 N. Y. 103. The exception contained in the contract reserved to Morss, his agents, or Chace, only such timber as was cut and removed within four years. If any was not removed within that time, although cut, it did not fall within the exception, and the equitable title, with the absolute right of possession, passed to the plaintiffs. <em>McIntyre </em>v. <em>Barnard, </em>1 Sandf. Ch. 52; <em>Boisaubin </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>*41 N. Y. 323; <em>Kellam </em>v. <em>McKinstry, </em>69 N. Y. 264; <em>Lacustrine Fertilizer Co. </em>v. <em>Lake Guano &amp; F. Co., </em>82 N. Y. 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">If it be admitted that Morss had title to the lumber and timber which had been cut and removed to the mill yard and piling ground, it by no means follows that he had the right to remove the portion left upon other parts of the premises of which the plaintiffs had actual possession, and to all of which they had an equitable title. When Morss, or those claiming or acting under him, failed to remove the timber cut within the time provided, as we have seen, it passed under the contract to the plaintiffs, who thereupon acquired an equitable title to it, with a legal right to its possession, which was expressly given by the contract. Before the trial of this action the plaintiffs\u2019 equitable title had ripened into a legal title. When the action was commenced, the plaintiffs, by virtue of their equitable interest and legal right to the possession of it, had, we think, such a special property in, and right of possession of, the lumber not removed, as would enable them to maintain an action for its conversion against any person wrongfully taking the same, and even against a person holding the naked legal title in trust as security for the payment of the unpaid purchase price of the premises, especially where, as in this ease, the whole purchase price had been tendered. 4 Amer. &amp; Eng. Enc. Law, 117; Moak\u2019s Underh. Torts, 589; <em>Edwards </em>v. <em>Frank, </em>40 Mich. 616; <em>Hoyt </em>v. <em>Van Alstyne, </em>15 Barb. 568; <em>Stowell </em>v. Otis, 71 N. Y. 38; <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Lawson, </em>103 N. Y. 40, 45, 8 N. E. Rep. 360. We therefore conclude that the court erred in holding that the plaintiffs had not sufficient title to maintain this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">But it is contended that the plaintiffs were estopped from insisting upon their right to the timber not removed within the time mentioned in the contract, because the plaintiffs forbade the defendant from removing it on January 12, 1886, when the defendant had all of the 13th day of that month in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>which to remove it. While the defendant\u2019s claim as to the time within which he might remove it may be correct, <em>(Cornell </em>v. <em>Moulton, </em>3 Denio, 12,) still, if so, it is difficult to discover any ground upon which the defendant\u2019s claim of estoppel can be upheld. As to what occurred between the parties, the defendant testified: \u201cOn the 12th day of January, 1886,1 remember being forbidden by the plaintiff to go on and to do anything further. I was on the track there we run lumber out of the mill. The mill was running at the time. Plaintiff wanted to know if I knew our time was out. I told him I did not. I supposed we had the 13th on which the contract was signed and delivered. He said: \u2018Ho; your time expires to-day. \u2019 \u2018 Well, \u2019 1 said, \u2018you will give us the benefit of this evening.\u2019 \u2018Ho,\u2019 he said; \u2018your time expires with the setting sun to-day. \u2019 I took out my watch, and looked at the time. It was four o\u2019clock, and as soon as he left I made a memorandum of the day and hour. I done some work that evening; cleaned the snow out of the chute. I did nothing on the 13th, as I could not get help. * * * Had I not been forbidden, I think I could have got all this lumber into the mill yard by the evening of the 13th of January. Think I had or could have got force enough to put them all on.\u201d As to what occurred upon this occasion there is substantially no dispute. From the evidence it is manifest that the plaintiffs were of the opinion that the time in which the defendant could remove the timber, excepted or reserved in the contract, expired at sundown on January 12, 1886, and that they, in substance, so informed the defendant, and refused to extend the time to remove it. In this we can find nothing sufficient to establish an estoppel against the plaintiffs. We are aware of no principle or authority which would sustain us in holding that the plaintiffs\u2019 assertion of their supposed rights at that time, and in the manner stated, estopped them from afterwards claiming the timber which had been cut, and not removed. We do not think the judgment can be sustained upon that ground. We are of the opinion that the learned trial judge fell into an error in holding that the plaintiffs had not sufficient property in the lumber cut, but not removed, to enable them to maintain this action, and in holding that they were estopped from claiming such timber. For these errors we think the judgment should be reversed. Judgment reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
