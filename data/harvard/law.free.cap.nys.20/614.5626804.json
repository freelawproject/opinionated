It is sufficient if the complaint in some form contains the elements essential to a cause of action. <em>Disbrow </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>122 N. Y. 362, 25 N. E. Rep. 356; <em>Zabriskie </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>13 N. Y. 332; <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>Soutter, </em>126 N. Y. 193, 27 N. E. Rep. 263; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Crego, </em>51 N. Y. 646. The complaint, liberally construed, makes out a complete cause of action, and the case was properly sent to the jury on the evidence. It was intelligently submitted, and the proofs sufficiently warrant the result arrived at. There is no merit in the exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-13\">It follows that the judgment appealed from must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
