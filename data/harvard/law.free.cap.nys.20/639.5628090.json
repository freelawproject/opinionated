Judgment for plaintiff. Defendant appeals. Reversed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b659-14\">The action was to recover the amount paid for a railroad ticket, by the terms of which plaintiff, and the members of his family, were entitled to 25 trips on defendant\u2019s railroad within one year from its date, upon presentation of the ticket to the conductor and ferry master on the occasion of each trip, the ticket having been issued in consideration of the payment of a reduced rate of fare, and defendant having refused to issue a duplicate in lieu of the original, which was lost before its use was attempted.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b659-15\">Argued before Bischoff and Giegerich, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b659-16\"><em>Charles Steele, </em>for appellant. <em>Adolph Simis, Jr., </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b659-17\">Bischoff, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7a\">The main questions sought to be presented on this appeal are whether, without any stipulation to that effect, defendant was bound to issue another ticket in lieu of the one lost, to enable plaintiff to secure the trips which he had paid for;'whether, for a refusal so to do, it is answerable in damages; and whether the mutual rescission of the contract, of which the ticket was only the evidence, did not require defendant to restore the sum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>paid in consideration of its promise to accord the trips. It is to be regretted that the admission on the trial of incompetent evidence, under objection and exception by defendant\u2019s counsel, for which- a reversal of the judgment is imperative, renders their discussion futile. That the conditions upon which the ticket was issued were printed, made the contract entered into none the less one in writing, <em>(Benson </em>v. <em>McMahon, </em>127 U. S. 467, 8 Sup. Ct. Rep. 1240;) and the admission of evidence offered for plaintiff, to the effect that at the time of the purchase of the ticket defendant\u2019s agent orally.agreed to issue a duplicate in case of its loss, violated the familiar rule that an instrument in writing may not be added to by proof of a contemporaneous oral understanding, and that the writing, if not ambiguous, except in cases of fraud, accident, surprise, or mistake, is conclusive of what the parties have agreed. 1 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">To establish a custom by defendant of issuing duplicate tickets in lieu of those lost, plaintiff was permitted to introduce evidence to the effect that defendant had frequently issued them. Evidence of a custom, however, assuming the acts of issuing duplicates on other occasions to be such, is admissible only when its office is to remove an ambiguity, or to clear up some obscurity, <em>(Silberman </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>96 N. Y. 522; <em>Barnum </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>97 N. Y. 188, 193; <em>Hopper </em>v. <em>Sage, </em>112 N. Y. 530, 534, 20 N. E. Rep. 350; <em>Newhall </em>v. <em>Appleton, </em>114 N. Y. 140, 143, 21 N. E. Rep. 105;) and it is incompetent when offered to show that one of the contracting parties \u00bfgreed to do more than the language of the contract expressly or by implication requires, <em>(Baker </em>v. <em>Drake, </em>66 N. Y. 518; <em>Oelricks v. Ford, </em>23 How. 65; <em>De Witt v. Berry, </em>134 U. S. 306, 10 Sup. Ct. Rep. 536.) For the errors above mentioned the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
