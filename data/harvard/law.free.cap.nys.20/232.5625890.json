Plaintiff-was entitled to bring an action upon such a judgment within six years from the time it was rendered. Code Civil Proc. \u00a7 382, subd. 7. The language of subdivision 7 is as follows: \u201cAn action upon a judgment or decree rendered in a court not of record.\u201d In section 3017 it is provided that a justice of the peace who renders a judgment \u201cmust, upon the application of the party in whose favor the judgment was rendered, and \u25a0 payment of the fee therefor, deliver to him a transcript of the judgment. The county clerk of tile county in which the judgment was rendered must, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>upon the presentation of the transcript, and payment of the fees therefor, indorse thereupon the date of its receipt, file it in his office, and docket the judgment as of the time of the receipt of the transcript, in the book kept by him for that purpose. * * * Thenceforth the judgment is deemed a judgment of the county court of that county, and must be enforced accordingly.\u201d In <em>Dieffenbach </em>v. <em>Roch, </em>112 N. Y. 621, 20 N. E. Rep. 560, construction was given \"to section 3017, section 382, and section 1913 of the Code; and it was held, \u201calthough, under the Code of Civil Procedure, (section 3017,) upon the \u25a0docketing of a justice\u2019s judgment in the county clerk\u2019s office, it becomes a \u25a0statutory judgment of the county court, it is not a judgment \u00abrendered\u2019 in that court, but remains \u2018 a judgment rendered in a court not of record,\u2019 within the meaning of the provision of said Code (section 382) declaring that an \u25a0action upon such a judgment must be commenced within six years after a \u2022final judgment was rendered.\u2019 \u201d In the course of the opinion it was said: \u201cAfter a justice\u2019s judgment has been docketed in the county clerk\u2019s office, it becomes a mere statutory judgment of the county court. It is not, in fact, \u2022a judgment of that court. There has been no judicial action there, and no judgment has been, in fact, entered or rendered. It is simply to be deemed a judgment of that court. Such a judgment has not been twice rendered,\u2014 \u25a0once in a justice\u2019s court, and once in the county court; and, as it may be \u25a0docketed in all the counties of the state, it certainly cannot be deemed to have been rendered in every county where it has been docketed.\u201d The prohib\u00ed-, \u25a0tian in section 1913 of the Code of Civil Procedure against \u201can action upon a judgment for a sum of money rendered in a court of record of the state\u201d does not, in terms, relate to a judgment rendered in a justice\u2019s court. It is insisted in behalf of the respondent that because a transcript was filed in the clerk\u2019s \u2022office the action was upon a judgment \u201crendered in a court of record of the state, \u201d to wit, the county courtf of Onondaga county. We think the rea\u2022soning and logic used in <em>Dieffenbach </em>v. <em>Roch, supra, </em>are adverse to the contention of the respondent. The cases to which he refers us, of <em>Lyon </em>v. <em>Manly, </em>10 Abb. Pr. 337, and <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>30 Hun, 163, were decided prior to the <em>Dieffenbach Case. </em>Section 3017 differs from section 71 of the Code of 1849, referred to in <em>Lyon </em>v. <em>Manly, </em>32 Barb. 53, 10 Abb. Pr. 337. In the act of 1849 it is provided in the section that, upon filing and docketing, it \u201cshall be a judgment of the county court.\u201d In section 3017 the provision is, after providing for the docketing of the judgment, as follows: \u201cThenceforth the judgment is deemed a judgment of the county court of that county, and must be \u2022enforced accordingly.\u201d <em>Baldwin v. Roberts, </em>30 Hun, 163, seems to have followed <em>Lyon </em>v. <em>Manly, supra. </em>In <em>Church </em>v. <em>Van Buren, </em>55 How. Pr. 489, it was said that the object of the restriction in section 71 (and the same may be said of the restriction in section 1913) \u201cwas to prevent multiplicity of suits and accumulation of costs. The statute was aimed at the evil practice, and designed to cut it off and prevent it. \u201d It seems the same object is attained by the restriction in section 3154 of the Code of Civil Procedure in respect to actions upon a justice\u2019s judgment, as that section provides that, if such an action shall be brought \u201cwithin five years after the rendition thereof against a defendant, upon whom the summons was personally served, no costs can be recovered, except,\u201d etc. Our conclusion is that, as the plaintiff\u2019s judgment upon which he recovered was not \u201crendered in a court of record of the state,\u201d the restriction in section 1913 of the Code does not apply. Following the views expressed, the judgment of the county court reversing the justice\u2019s judgment must be reversed, and the judgment of the justice\u2019s court affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Judgment of the county court reversing a justice\u2019s judgment reversed, and the judgment of the justice affirmed, with costs.
