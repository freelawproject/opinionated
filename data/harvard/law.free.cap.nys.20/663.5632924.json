It was fairly submitted to the jury, and they found a verdict against the defendants. If the defendants made the note, it is immaterial whether they made it as partners, or were doing business in some other'manner. Once shown that the note was made by them, they are liable. The learned justice was therefore right in declining to charge as requested. The judge committed no error, and the judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
