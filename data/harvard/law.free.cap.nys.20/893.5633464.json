The complaint alleges the recovery of a judgment against the company in this court, together with the issuing and return of an execution thereon unsatisfied. The defendants denied any knowledge or information as to the facts of the judgment and execution, and rested on this form of denial for a defense. The plaintiff proved the facts disputed, by affidavit and by the records themselves, and moved to strike out the answer as sham. The motion was granted, and the defendants appealed from the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">The matters in dispute consisted of court records open to public inspection, and the ignorance thereof by the defendants was intentional. Such pleas are not encouraged. <em>McLean </em>v. <em>Electric Co., </em>(Super. N. Y.) 19 N. Y. Supp. 906. And the order made was right, and must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">Fitzsimons, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b914-7\">Newburger, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AYr\"><em>(dissenting.) </em>This is an appeal from an order striking out defendants\u2019 answer as sham. The denials in the answer herein are substantially general denials of material allegations of the complaint, and, though false, cannot be stricken out as sham. The case of <em>McLean </em>v. <em>Electric Co., </em>(Super, N. Y.) 19 N. Y. Supp. 906, referred to by my associates, was a case in which the answer was stricken out as frivolous, and not as being sham. The order appealed from should therefore be reversed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
