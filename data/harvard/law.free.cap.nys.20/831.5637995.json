It is not the building which is spoken of, but the \u201cplace\u201d for which an application for a license has been made. The principal entrance to the building might well be many feet removed from the entrance to the saloon. Upon the facts in the present case it appears that the principal entrance to the building is not the principal entrance to the place for which a license is sought, and that the distance between the principal entrance to the church and that of the saloon is more than 200 feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-13\">The motion must therefore be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
