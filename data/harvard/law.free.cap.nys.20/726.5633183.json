North, a surety on an undertaking given by one Bartlett, under section 559 of the Civil Procedure Code, in an action by Bartlett against plaintiff, in which the latter was arrested, and judgment for costs subsequently given in his favor.

Pl. N. Y.) 13 N. Y. Supp. 557. Subsequently plaintiff applied at special term for judgment on the ground that the remaining allegations of the answer were frivolous, and constituted no defense. This motion was granted, and upon the order made interlocutory judgment was entered directing the assessment of plaintiff\u2019s damages by a reference for that purpose. From- such order and judgment, defendant has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-13\">Appellant\u2019s counsel contends that on the hearing of the motion the court erroneously considered the facts set forth in an affidavit made by the plaintiff, which appears in the record. That this contention is erroneous is apparent from the notice of motion, and the order made and appealed from, neither of which alludes to any papers other than the summons, pleadings, and the order striking out the allegations of the answer held to be sham. Eliminating from the answer all such last-mentioned allegations, there remains as matter of attempted defense only the allegation of the fact that defendant had paid the several judgments for the costs of the action which were awarded to the plaintiff herein as defendant in the action wherein the order for his arrest was issued. That the costs of the action were not the costs which the undertaking on arrest required by section 559 of the Code of Civil Procedure<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is intended to secure was decided by this court on the former appeal, hereinbefore referred to, and again in <em>Sperry </em>v. <em>Heilman, </em>(Com. Pl. N. Y.) 13 N. Y. Supp. 899. Hence, their payment could not constitute a defense to an action on the undertaking, and the answer was plainly frivolous. <em>Strong </em>v. <em>Sproul, </em>53 N. Y. 497, 499. The order and judgment appealed from should'be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b746-14\"> Code Civil Froo. \u00a7 559, requires an undertaking on arrest to provide for payment of \u201call costs which may be awarded to the defendant, and all damages which he may sustain by reason of the arrest, not exceeding the sum specified in the undertaking. \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
