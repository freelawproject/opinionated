Plaintiffs and one John W. Hutton furnished hardware for the buildings against which the plaintiffs\u2019 lien was filed. The premises were sold under a mortgage foreclosure; at public auction, and purchased by defendant Arend. All of plaintiffs\u2019 materials were delivered subsequent to said sale, and were used in the building. From an examination of the record there appears to have been no error committed by the trial justice. The judgment against the defendants personally is proper and in accordance with the practice, they having executed a bond for the discharge of the mechanic\u2019s lien, which bond had been approved by a justice of the court of common pleas. For these reasons the judgment appealed from must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
