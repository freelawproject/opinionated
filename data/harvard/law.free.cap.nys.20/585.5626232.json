The plaintiff claimed that he was employed to work for the defendant by her husband, and that the husband was defendant\u2019s agent, and authorized to thus employ him. Plaintiff relied solely upon the statement of Mr. Benedict, when he employed plaintiff, that he was Mrs. Benedict\u2019s agent, and authorized to employ the plaintiff, to prove the employment. Both Mr. and Mrs. Benedict testified that they resided upon the premises as a family, and that Mr. Benedict had no authority to employ the plaintiff to \u2022 work for Mrs. Benedict. The proof was that Mr. Benedict provided for and supported the family. Mr. Benedict\u2019s declaration that he was agent for defendant, if made, proved nothing towards making a case. The plaintiff failed to make a case against the defendant. The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
