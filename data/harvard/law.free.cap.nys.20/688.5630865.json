St. p. 744, \u00a7 3,) does not create the relation of landlord and tenant, so as to justify the summary removal of the tenant by the claimant for nonpayment of rent. <em>Sperling </em>v. <em>Isaacs, </em>13 Daly, 375, followed.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b708-7\">Appeal from district court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b708-8\">Summary proceedings by Michael Donelly against John O\u2019Dav for nonpayment of rent.

The question is whether the conventional relation of landlord and tenant subsisted between the parties to the proceedings. To establish the relation, appellant relies upon the attornment. But, obviously and indisputably, the \"attornment was merely void, (1 Rev. St. p. 744, \u00a7 3,) and, as such, was inoperative for any and all purposes, <em>(O'Donnell </em>v. <em>McIntyre, </em>37 Hun, 623, 626;. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Harper, </em>5 Wend. 246.) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Angel, </em>61 How. Pr. 157, the attornment was valid and effectual, and for that reason the order dismissing the proceeding was reversed. Our own adjudication in <em>.Sperling </em>v. <em>Isaacs, </em>13 Daly, 275, is explicitly in point, and conclusive of the case adversely to appellant. Order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
