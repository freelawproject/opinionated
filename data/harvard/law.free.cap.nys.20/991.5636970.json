There was no dispute as to the amount of the claim, or the fact that all the proceedings necessary to acquire a lien had been taken. The issue was, by consent, narrowed down to the inquiry whether there was a contract by which the work and material were furnished on the credit of Braender, the owner. The court below, on evidence entirely satisfactory, found that there was such a contract, and the usual judgment of foreclosure of the lien followed as of course. We find no error in ths rulings, and the judgment appealed from must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
