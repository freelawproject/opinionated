There is no power in a judge to close the examination of a party <em>de hene esse. </em>He can only pass on the admissibility of each question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-11\">H. If there were such power it could only be exercised upon motion by the opposite party, and after the examining party had the opportunity of reviewing the testimony, and proving that the examination was conducted in good faith, and not vexatiously or unnecessarily protracted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b205-12\">HI. In the present instance the parties met before the judge to take his ruling on the admissibility of a single question, and there was no motion pending that the examination be closed; in fact the opposite party had signified his intention of examining the plaintiff on his own behalf.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b205-13\"><em>Lawrence J. </em>Goodale, for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b205-14\">Brady, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aye\">There are two objections to the appeal in this case. The first is that the order made by Judge Hilton has not been entered as required by sections 349 and 350 of the Code, nor has it been served as made. The other is, that the examination of the plaintiff by the defendants is in the nature of a cross-examination. He had already stated his cause of action in the complaint, and the limit of a cross-examination is entirely within the discretion of the judge conducting it. This is an elementary rule, and one founded in good sense and justice. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>true that the exercise of the discretion is not absolute in its effect. If it be abused, the party injured has his remedy by appeal. The defendants have not shown that the discretion exercised by Judge Hilton was an abuse of power, and the appeal must therefore fail. If the examination of a witness could not be limited, it might go on <em>ad </em>infinitum, and the most vexatious practices result. The plaintiff in this case was examined at length, and, for aught that we know, exhausted upon the material features- of the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Halt, F.
