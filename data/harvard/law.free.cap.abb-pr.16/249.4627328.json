The defendant demurred to the complaint, specifying among other grounds of objection that there was a defect of parties defendant. The demurrer was sustained on this ground, with leave to plaintiff to amend the complaint on payment of costs. The plaintiff amended the complaint by adding the requisite parties. The defendant Vallette returned the complaint, and omitted to answer. Plaintiff now applied for judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number><em>Henry F.

Parties defendant can only be added by amending the summons, which can only be done by order of court. (Russell <em>a. </em>Spear, 5 <em>How.

Ro leave to add parties has been given; the order does not authorize the addition of parties.

It is resisted by Yallette because there has been no amendment of the summons. The new parties have been brought in without an express order touching the summons.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">Yallette has not answered this amended complaint, his attorney having returned it, when served on him, for the reason just \u2022 mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">I think Yallette was bound to answer; but the question is not free from doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-13\">The plaintiff may take an order to show cause, &amp;c., by a short day, why the order on deciding the demurrer should not be resettled.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-14\">The motion for judgment will be denied without costs, and without prejudice to the right to renew this motion for judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
