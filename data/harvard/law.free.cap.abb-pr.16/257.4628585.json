The court must be enabled to see from the pleadings, and other papers of the . parties, that the trial of the cause must necessarily involve the examination of a long account, on either side, before they will compel a reference. (Keeler <em>a. </em>Poughkeepsie Plank-road <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Co., 10 <em>How. </em>Pr., 11; Sharp <em>a. </em>Mayor, &amp;c., of N. Y., 18 <em>Ib., </em>213.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-5\">IT. Four items are not enough to justify a reference. (Parker <em>a. </em>Snell, 10 <em>Wend., </em>577.) There are hut two items embraced in the plaintiff\u2019s bill of particulars in this action. (Swift <em>a. </em>Wells, 2 <em>How. Pr., </em>79; Miller <em>a. </em>Hooker, <em>Ib., </em>171.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-6\">HI, Where the judge at the trial orders a reference, this court may review his decision, and revoke the order. (Van Rensselaer <em>a. </em>Jewett, 6 <em>Hill, </em>373; Thomas <em>a. </em>Reab, 6 <em>Wend., </em>503; 25 <em>Ib., </em>687.) On question of right to appeal, see 13 <em>Abbotis\u2019 Pr., </em>124.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-7\">IY. Compulsory references should be rigorously confined to cases invoking the examination of a <em>bona-fide </em>account in an action of contract,, and should be literally and truly a long account. The constitutional provision of the right of trial hy jury cannot be too faithfully preserved, and any legislative provision tampering with it should, at least, be very strictly construed. (18 <em>How. Pr., </em>213.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b274-8\"><em>John C. T. Smidt, </em>for the respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABt\">I. The complaint is for work, labor., and services, and for materials furnished. It will he seen, on examination of the plaintiff\u2019s hill of particulars, that the first and the last item necessarily involve many small items connected with the several contracts. The number of these items cannot be discovered from tibApapers. It is fair to assume, however, that in a motion of the kind, made when a case comes on for trial in its regular order upon the calendar, that the court could ascertain from the statement of counsel more facts pertinent to those items than the pleadings show, and that it acted upon such knowledge, as well as the facts - shown by the papers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-9\">H. The court, did, in fact, make its decision as well upon the facts ascertained from counsel as the papers in the case.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b274-10\">Daly, F. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7E\">There were but seven items in this case, under one date. Substantially, there were but two: putting in gas-pipes per contract, $54; plumbing work by contract, $80. The remainder were a few items of extras added to the plumbing work; and, with one exception, a marble top to wash-basin,. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>$10, they were trifling in amount. Within the decisions, this was not a- case for a reference. (Smith <em>a. </em>Brown, 3 <em>How. Pr., </em>9; Swift <em>a. </em>Wells, 2 <em>Ib., </em>79; Miller <em>a. </em>Hooker, <em>Ib., </em>171; Parker <em>a. </em>Snell, 10 <em>Wend., </em>577; Van Rensselaer <em>a. </em>Jewett, 6 <em>Hill, </em>373.)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Hilton and Beady, JJ., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">Order reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
