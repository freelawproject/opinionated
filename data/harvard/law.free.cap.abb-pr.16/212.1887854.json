S. Candler, Jr., the party insured. The defendants, on the eve of trial, offered to pay to the sheriff the amount of the attachment and taxable costs to date, and demanded that on such payment the actions should be discontinued by the sheriff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b229-5\">Brown, <em>Ball &amp; </em>Yanderpoel, attorneys of record, for the sheriff, moved to discontinue, on said terms, under section 232 of the Code.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-6\"><em>William W.
