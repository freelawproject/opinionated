Three defences were interposed by the defendant Lahens, to the second of which the plaintiffs demurred. Their demurrer was sustained, and judgment awarded in their favor on such demurrer, with costs; \u201c with liberty, however, to the said defendant, Louis Emile Lahens, to serve an amended answer to the complaint herein within twenty days after notice of this order, upon payment of the costs of said demurrer.\u201d An amended answer was served, containing the defence formerly demurred to, and avoiding the defects in the former answer. The defendant Lahens added to the defence, also, a statement of absence from the country at a particular period, in connection with a denial that he had accepted the trust under the assignment, as was averred by the complaint. The former answer did not deny such acceptance, and therefore had admitted it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b305-11\">The plaintiffs moved to strike out this denial; which motion\u2019 was denied at chambers, and the plaintiffs appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b306-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number><em>Jeremiah larocgue, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b306-5\"><em>Elbridge J. Gerry, </em>for the respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A7S\">I. It is true, that under the old rule of this court of 1796, and, indeed, at common law, where an amendment of a pleading held bad on demurrer was permitted, the defendant was not allowed to add or interpose new pleas. <em>(Rule </em>8, <em>Supreme Court Rules of </em>1796; Dole <em>a. </em>Moulton, <em>Col. &amp; C. Cas., </em>91; Gouverneur <em>a. </em>Elmendorf, 4 <em>Johns. Ch., </em>357; Benedict <em>a. </em>Ripley, 5 <em>Cow., </em>37; Western Reserve Bank <em>a. </em>Stryker, <em>Clarke, </em>380; Hollister <em>a. </em>Livingston, 9 <em>How. Pr., </em>140.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-6\">H. But, under the Code, either party is allowed to shape his own pleadings to suit himself; and there no longer exists any restriction upon the power of the court to allow such amendments before trial, even though the effect be to change entirely the whole cause of action or ground of defence. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 173.) 1. A party may amend his answer by setting up a new and separate defence, even though such defence is of the class usually styled unconscionable. (Macqueen <em>a. </em>Babcock, 13 <em>Ab</em>botts\u2019 <em>Pr., </em>268; S. C., 22 <em>How. Pr., </em>229; overruling Hollister <em>a. </em>Livingston, and reviewing the cases cited by the appellants\u2019 counsel; Harrington <em>a. </em>Slade, 22 <em>Barb., </em>161; Wyman <em>a. </em>Remond, 18 <em>How. Pr., </em>272; Spencer <em>a. </em>Tooker, 12 Abbotts\u2019 <em>Pr., </em>353; S. C., 21 <em>How. Pr., 333; </em>Beardsley <em>a. </em>Stover, 7 <em>Ib., </em>249; 1 <em>Van Santv. Pl., </em>2 ed., 805.) 2. So, a plaintiff may amend his complaint by adding or striking out a cause of action. (Mason <em>a. </em>Whitely, 1 Abbotts\u2019 <em>Pr., </em>85; Watson <em>a. </em>Rushmore, 15 <em>Ib., </em>51, per Barhabd, J.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-7\">III. The rule is different as to amendments on the trial, or after trial. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 173, <em>supra; </em>Fagen <em>a. </em>Davison, 2 <em>Duer, </em>153. Miller <em>a. </em>Moore, 1 <em>E. D. Smith, </em>743, cited by appellants\u2019 counsel. Troy <em>&amp; </em>Boston R. R. Co. <em>a. </em>Tibbetts, 11 <em>How. Pr., </em>168, states the distinction.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-8\">IV. The terms of the order, under which this ramended answer was interposed, are not restrictive as to what may be set up as a defence.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-9\">V. Mor is there any harshness in permitting a party, upon terms, to interpose a good and valid defence not previously pleaded. <em>(Code, </em>\u00a7 172.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b307-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Bt the Court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014Ingraham, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALc\">This matter is not added as \u25a0a separate defence, but as intended to aid the defence formerly demurred to. Although it was not thought necessary in the former answer to set up these facts, still I know of no rule that would prevent the party, under the Code, from obtaining leave to amend in this respect. The omission to contradict an allegation in a pleading should not, on such an application, be considered equivalent to a direct admission of its truth. In the latter case, some explanation would be required before a party would be allowed to make a contrary statement. Mere silence in an answer is not to be held to such a strict rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Where only a part- of an answer is demurred to, the defendant, under the leave to amend, can only amend the defective portion of the answer, and cannot set up new defences; but he may add to the part demurred to any thing which would strengthen the defence as originally made, even if such matter had, from any cause, been passed over and left unanswered in the first pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">On motion, such an amendment would be allowed (Macqueen <em>a. </em>Babcock, 22 <em>How. Pr., </em>229; Spencer <em>a. </em>Tooker, 12 <em>Abbotts' Hr., </em>249); and the defendant could do the same under the right to amend of course, and might even add new defences. (Wyman <em>a. </em>Remond, 18 <em>How. Pr., </em>272.) Under the enlarged system of amendment introduced by the Code, it seems to be only in accordance with the whole scope and intent of that statute, to extend the rules of amendment much further than were formerly in practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">We think the order at chambers was proper, and should be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b307-8\"> Present, Sutherland, Ch.
