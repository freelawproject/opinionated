The text of the will is stated at length in the opinion of the Surrogate. Its probate was contested upon the ground that at the time of its execution, the testator entertained an insane delusion that upon his decease, his soul would enter into the body of some animal, and that, influenced by that decision, he executed the will propounded, with a view to the better security of his future existence. It was further objected that the will violated the statute against perpetuities ; that the devise of the real estate was to a corporation not competent, at the time of the decease of the testator, to take by devise: and that an equitable conversion of the personalty into realty took place at chat time also, and vitiated the bequest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-5\">The parties contesting the probate, were certain alleged heirs of the testator, natives of France, and intervening through the French consul; and two persons claiming as legatees under a previous will. Evidence was given on the probate, bearing upon the life and habits of the testator, from which it appeared that he was a man of considerable education and shrewdness, simple and economical in his habits, and reticent on the subject of his family affairs, very fond of animals, often remarking that \u201cthey were better than men that he .left France about 1849, went trading in South America and California, then came to New York, and completed his fortune by speculating in real estate, with great success. In February, 1871, he was seized with pneumonia, and taken, at Ms own request, to St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital, in New York city.

What do you understand by an <em>insane delusion ? </em>give a brief definition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-9\">A. Well, sir; it is almost impossible to define it accurately. I can give a general idea by saying that it is a false notion, impossible in the nature of things, or the nature of the case\u2014often personal to the individual who is suffering from it; of the falsity of which he. can not be persuaded by others, or persuade himself; and in which the faculty or power of comparison is lessened or abolished.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-10\">Q. How does such a delusion differ from an illusion <em>%</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b147-11\">A. An illusion is a false appreciation of a perception, or of a real sensation ; it is a mistaken perception ; it is a false perception of a sensation. A man, for example, looking into a cloud, describes it as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>camel, or a horse, or some fantastic creature\u2014that would be an illusion\u2014seeing the transformation of what actually exists in some other form.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-5\">Q. Can you give an illustration of a delusion <em>%</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-6\">A. An ordinary illustration is that of a person who thinks that he has a glass leg. I can also give a case, which happened quite recently in my experience, of a lady with unsoundness of mind. After several examinations, and very careful ones, I was unable to detect any delusion, until she suddenly ordered her children from the room, and then communicated to me the fact that all her troubles came from her daughter being <em>enceinte </em>by the Devil, and that the Devil took the form of various young men, and so on. That was evidently a delusion, and from that arose her peculiar treatment of her family\u2014her dislike of one and special guarding of the others ; from that delusion arose the general symptoms of unsoundness of mind.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-7\">Q. How does an illusion differ from an hallucination <em>% </em>Give an illustration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b148-8\">A. An hallucination may be called a projection ex- ' ternally of an inward conception ; that is to say, it is a subjective sensation. The difference between an illusion and hallucination is that the object does not exist except in the idea or fancy of the person in a hallucination. If I were to call that chandelier a horse, or to say that I saw a horse suspended there, it would be an illusion. But an hallucination is not referred to any external object; it is simply a subjective sensation ; it is a false perception of the various senses, as of the sense of hearing ; hearing sounds when no sounds exist, as Luther heard the voice of the Devil, and so on ; of the sense of touch, an ordinary illustration of which is when you take a simple round body and roll it between your two fingers crossed, there appears to be two, when it can be demonstrated that there is only one body. That is an hallucination of the sense of touch.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>Q. How does . a delusion differ from a belief\u2014what do you understand a belief to be ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-5\">A. A belief may be described as the assent to a proposition admitting of any degree of strength, from the slightest probability to the fullest certainty. There are various forms and gradations or degrees of belief. There is a mere notional belief, and there is a religious belief or conviction, which admits of no doubt or discussion, and which is fixed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-6\">Q. How does a belief differ from a delusion <em>%</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-7\">A. That -is a question which can not be answered by a single illustration ; it will admit of a wide range.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-8\">Q. I will put it in this form : In your judgment, as a medical man, would the expression of a belief by any adult of the human species, at variance with that generally entertained by those of his fellow-beings with whom he more immediately lived, and among whom he moved, indicate the existence of any mental disease 1</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-9\">A. Ho, sir ; in my opinion, no.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-10\">Q. Would it indicate any irrationality, any defect of the power of reasoning, on the part of such adult ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-11\">A. Ho, not necessarily.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-12\">Q. [1J Suppose any one of the human species, an adult, were to express a belief in regard to the future existence of the soul, which belief, although formerly entertained centuries ago by the then civilized world, and now maintained by over four hundred millions of people as a distinct religious creed, is, nevertheless, at the present day, regarded as purely heretical and absurd by the more civilized portion ofmankind\u2014would, I ask, the expression of such an opinion, repeatedly asserted, and maintained at times with considerable warmth of expression by that adult, indicate to you, as a medical man, the existence in him of any insane delusion, mental derangement, irrationality, or unsoundness of mind ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-13\">A. Ho ; not by itself alone.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Q. [3] Suppose a man sixty years of age and upwards, should, ten years prior to his death, entertain, and repeatedly express it to be his firm belief that upon the death of man the soul passes into the body of some animal, without, however, asserting it as his belief as to his own soul; and then for the ten years immediately preceding his death should not be known or heard to assert such belief, and finally should die professing the faith of a church which taught that the expression of any such belief, and that such belief itself, was a heresy, \u2014would you consider that this belief, assuming it to be a delusion, continued to the time of his death ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-5\">A. I understand that it is assumed in your question that a period of ten years elapsed between the expression of this belief, which is again assumed as a possible delusion, and the death of this individual\u2014am I correct ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-6\">Q. Entirely so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-7\">A. Assuming it to be a delusion, the strong probability in such a case, amounting almost to a certainty, would be that it had not continued during those ten years ; because delusions take possession of a man ; are his main subject of conversation, are constantly being recurred to and referred to. A delusion is a man\u2019s main thought, intruding itself upon nearly all occasions, as a general rule. For that reason, I should say that the strong probability, almost certainty, was that during that time no such delusion was entertained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b150-8\">Q.

Ho, sir.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-6\">Q. In the course of your professional study, in connection with the subject of insanity, have you had occasion to examine, and have you examined, the subject of metempsychosis, or the theory of the transmigration of souls, as bearing upon the question of alleged insane delusion connected therewith <em>%</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-7\"><em>A. </em>I have.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-8\">Q. Will you state, as concisely as you can, the result of your examination upon the subject, more especially as bearing upon the question of the sanity or rationality of those who have entertained or professed to entertain any such belief or theory ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-9\">A. The doctrine of the transmigration of souls appears to have been not only a very ancient but at one time a. very common one. In modern times we know it more as the doctrine of Pythagoras; but when you come to study out the subject you will find that he got it from the Egyptians. How, it is held that the Egyptians were the first to believe in the immortality of the soul, and that this doctrine of metempsychosis was-the first expression of the belief in the immortality of the soul. I should have prefaced this with a definition of the term metempsychosis. The term implies the passage of the animating quality, or what is believed to be the animating quality, of the body of a man into animals successively ; and, by some who have held that doctrine\u2014some people or believers (and when I speak, of <em>believers </em>I mean whole masses)-\u2014again returning after a certain purification by its progression through these animals to the human form again. That would. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>seem unquestionably to have been the belief of the1 Egyptians; and it would appear that it was one of the reasons for which they preserved their mummies. The-soul or animating principle went through a sort of expiation by the passage into the different animals, until finally, say after a period of three thousand years, it was re-born humanly into the body of a young infant, and then going on again, and on its death taking up an animal direction. It was also held by the believers of this doctrine that the kind of animal that the soul went into was according to the nature of the individual; a ferocious temperament going into a lion, a cunning person into a fox, usurers into asses, and so on. The doctrine was held by the Celtic Druids, the Druids in France, the Druids in Britain ; it came originally from Germany with the Druids. It was supposed by some of the biographers of Pythagoras that he got this idea from the Druids during his residence at Crotona ; but the better historians on this subject seem to think that the Druids got many of their doctrines-from him, and that Pythagoras got his doctrine of metempsychosis during his residence in Egypt. The doctrine undoubtedly prevailed in a modified form among the ancient Greeks before the Pythagorian time. It is also still held as a belief amongst the Brahmins.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-5\">Q. About how many in numbers are there of the Brahmins <em>%</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-6\">A. There are several millions; I can not tell the exact number; the followers of that religion are counted by several millions. The form of the doctrine that was taught by Pythagoras was adopted and taught by the Grecian philosophers and metaphysicians. It seems never to have been adopted by the Romans, but we find it amongst several of the early fathers of the Christian church. Origen was a holder of that belief. It has even been attempted to prove that the belief was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>countenanced in the New Testament by some verses, I think in the ninth chapter of John. That matter has been discussed by some of the theologians. Origen and his followers held this belief, and held it very strongly. And it is held by some\u2014T am not committing myself, in relating the history, either for or against any of the statements\u2014it is held by some that the doctrine of Purgatory originated in that way. Again, in modern times, it was held distinctly by Fourier, and is still by his disciples in France.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-5\">Q. Would you consider a man who entertained such a belief irrational ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-6\">A. Not necessarily, and for this reason ; that it is a belief, in the first place, that has been held by many of the first minds in the world in former - times, and even in modern times\u2014Fourier himself being a good mind. Such beliefs are held sometimes as a mere metaphysical belief. There is a difference between a conviction and merely holding a general belief upon a subject; and for that reason I should not suppose that it necessarily involved any irrationality or mental unsoundness. Beliefs of that kind, and even beliefs which are more extravagant, do not necessarily involve unsoundness of mind, when looked at in an abstract way by a medical man.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-7\">The doctrines of the Christian church are held variously; what one sect believes another holds to be irrational, in the ordinary meaning of the term. But a medical man asked to investigate the mental condition of a person holding such a religious belief, and finding no other evidence of delusion or of mental unsoundness generally, certainly would not be warranted in saying that such a person was laboring under any degree of mental unsoundness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-8\">That is my reason for answering categorically, shortly, no.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-9\">Q. Will you name some of those prominent men <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>who entertained and openly professed to entertain this belief, and who were always regarded, for aught that appears to the contrary, as entirely sound in mind and perfectly rational ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-5\">A. I have mentioned already the name of Pythagoras, who was the founder of the school of Grecian philosophy, and there is no question as to his mental soundness, and thousands of his followers\u2014I can not recall all the names at present.....</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-6\">Plato held the doctrine and taught it, as you will see by his works.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-7\">Q. Is there anything about it in Ovid ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-8\">A. Ovid refers to it in several parts of the Metamorphoses as a doctrine held. Montaigne, in his Essays, refers to it without derision. He says it is a doctrine that has not only been held in the past but is held at the present day. I think it is in his Essay on Cruelty to Animals, if I am not mistaken. All who have held that doctrine were strict believers in the immortality of the soul. They base upon that, that the soul being eternal, never ceases to be removed and shifted in its place from one body to another.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-9\">Q. Do you know whether this doctrine or theory was regarded as a heresy by the Jews as well as the Christians?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-10\">A. No ; it was held by the Jews very strongly, decidedly. That I omitted to state. The Pharisees believed in it as a part of their doctrine. The doctrine seems to have originated in the idea of the immortality of the soul. It was the first form in which that idea was presented to the human mind, and the doctrine was intended to reconcile the idea of the immortality of the soul, to make it understandable as against those who believed in total annihilation. It was for the purpose of presenting it in a tangible form. The soul passed into the body of one animal and then into another. And then there were modifications of it. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Egytian form gave it a purgatorial nature, and when the soul was purified it returned and was re-born. In the Brahmin form the soul returned to God or Brahma.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-5\">\u2022 Q.

You made some preparation for this case\u2014was it at the request of my learned adversary, Mr. Gerry ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-14\">A. Yes. sir.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-15\">Q.

Yes, sir.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-17\">Q. And those notes you have referred to to-day, have you ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-18\">A. Those notes you saw me have in my hand\u2014yes, sir.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-19\">Q. I saw you had your notes in your hand during the latter part of the examination, but not the first part?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-20\">A. No, sir; I have had no notes or answers prepared to any of tie interrogatories, with the exception <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>of the general definitions and this matter of metempsychosis.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-5\">Q. Those definition s you had written out in advance ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-6\">A. To refresh my own memory.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-7\">Q. Now, those definitions are general ones?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-8\">A. Yes, sir.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-9\">Q. Are there not cases that it is very difficult to class under these definitions\u2014I mean, do not cases run into each other to such an extent that it is frequently difficult to give an absolute definition ? For instance, you have defined belief, delusion, illusion, and hallucination ; now, are there not some cases so peculiar that it is difficult to tell where to class them, or to class them, under any particular head ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-10\">A. Yes, sir.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-11\">Q. And, of course, in these answers that you give, you merely give general definitions applicable to general cases ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-12\">A. Yes, sir ; all definitions are more or less defective. I do not pretend to put them out as perfect definitions by any means.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-13\">Q. Now, is it not at times difficult to draw the line between belief and delusion? Are there not some forms of belief that so closely resemble delusions that it is difficult to draw the line between ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b158-14\">A. Well, the question is somewhat general\u2014it depends so much upon the habit of thought of an individual. A person may regard another as holding a delusion, which others again may regard as a proper belief. It is a relative matter\u2014it is not a positive matter; and therefore I can not answer the question distinctly, yes or no. Take, for example, the various forms of belief of Christianity, in which it is held that such and such a belief of such a sect is evidently a delusion, a heresy, &amp;c., while that belief is held by a large number of persons. A delusion is peculiar, particular to the individual himself, as a rule. You won\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>find ten thousand men believing that they have glass legs, or believing in any delusion of that kind. But you will find ten thousand, and ten millions and hundreds of millions, believing in some extravagant or particular proposition. That is the difference I make. I can only answer your question by an explanation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-5\">Q. Then it is the number of votaries of a particular belief that would influence you in determining whether that belief is a delusion or not ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-6\">A. Certainly not; not the mere number. But if it is what is commonly known as a general belief\u2014you may take, for example, the Mormons or the Shakers, who hold beliefs at variance with those commonly held \u2014and there are many hundreds and thousands of them\u2014but they have inherited this belief; they have been taught it as children; I can not call them delusions, however fallacious I might think the beliefs to-be.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-7\">Q. Is there any form of religious belief, or any opinion upon such matters, that you would ever call a delusion <em>1</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-8\">A. I should hardly feel myself competent- to pronounce upon any theological or religious question.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-9\">Q. You consider them outside of your department ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-10\">A. I do, sir.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-11\">Q. And you will not undertake to say, then, what is a delusion or a belief when it comes to questions in that department\u2014is that what I understand you to say ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"111\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-12\">A. By religious, I understand you to mean the general belief. I meant to say in my previous answer that I do not consider myself capable to decide upon any religious belief and condemn it as wrong or heretical.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"112\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-13\">Q. Do you believe in the transmigration of souls into animals ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"113\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-14\">A. I do not\u2014it. is no part of my belief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"114\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-15\">Q. What is your belief <em>%</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"115\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>A. I believe in the Christian religion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"116\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-5\">Q. Then, of course, you can not believe in this doctrine of metempsychosis, such as you have defined it ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"117\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-6\">A. No.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"118\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-7\">Q. I am asking now in reference to the country and age in which you live\u2014do you consider the belief in metempsychosis a general belief?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"119\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-8\">A. It is not, to the best of my knowledge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"120\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-9\">Q. In the course of your experience have you known \u2022any man or woman, or, as my friend calls it, \u201can adult,of the human species\u201d of full age, who believed that his soul was going into a horse, a donkey, a dog, or \u2022a cat ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"121\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-10\">A. Not to my recollection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"122\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-11\">Q. You have then practiced thirty odd years and have never known of such a case ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"123\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-12\">A. Yes, sir.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"124\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-13\">Q. Now, when you spoke of metempsychosis you very aptly drew a distinction, if I understood you correctly, between the metaphysical belief and the actual belief ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"125\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-14\">A. Yes, sir; mere notional belief, and religious .'belief, if I may use those words.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"126\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-15\">Q. And there is a great difference, is there not ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-16\">A. Yes, sir ; a man may hold a metaphysical belief, a notional belief, to a certain extent; he may be able to be convinced of its impropriety ; he may be able to renounce it; he maybe very violent in his disputations about it, but really have no certain conviction upon the subject. He may hold it as a probability or possibility, but have no ultimate perfect conviction on the subject; it forming no part of what is called his faith. There is a great difference between faith and a mere notional belief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b160-17\">Q. Now take the case \u00f3f a man who is actually piously convinced that his soul after death will go into the body of an animal, and will require protection in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>\u25a0consequence of its being in the lower order of animals, \u2014is that what you call metempsychosis ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-4\"><em>A. </em>I never have heard a part of that definition\u2014 requiring protection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-5\">Q. Then we will exclude that. Is that one of the forms of metempsychosis ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-6\">A. That is one of the forms of metempsychosis\u2014the belief that at death, the soul or animating principle will pass into the body of some given animal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"132\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-7\">Q. In the answers that you have given I understood you to say that you did not hold that a man was necessarily insane because he entertained this belief in metempsychosis. Were you speaking of the metaphysical belief or the actual, real, firm belief <em>%</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"133\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-8\">A. I was speaking of both\u2014I included both.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"134\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-9\">Q. But suppose there were other circumstances in the case that tended to delusion, would you or not consider this belief, this actual belief that the soul of the individual was going into a horse, or a cat, or a dog, one of the links which might form a chain tending to an opinion that the party was irrational ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"135\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-10\">A. Not unless I could connect it with another or other palpable delusions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"136\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-11\">Q. But if you could connect it, you'would consider it a link, would you ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-12\">A. Certainly, it would be a link.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b161-13\">Q. Now, suppose a man of a very large estate, living in a cheap boarding-house in the poorest quarters of the city, alone, a man keeping kegs of gold under his bed, starting up at night with exclamations which are unintelligible to those who hear them\u2014suppose him to be taken sick, to be conveyed to an hospital, to make two. wills within a few days of his death, to believe at the time that he was dying, that his soul was going into the body of an animal, and then leaving every dollar that he possessed to a society, the only object of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>which was to protect animals\u2014would you consider that man rational or irrational?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-5\">A. I should see no positive evidence of irrationality in the act.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-6\">Q. What do you mean by positive evidence ; would you see any evidence whatever ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"141\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-7\">A. No evidence unless there were other symptoms or evidences of irrationality. It might be a mere fancy, a mere whim ; I do not call that irrationality. We see people affected with whims who have a fanciful imagination, who do acts under those whims, but that alone does not necessarily constitute mental unsoundness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"142\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-8\">Q. Is there any other theory by which you could account for such an act ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"143\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-9\">A. Well, the mere fact of his admitting- that he held that belief at that time, and acting under the belief, the belief not constituting a delusion, I should not call that an act of irrationality.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"144\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-10\">Q. Then you don\u2019t consider that belief an irrational one ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-11\">A. I don\u2019t consider it a delusion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"146\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-12\">Q. Do you consider it a rational or irrational belief?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"147\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-13\">A. It would be considered by certain persons, certain sects, as irrational, and others, the followers of Brahma, a large portion of the East Indians, would consider it a rational belief. I might consider the belief of the Mormons or of the Shakers as irrational, but certainly I would not, from their belief alone, pronounce a Mormon or a Shaker as of unsound mind in making a will, even in connection with that peculiar belief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"148\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b162-14\">Q. Then, you draw no distinction in your own mind between the belief of any of those sects you have mentioned and this belief which we are now speaking of; you think they stand on the same footing, and you would consider that the same degree of rationality attached to each ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"149\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>A. Well, you have put to me hypothetically the question as to its being a religious and not a metaphysical belief. Am I right <em>%</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"150\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-5\">Q. Yes, an actual belief I am speaking of; an article of faith, of which he is as well satisfied as you are of your own faith ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"151\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-6\">A. Then I should not consider that as an evidence of irrationality.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"152\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-7\">Q. That was not precisely the question. The question that I put to you was whether you placed this actual belief in metempsychosis upon the same footing as the other beliefs that you have mentioned ; that is, the Shakers and others? Do you think they are all equally rational beliefs ? Can you answer that question <em>%</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"153\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-8\">A. I can not answer that question without an explanation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-9\">Q.

That was a delusion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"164\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-19\">Q. Why was it a delusion ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"165\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-20\">A. Because it was personal to the man and' held only by himself\u2014not a form of belief of numbers of other persons held in common by a variable number of individuals.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"166\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-21\">Q. Then the reason that you draw this distinction and accord the other to be a rational form of belief is that a great many others believe in it ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"167\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>A.

A religious belief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"172\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-9\">Q. Leave out the words and simply answer my question, if you can. I am speaking of a man in a dying condition.

Then you could not answer it ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"175\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-12\">A. Not in the manner you have put it, without further inquiry; for that would decide very much whether he had dislikes to particular individuals of his family, his daughter or wife, and so on ; and whether he was influenced by those dislikes in connection with his fanciful belief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"176\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-13\">Q.

I will come back to my question. I understood you to say\u2014and I have your definition here in writing \u2014that an insane delusion is a false notion impossible in the nature of things. I also understood you to say, in answer to my questions, that, in yonr judgment, a belief in metempsychosis was a false notion and impossible.

I answer that again as I have already attempted to, because I added that it was personal to the individual\u2014the delusion\u2014in a vast majority of, if not in all, cases. Metempsychosis is not personal to the individual. It is believed at the present time by several hundred millions of persons, and has been so believed for a long time.

The only test is, that, in one case it is a personal belief, and in the other the belief is shared by many.

That is one, and a very strong differentiation between the two.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"183\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-10\">Q. Do you consider that, in judging of the acts of a man who is now living, and has always, or for many years, lived in a civilized Christian community, your judgment or decision should be at all affected by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>opinions that, may be entertained by millions of uncivilized and unchristian people ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"184\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-5\">A. He may have lived among the very people who held these doctrines, and been converted to them there, or gained his notions of them there. If he had lived all his life in a civilized Christian community, and had read nothing on the subject, and his mind was not of an imaginative character, or Ms imagination was not easily affected, then I might think it singular. But if he was of an imaginative or speculative mind, and he was suddenly attracted, or attracted by specious writings on the subject, he might for a time entertain such a belief, and such circumstances would influence very much my opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"185\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-6\">Q.

An hallucination is likewise a false perception, but it is not based upon a reality. An illusion is based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>upon a reality.

By belief I understand the acceptance by the intellect of any proposition as true upon argument or proof but without certain knowledge of its truth. In a .good many cases I think that belief is confounded with knowledge and faith, whereas I think the three things are very essentially distinct.

We simply regard them as somewhat strange, because we are not so familiar with them as with some others. There are beliefs entertained which are fully as absurd, if I may use that expression, by people around us with whom we mingle every day of our lives and which yet do not excite astonishment, and we do not think the people insane. We have the Spiritualists, Mormons, Muggietonians, Shakers, Swedenborgians, and others, who hold very erratic notions, far more absurd, to my mind, than that of metempsychosis, and yet we do not consider them insane, and mainly for the reason that no religious belief is evidence of a man\u2019s insanity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"341\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b178-8\">Q.

He might have had a dim impression, perhaps, at times, that it was true, as people have in regard to various theological dogmas ; but as to his believing it firmly and fixedly, I am very sure he did not, if that is a correct statement of the facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"357\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b181-6\">Q.

In the course of your professional study in connection with the subject of insanity, have you had occasion to examine, and have you examined, the subject of metempsychosis, or the theory of the transmigration of souls, as bearing upon the question of alleged insane delusions connected therewith ; and have jtou also ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>amined the subject of metaphysical and religions beliefs in connection with the subject of insanity <em>\\</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"360\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-5\">A. I have, for a number of years past\u2014certainly over twenty years ago I began my study of those subjects.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"361\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-6\">Q. Will you state, if you please, as concisely as you can, the results of your examination upon these subjects, more especially as bearing upon the question of the sanity or rationality of those who have entertained, ' or | rofessed to entertain, any such beliefs or theories ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"362\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-8\"><em>A. </em>Briefly, the answer that I should make to that question would be mainly a reiteration of what, I have already stated, and the answer I gave to a former question is based upon my study of those subjects ; and that is, that no religious belief, no matter how absurd it may be, is of itself sufficient evidence of a man\u2019s insanity. I base that answer upon the investigation of a large number of cases, and likewise upon a very thorough reading of the subject. As regards the doctrine of the transmigration of souls, and the doctrine of metempsychosis\u2014because, I think, there is a distinction between them\u2014both have been held at various times of the world\u2019s history by the most enlightened nations then on the earth. They were, and are to the\" present day, held in some form or other, by the Hindoos, by the people of Siam, by the people of Thibet, by the Chinese. They were held by the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, Persians, Scythians, by the Druids, and by the Celts generally to some extent. They are held now by the North American and South American Indians, as I know from my own knowledge in regard the North American Indians. They were held by various heretical sects among the early Christians ; and then in the twelfth century by the Gnostics, and by the Manicheans, who were early heretical sects. They have likewise been held by several distinguished European men, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>Pythagoras, Plato, Pericles, Plotinus, by Origen, by Fourier, by Leibnitz, by Lessing, and among writers of the present day by Pierre Leroux ; and Fourrier has written extensively upon that subject. I know of my \u25a0own knowledge that they are held by people of the present day in the city of New York. I may state that Mr. Alger, in his very learned work \u201cThe Doctrine of a Future State,\u201d states from his own knowledge that those beliefs, in some form or other, are largely held in this country and Europe at the present day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"363\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-5\">Q. You stated that the belief was entertained- by the Brahmins, do you know how many of those people there are at the present time <em>%</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"364\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-6\">A. There are about two hundred millions ; and there are about four hundred millions Buddhists who also hold it. The belief is held by millions of the human race at the present day.,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"365\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-7\">Q. What is the particular belief of Brahma and Buddha upon that subject generally ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"366\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-8\">A. The particular belief of the Buddhists is that at death the soul goes into matter of all forms, animal, vegetable, and mineral; and it is to that form of belief that the term of transmigration of souls is more properly applied.. The doctrine as held by the Egyptians, and I think by the Brahmins and by the ancient Greeks, by Plato, Pythagoras, and others, restricts the passage of the soul into animal forms ; but the Buddhists hold that it goes into all forms of matter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"367\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-9\">Q. That is the distinction between metempsychosis and the doctrine of the transmigration of souls <em>%</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"368\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-10\">A. Yes, sir.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"369\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-11\">Q. Would you consider a man who entertained such a belief at the present day irrational <em>%</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"370\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-12\">A. I might consider him irrational, but I should not consider him insane. People are irrational every day of their lives.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"371\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Q. Do .you remember whether this belief was entertained at any time by the Pharisees ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"372\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-5\">A. It was held by the Pharisees and by certain heretical sects of the Jews, and is supported in the Talmud, and in the writings of Philo, a very distinguished Jew of a very early period.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"373\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-6\">Q. Do you recollect whether anything occurred in the Fifth Council of Constantinople 1</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"374\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-7\">A. It was in that Council that it was denounced. But it was held by the Manicheans and Gnostics in spite of the decrees of any Council.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"375\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-8\">Q. In the course of your examination of this subject, have you had occasion to read carefully the writings of any of the men that you have mentioned, such as Plato, for instance, in which he has expressed this idea of the metempsychosis and transmigration of souls ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"376\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-9\">A. I have read them many years ago. I have read Plato very thoroughly, I think.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"377\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-10\">Q. Do not persons laboring under insane delusions ordinarily indicate in their writings some trace of the delusions ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"378\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-11\">A. I should say that they invariably do, or at least, with remarkably few exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"379\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-12\">Q. As a medical man did you discover anything in those passages in the writings of those persons that you have mentioned, who entertained this belief, indicating to you the existence in the minds of the writers of any mental unsoundness or insane delusion ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"380\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-13\">A. In none of them, unless in the writings of Fourier, which I have only read to a limited extent. I do not consider that Fourier was insane at all; I think he was eccentric ; he was upon the border of insanity ; he was impractical; but I am very far from expressing the opinion that he was insane. An eccentricity is to a certain extent mental unsonndness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"381\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-14\"><em>Cross-examined </em>by Mr. Cotjdert :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"382\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-15\">Q.

There was no equitable conversion of the personalty into realty upon the death of the testator. (1) The direction to his executors affected only the mode of investment (Dorland v. Dorland, <em>2 Barb., </em>81). (2) If the investment clause constitutes a restriction upon the power of alienation, it is repugnant to the prior absolute gift and void (Wetmore <em>v. </em>Parker, <em>52 N. Y., </em>459 ; Manice <em>v. </em>Manice, 43 <em>Id., </em>384; Schettler <em>v. </em>Smith, 41 <em>Id., </em>328 ; Harrison v. Harrison, 36 <em>Id., </em>543; Lovett v.

Burr, 18 <em>Id., </em>103 ; Savage <em>v. </em>Burnham, 17 <em>Id.-, </em>561). (3) The doctrine of equitable conversion proceeds upon the principle, that what was intended to be done, is in equity regarded <em>as </em>done. It is invoked only to sustain a bequest\u2014 never to overturn it (Lovett v. Kingsland, 44 <em>Barb., </em>564; Walker v. Denne, 2 <em>Vesey, Jr., </em>176; Wheldale v. Partridge, 5 <em>Vesey, Jr. </em>[Am., ed.], 197, note; 1 <em>Story Eq. Jur., % </em>64). (4) The power of invoking the doctrine is vested in the beneficiary under the will\u2014not in a contestant; and the beneficiary may elect to take the property as it is and prevent its conversion (2 <em>Story Eq. Jur., </em>\u00a7 793 ; 1 <em>Roper on Leg., </em>372; Rashleigh v. Master, 1 <em>Vesey, </em>Jr., 201, note <em>a. </em>; Kirkman v. Miles, 13 <em>Id., </em>338; Reed v.

The society claims title to the lands covered by the devise, under a special act of the legislature (1 <em>Laws of </em>1871, ch. 76).

The first question in the case, therefore, to be considered, is, that of testamentary capacity ; and the inquiry, on the objections and testimony before me is, mainly, whether the decedent, at the time he executed the alleged will, was of that sound mind and disposing memory which the law requires to be possessed by a testator, or whether the doctrine of metempsychosis, alleged to have been believed by the decedent, constituted such insane delusion as <em>to </em>have so operated upon his mind that he was rendered incapable of making a testamentary disposition of his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Several witnesses, called by the counsel for the alleged next of kin and heirs, testified to. statements made by the decedent, wherein he expressed the belief, at different times, that the souls of men, after death, passed into animals. It was, therefore, urged that this belief was an insane delusion, and that it so affected Ms mind against the natural claims of relatives as to influence him to bestow all his property, real and personal, upon the \u201cAmerican Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,\u201d named as the sole legatee of the will in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\"><em>There </em>was no important amount of evidence adduced, otherwise, tending to show an insane mind. He was a man of fair education and intelligence; his habits were frugal and temperate ; he gave his personal attention to his property, which, by his industry and watchfulness, had accumulated to a large amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">This belief of what is known as metempsychosis, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>which, simply stated, is a speculation as to the destiny of the soul after death, is urged as an evidence of the insanity of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">To no human being has been given the positive knowledge of an existence after death. The instincts of the human mind prompt us to believe, or at least to hope, that, although there may be a death of the body, yet that there is an intellectual or spiritual part of our nature which survives in some form or other. But, in a logical sense, there is no <em>major premise </em>of knowledge ; it is, to all of us either a matter of speculation, or a belief based on the religious doctrine or tenets which we accept. To almost every man there is, to to him, some evidence that there is a higher power, whatever that power may be, which has created this world, and which governs it. The manifestations which surround him on every side, confirm him in that belief, though what that power or Being is, he can, with his finite knowledge, have no definite conception; and, therefore, his views as to a future state rest merely on philosophical speculation, or the faith of that religion which he accepts as his creed and is taught by its priests ; and \u201cfaith is the evidence <em>of </em>things not seen.\u201d The world is divided into many sects, each sect presenting a creed more or less different as to a future state. This very doctrine, metempsychosis, as shown in this case, has been believed in by Pythagoras, Plato, and others of the ancient philosophers, and sages of the East, and even, in modern times, by intellectual, wise, and good men, and is, at this day, accepted by a larger portion of the human race, on the globe, at large, than those who reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Having seriously considered this subject, with reference to the nature and limited capabilities of the human mind, and the differences not only of race, but -of men of the same race, living under the same civil and religious institutions, and resulting from origin, edu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>cation and circumstances ; and also borne in mind the freedom of individual conscience, favored by the society in which we dwell, and by our laws, and the multifarious fofms and shades of opinion, on all subjects, which are consequently engendered among ns, and must be tolerated, whether as means of arriving at truth itself, or, as wise, or mistaken, methods of happiness, which each person has a right to select for himself, or as heresies and error in individual cases, inevitably growing out of the large liberty accorded to all; and taking, as 1 feel compelled, a comprehensive and liberal view of the subject,\u2014my reflections have led me to say that I can not commit myself to what I would deem an extravagant and unjust stretch of judgment of a court of justice, to hold, upon the question of the condition or destiny of the soul of man, after the death of the' body,\u2014of which no man has more positive knowledge than can be expressed by his individual belief,\u2014that insanity, or a delusion, to be characterized as insane, as respects competency to dispose of property by will, for a purpose, which might not, otherwise, than for an alleged delusion, have been entertained, but which pur-, pose, in itself considered, is entirely rational and explicable on other grounds, is to be ascribed to one who honestly and sincerely had faith in the doctrine of metempsychosis, and who, having no family or any near or known remote relations, bequeathed his entire estate to or for a society for <em>the prevention of cruelty to animals.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">It appears to me that, if a judicial officer should assume, that merely because a man earnestly believed in that doctrine, he was insane or labored under an insane delusion, or monomania., incapacitating him for making a will, if prompted by that faith, but, though consistent with it, wholly rational in its provisions, it would not fall very far short, in principle, of assuming that all mankind who do not believe in the uarticular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>faith which the judge accepts, respecting the future state, are more or less insane, or the victims of an insane delusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">This question is entirely within the domain of opinion, or faith, and not of knowledge. A man may properly be assumed insane upon evidence that he is governed by hallucinations which are <em>physically </em>impossible to the knowledge of all sane men, and which are contrary to the evidence of the senses, or who is influenced by delusions, which are the creation of diseased reflective faculties.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Hence, the opinion as to a future state, of which no man has positive knowledge, and in regard to which mankind have always differed, and do widely differ today, even in the most civilized countries, and among the most intellectual of men, can not, in any respect, be deemed evidence of insanity ; the only rule by which the insanity of one of certain opinions can be determined, being by some test founded on positive knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The insanity of an opinion must be established only with reference to means of knowledge accessible to men of common minds and understanding, and not upon the results of- profound scientific researches or experiment, or scholastic theology, or religious tenets concerning the nature of the infinite, or the destiny of the race beyond the present, which, itself, is too vast and mysterious a domain for the finite mind to comprehend ; and if we are so much at fault, or deficient, and so at variance in opinion of the truth of the present, how can we presume to hold one insane, as to our nature and destiny in the future ?</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">Moreover, if a court is to ascribe insanity to a man, or a class of men constituting a sect, on account of his or their opinion or belief as to a future- state, and a particular sect had, in fact, attained to a real knowledge of that future, the logical deduction would necessarily be, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>that a major portion of mankind, comprised in all other and different sects, were of unsound mind or monomaniacs on that \u2022 subject. If it be the case that such knowledge has been so attained by a sect or known body of believers, the question remains, which it is, and what tribunal is to exercise the judgment cf determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">But what degree of practical importance has the question of the testator\u2019s belief in the peculiar doctrine referred to, in this case ?</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">It is not proved that any act of his life in regard to Ms property was insane, or that the peculiar opinion entertained by him, respecting the destiny of man or the form or condition of his future existence, and claimed to be a sign of mental disease, or of an unsound mind, manifested itself in the use or disposition he made of his money or property, in his lifetime, or that the management of his affairs was characterized, in any manner, by such, or, any, peculiar opinions concerning the nature of man or his future life ; and, so far as the proof appears in this case, the testator\u2019s general con duct of his business affairs did not distinguish him from a multitude about him ; and in his, no more than in their case, indicated unsoundness of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">But it is not strongly claimed that the testator was otherwise unsound in mind than that he was a monomaniac on the subject of the transmigration of souls, and that, in consequence of that, he made the will in question. There is no proof of any declarations he ever made connecting such opinions with his intended disposition of property by will. Mo such opinions were expressed or alluded to, nor was there any conversation on the subject, when the will was prepared or executed, nor does it appear that he alluded to any such opinions, for along time before, thong li he may have entertained them. It does, however, appear, that in his last illness, and about the day the will was made, the testator re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>ceived the Holy Sacrament at the hands of a priest of the Catholic Church, to which he had formerly belonged, and in which he was reared. It therefore seems to be an inference only, that the will was the offspring of those opinions. I cannot decide such to be the fact, on the evidence. The will is silent about such opinions, and, in none of its provisions, imports that the testator held them. It justas much imports that his opinions were those of annihilation, or that no soul survives the body, and probably it would not be claimed that the believers in that doctrine are, on that ground alone, incompetent to make a will; and in fact, a will, such as is before me, though nothing is given to individuals, or for the direct benefit of the human, race, does not <em>necessarily </em>import that the testator was not a believer in the most enlightened religion known in our midst. It would, it is trae, be a singular act for one thus enlightened, so to devote a large estate, but the object is a very worthy one, and has the commendation, and commands the respect, of the best minds, and the sympathies of all humane- people. The commission of cruelty to certain useful animals has long been punishable in this State as a misdemeanor, and the prevention of such cruelty, besides being right, has even its salutary moral effectupon man himself, in the sense that all forms of cruelty inflicted by Mm are, mor\u00e9 or less, the expression of violent passion or of insensibility, tending to retard his own moral advancement; and now, organizations to prevent cruelty to animals exist extensively here and in Europe, and to that object, liberal contributions are made by our most charitable and thoughtful citizens from year to year, and no reflecting person will withhold his approval of expenditures of money for the purpose, as among the laudable movements of the age. How, then, can it be urged that the bequest of the testator\u2019s entire property to the society named, is either, in itself, irrational, or not reconcilable with a sound mind, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>that it implies even a belief in the transmigration of souls of men after death, any more, necessarily, than any other forms of belief, that are, generally, in our country accepted as true <em>1 </em>It is, then, impossible, or it would certainly be a violation\"\u00d3T established principles of law, for me to hold this will to be wholly the offspring of the peculiar opinions of the testator respecting the souls of men in the future, when the case entirely lacks evidence of declarations by Mm, connecting those opinions with the testamentary act, or expressing a purpose of making such a will <em>because </em>he so believed; and I am not prepared to say that, even if such evidence had been produced, I would feel required to take a different view of the sanity of the act, when, as in this case, the testator had neither wife nor child, father or mother, or any known, near or remote, relatives living on the earth, or others on whom h\u00e9 was, or felt himself, under obligation, to bestow his property. lie had no relatives known to Mm,\u2014none had followed him in his career, or taken any interest in his welfare, comfort or happiness ;\u2014and not until after a long life, successful in the accumulation of an estate, and after the journals had promulgated, here and abroad, that quite a fortune is left, is there any claim of relationship to him ; and while the French Consul-General at New York has properly intervened in these proceedings, to save the legal rights 'of the subjects of France, who may be heirs at law or next of kin to the testator, and, by his counsel, has diligently performed his duty to his government, and by his agents in France, endeavored to make known, there, the pendency of these proceedings, the period of over eighteen months has elapsed since testator\u2019s death, and it is not yet clear to me that a single heir-at-law or next of kin in fact, has presented himself, although months ago a commission was issued to France, at the instance of the consul-general, to take proof on the subject, but is not yet returned as exe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>cuted. So that the argument, made at the early stage of this preceding, and since, that this will ignores the claims of relatives upon testator's bounty, and should be looked upon with disfavor or suspicion, has quite lost such degree of force as it originally had.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The result of my reflections on this branch of the case is, therefore, that the will in question is not impeached as a testamentary paper, on the ground of the mental incapacity of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">The question of mental capacity having therefore been determined, as well as that of proper execution, the instrument propounded would be entitled to admission to probate as the last will and testament of decedent, as an entii'ety, unless there be ground for a different decision in respect of its constituting such last-will, depending on my determination of the question of the validity of the devise and bequest contained in the paper ; the same having been submitted to my decision under <em>Laws of </em>1870, ch. 359, \u00a7 11, which is as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">\u201cIn any proceeding before the said surrogate to prove the last will and testament of any deceased person, as a will of real or personal estate, or of both real and personal estate, in case the validi ty of any of the dispositions contained in such will is contested, or their construction or legal effect called in question by any of the heirs or next of kin of the deceased, or any legatee or devisee named in the will, the surrogate shall have the same power and jurisdiction as is now vested in and exercised by the supreme court to pass upon and determine the true construction, validity and legal effect thereof ; he shall enter in his minutes any decision he may make in relation thereto, and any of the heirs or next of kin of the deceased, or any of such legatees or devisees, may appeal therefrom in the same manner, and with the same effect, in every respect, as is now provided by law in relation to appeals from decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>of surrogates, admitting wills to probate or refusing the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">II. As to the validity of the devise of the real estate of which decedent died seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The statutes of this State, applicable to this question, provide,, that all persons, except idiots, persons of unsound mind and infants, may devise their real estate by a last will and testament, duly executed, according to the provisions of this title.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Every estate and interest in real property, descendible to heirs, may be so devised.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Such devise may be made to every person capable by law of holding real estate ; but no devise to a corporation shall be valid unless such corporation shall be expressly authorized by its charter, or by statute, to take by devise.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">The sole devisee of the real estate of decedent is \u201c The, American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,\u201d a corporation created by special act of the legislature, passed April 10, 1866. It is not disputed that the charter of said corporation, as it existed at the time of testator\u2019s decease, contained no words expressly authorizing it to take real estate by devise, and the invalidity of the devise in question is so apparent as to require no discussion whatever, were it not that the counsel for the said society offered in evidence an act of the legislature, passed March 8, 1871, which is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">Seo. 1. \u201cThe American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, a corporation created by an act of the legislature of this State, passed April 10, 1866, is hereby authorized and empowered to take, hold, use and enjoin all the lands, tenements and hereditaments which were, by the last will of Louis Bonard, devised unto the said corporation, for the uses and purposes in said will expressed. And1 all the estate, claim, right, title and interest of the people of this State, of, in, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>to, said lands, tenements and hereditaments, and every part thereof, are hereby released, granted, confirmed to and vested in said corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Sec. <em>2. </em>\u201cThe sixth section of an act entitled \u201cAn act to incorporate the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,\u201d passed April 10, 1806, is hereby amended and shall read as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Sec. 6. \u201c This corporation shall be capable of taking-, holding and enjoying any real property by virtue of any deed, or of any devise contained .in the last will of any person whomsoever, subject to the provisions of law relating to devises by last will. But this corporation shall not in its corporate capacity hold real estate, the yearly income derived from which shall exceed the sum of fifty thousand dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Sec. 3. \u201cNothing in this act contained shall in any manner affect the right of any heir or. creditor of the late Louis Bonard.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">Sec. <em>4. </em>\u201c This act shall take effect immediately.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">The counsel for the society, in his argument, admitted the invalidity of the devise, and that the society did not claim such real estate under the will, but by virtue of the act last referred to ; and submitted to the court that it was proper for it to pass upon the effect of that enabling statute, in determining what disposition is to be made of the real estate here.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-10\">I do not deem it any part of my province to entertain the question of the effect of that special act.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-11\">If the lands, so in terms devised, escheated to the State, on account of the invalidity of the devise, and the non-existence of heirs capable of inheriting the real estate of testator, the escheat was effectual at the instant of testator\u2019s decease, and no enabling act could be rendered lawfully retroactive, to invest the society with power to take any real estate by previous devise, the invalidity of which, at the time, either rendered the real estate inheritable at the instant of death by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>heirs at law, or escheated to the State for want of such heirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">The only question which it is proper for me. to decide as to such real estate is, not, who are now vested with the title, or may enforce the-rights of any party now lawfully claiming the same, whether it be the society by such enabling act, or any individuals, otherwise claiming ; but simply whether the devise was valid, and if not valid, it would follow as a consequence that the testator died intestate as to such real estate. To entertain jurisdiction of what disposition is to be made of the same real estate, as claimed under that act, would be equivalent to trying the title to the real estate as between the society, not as devisees, but as subsequent grantees of the State, and others who may, or might, claim as heirs at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">I must, therefore, hold that the direct devise of the real estate to the society is invalid, and wholly inoperative by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">III. As to the validity and effect of the bequest of \u2022the personal property, which is as follows: [The learned surrogate here quoted the third paragraph of <em>(A2rxx.se fourth </em>of the will, which will be found on p. 180 above.]</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">It is claimed by counsel for two legatees under an alleged former will of testator, dated February 11,1871, (and which is now on file in this court, and propounded for probate, but not yet otherwise acted upon): That under its provisions there is an equitable conversion, at his decease, of the personal property of the testator into real estate for all the purposes of the instrument, and that he assumed to devise the entire property to an incorporated society, therein named :</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">That such incorporated society was not, at the time of the death of said Louis Bonard, or at any time prior thereto, authorized by law to take by devise :</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">That the disposition of the property in favor of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>society was for uses and upon trusts, which were unauthorized by law, and in contravention of the statutes in such case made and provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">That each disposition in said instrument which the testator assumed to make of his property of each kind and description was in contravention of the statutes prohibiting the suspension of the power of alienation of real estate, and of the absolute ownership of personal property, for periods not measured by lives in being, or by such lives and subsequent minorities:</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">That the revocation clause is invalid and inoperative, having been manifestly introduced only for the purpose of substituting, for his antecedent testamentary dispositions. which were mainly in favor of the same donee, the still more liberal provisions of this instrument, and, this object failing, by reason of the entire invalidity of the last intended disposition, the revocation clause falls with the devise to which it was subservient, and to effectuate which it was introduced :</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">And counsel for the consul-general of France, intervening for alleged foreign next of kin, claimed :</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">That the bequest, or so-called bequest, of personal property, is also null and void, and of no effect for the same reasons; said bequest being in fact and in law, by the terms of said instrument, a devise of real estate by reason of the directions in said instrument contained, to convert the said personalty into real estate :</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">That the several provisions in said pretended will, directing that the said property so pretended to be devised should be held for the uses and upon the trusts therein mentioned, and for undetermined and unlimited periods, are, and each of them is, void, as being contrary to the laws and statutes of the State of New York:</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">If the bequest above set forth stood alone, without any subsequent clauses referring to the personal property, there could be no doubt of its validity as an abso<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>lute gift: and this view, I believe, is not controverted by either of the contesting parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The uncertainty of its validity, however, arises from a subsequent clause, but not immediately folio wing'it; (one intervening), and all that follows such bequest in the will is in these words : [The learned surrogate here quoted the residue of the will beginning with the fourth paragraph of clause <em>fourth </em>which will bo found on p. 181, above.]</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">I therefore now proceed to consider the meaning and legal effect of the clause for the investment of money in <em>real estate property.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">In the first place I am satisfied that the clause under which the doctrine of equitable conversion into real estate is claimed, is not limited to the moneys or sums of money left by the testatator, but extends to, and embraces all moneys, whatsoever,, which may, under the will, arise from any portion of the personal property of the testator ; as the language is plain and explicit as' referring to moneys arising./rom <em>any source </em>by virtue of the will. These emphatic words leave no doubt of the testator's intention in respect to the character or meaning of the terms, \u201cmoney or sums of money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">The next, and, indeed, primary question concerning the effect of the clause for the investment of moneys in real estate property, is, whether, under it, there was an equitable conversion, at testator\u2019s decease, of the said personal property into real estate ; the argument being, that, if there was such a conversion into real estate, the society, being incapable by law of taking real estate by devise, therefore the bequest under which it is claimed the direction so to convert or invest, was given, is\u2019void and inoperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">It is my judgment that there was not such an equitable conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-10\">In the case of Wright <em>v. </em>Trustees Meth. E. Ch. <em>(Hofman, 202), </em>it is said: \u201cIf the purposes for which a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>sale of real estate is directed by will are illegal, there is no conversion.\u201d \u201cThe real and personal property were blended into one fund by a direction that the former should be sold and the latter collected, and the whole applied to the payment of the debts and legacies, and the residue was given by the will to certain corporations : <em>Held, </em>that there was no conversion of the realty (as regards the surplus), the corporations being inca,pable of taking the land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">So, applying the principle of that case to this will, it would certainly seem to follow that if the society in question, was incapable of taking land, in which the personalty was directed to be invested, 'then, as to the-legatee, there was .not an equitable conversion,\u2014and the direction so to invest is inoperative and void ; and that the society, for whose use and benefit the investment was ordered to be made, would take the personalty <em>as. such, </em>under the direct bequest of the same, bv another clause of the will, in the same manner as if the inoperative subsequent direction had not been inserted; whether the same be regarded as creating an implied trust which can not lawfully be fulfilled, or as only a direction void in law, even if not invalid for repugnancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The legal estate of the personal property was not, by the will, in terms, vested in the executors, who were ordered so to invest it in real estate property. It was a naked direction, unless it can be maintained that the testator intended to invest them with the title to the personalty, or created an express trust of such personalty in the executors, or an implied trust, for the uses and purposes mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Aside from the fact that the clause in question, did not immediately follow the previous absolute bequest to the society, it is noticeable, and not immaterial, that the intervening clause related solely, to the real estate specifically devised and particularly before described ; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>and the clause relating to the investment of moneys in real estate property is one which commences with the words \u201cI will and order\u201d that all moneys or sums of money which may be so coming <em>to the said society, </em>from any source, &amp;c., shall be invested, &amp;c., thus referring to the absolute ownership before given; and I am now asked, so to construe the directions there given as to investment, that if the same can not be lawfully made in <em>real estate property, </em>for the sole, exclusive and perpetual use, benefit and enjoyment of the said society, that the preceding bequest, absolute in its terms, shall fall with such unlawful directions for investment.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Where a direction to invest the proceeds of land, in land, fails from illegality, they are still regarded as land, and pass to the heir and not to the residuary estate (Thorn <em>v. </em>Coles, 3 <em>Edwards Ch., </em>330): and, on principle, it is the same as to personal property directed to be invested in land ; if the direction so to invest in land fails from illegality ; it is still regarded as personalty, passing to the next of kin, if not otherwise disposed of or bequeathed under other clauses of the will; and this qualification applies, equally, to the doctrine of the case last cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">I am unable to discover that the clause for such investment has tha.t great importance ; or that any good reason can be assigned, that could have induced the testator to render the gift, first expressed as absolute, actually dependent upon the subsequent clause; for that would be directly in conflict with the general scope and theory of the will, and would, contrary to his intention, render him intestate as to the personalty, in case the last clause failed; neither can I perceive any good reason to suppose that he should, any the more, have intended to create a perpetual trust in real estate under the clause directing such investments in real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>estate, than that he so intended, as to the lands which he specifically devised directly to the society.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">If the personal property had been directly bequeathed to the execntors, <em>in trust, </em>for the purpose of investment as aforesaid, and there had been no direct bequest to the society, I should not hesitate to pronounce the directions of such investment unlawful, and consequently that such bequest, in trust, would fall with it; as the doctrine of equitable conversion would then apply to it, and the validity of the trust would depend upon the capacity of the society to take real estate by devise ; because the law would not permit them to take indirectly, what they could not take directly ; and even if they could take by devise, the devise would be subject to the question of absolute restriction against alienation by the society, if the preceding clause, referring to the specific real estate devised, applied to the subject of such equitable conversion, which seems to have been claimed on the argument; but, it must be noticed that the restriction contained in the vrill against alienation of real estate, in its terms, refers only to \u201csaid real property,\u201d meaning, evidently, the lands before particularly described.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Or, if the testator had employed any words in the clause directing such investment, to show, plainly, his intention that the preceding bequest was conditional upon the directions so given, there might be stronger reason for interpreting the directions as creating a trust; but the clause is without words necessarily importing a trust, or is not so clear, as implying one to be created or intended, that any forced construction should be given to it, which should, or might, defeat and subvert the absolute character of the general bequest of the society. There is certainly no trust created by express words, and none is clearly implied, and if neither is the case, the directions for investment in real estate property should be observed and performed, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>they can lawfully be ; but if not, the main purpose and intentions of the testator as to the disposition of his personal property, before absolutely given to the society, should .stand, and courts should seek to effectuate the testator\u2019s intentions, as they may be ascertained from the whole instrument, and not to defeat them. The intentions of a testator are, of course, to be ascertained from an examination of the entire paper, as he executes it; without reference to the validity or invalidity of any of its provisions, for he is not supposed, or presumed, to doubt that effect may be given to all if, contains. It is for the courts to determine whether to all, or to what part; but, so far as the construction of any part depends on testator\u2019s intention, it is to be ascertained, and can only be, by a view of the whole instrument ;\u25a0 for that purpose, assuming validity of all its provisions. In this case, it is, in the first place, obvious that t.ho testator intended that none of his relatives near or remote, should share in his estate, real or personal, for no mention is made of any of them, or any provision direct or contingent for their benefit. Next, it is plain that ihe society referred to should be the only beneficiary of his estate} real and personal. No mention is made of any other, to take directly or indirectly, absolutely or contingently. His primary motive, and the pervading purpose <em>of </em>the instrument, throughout, was that the society named should have, use, and enjoy, for its corporate purposes, whatsoever property of any kind or description he should leave at his death. He so expressed himself in unequivocal words in the devise of the real estate, and the bequest of the personalty. He created no trust of the specific realty described, in his <em>executors, for </em>the benefit of the society ; he did not withhold from them the legal title to it, giving them only the equitable use; but he, in express terms, intrusted and devised it directly to them ; and the only peculiar lea hire of that devise, if, indeed, there is that to <em>be </em>said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>of it, in a legal sense, was, that the society should not alienate the real estate so specifically given to it; but this, if expressive of more than a desire, wish, or recommendation that the real estate should not be alienated, only confirms the singleness of his purpose, that the society should, for its corporate objects, be the sole recipient and possessor of his real estate, and if such was the unreserved or direct control which he intended to confer on the society, by the direct devise of the real estate of which he died seized, there is no <em>presumption </em>to be entertained that lie intended any the less to give the society the direct title to his personal estate and control over the same, and, therefore, no intention to fetter, or expose to defeat, the absolute character of the general bequest, except so far, if at all, as he, in express and unequivocal terms, by the subsequent clause, provided that the title to, or possession of, the personalty should be intercepted or withheld from the society by means of an express trust, or terms of prohibition or restriction against such actual possession of the personal estate ; and if the construction claimed by contestants, of the clause for the investment of the personalty into real estate property is sound in law, it is difficult to harmonize it with the absolute bequest before made, if such construction is that a trust in the executors was created for the perpetual benefit of the society; for if so, there is the incongruity or contradiction of an unqualified gift entitling the legatee to the ownership and possession of the personalty, and a subsequent clause creating a trust which, in effect, declares that the society shall have neither title nor possession, but only the use of its income : no such contradiction or\u00edn consistency of intention of a testator, can be presumed \u25a0or entertained of a rational person, unless on the supposition that his mind was changed as he proceeded in ihe declaration of his will.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">My conclusions on this portion of the case are : that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>the direct bequest of the personal estate to the society is valid as an absolute gift; that the subsequent clause under which the doubt has arisen, does not create a trust in perpetuity as real estate, by conversion ; that such last clause amounted only to a direction which was to be executed if i t could lawfully be, so as to vest the personalty converted into real estate, in the society ; that the prospect that the investment could lawfully be so made, does not seem to be the only or principal consideration that induced the testator to make the bequest ; that as the testator had not vested the real estate before specifically devised, in the executors, as trustees, for the benefit of the society, but devised it directly to the society, he, probably no less intended that the real estate in which he directed the personalty to be invested, should be taken by the executors in the name of the society, and not in their names as trustees, and therefore, as well as for other reasons above stated, the clause in question relating to investments does not defeat, but is, or may be fulfilled, in furtherance, and in execution, of the general scheme of the will, apparent from all other parts of it; that as the society could not thus take the bequest in the converted form of real estate, the clause became inoperative, and left the general bequest to take effect as an unconditional and independent gift; and 1 hat if an implied trust was created by the particular clause relating to investments in real estate, it was repugnant to the previous absolute gift, and therefore void ; or, if not so repugnant, but, as an implied trust., could not be lawfully executed, the implied trust falls, and still leaves the previous clause of bequest operative, as necessary to carry out the obvious general intention of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">IY. As to the legal effect of the. revocation clause in the will in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">It was urged by the counsel for the two legatees Walter Jones and William H. Bell, named in the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>instrument, purporting to be a will of earlier date, that the revocation clause in the paper now under discussion, was introduced by testator, only for the purpose of substituting for his antecedent testamentary dispositions in favor of said society, the more liberal provisions of the last, that is to say, of the whole real and personal estate ; and that such object failing, by reason of the entire invalidity of the last instrument, the revocation clause falls with the devise and bequest to which it was subservient, and to effectuate which it was incorporated.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The point so taken by the counsel for the two legatees named in the prior instrument, was maintained on the argument, on account of its importance, in case, and assuming that, it should be determined that the bequest of the personal estate of the testator, as well as the devise, in the will of later date, was void, so that no property of either description would pass under it, and thus (excepting the appointment of executors), leave only the revocation clause standing for consideration. The question would, in that event, be quite a difficult one to decide ; but it is apparent that, from my determination of the validity of the bequest, it is unnecessary to investigate the authorities cited by the learned counsel for those legatees: as a later will bequeathing the testator\u2019s entire personalty, absolutely, and in a form free and clear of all legacies to third persons, is, by the law of this State, <em>ipso facto, </em>a revocation of all former wills of or affecting the same personal estate ; and, consequently, by my decision of the bequest to the society as valid, the legacies in the previous instrument, given to Messrs. Jones and Bell, which could, thereunder, be enforced only against the personalty, are in legal effect annulled, wholly irrespective of the existence or legal effect of an express revocation clause, which, in this case, and with my view of the last bequest, only made express, what was, without it, a legal consequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Before concluding my opinion, it is proper to present some well established cardinal principles, and decisions in particular cases, which have aided and guided me in my determination, and may be usefully cited as applicable to the questions arising on the bequest before discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Courts should rather strain, to prevent the divesting of an estate, though not to give an estate that never vested.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">An implied intent, or a doubtful implication of different intent, that can not be lawfully effectuated, should give way to and be controlled by, clauses which are express and clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\"><em>In </em>Schettler Smith (41 N. <em>Y. </em>329), Daniels, J., said: \u201cThe will, the construction and effect of which are in controversy, was clearly intended to make a full and final disposition of all the estate, real and personal. Its general tenor and meaning, as well as the particular provisions, devises and bequests made of the property, very clearly show that to have been the design and intent of the testator. And this circumstance must be prominently observed and considered in determining the effect of particular terms and phrases, which standing by themselves, may not be entirely consistent with the execution for that purpose (3 Burrows, 1626).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">\u201cAnd it was stated in terms of similar import by the \u25a0chancellor, in deciding the case of Bond <em>v. </em>Bergh, (10 Paige, 140, 152). He there declares that the intent of the testator, so far as it Is consistent with the rules of law, must, govern in the construction of a will. When, therefore, the intention is apparent upon tho whole will, taken together, the court must give such a construction as to support the intent of the testator, \u25a0even against strict grammatical rules. The observance of this principle is important in this case [Schettler], in view of the circumstances already referred to, that the will renders it entirely clear that the testator did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>intend to die intestate as to any portion of his estate, and that intention should be maintained by the construction given to the different clauses in the will,, if that can practicably be done, consistently with the language he has made use of in framing them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">In general, implication is admissible only in the absence of, and not to control, an express disposition <em>(Rule </em>11, <em>Jarman on Wills ; </em>Dyer, 330 b.; 8 <em>Rep. </em>94 ; 2 Vern., 60 ; IP. <em>Wms., </em>54).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Words, in general, are to be taken in their ordinary and grammatical sense, unless a clear intention to use them in another can be collected <em>(Jarman ; </em>also 18 <em>Ves </em>, 466 ; 4 <em>C. B. N. S., </em>791), and that, other can be ascertained, and they are in all cases to receive a construction which will give to every expression some effect, rather than one that will render any of the expressions inoperative (3 <em>Ves., </em>450 ; 7 <em>Id., </em>458 ; 7 <em>East, </em>272 ; 2 <em>B. &amp; A., </em>441) ; and of the two modes of construction, that is to be preferred which will prevent a total intestacy <em>(Cas. t. Talb., </em>161; 4 <em>Ves.. </em>406; 2 <em>Mer., </em>386).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">In Parks v. Parks (9 <em>Paige, </em>107), it is stated that the intention of a testator, as to the disposition of his property, by will, is not to be defeated where such intention can be ascertained upon a careful examination of the whole will, and that intention is not inconsistent with the rules of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">Where a testators intention can not operate to its full extent, it shall take effect as far as possible <em>(Rule </em>13, <em>Jarman; Finch, </em>139; 4 <em>Ves., </em>325; 13 <em>Id., </em>486&gt;.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">It is a well settled principle of law, that where a will contains distinct and independent provisions devising different portions of the testator\u2019s property, or distinct-estates or interests in the same portions of the property-, some of which provisions are consistent and others inconsistent with the rules of law, the former will be permitted to stand, although the latter are declared to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>illegal and void, except where they are so dependent on each other that they can not be separated.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">A testator is rather to be presumed to calculate on the dispositions in bis will taking effect, than the contrary <em>(Rule </em>24, <em>Jarman). </em>It was said in Jenkins <em>v. </em>Hughes (8 <em>H. L. Cas., </em>571; 6 <em>Jur. </em>N. <em>S. </em>1043), that whether a general intent or a particular intent expressed in a will is to prevail, must depend on the context of the whole will, in construing which the words of a technical kind are not necessarily to receive a technical meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Full effect should be given to the particular intent, as well as to the general intent of the testator, so far as his particular intent can be ascertained by the will, and as is consistent with the rules of law, and with his general intent; which general intent must control in a will (Parks <em>v. </em>Parks, 9 <em>Paige, </em>107).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">It is necessary to give full effect to special intentions of a testator, so far as they can be ascertained by the will and are consistent with the rules of law, as well as to his general intention as to the disposition of bis property after his death. The rule of construction in such cases is to give effect to the whole of the language of the testator in expressing his particular intent, <em>provided </em>it is not inconsistent with the general construction of the will (1 <em>Roberts on Wills </em>[3 <em>Lond. Ed] </em>356; Dawes <em>v. </em>Swan, 4 <em>Mass. </em>208).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">There is no rule of more universal application, both here and in England, that the plain and unambiguous words of the will must prevail, and are not to be controlled or qualified by any conjectural or doubtful constructions growing out of the situation, circumstances or condition, either of the testator, his property, or his family (Bunner <em>v. </em>Storm, 1 <em>Sandf. Ch., </em>357; Mann <em>v. </em>Mann, 14 <em>Johns., </em>1; Parsons <em>v. </em>Winslow, 6 <em>Mass., </em>175 ; Dawes <em>v. </em>Swan, 4 <em>Mass., </em>208).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">1 here is, perhaps, no rule of construction of more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>universal application to wills, or which oftener requires tobe acted upon, than that every portion of the instrument must be made to have its just operation, unless there arises some invincible repugnance, or else some portion is absolutely unintelligible (Norris v. Beyea, 13 <em>N. Y, </em>273, 283).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">In Chrystie v. Phyfe (19 N. <em>Y., </em>344), Strong, J., states the leading doctrines applicable to the construction of wills in a very clear and forcible manner; as that the language used shall receive its ordinary interpretation, except where some other is necessarily or clearly indicated; and where words are equivocal, that meaning shall be adopted which will tend to preserve consistency, in preference to one which will create inconsistency, and, if possible, some effect shall be given to each distinct provision of the will, rather than it should be annihilated (1 <em>Redfield on Wills, </em>432 ; Hone v. Van Schaick, 3 N. <em>Y., </em>538; 3 <em>Barb. Ch., </em>488 ; 3 <em>Brad. Surr., </em>230; 16 <em>Barb., </em>412; 13 N. <em>Y, </em>98).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">In 35 <em>N. Y., </em>162, the court affirms the rule, that it is proper to incline towards such a view as will render the instrument legal and operative, rather than the opposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">If the words of the will be such that they may be construed in two different senses, one of which would render the disposition made of the property illegal and void, and the other would render it valid, the court should give that construction to the language that will make the disposition of the property effectual (Butler v. Butler, 3 <em>Barb. Ch., </em>310; Mason <em>v. </em>Jones, 2 <em>Barb., </em>230).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">A clearly expressed intention in one portion of the will, is not to yield to a doubtful construction in any other portion of the instrument (Corrigan <em>v. </em>Kiernan, 1 <em>Brad. Surr. </em>208 ; Brown v. Lyon, 6 N. <em>Y., </em>419).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">When the testator\u2019s general or primary intention appears, the court, in order to give it effect, would sacri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>fice to it a particular or secondary intention inconsistent with it (Lovett <em>v. </em>Kingsland, 44 <em>Barb., </em>567, and cases cited).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">In Kane <em>v. </em>Astor (5 <em>Sandf., </em>467), it was held, that in construing a will, the court must give full effect to every part of it, if lawful, and to single words as well as to sentences and paragraphs. But it is a permanent principle that the court shall carry out the general intent of the testator ; and where a particular word or sentence is repugnant to the general intent and design of the whole will, or tends to render it incongruous or insensible, such word or sentence must give way, rather than sacrifice the whole scheme of disposition disclosed by the general tenor of the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">It is true, as a general rule, that where a gift or trust is void by statute, as a disposition in favor of persons or objects prohibited from taking, or in a manner forbidden, as in violation of statute, or where the gift contravenes some policy of the law, as tending to a perpetuity, a trust to the extent of the estate given, will will result to the donor or his heirs, or legal representatives, <em>but only so, if it is not otherwise disposed of.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">In Webb <em>v. </em>Wools, (2 <em>Sim. N. S., </em>267), Kendersley, V. G., said, \u201cWhere the later words of a sentence in a will go to cut down an absolute gift, contained in the first part of a sentence and are inconsistent with such gift, the court will, if it can, give effect to the absolute gift.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">If two parts or provisions of a will are repugnant, so that both can not stand, the last will prevail, <em>unless other parts </em>of the will forbid it (Bradstreet <em>v. </em>Clark, 12 <em>Wend., </em>602; Covenhoven <em>v. </em>Shuler, 2 <em>Paige, </em>122 <em>; </em>Mason <em>v. </em>Jones, 2 <em>Barb., </em>229; Parks v. Parks, 9 <em>Paige, </em>107 ; Leggett <em>v. </em>Perkins, 2 <em>Comstock, </em>207, 306).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">A subsequent clause, apparently irreconcilable with precedent provisions, will be construed in connection with them, and may be rejected, if repugnant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>intention of the testator as derived from the whole will (Bradley <em>v. </em>Amidon, 10 Paige, 235).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">It sometimes happens in wills that there are clauses inconsistent with each other, in which case both can not take effect. In such a case it becomes the duty of the court to select one ox the other. In analogy to the fact that the last will of a testator is to prevail in preference to the earlier one, the courts have adopted from necessity a similar rule, and treated the subsequent words in the will as indicating a subsequent intention <em>unless, indeed, there be other expressions in the will which malee it apparent that the first should ialce effect </em>(Sims <em>v. </em>Doughty, 5 Vesey, <em>Jr., </em>247; Constantine v. Constantine, 6 <em>Id., </em>102 ; Parks <em>v. </em>Parks, 9 Paige, 124 Dawes <em>v. </em>Swan, 4 <em>Mass., </em>215; Sweet <em>v: </em>Chase, 2 <em>Comstock, </em>73, per Ruggles, J).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">A bequest to a man, generally, of money or personal property is an absolute legacy, and in such a case a subsequent <em>direction </em>to the executors to put the money at interest for the support of the legatee does not in any manner revoke or qualify the gift. It merely relates to the investment, and being inconsistent with the absolute title before given to the legatee, it is null and void. Fo valid qualification can be attached to a full title to personal property (Dorland <em>v. </em>Dorland, <em>2 Barb.\u00bb </em>65).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">In Beck <em>v. </em>McGrill, 9 <em>Barb., </em>35, the devise was to a married woman for life, \u201c subject to the powers and limitations therein expressed,\u201d followed by an appointment of her husband as trustee \u201cto take possession of the property so devised, receive the rents and apply the same to her use during her life, as she should direct; \u201d and by a codicil, other property was devised to her for life, \u201c subject to the same restrictions, limitations and powers in trust specified in my will.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that the-power being inconsistent with the devise was void, and that the devisee took an unshackled estate for life.</p>\n<p id=\"AFM\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>When an absolute interest is given to the legatee, a devise over is void for repugnancy (11 <em>Wend., 275).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\"><em>No </em>precise form of words is necessary to create a \u25a0condition in wills. But whenever the intention of the testator is <em>clearly </em>manifested that the legacy should depend on a condition, and the <em>condition </em>is <em>not repugnant </em>to the estate or <em>contrary </em>to the <em>rules </em>of law, the intention will be carried into effect <em>(Shep. Touch., </em>433; Pink v. Thuisey, 2 <em>Mad., </em>157).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">If a legacy is given upon the performance of a condition subsequent, which is illegal, the rule at common law, and by the civil law adopted in courts of equity, is the same, and the condition is void and the legacy is <em>absolute, freed </em>from the <em>condition </em>and is as if <em>no condition </em>had been annexed to it. It is upon this principle that conditions and <em>qualifications inconsistent with </em>and <em>repugno/nt to </em>the gift, are wholly void and are to be \u25a0rejected. This rule is well illustrated by a case decided by Lord Alvawley, Master of the Rolls. Lord A. said : \u201cI find it laid down as a rule, long ago established, that where there is a gift with a condition inconsistent with and repugnant to such gift, the <em>condition </em>is wholly void. A condition that tenant in fee shall not aliene is repugnant, and there are many other cases of the same sort. In all these cases the gift stands, and the condition or exception is rejected\u201d (Bradley v. Peixot, 3 <em>Vesey, </em>324; Schermerhorny. Negus, 1 <em>Denio, </em>448).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">If a good bequest is made to a legatee, subject to an illegal or void direction to accumulate, as where such direction is <em>independently </em>engrafted upon the bequest, and can be stricken out without destroying the substantial form of the gift, the gift may be held to be good, but the direction to accumulate void (Haxton v.

If the witness was the medical attendant ol the person whose capacity is in question, or has adequately examined him, he may testify to his opinion as to such person's capacity, especially if his opinion is given in connection with his statement of the facts of the person\u2019s condition. For recent illustrations of this method, see People <em>v. </em>Montgomery, (13 <em>Abb. Pr. N. S., </em>207); Macfarland\u2019s Trial, (8 <em>Id., </em>57). 2. Amedical expert who has heard all the testimony adduced upon the trial hearing upon the mental condition, may give his opinion on the question of what the facts proved or claimed to be proved, indicate as to the mental condition (see People v. Lake, 12 <em>N. Y. </em>(2 <em>Kern.) </em>358; affirming 1 <em>Park. Cr., 495). </em>3. A medical expert, may be asked what a supposed state of facts put to him hypothetically, but corresponding in details to the facts already in evidence on the trial, would indicate as to the mental condition. <em>Ib, </em>The case in the text is an instance of the latter method.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
