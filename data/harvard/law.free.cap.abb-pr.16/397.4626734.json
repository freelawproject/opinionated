Abbot against the American Hard Bubber Go. and others, the plaintiff obtained an injunction, which, among other things, restrained the defendants Poppenhusen <em>&amp; </em>ELonig from paying notes to the amount of $27,000, which they had given to the company in payment of a transfer of property, effected, as it was claimed, in fraud of the rights of the plaintiff. The parties subsequently agreed upon an order settling the principles upon which final judgment should be rendered, but the actual'judgment had not been given. William B. Bristol, a trustee in insolvency of the Bubber Co., appointed by the Probate Court of Bethany, Connecticut, under the laws of that State, without becoming a party to the action, applied for a modification of the injunction \u00bb so as to allow these notes to be paid to him. His petition was denied <em>(Ante, </em>184), and the petitioner appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b414-6\"><em>Thomas G. Shearman, </em>for the respondent, claimed that the appeal should be dismissed. Ho one but a party to the action can appeal, even from an order denying his motion.
