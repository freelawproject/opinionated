Klinken. At the trial, the jury found a verdict for plaintiff for fifty dollars. The court allowed the defendant thirty days to make a case, and ordered that all plaintiff\u2019s proceedings be stayed in the mean time, except that he be at liberty to enter judgment. Judgment was entered February 5,1863, and on the following day the plaintiff served notice of the entry of judgment. The defendant served notice of appeal on March 9th. Plaintiff now moved to dismiss the appeal, as not taken within thirty days.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b126-6\"><em>Gideon L. </em>Walker, for the motion..</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b126-7\"><em>Nelson </em>Smith, opposed.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AW\">Inasmuch as plaintiff\u2019s proceedings, except to enter judgment, were stayed, the notice of entry of judgment was a nullity, and did not limit the time to appeal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b126-8\">[Olerke, J.\u2014But is a notice of judgment a proceeding in the action ?]</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b126-9\">It certainly is, and a very important one too, as it limits the time within which to bring an appeal.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b125-9\"> In the case of White <em>a. </em>Smith <em>{Supreme Court, First District; at Chambers, December, </em>1862), it was <em>Hdd, </em>that a stay of proceedings does not operate as an extension of the time to answer ; and that an application to be let in to defend the merits cannot be entertained on the application of plaintiff for the relief demanded after failure to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"AW4\">Application for judgment on failure to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"Aodd\">This action was brought by Lewis White against Milton G. Smith and another. The summons was for relief. The summons and complaint were served on the defendants on the 23d of August, 1862. The plaintiff was a non-resident. On the 30th of August an order was made that plaintiff file security for costs. Such security was given on the 19th of September. The defendants excepted, and the sureties justified on the 18th October. On the 22d October defendants served their answer, which the plaintiff returned. No order extending time to answer had been made, unless the stay of proceedings accompanying the order to file security effected such extension. The plaintiff now applied, on notice of eight days, for the relief demanded in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"AEX\"><em>Jonathan S. Slauson, </em>for the plaintiff.\u2014I. The stay of proceedings until security is filed does not extend the time to answer. (14 <em>How.

J. (orally).</author>\n<p id=\"Ad4\">We are all of opinion that the order staying the plaintiff\u2019s proceedings prevented the giving notice of the judgment, and that such notice was a nullity. The defendant\u2019s time to appeal has not been limited, and the motion to dismiss must be denied, but without costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b126-11\"> Present, Sutherland, P.
