Pettengill recovered judgment against Robert E. Mather, for $1,536.08. Subsequently the plaintiff obtained an order for leave to issue an execution against the person of the defendant, which was affirmed by the general term. (12 <em>Ante, </em>436.) Execution was accordingly issued, and the defendant gave bail for the jail limits. In March, 1862, the plaintiff consented, in writing, that the sheriff should release the defendant from imprisonment. In June, 1863, the defendant\u2019s attorney demanded of the plaintiff a satisfaction of the judgment; but made no offer to pay the expense of such satisfaction. The plaintiff declined to give a satisfaction of the judgment. The judgment had never been paid, unless the imprisonment and release constituted payment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Defendant\u2019s motion, that plaintiff be required to satisfy the judgment was denied by Mr. Justice Barnard, and the present appeal was taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b417-5\"><em>Cornelius </em>Fiske, for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqe7\">cited 7 <em>Cow., </em>276; 8 <em>Id., </em>173; 3 <em>Wend., </em>186; 5 <em>Johns., </em>364; 20 <em>How.

Hanson, James McBrair, Jr., Eliza Marshall, and six others. The judgment in the case constituted and appointed the plaintiff trustee under the will of James McBrair, deceased, and provided for the leasing of certain unimproved property belonging to the trust-estate, and ordered \u201cthat the parties having estates in remainder do join in such leases of unimproved lands the two defendants against whom this motion was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>made, were <em>among those </em>having estates in remainder in the lands. The affidavits upon which the motion was made, stated that a lease drawn in pursuance of the judgment had been shown to James McBrair, Jr., and Eliza Marshall, that they were informed that such lease was in the form required by the judgment; that they had each refused to execute it.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah2\">The defendants, in their affidavits, each denied having any knowledge of the judgment or lease until the same were served on them with the notice of motion.</p>\n<p id=\"Acu\"><em>Jonathan Nathan, </em>for the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"Akx\"><em>Oliver Dyer, </em>opposed.\u2014I. In order to sustain the motion, it is necessary for the mover to show affirmatively that the parties sought to he attached, had personal knowledge of the \u201c lawful order and decree,\u201d at the time they were required to perform. In the very nature and essence of things, <em>contempt </em>implies <em>knowledge of the thing contemned. </em>Therefore, there can he no contempt until the party knows that he <em>is </em>ordered and <em>what </em>he is commanded to do, and <em>when </em>and <em>under what dream-stances </em>he is to do it.</p>\n<p id=\"A4l\">II. The controlling papers on the motion are the veiy ones on which the demand was made ; nothing else is admissible in the argument, except affidavits of demand and service. The moving papers do not show that the defendants had been served at or before the time of the demand with any of the papers necessary to lay a foundation for this motion, and our affidavits are explicit in negation of all knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"AoZ\">Barnard, J.\u2014To put the parties in contempt, a certified copy of the judgment and a copy of the lease which they are required to execute, should be served upon them a reasonable time for them to examine the same before a peremptory demand for the execution of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"AqjY\">The papers do not show such service.</p>\n<p id=\"A1e\">Motion denied without prejudice to a renewal after such service shall have been made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b417-9\">By the Court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014Leonard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQ6\">The order appealed from should be affirmed; The defendant is entitled to the benefit of the discharge only as a defence to future legal proceedings against him. He was also bound, if entitled to a satisfaction, to prepare it and attend the plaintiff with it, and offer to pay the expense of its execution. The authorities cited, do not bear out the defendant\u2019s proposition. In most of the cases cited, the judgments sought to be satisfied of record, have been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-10\">Order affirmed with costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b417-11\"> Present, Sutherland, P.
