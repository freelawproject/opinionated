The Tax Court did not agree, nor do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">26 U.S.C. \u00a7 117(b) (1) excludes from gross income the amounts received by an individual who is a candidate for a degree who renders teaching, research, or other services <em>only </em>if those services are required of all candidates for a particular degree as a condition to receiving that degree. The Tax Court found that such services rendered by Kreis for which he received taxable compensation were not a requirement for his degree and the facts sustaining this finding are set forth in Judge Kern\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
