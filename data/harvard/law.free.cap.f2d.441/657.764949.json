Evans, 400 U.S. 74, 91 S.Ct. 210, 27 L.Ed.2d 213, reversing the judgment of this court in Evans v. Dutton, 400 F.2d 826 (5th Cir. 1968), the cause was remanded to this court for consideration of other issues presented in this habeas corpus proceeding. The Supreme Court dealt only with the evidentiary and and confrontation issues involved in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-34\">On oral argument before the Supreme Court it was conceded that the death penalty imposed could not be carried out, because the jury was qualified under standards violative of Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 20 L.Ed.2d 776.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See Dutton v. Evans, 400 U.S. 74, 91 S.Ct. 210, 27 L.Ed.2d 213 note 20. Prior to that time this court had already set aside, pursuant to the <em>Witherspoon </em>decision, the death sentence imposed in the companion case involving Vincent Williams, an alleged accomplice of Evans. See Williams v. Dutton, 5 Cir., 400 F.2d 797, 804-805. Accordingly, there has been appropriate disposition of the <em>Witherspoon </em>issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-35\">We have carefully reviewed all other issues presented to the court and it is our judgment that such issues have been dealt with fully and were properly disposed of in our decision in Williams v. Dutton, 400 F.2d 797 (5th Cir. 1968). We adhere to our decision in that case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>See also United States ex rel. Williams v.
