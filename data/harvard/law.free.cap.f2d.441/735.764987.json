The only contacts of the defendant newspaper with the State of Florida in the whole of the year in which process was served were the sale of between 10,000 and 11,000 individual copies of newspapers to unsolicited subscribers and the sale of 38,601 dollars worth of advertising space to unsolicited advertisers. The percentage of circulation in Florida of defendant, as compared to its total circulation, was 0.15% for the Sunday paper and .008% for the daily paper. The advertising revenue from Florida amounted to less than .153% of the newspaper\u2019s total advertising revenues and the Florida advertising lineage was less than .091% of the total.
