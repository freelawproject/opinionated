Plaintiff contends that while the defendant was admittedly a judge at the time of the alleged violation, the district court erred in holding that his acts were covered by the judicial immunity defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-12\">The allegations of the complaint do not negative the fair inference that the defendant acted on the belief that plaintiff was not seeking to commence a legal action but, rather, desired an investigation of the conditions under which he was being held. In these circumstances, we do not view the judge\u2019s action in referring the petition to a probation officer . as being beyond the ambit of the judicial immunity doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-14\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
