Upon appeal, Oakerum contends: (1) that the registration provisions of the Act are an unconstitutional infringement upon the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination; (2) that the evidence was insufficient to show possession or interstate transportation of the firearm in question; and (3) that the sentences were excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-11\">Appellant\u2019s constitutional challenge to the Act has been foreclosed by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in United States v. Freed, 401 U.S. 601, 91 S.Ct. 1112, 28 L.Ed.2d 356 (1971), wherein the Court held that the Act <em>does not </em>violate the self-incrimination provision of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-12\">We find no merit in appellant\u2019s other contentions. Clearly there was sufficient evidence to show possession and interstate transportation of the firearm. The sentences imposed were well within the statutory limits and there is no reason to disturb them as we perceive no abuse of discretion by the sentencing court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
