The jury returned a verdict of guilty on both counts, and on January 23, 1970, defendant Foy was sentenced to two concurrent terms of 15 years, and defendant Moss was sentenced to two concurrent terms of 17% years. Defendants now appeal from these convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Subsequent to the conviction and sentencing of defendants in this case our court rendered its opinion in United States v. White, 5 Cir. 1971, 440 F.2d 978. In <em>White </em>we held that subsections (a) and (d) of section 2113 did not create separate offenses but rather created different maximum punishments for a single offense. Thus, we found that the imposition of separate penalties under subsections (a) and (d), even if concurrent, was improper even though \u201cthe consummated crime under one subsection may well include the lesser or more aggravated offenses under other subsections,\u201d so that \u201ca single defendant may theoretically have violated more than one subsection.\u201d Where multiple penalties have been imposed, as in the instant case, we held that the proper remedy was \u201cto vacate the sentences and remand for resentencing on one count.\u201d In accordance with the decision in <em>White </em>we therefore vacate each concurrent sentence and remand the case to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Defendants have raised numerous additional errors which they contend require a new trial. Thus, defendants argue that the trial court erred (1) by limiting the scope of defendants\u2019 cross-examination during an in camera hearing on the propriety of certain photographic identifications; (2) by conducting the questioning of prospective jurors on voir dire rather than permitting the questioning to be done by opposing counsel; and (3) by refusing to conduct a broader investigation into defendants\u2019 allegations of jury misconduct. We have carefully considered the briefs and record and find all of these contentions to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">The sentences of conviction are therefore vacated and the case is remanded to the district court for the resentencing of each defendant on one count.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">Vacated and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
