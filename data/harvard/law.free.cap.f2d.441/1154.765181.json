At the time the action was dismissed Hanvey was a prisoner at the New Jersey State Prison at Rahway. The complaint is brought under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343(3) and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and it seeks to remedy the alleged arbitrary and unconstitutional withholding of good time credits by prison officials who transferred Hanvey from one prison job to another, which afforded him less of an opportunity to earn good time credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-15\">While it is essential to prove in any action \u2022 brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 that federally protected rights have been violated, this court cannot eon-elude that the transfer of an inmate of a state prison from one wing to another and the consequent change of prison jobs involved any federally protected rights. Discipline reasonably maintained in state prisons is not under the supervision of federal courts unless such actions are so severe as to require constitutional protections. Ford v. Board of Managers of N. J. State Prison, 407 F.2d 937 (3d Cir. 1969); Gurczynski v. Yeager, 339 F.2d 884 (3d Cir. 1964). In addition, the alleged denial of good time credit as evidenced in this case is a far cry from those \u201ccruel\u201d and \u201cinhuman\u201d acts which cross the imaginary line from permitted to prohibited types of prison discipline. See, Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 78 S.Ct. 590, 2 L.Ed.2d 630 (1958); Burns v. Swenson, 430 F.2d 771 (8th Cir. 1970); Church v. Hegstrom, 416 F.2d 449 (2d Cir. 1969); Wright v. McMann, 387 F.2d 519 (2d Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-18\">The order of the district court dismissing the appellant\u2019s action will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
