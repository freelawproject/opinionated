Both parties were invited to file supplemental briefs, and both have done so. Upon reconsideration, we conclude that on the basis of the facts then known to him, Sergeant Connolly had neither probable cause to arrest Williams nor any other sufficient cause for reaching into Williams\u2019s waistband, an action which led to the subsequent search of Williams\u2019s car and the discovery of a machete and narcotics later introduced in evidence at Williams\u2019s trial. See Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1969); Spinelli v. United States, 393 U.S. 410, 89 S.Ct. 584, 21 L.d.2d 637 (1969); Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723 (1964); Henry v. United States, 361 U.S. 98, 80 S.Ct. 168, 4 L.Ed.2d 134 (1959); Draper v. United States, 358 U.S. 307, 79 S.Ct. 329, 3 L.Ed.2d 327 (1959). Since those illegally seized items should have been excluded from evidence, Williams\u2019s conviction must be set aside. Accordingly, we reverse the order of the district court denying Williams\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b456-17\">HAYS, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AHE\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"Azb\">The facts of this case were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFO\">\u201cAt 2:15 on a Sunday morning, a sergeant of the Bridgeport police department was patrolling alone in a section of Bridgeport noted for its high incidence of crimes of various kinds. There he met a person known to him and considered by him to be trustworthy and reliable who pointed to an automobile parked on the other side of the street and told him that a person seated in the vehicle was armed with a pistol at his waist and had narcotics in his possession. The defendant was the occupant of this automobile and was seated on the pas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>senger\u2019s side of the front seat. The sergeant walked across the street, tapped on the window of the automobile and told the defendant to open the door. The defendant rolled down the window of the door, and the sergeant immediately reached directly to the defendant\u2019s waistband and removed a fully loaded, .32-caliber revolver from the waistband of the defendant\u2019s trousers. He thereupon arrested the defendant, and thereafter a search was made of the defendant and the automobile. The search disclosed * * * a machete under the front seat, twenty-one cellophane packets containing a white substance in the defendant\u2019s wallet and six similar packets in a jar in the defendant\u2019s right-hand coat pocket. Later tests of ten of the cellophane packets established that they contained heroin.\u201d State v. Williams, 157 Conn. 114, 116-117, 249 A.2d 245, 246 (1968), cert. denied, 395 U.S. 927, 89 S.Ct. 1783, 23 L.Ed.2d 244 (1969).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">In Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 175, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 1310, 93 L.Ed. 1879 (1949), the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\">\u201cIn dealing with probable cause, however, as the very name implies, we deal with probabilities. These are not technical; they are the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">A familiar way of testing the \u201cfactual and practical considerations of everyday life\u201d is to ascertain what practical ever-day people would do in the given factual circumstances. I would suppose that very close to one hundred per cent of the people of this country, if they were asked whether in the situation in which he found himself, the Bridgeport police sergeant\u2019s actions were those of a reasonable and prudent man, would unhesitatingly reply in the affirmative. If the police officer had disregarded the information that a man sitting alone in a ear in a high crime area at 2:15 in the morning had a gun stuck in his belt, his conduct, far from being reasonable and prudent, would have been bizarre and erratic.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">An \u201cexclusionary rule\u201d which deters police officers from taking ordinary precautions against criminal conduct and encourages possession of guns, machetes and narcotics, is surely an unacceptable rule.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
