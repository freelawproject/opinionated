Pugach v. Mancusi, 411 F.2d 177 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 889, 90 S.Ct. 172, 24 L.Ed.2d 163 (1969), we considered a number of appellant Pugach\u2019s claims attacking the legality of his 1962 conviction for the maiming of Linda Riss and determined that at least two of them were not on their face \u201cso lacking in merit as to warrant denial without a hearing.\u201d 411 F.2d at 179. Noting that Pugach had \u201cmounted an almost unparalleled succession of collateral attacks on his conviction,\u201d some of which were pending at the time we handed down our decision, we suggested that all of his federal habeas corpus applications be consolidated for the hearing we were directing, and put Pugach on notice \u201cthat if he still has other federal claims these must be promptly asserted along with the ones now pending.\u201d 411 F.2d at 181.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The hearing was conducted fairly and effectively. In a thorough and well-considered opinion, Judge Pollack denied Pugach\u2019s applications, 310 F.Supp. 691, and Pugach appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-6\">At the hearing below, Pugach narrowed the grounds of his attack to six: illegal eavesdropping, coerced admissions, prosecutorial misconduct, denial of the right to act as his own counsel, ineompetency of trial counsel, and the admission of a co-defendant\u2019s unredacted confession. On appeal he raises several other claims, including bias on the part of the district judge. We have considered all these contentions and can add nothing useful to Judge Pollack\u2019s opinion with respect to most of them; those contentions not specifically passed on by him are without merit. We therefore limit our brief comments to the issue of coerced admissions, see 411 F.2d at 180-181, 310 F.Supp. at 708-712, and to the issue, not previously before us, of the introduction into evidence of an unredaeted confession by Pugach\u2019s co-defendant, Heard Harden, one of the allegedly hired assailants, which seriously implicated him, see 310 F.Supp. at 718-721.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-10\">Pugach contends that the use in evidence of admissions he made to two former suspects acting at the instance of the police violated his Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights. We need consider only his Fifth Amendment claim. See 411 F.2d at 180-181. The facts surrounding these admissions, as the judge permissibly found, were essentially as follows: Two former convicts, at one time suspects with respect to the maiming, were enlisted by the police to elicit information concerning the case. A meeting with Pugach was arranged at his office through an acquaintance of Pugach who introduced the two as his friends. The two told Pugach of their alleged involvement in the case and indicated their awareness of his complicity therein, demanding $10,000 and threatening to tell the police all they knew if they were not paid. Pugach denied his involvement and told the men to leave his office, asserting that he would call the police, for whom the two visitors, after refusing to leave, offered to wait. Pugach then became noticeably nervous and made an offer of $300.00 under the guise of desire to avoid injurious publicity. The offer was refused, and Pugach said he would think about the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-11\">A second conversation occurred in Pugach\u2019s automobile. Pugach invited one of the two men into his car and the $10,000 demand was repeated. Pugach demanded assurance that he would not be approached in the future, sought proof that the man had inculpatory information (some of which was furnished), and inquired as to the cost of having his confederates in the crime put out of the way. Testimony with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1075\">*1075</page-number>to the above was given at trial. The district court found that the entry into the car was by Pugach\u2019s invitation and that no violence, Pugach\u2019s protests to the contrary notwithstanding, was visited upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-5\">Judge Pollack denied on the merits the claim that the admissions elicited from Pugach during the above course of events violated his Fifth Amendment rights, without reaching the questions of waiver, through failure to object to the reception of the evidence at the trial, 411 F.2d at 180-181. The issue is whether the investigatory stratagem employed in this case, which, as the district court found, is not inconsistent with due process, cf. Hoffa v. United States, 385 U.S. 293, 310-311, 87 S.Ct. 408, 17 L.Ed.2d 374 (1966); United States v. De Sapio, 435 F.2d 272, 281-282 (2 Cir. 1970), cert. denied, 39 U.S.L.W. 3521 (May 25, 1971), nevertheless elicited responses that were the product of coercion. Assuming the same standards to govern admissions as govern confessions, and they surely are no more rigorous, we see no basis for upsetting the district court\u2019s factual determination that Pugach\u2019s \u201cwill was not overborne by any physical or psychological coercion,\u201d 310 F.Supp. at 712. The conversations involved were of short duration; Pugach, a \u201chighly educated, successful, resourceful, quick-minded lawyer,\u201d was in his office or car at the time he made the statements; he was subjected to no physical threats; and at no time was he under restraint or in anyone\u2019s custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-6\">Pugach\u2019s contention that the admission in evidence during trial of his co-defendant\u2019s confession\u2014eoneededly inculpatory of Pugach\u2014violated his right of confrontation, Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), held retroactive in Roberts v. Russell, 392 U.S. 293, 88 S.Ct. 1921, 20 L.Ed.2d 1100 (1968), is unjustified on the facts of this ease. Unlike the situation in Bruton, or in Douglas v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 415, 85 S.Ct. 1074, 13 L.Ed.2d 934 (1965), where there was no opportunity for effective cross-examination of the confessor, Pugach\u2019s co-defendant Heard Harden took the stand, \u201caffirmed the statement as his,\u201d Douglas v. Alabama, <em>supra, </em>380 U.S. at 420, 85 S.Ct. 1074, but denied its truth, asserting that it had been coerced from him by a combination of beatings, threats, and promises. He was cross-examined by Pugach\u2019s counsel. As Judge Pollack noted, 310 F.Supp. at 720,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1137-8\">It is difficult to conceive of any fuller opportunity that might have been afforded petitioner to cross-examine and contradict the co-defendant\u2019s extra-judicial statements or a more favorable result that might have been obtained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AaI\">Although when Judge Pollack handed down his decision, this Circuit did \u201cnot appear to have as yet considered whether <em>Bruton </em>applies where the co-defendant testifies at trial,\u201d 310 F.Supp. at 721, any doubt on that score was put to rest by United States v. Bujese, 378 F.2d 719 (2 Cir. 1967), <em>vacated for consideration in light of Bruton, </em>392 U.S. 297, 88 S.Ct. 2064, 20 L.Ed.2d 1113 (1968), <em>rev\u2019d per curiam, </em>405 F.2d 888 (2 Cir. 1969) judgment of reversal rev\u2019d and original conviction aff\u2019d on reh\u2019g, 434 F.2d 46, 48 (2 Cir. 1970), where we said: \u201cThe only question is: did the defendant, whom the confession implicates, have an opportunity to confront the confessor?\u201d Accord, Santoro v. United States, 402 F.2d 920 (9 Cir. 1968), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 849, 91 S.Ct. 58, 27 L.Ed.2d 86 (1970); Baker v. Wainwright, 422 F.2d 145, 147-148 (5 Cir.), cert. denied, 399 U.S. 927, 90 S.Ct. 2243, 26 L.Ed.2d 794 (1970); United States v. Sims, 430 F.2d 1089, 1091 (6 Cir. 1970); People v. Anthony, 24 N.Y.2d 696, 301 N.Y.S.2d 961 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1136-7\">.
