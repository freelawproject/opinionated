Appellant was admitted as a non-immigrant visitor to the United States from October 29, 1969, to April 29, 1970. She asked for a change to non-immigrant <em>student </em>status from non-immigrant <em>visitor </em>status. The Immigration and Naturalization Service denied the application \u201cas a matter of discretion,\u201d noting that the American Consul who issued the original visa had written under it \u201cwill not study.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-14\">An appeal to the Regional Commissioner was had, and dismissed (after argument), on the ground the discretion granted to the Attorney General had been exercised; and that it was controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-15\">The District Court affirmed by Summary Judgment and we likewise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-16\">Two questions are presented. Did the appellee abuse his discretion in denying appellant\u2019s application for change of status? Did the District Court err in affirming the decision of the appellee ? To both questions, the answer is no.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-17\">Appellant complains there was a total lack of any evidence to support a denial of change of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-18\">By 8 C.F.R. 248.2, any application for a change of status \u201cshall be accompanied by documentary evidence that the applicant * * * is eligible for the change of classification being requested. * * * \u201d This places a substantial burden of proof on the applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-19\">While any such application must also show applicant has maintained her visitor status (8 C.F.R. 248.1), such status was not here questioned. Hence, that requirement is irrelevant to this appeal, and therefore the case appellant cites\u2014Elizabeth Ho v. District Director, etc., 70-2435-IH, from the Central District of California\u2014is not in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-20\">What the application must show to comply with 8 C.F.R. 248.2 is \u201cdocumentary evidence,\u201d as required by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a) (15) (F) (i)\u2014i. e., that he or she * * * <em>\u201cis a bona fide student, qualified to pursue a full course of study * </em>* * <em>at an established institution of learning, </em>etc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-21\">The fact that \u201cwill not study\u201d was marked upon appellant\u2019s visa is either a quotation of her statement made to the consular officer issuing her visitor\u2019s visa, or his conclusion based upon his knowledge of her good faith, her then position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>in the community, and her capabilities as a student.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Appellant, without citation of authority, charges that the administrative decision denying change of status must specifically state all facts upon which the discretionary decision is based. The government asserts there is no such requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">As the trial judge pointed out, a 26-year-old \u201chousewife\u201d does not normally come to another country to begin a course of study, without evidence of some prior education. The District Court made findings on other factual issues demonstrating the failure of applicant to establish her eligibility for the \u201cstudies\u201d she proposed to embark upon. (Second paragraph of Finding of Fact III, C.T. p. 19.) The record supports such findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">The Judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
