Both defendants pleaded not guilty and stood trial by jury. At the conclusion of the Government\u2019s case both defendants moved for a judgment of acquittal. The district court granted the motions in part and dismissed Counts I, II, and III with respect to Miller and Counts I and III with respect to O\u2019Brien. The jury found O\u2019Brien guilty as charged in Counts II and IV and Miller guilty as charged in Count IV. The court sentenced Miller to serve a five-year term in the custody of the Attorney General; O\u2019Brien was sentenced to serve two concurrent five-year terms. Both defendants have appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-16\">On appeal O\u2019Brien contends that the Government\u2019s evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction under Count IV. Both O\u2019Brien and Miller contend that the court erred in allowing the jury to consider the Government\u2019s evidence concerning the counts that the court dismissed at the close of the Government\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-17\">We have considered the briefs and the record and conclude that there was sufficient evidence to sustain O\u2019Brien\u2019s conviction under Count IV. Similarly, we hold that the court did not err, in the circumstances of this case, in permitting the jury to consider the Government\u2019s evidence pertaining to the dismissed counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-18\">Therefore, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
