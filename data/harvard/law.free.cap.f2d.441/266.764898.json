Our review of the record shows that there was substantial evidence that petitioner was a supervisor. It follows that his discharge for engaging in the employees\u2019 protest against unsafe working conditions did not violate the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-20\">Petition dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
