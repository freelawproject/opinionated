Moreover, shore leave was not involved in either of the two cases upon which the court principally relied, Weiss v. Central R. R., 235 F.2d 309 (2d Cir. 1956), and Hudspeth v. Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores, Inc., 266 F.Supp. 937 (E.D.La.1967). In both, as defendant itself points out, the disability resulted from the seamen\u2019s activities while on duty. Thus the award of maintenance and cure rested upon the district court\u2019s finding, supported by the record, that commuting was part of the job plaintiff\u2019s decedent was employed to perform\u2014that in the circumstances of this case \u201cthe hazards of the journey may fairly be regarded as the hazards of the service.\u201d Cardillo v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., 330 U.S. 469, 479, 67 S.Ct. 801, 807, 91 L.Ed. 1028 (1947).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Hopson v. Texaco, Inc., 383 U.S. 262, 86 S.Ct. 765, 15 L.Ed.2d 740 (1966);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Magnolia Towing Co. v. Pace, 378 F.2d 12 (5th Cir. 1967);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Sullivan v. United States, 73 F.Supp. 525 (S.D.N.Y.1947), aff\u2019d, 179 F.2d 924 (2d Cir. 1949). For this reason it does not necessarily follow from the district court\u2019s decision, as defendant suggests, that defendant would have been liable had plaintiff\u2019s decedent sustained the injury at home. That would be another case, as to which we intimate no opinion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-12\">With respect to Jones Act liability, defendant\u2019s argument consists largely of an attack upon the factual support for the district court\u2019s conclusion that plaintiff\u2019s decedent and the driver of the car were acting in the course of their employment. As we have said, and as the district court\u2019s opinion reflects, this finding had adequate support in the record. Defendant argues with particular vigor that it lacked power to control the commuters. It is sufficient to repeat: \u201cThe presence or absence of control is certainly a factor to be considered. But it is not decisive. An employer may in fact furnish transportation for his employees without actually controlling them during the course of the journey or at the time and place where the injury occurs. * * * And in situations where the journey is in other respects incidental to the employment, the absence of control by the employer has not been held to preclude a finding that an injury arose out of and in the course of employment.\u201d Cardillo v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., <em>supra, </em>330 U.S. at 480-481, 67 S.Ct. at 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Defendant argues that the district \u201ccourt\u2019s reasoning would have supported recovery if Williamson had died from poisonous food negligently served by his wife. It likewise would have supported recovery if Williamson had fallen out of bed.\u201d The argument is faulty for two reasons. The district court\u2019s Jones Act holding, like the award of maintenance and cure, rested upon the premise that plaintiff\u2019s decedent was in the course of employment while commuting, not that all of his activities ashore fell within this category. In the second place, an employer\u2019s liability under the Jones Act is limited to \u201cinjuries negligently inflicted on its employees by its \u2018officers, agents, or employees.\u2019 \u201d Hopson v. Texaco, Inc., <em>supra, </em>383 U.S. at 263, 86 S.Ct. at 766. Defendant was liable under the Jones Act only because the injuries resulted from the negligence of one of its employees, the driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">On her cross-appeal, plaintiff contends that the general damage award under the Jones Act was insufficient and that the court should have allowed prejudgment interest calculated from the time of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">We agree with defendant that in such a case as this \u201cdamages are most difficult of assessment and many items * * * can only be set arbitrarily.\u201d We cannot say that the district court\u2019s finding of damages was clearly erroneous. Although it may well be that prejudgment interest is available in a Jones Act case tried, as here, in admiralty, <em>see </em>Sanford Bros. Boats, Inc. v. Vidrine, 412 F.2d 958, 972-973 (5th Cir. 1969); Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc. v. Richardson, 295 F.2d 583, 592-593 (2d Cir. 1961); Petition of Marina Mercante Nicaraguense, S.A., 248 F.Supp. 15, 25 n. 22 (S.D.N.Y.1965); Gardner v. National Bulk Carriers, Inc., 221 F.Supp. 243, 247-248 (E.D.Va.1963), aff\u2019d, 333 F.2d 676 (4th Cir. 1964), the allowance of interest rests with the trial court\u2019s sound discretion, <em>see, e. g., </em>Gardner v. National Bulk Carriers, Inc., 333 F.2d 676 (4th Cir. 1964), and plaintiff has made no attempt to show that the court abused its discretion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b128-7\">. This Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act case interpreting the phrase \u201cin the course of employment\u201d is relevant because the Jones Act utilizes the same standard, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 688, which \u201cis the equivalent of the \u2018service of the ship\u2019 formula used in maintenance and cure cases.\u201d Braen v. Pfeifer Oil Transp. Co., 361 U.S. 129, 133, 80 S.Ct. 247, 250, 4 L.Ed.2d 191 (1959).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b128-9\">.

Defendant also contends that the claim for maintenance and cure became \u201cmoot\u201d when plaintiff received insurance benefits sufficient to pay medical and funeral expenses from a health and welfare trust fund to which defendant contributed. We do not reach the merits of this contention for there is nothing in the record or appeal to indicate that it was raised below.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
