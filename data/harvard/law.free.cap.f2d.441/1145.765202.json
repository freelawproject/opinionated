The company representatives indicated that no one would be discharged in the meantime and the employees indicated that they would continue to work. In fact none of the employees did report for work, and four of them were discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-20\">In addition to finding the pre-election \u00a7 8(a) (1) violations referred to above, the Board also found that the employee refusal to work was protected concerted action and ordered the rehiring with backpay of three of the four who had been discharged. It also ordered a new election.</p>\n<p id=\"b1207-21\">The facts presented by this case are not without difficulty. The Board argues that the doctrine of N. L. R. B. v. Washington Aluminum Co., 370 U.S. 9, 82 S.Ct. 1099, 8 L.Ed.2d 298 (1962), governs our decision in this matter. In that case the United States Supreme Court said, among other things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0e\">\u201cAlthough the company contends to the contrary, we think that the walk<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1146\">*1146</page-number>out involved here did grow out of a \u2018labor dispute\u2019 within the plain meaning of the definition of that term in \u00a7 2(9) of the Act, which declares that it includes \u2018any controversy concerning terms, tenure or <em>conditions of employment. </em>* * * \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1208-4\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1208-5\">\u201c [I]t has long been settled that the reasonableness of workers\u2019 decisions to engage in concerted activity is irrelevant to the determination of whether a labor dispute exists or not. Moreover, the evidence here shows that the conduct of these workers was far from unjustified under the circumstances.\u201d NLRB v. Washington Aluminum Co., <em>supra </em>at 15, 16, 82 S.Ct. at 1103 (Emphasis in original.) (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1208-6\">The company relies upon the employees\u2019 promises to report for work and contends that refusal to work, in direct contravention of those promises, removed the \u201cprotective mantle\u201d of Section 7 of the Act from their concerted activity. It argues that a strike in violation of the provisions of a bargaining agreement is not protected activity and that those who strike in violation of contract may be lawfully discharged, citing N. L. R. B. v. Sands Manufacturing Co., 306 U.S. 332, 59 S.Ct. 508, 83 L.Ed. 682 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-8\">The question is thus narrowed to whether, as the company contends, the employees\u2019 promises to report for work, and their subsequent failure to do so, constituted a violation of a binding, albeit oral, no-strike agreement. The Board considered this question and found that under all the circumstances the promises to report for work were not \u201cclear and unmistakable\u201d waivers of the right to strike. Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. N. L. R. B., 325 F.2d 746, 751 (6th Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 971, 84 S.Ct. 1135, 12 L.Ed.2d 1285 (1964). We view the record as a whole as containing substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s determination that there was no express waiver of the employees\u2019 statutory right under Section 7 to engage in \u201cconcerted activity for the purpose of * * * mutual aid or protection.\u201d (See N. L. R. B. v. Lion Oil Company, 352 U.S. 282, 293, 77 S.Ct. 330, 336, 1 L.Ed.2d 331 (1957)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1208-12\">The petition for review is dismissed and the order of the National Labor Relations Board is enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
