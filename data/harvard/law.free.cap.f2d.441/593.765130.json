B. Rushing and Max Tidmore,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> each owned 50 percent of the stock in two corporations. In 1962 the taxpayers as directors voted to adopt a plan of liquidation for both corporations in accordance with the provisions of Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 337.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Short<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>ly after the decision to liquidate, substantially all of the assets of both corporations were sold. Immediately before the end of the statutory twelve month period allowed for liquidation under \u00a7 337 both taxpayers created irrevocable trusts for each of their children and sold their stock in the two corporations to these trusts. The trustee, Lubbock Citizens National Bank, purchased the stock by paying part cash and executing notes for the remainder, payable to the taxpayers over a period of years. These notes were to be secured by the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>assets of the trusts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In each case the total purchase price payable by the trusts was an amount equal to the anticipated liquidation dividend to be paid on the stock purchased. Shortly thereafter, and still within the twelve month statutory period, the trustee, as sole shareholder of the two corporations, liquidated the corporations and collected the distribution proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-16\">In their tax returns for 1963, the year of liquidation, the taxpayers did not report their gain from the liquidation of the two corporations, but claimed instead that they had sold their stock to the trusts which were to make payments on the installment basis. Accordingly, the taxpayers contended that the gain need be reported only as the payments were received from the trusts in succeeding years under Int.Rev.Code \u00a7 453.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>Commissioner, refusing to allow taxpayers the benefit of the installment sales section, determined that each taxpayer was taxable in 1963 on his gain of $301,-310, representing the difference between the proceeds received in liquidation and his basis in the stock. The Commissioner determined their income tax deficiencies accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The Tax Court, relying in part on Jacobs v. United States, S.D.Ohio, 1966, 280 F.Supp. 437, <em>affd, </em>6 Cir., 390 F.2d 877, disallowed the Commissioner\u2019s deficiency determination, finding that the taxpayers should be allowed to report their gain on the stock on the installment basis.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Agreeing with the determination of the Tax Court, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">At the outset we feel compelled to state what this case is not about. In the first place, there is no attempt here to change the character of the gain involved and convert what would be ordinary income into capital gain. The gain realized by the taxpayers on the liquidation of the corporations, whether derived through sale on the installment basis to the trust or directly from the liquidation proceeds, would be entitled to capital gains treatment. Secondly, this is not a ease where one taxpayer has attempted to shift the gain to a second taxable entity in order to reap the benefits of the second entity\u2019s lower tax rate. The price the trusts paid the taxpayers for the stock was the full value of the stock, including the appreciation in value which would be realized upon liquidation. We therefore find the Commissioner\u2019s reliance upon the anticipatory assignment of income theory entirely misplaced simply because no income was assigned. The taxpayers, in effect, kept all of the gain realized as a result of the appreciation in value of the stock. The only question is whether they must pay taxes on the entire amount of the gain in the year the corporations were liquidated or whether they may pay taxes on the entire amount over a period of years as the installment payments are received from the trusts. In essence, the determinative question is whether for tax purposes Rushing and Tidmore should be treated as if they constructively received the entire liquidation dividend in the year of liquidation or whether the sale and consequent distribution to the trusts insulates the taxpayers so that for tax purposes they are deemed to receive the payments representing their gain only as they receive the installment payments from the trusts.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-11\">This is not the first time that a taxpayer, in order to receive installment sale benefits, has created a third entity between himself and the ultimate source of his profit. <em>See e. g., </em>Griffiths v. Helvering, 1939, 308 U.S. 355, 60 S.Ct. 277, 84 L.Ed. 319; Hindes v. United States, 5 Cir. 1967, 371 F.2d 650; Hindes v. United States, 5 Cir. 1964, 326 F.2d 150; Williams v. United States, 5 Cir. 1955, 219 F.2d 523; Pozzi v. Commissioner of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Internal Revenue, 1967, 49 T.C. 119. We think it clear from a reading of these cases that a taxpayer may, if he chooses, reap the tax advantages of the installment sales provision if he actually carries through an installment sale, even though this method was used at his insistence and was designed for the purpose of minimizing his tax. Williams v. United States, <em>supra, </em>219 F.2d at 527; Pozzi v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, <em>supra, </em>49 T.C. at 128. On the other hand, a taxpayer certainly may not receive the benefits of the installment sales provisions if, through his machinations, he achieves in reality the same result as if he had immediately collected the full sales price, or, in our case, the full liquidation proceeds. As we understand the test, in order to receive the installment sale benefits the seller may not directly or indirectly have control over the proceeds or possess the economic benefit therefrom. In Griffiths v. Helvering, <em>supra, </em>the Supreme Court denied installment sale benefits to a seller who arranged for an intermediate corporation which he wholly controlled to collect the full sales price from the buyer and pay it over to him in installments. In <em>Griffiths </em>the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-4\">\u201cWe cannot too often reiterate that \u2018taxation is not so much concerned with the refinements of title as it is with actual command over the property taxed\u2014the actual benefit for which the tax is paid.\u2019 Corliss v. Bowers, 281 U.S. 376, 378, 50 S.Ct. 336, 74 L.Ed. 916, 917. And it makes no difference that such \u2018command\u2019 may be exercised through specific retention of legal title or the creation of a new equitable but controlled interest, or the maintenance of effective benefit through the interposition of a subservient agency. Cf. Gregory v. Helvering, 293 U.S. 465, 55 S.Ct. 266, 79 L.Ed. 596, 97 A.L.R. 1355.\u201d 308 U.S. at 357, 60 S.Ct. at 278.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Applying these principles to the instant case, we find that the taxpayers here are entitled to the benefits of the installment sale provision. The sale to the trusts deprived the taxpayers of the immediate right to realization of the liquidation dividends. An autonomous entity controlled the proceeds, and no right of recapture inured to the benefit of the taxpayers. The Tax Court found, and we think the evidence supports the finding, that the trustee was independent of the taxpayers\u2019 control.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus the intervening third party, the trustee, was neither a puppet nor an economic serf. The taxpayers retained no effective benefit or control over the liquidation dividend. Absent the possibility of control or recapture, the alienation of the stock cannot be hyphenated for tax purposes by merely labeling the transaction an assignment of income or constructive receipt. Here there was no possibility of recapture or control. The trustee was no alter ego of the taxpayers; it had independent duties and responsibilities to persons other than the taxpayers. The taxpayers\u2019 only effective means of obtaining the benefit of the liquidation proceeds was under the contract of sale with the trust a contract which provided for payments to be made on the installment basis. The taxpayers therefore are entitled to report their gain as it is received by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">For the foregoing reasons the decision of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b655-14\">.
