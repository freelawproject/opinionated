In the only argument of substance in his petition, Nussbaum contends that Haynes v. United States ((1968) 390 U.S. 85, 88 S.Ct. 722, 19 L.Ed.2d 923) compels his release. <em>Haynes </em>held that the registration provisions of section 5851 are self-incriminatory and that failure to comply with them cannot be criminally punished.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-26\"><em>Haynes </em>would compel vacation of Nussbaum\u2019s conviction if it were to be given retrospective application. But in Mackey v. United States (1971) 401 U.S. 667, 91 S.Ct. 1160, 28 L.Ed. 404, the Supreme Court held that Marchetti v. United States (1968) 390 U.S. 39, 88 S.Ct. 697, 19 L.Ed.2d 889 and Grosso v. United States (1968) 390 U.S. 62, 88 S.Ct. 709, 19 L.Ed.2d 906, the companion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>cases of <em>Haynes </em>raising the same self-incrimination issue, would apply only to prosecutions commenced after the date those decisions were announced. Nussbaum\u2019s prosecution antedated the pronouncement of <em>Haynes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
