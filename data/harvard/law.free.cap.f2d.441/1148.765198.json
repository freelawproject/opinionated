Tougher, Jr. and Amelia L. Tougher, his wife, deducted from gross income the cost of supplies\u2014principally groceries\u2014purchased by Mrs. Tougher for family use from the Federal Aviation Administration Commissary on Wake Island, where Mr. Tougher was then employed by the F.A.A. as an electronic technician.</p>\n<p id=\"b1210-21\">The Commissioner disallowed these deductions and determined deficiencies in the Toughers\u2019 income taxes resulting from these adjustments. The Tax Court, concluding that the deductions did not fall within the purview of Section 119 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 119), as contended by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>Toughers, sustained the Commissioner\u2019s determinations. Michael A. Tougher, Jr. and Amelia L. Tougher v. C. I. R., 51 T.C. 737 (1969). The Toughers brought the matter here on petition to review the decision of the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"A8VZ\">We affirm on the rationale of the Tax Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
