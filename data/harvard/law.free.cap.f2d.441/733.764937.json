The District Court denied his petition on the ground that the appellant had failed to exhaust his available state remedies inasmuch as his direct appeal from the judgment of conviction was then pending in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-13\">We find no error in the district court\u2019s refusal to consider the merits of the appellant\u2019s habeas petition. Under the doctrine of comity a federal court should not exercise jurisdiction over a state prisoner\u2019s claims of constitutional deprivation, unless or until the highest court of his state has adjudicated them, either upon direct appeal or collateral attack. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254 (1959); Ector v. Smith, 438 F.2d 975 (5th Cir. 1971); Wheeler v. Beto, 407 F.2d 816 (5th Cir. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-15\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b796-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
