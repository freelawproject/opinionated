The only material point urged as error is the denial of the District Court to declare a mistrial because the Government introduced evidence of a prior criminal conviction of Driver although he had not put his character in issue. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-17\">Driver\u2019s accomplice Ort was called as a Government\u2019s witness and testified that Driver came to Ort\u2019s house with a car and asked Ort to accompany him from Alabama to Florida and to sell the car for him. When questioned about this Ort said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-18\">\u201cA1 asked me to sell this car for him that he had gotten, the reason he said he wanted me to sell it is that he had a prior criminal record on cars and * * *\u00bb</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-20\">Driver\u2019s motion for a mistrial was denied. The Court instructed the jury that they must disregard any suggestion, implication or reference to possible previous criminal activities of Driver. \u201cThe admonition to the jury by the trial judge was sufficient to expunge any possible prejudice to the defendant and as such, the error [if indeed there was error] was harmless only.\u201d Russell v. United States, 5 Cir. 1970, 429 F.2d 237, 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
