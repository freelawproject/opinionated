(J.A. 192.) The issues raised by the appellant, as stated in her brief, are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>3</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-9\">We have given each of appellant\u2019s contentions careful consideration; in our opinion the only matter which merits extensive analysis is the controversy over whether the damage suffered by Mrs. Souza\u2019s property was covered by the terms of her \u201chomeowner\u2019s\u201d insurance policy. The trial judge concluded as a matter of law that this damage was not covered by the policy and accordingly granted the directed verdict in favor of Travelers. (J.A. 150.) We agree with this conclusion as applied to the damage to Mrs. Souza\u2019s personalty. However, for reasons set forth below, we feel Mrs. Souza may be entitled to a recovery for at least some of the damage to her realty. We therefore hold that the trial judge erred in granting the directed verdict in favor of Travelers as to the realty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-17\">The \u201chomeowner\u2019s\u201d policy which was in force for Mrs. Souza\u2019s property at the time of the losses here relevant provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-18\">COVERAGE A\u2014DWELLING</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-19\">* * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-20\">PERILS INSURED AGAINST</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-21\">This policy with respect to Coverages A * * * insures against all risks of physical loss * * * except as excluded or limited herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-22\">* * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-23\">SPECIAL EXCLUSIONS</p>\n<p id=\"AHI_\">\n<em>This policy does not insure against loss :</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-24\">(a) by wear and tear, deterioration, * * * settling, cracking, shrinkage, bulging or expansion of pavements, pat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>ios, foundations, walls, floors, roofs or ceilings * * * unless loss by fire, smoke * * *, explosion, collapse of building, water not otherwise excluded or glass breakage ensues. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-6\">(b) * * * caused by, resulting from, contributed to or aggravated by any earth movement, including but not limited to earthquake, landslide, mudflow, earth sinking, rising or shifting; unless loss by fire, explosion or breakage of glass * * * ensues. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"A0m\">(J.A. 41-42.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-8\">COVERAGE C\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-9\">UNSCHEDULED PERSONAL PROPERTY</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-10\">* * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-11\">PERILS INSURED AGAINST</p>\n<p id=\"AaP\">This policy insures * * * against direct loss to the property covered * * by following perils as defined and limited herein:</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-12\">* * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-13\">4. <em>Explosion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1078-14\">* * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-15\">10. <em>Vandalism and malicious mischief, </em>meaning only the wilful and malicious damage to or destruction of the property covered. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-16\">(J.A. 37.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-17\">With regard to the personal property, the insurance contract was a \u201cspecific risk\u201d policy which covered only items brought within eighteen specifically enumerated causes of damage. Appellant sought to bring her loss within either item 4, \u201cexplosion,\u201d or item 10, \u201cvandalism and malicious mischief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-18\">In an effort to recover for damage caused by explosion, appellant charged in her complaint that Corvick \u201cblasted\u201d in constructing sewers near her home (J.A. 23); we are satisfied that the record clearly shows that no blasting took place as this term is generally used.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the cross-examination of Mrs. Souza the following dialogue took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-20\">Q. When and where was the blasting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-21\">A. Mr. Cooney, I did not police\u2014It was only when noise and vibrations were so deafening and excessive, and I just didn\u2019t stand out in the street where I would say was\u2014This is just an opinion of where the big storm sewers went in the alleys. I wouldn\u2019t know. I\u2019m not an engineer. All I know is of the machinery\u2014dirt, deafening noise where you would have to scream to people in your home to speak, and picking up crushed, fallen and broken articles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-22\">Q. For the reason that you have just stated, you came to the conclusion that there must have been blasting, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-23\">A. I did not come to that conclusion. I know nothing of engineering. I know nothing of sewerage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-24\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-25\">Q. You have said we blasted. Have you any proof of any, that there was any blasting done by Corvick Construction Company? Yes or no can answer that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-26\">A. I had only verbal proof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1078-27\">(J.A. 100-01.) Later in the cross-examination counsel returned to this line of questioning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-28\">Q. I\u2019m not quite clear on the blasting. * * * Was there or was there not [blasting] ? * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-29\">A. Mr. Cooney, I can\u2019t answer that by a yes or no.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1078-30\">(J.A. 117.) In order to refresh the appellant\u2019s memory, counsel then read to her the following statements from her pre-trial deposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1078-31\">Q. The only thing I am asking you is whether or not you have available to you now or will have available to you at the time of this trial of this matter any evidence to indicate that dynamite, nitro glycerine or any com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>parable explosive was used by Mr. Corvick in the course of the construction of the sewer separation. * * * Do you have that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-4\">A. That\u2019s a question that is peculiar\u2014not the question itself is not peculiar but the only thing I know is that <em>something must have been used. I don\u2019t know. </em>I couldn\u2019t swear to it and put my hand on the Bible, but <em>something other than heavy machinery must have been used to cause this excessive damage.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">(J.A. 118-19) (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-6\">In these circumstances we feel it was perfectly proper for the trial judge to rule that no explosion occurred.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We also think the trial judge was correct in rejecting plaintiff\u2019s claim that \u201cvandalism\u201d or \u201cmalicious mischief\u201d were involved here; there was absolutely no evidence introduced in support of these theories.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Since it was clearly Mrs. Souza\u2019s burden to prove that the damage to her personalty was caused by one of the specific \u201cperils insured against\u201d and she failed to meet this burden, it was proper for the trial judge to direct a verdict in favor of appellee Travelers as to the personalty claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-19\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-20\">Before examining the provisions of the insurance contract applicable to the real property, we must consider a very substantial defect in appellant\u2019s claim against Travelers for loss to her realty. This was her almost complete failure to introduce evidence as to the amount of damage to her realty. The extent of this failure is revealed in the following lengthy excerpt from the record:</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-21\">THE COURT: * * * Tell me what the evidence is with respect to damages. I am not talking about physical damage to the building; I am not talking about cracks in the walls or various other rooms sunk, dining room sunk, sun room sunk. <em>What\u2019s the evidence of the damage, </em>money-wise? <em>What is the evidence as to the financial loss sustained by Mrs. Souza in this case?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1079-22\">MR. MOORE: On the personal possessions\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-23\">THE COURT: Leave out the personal possessions. I am talking about the building and the grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-24\">* * * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-25\">THE COURT: <em>What\u2019s the evidence money-wise as to the damage of the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number><em>building other than the heating plant and the personal property </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-4\">MR. MOORE: Well, Mr. Bradley Hall stated in effect that it simply could not be repaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">THE COURT: O.K. Let\u2019s assume that\u2019s so. <em>What is the evidence as to what that is </em>worth?</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-7\">MR. MOORE: Mrs. Souza testified she paid something like $60,000 for the house, and if the house cannot be repaired\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-8\">THE COURT: You mean it\u2019s valueless?</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-9\">MR. MOORE: It\u2019s not completely valueless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-10\">THE COURT: You mean the jury has evidence from which they could find $60,000 of damages?</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-11\">MR. MOORE: <em>I just don\u2019t know, your Honor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-12\">THE COURT: <em>Neither do I. That\u2019s my point. What can the jury do by way of estimating the value of the damage to the </em>property? <em>What do they have on which to base a judgment </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-13\">MR. MOORE: The jury has the testimony of Mrs. Souza.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-14\">THE COURT: What testimony?</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-15\">MR. MOORE: On the damage to the structure itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-16\">THE COURT: I understand, but what\u2019s that worth? <em>What would it cost to repair </em>ii[?] <em>Or, put another way, to what extent did that decrease the value of the </em>property? There are only two elements of damage that I can see. I\u2019m not quite sure which would apply. One would be the cost of repairing it; the other might be the decrease in value as a result of the damage done to the property. <em>What evidence do you have on either of those </em>bases?</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-18\">MR. MOORE: <em>Well, your Honor wouldn\u2019t let in the estimate.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-20\">THE COURT: <em>Because you didn\u2019t offer any competent evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-21\">MR. MOORE: <em>We, unfortunately, weren\u2019t able to get those.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-22\">THE COURT: <em>Well, that\u2019s not the Court\u2019s fault. </em>I\u2019m asking you what evidence does the jury have with respect to the damage to the real property. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-23\">MR. MOORE: I think the jury can draw from Mr. Bradley Hall, who is a builder. He gave them his opinion as an expert builder, on the damage. <em>I think they know enough from their own experience to know that a house like this will cost money to be repaired.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-24\">THE COURT: <em>But how much money </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-25\">MR. MOORE: <em>It would cost enough to get it repaired.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-26\">THE COURT: <em>Well, how </em>much? <em>What is the evidence in this case as to how much it will cost </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-28\">MR. MOORE: <em>Well, we have asked, your Honor, in our Complaint for a specific sum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-29\">THE COURT: <em>Yes, but you have no evidence to support that.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-30\">MR. MOORE: Your Honor, Mr. Hall is a competent builder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-31\">THE COURT: But he didn\u2019t give any figures. He wasn\u2019t qualified to give figures.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-32\">MR. MOORE: He said it could not be repaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-33\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t want to pursue this with you, Mr. Moore, but it is perfectly clear to me\u2014and frankly, I will say this to you, and I am perfectly willing to put it on the record: I think it\u2019s too bad that Mrs. Souza has suffered this damage to her property. It seems to me, there ought to be some way that she could be compensated for it. <em>But I have a problem before me as to how she can be compensated against these defendants in the light of the evidence that\u2019s been introduced in this case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-34\"><em>If you will tell me how I can do it! If you will tell me what evidence there is in this case</em>\u2014and <em>this it seems to me is a major item, other than the questions of whether the policy covers it. </em>* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-35\">But on the major item which relates to the damage to the real estate, damage to the building and damage to the grounds * * * <em>what evidence is there </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number><em>as to what that cost, what that would cost to repair </em>* * * ?</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-4\">MR. MOORE: <em>This is one of these situations in life, your Honor, when you sometimes can\u2019t get exact evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t know why you couldn\u2019t in this case. Certainly there must be experts in this community who could testify what it would cost to repair the damage to the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">MR. MOORE: We attempted to find out from Mr. Bradley Hall and your Honor wouldn\u2019t allow\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-7\">THE COURT: Mr. Hall didn\u2019t have the background for any such testimony. He wasn\u2019t familiar, he said, with what needed to be done even, did he? Didn\u2019t he say he didn\u2019t know that excavations would have to be done, what foundations would have to be repaired?</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-8\">MR. MOORE: That\u2019s the difficulty with this house your Honor. Until you actually dig up * * * [you must] dig up all around the house to find out what the damage is to the footings. * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-10\">THE COURT: Mr. Moore, all I know is, I have to decide this case on the basis of the evidence introduced in the case during the course of the trial. Now you tell me what evidence there is upon which a jury can make a finding as to damage done to the real estate\u2014. * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-11\">MR. MOORE: I believe that they could find, your Honor, from the\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-13\">THE COURT: What is the evidence on which you base that belief ?</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-14\">MR. MOORE: The testimony of the witnesses on the extent of the physical damage to the structure itself. <em>These jurors are familiar with costs these days on repairing buildings. That\u2019s an area that they have knowledge on.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-20\">THE COURT: You\u2019ve got on the jury a letter carrier, a clerk in the USAF, you have a display artist at Woodward &amp; Lothrup\u2019s [sic], one is a secretary at the Bureau of Standards, another is a painter, another who is a clerk. I just mention this by way of example. <em>Do you think they are qualified to make a determination as </em>to\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-21\">MR. MOORE: <em>I think they are.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-22\">THE COURT: <em>I\u2019m sorry. I have to disagree with you, Mr. Moore.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-23\">\n<em>Is that all you can say to me?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-24\">MR. MOORE: <em>Yes, your Honor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1081-25\">(Tr. 300-06) (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-26\"> Thus, with regard to virtually every item of realty there was no evidence of the amount of damage. If the absence of such evidence had been complete, the directed verdict would have been proper because the jury could not have been allowed to speculate what proper damages would be.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, since there was competent evidence of the amount of damage to the heating plant\u2014a bill for repairs performed by a plumbing and heating contractor (J.A. 273), the directed verdict in favor of Travelers as to the realty cannot be sustained solely on the ground that there was no proof of the amount of damage thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-27\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-28\">We turn, therefore, to the narrow question of whether it can be said as a matter of law that the damage to Mrs. Souza\u2019s heating plant was not covered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>the terms of her insurance policy. The portion of the policy applicable to the realty provides for \u201call risks\u201d coverage subject only to certain Special Exclusions. The exclusions relevant to the consideration of this case are those which exclude from the coverage of the policy loss caused by \u201csettling\u201d or \u201cearth sinking\u201d unless loss by fire, explosion, or other specifically enumerated catastrophe \u201censues,\u201d in which event the company is responsible only for the \u201censuing loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">Here the burden is on Travelers to prove that the damage to Mrs. Souza\u2019s property is excluded from the coverage of her policy. The general rule, applied in numerous federal cases,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aht\">In an action for a loss covered by an insurance policy, the burden is on the defendant insurer to show that the loss was excepted by the terms of the policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">1A W. Barron &amp; A. Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 279, at 163 (Wright ed. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-6\">Appellant contends, quite logically, that since Travelers introduced no evidence showing that the damage to Mrs. Souza\u2019s realty was not covered by the policy, it did not sustain its burden of proof on this issue and the directed verdict in its favor was improper. However, even where the burden of proving an exclusion from the coverage of an insurance contract is on defendant insurer, he is sometimes entitled to a directed verdict at the close of plaintiff insured\u2019s ease. In presenting its case an insured may introduce evidence indicating that the loss he suffered was excluded from the coverage of his policy. If the insurer moves for a directed verdict in such circumstances, the court is to \u201cconsider as true all the evidence introduced by the insured, draw all reasonable inferences therefrom which are favorable to the insured and apply the law thereto.\u201d James v. Federal Ins. Co., 5 N.J. 21, 24, 73 A.2d 720, 723 (1950). If the court finds that the insured has in fact proven his opponent\u2019s case, the directed verdict on behalf of the insurer is proper. James v. Federal Ins. Co., supra. Cf. Hankel Printing Co. v. Illinois Mfrs. Casualty Ass\u2019n, 240 Ill.App. 438 (1926).</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-10\">Here plaintiff did introduce evidence tending to show that the damage to her realty fell within the exclusions to the general coverage of her insurance policy. In her testimony Mrs. Souza repeatedly spoke of the sinking of the house. Mr. Hall, a licensed contractor called by the plaintiff, testified that floors had sunk (Tr. 258-59) and, in describing this sinking, said, \u201c[T]his is settlement, sir.\u201d (Tr. 260.) There was even evidence that the damage to the heating system resulting from the subsidence of the house. Mrs. Souza testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1082-11\">The pipes under the crawl space had not broken. They had, because of the steady sinking, had pulled loose and water was not feeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1082-12\">(J.A. 59.) These are apparently the same pipes which the heating and plumbing contractor later repaired, and his bill for these repairs and for related work was the only competent evidence of the amount of damage presented at trial. Thus, even granting the plaintiff the inferences to which she is entitled, we feel she did prove that the subsidence of the house caused the only damage now in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-13\">It remains to be seen, however, whether a mere showing that the house subsided is enough to bring the damage to the heating plant within the exclusions for loss caused by \u201csettling\u201d or \u201cearth sinking.\u201d On the record before us, we do not believe it is. Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 2293 (2d ed. 1952) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>defines \u201csettle\u201d to mean, \u201c [t] o sink gradually to a lower level; to subside, as the foundation of a house, etc.\u201d One of the meanings of \u201csettlement\u201d is \u201c[t]he gradual sinking of a structure, whether by the yielding of the ground under the foundation, or by the compression of the joints or the material.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 2294.) These definitions indicate that \u201csettling\u201d is a slow process resulting from the condition of the ground or building. Although Mr. Hall, a building contractor, testified that the fairly rapid sinking involved here was \u201csettlement,\u201d a close examination of his testimony suggests that he might well accept the definitions given above. The following colloquy took place between Mr. Hall and Mr. Cooney, counsel for the insurance company:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-4\">Q. Do you know what kind of soil this building is on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-5\">A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-6\">Q. Isn\u2019t it pretty important to determine the soil that a building is on before\u2014in order to find out what causes possible sinking ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-7\">A. That\u2014I don\u2019t know whether I am capable of answering that question just exactly or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-8\">Q. You can probably answer it a lot better than I asked you. You go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-9\">A. The only thing I can say in answer to this, in my judgment and from my past experience, <em>this is not just exactly a normal settlement by any means. It is an unusual settlement as far as I am concerned. </em>I can\u2019t tell you what caused it and the type or condition of the soil under it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-11\">Q. <em>Can you tell us what you mean by \u201can </em>unusual\u201d\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-12\">A. <em>Well, it isn\u2019t unusual for a house, a new house, sometimes four or five years old to get settlement cracks and it isn\u2019t unusual in some instances to have a door that won\u2019t close properly.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-17\">Q. We are not talking about a house four or five years old?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-18\">A. That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-19\">Q. You realize\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1083-20\">A. This to my judgment, sir, is\u2014well, the only thing I can say on this to you, this is settlement, sir. What it is from, I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1083-21\">(Tr. 259-60) (Emphasis added.) Judging from Webster\u2019s definitions and from Mr. Hall\u2019s description of a normal settlement, we believe \u201csettling\u201d should be interpreted to mean the gradual subsidence of a structure resulting from the condition of the ground. The term \u201cearth sinking\u201d presents a more difficult case, but we believe it should also be construed as meaning a subsidence resulting from the condition of the ground; several of the catastrophes grouped with \u201cearth sinking\u201d\u2014\u201cearthquake, landslide, mudflow\u201d\u2014normally are considered natural phenomena resulting solely from upheaval or disintegration of the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-22\">The insurance company contends that these terms should be given a broader interpretation because of the context' in which they appear. The company\u2019s interpretation of the exclusions is that loss caused by \u201csettling\u201d or \u201cearth sinking\u201d is excluded unless caused by an explosion or another of the catastrophes listed in the exclusions. On the basis of this interpretation it can be argued quite persuasively that the exceptions to the Special Exclusions indicate that the terms \u201csettling\u201d and \u201cearth sinking\u201d mean any subsidence of the ground <em>not </em>caused by one of the enumerated catastrophes; if these terms are read to mean only subsidence resulting from the condition of the ground, then the exceptions to the exclusions for \u201csettling\u201d and \u201cearth sinking\u201d caused by explosions and othr er catastrophes would appear to be surplusage.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1084-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>However, we do not think the exceptions to the exclusions are as clear and unambiguous as the insurance company would have us believe. The relevant language of Special Exclusion (a) is that \u201csettling\u201d is excluded \u201cunless loss by fire, smoke * * *, explosion, collapse of building, water not otherwise excluded or glass breakage ensues. * * * \u201d (J.A. 42.) Special Exclusion (b) states that \u201cearth sinking\u201d is excluded \u201cunless loss by fire, explosion or breakage of glass constituting a part of the building (s) * * * ensues. * * * \u201d <em>(Id.) </em>Since the most common meaning of \u201censue\u201d is \u201cresult from,\u201d the exclusion could be read to mean that loss caused by \u201csettling\u201d or \u201cearth sinking\u201d is excluded unless explosion, breakage of glass, or another of the specifically enumerated catastrophes <em>results from </em>the \u201csettling\u201d or \u201csinking.\u201d This interpretation does not seem very logical when considered in connection with the provision for explosion. However, with regard to the provision for breakage of glass, this almost certainly is the meaning which the drafters of the contract intended \u201censue\u201d to have; it is difficult to envision how breakage of glass could cause a building to subside. Perhaps the drafters intended the same \u201censue\u201d to convey different meanings. In any event, the language is ambiguous, and interpreting the ambiguities against the drafter, we feel it can be said that an insured could reasonably have believed that the exceptions to the Special Exclusions did not call for an expansive reading of the terms \u201csettling\u201d and \u201cearth sinking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-5\">To summarize, we feel Mrs. Souza did present evidence proving that the damage to her heating plant resulted from the subsidence of her house. However, we believe that at least at this stage of the proceedings, in the absence of evidence of special circumstances which would require a different interpretation of the Special Exclusions, these exclusions should not be interpreted as barring recovery for damage caused by the subsidence of Mrs. Souza\u2019s house if that subsidence resulted from something other than the condition of the soil. Finally, since it certainly can be inferred that the subsidence involved here resulted from something other than the condition of the ground, we cannot say as a matter of law that the damage to Mrs. Souza\u2019s furnace was excluded from the coverage of her policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-8\">Accordingly, we reverse and remand for a new trial on the issue of the liability of Travelers for the damage to Mrs. Souza\u2019s heating plant. At retrial the jury should be instructed that damages may not exceed the amount paid the heating contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-9\">Reversed and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1077-10\">. Appellant contends that vibrations resulting from Corvick\u2019s use of heavy equipment, particularly an \u201cArrow tamper\u201d\u2014a \u201cmachine which hydraulically propelled a 1,000 pound chisel-headed drop-weight into the concrete road surface at a rate of fifty times per minute\u201d (Brief for Appellant at is.), caused the damage to her home and furnishings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1077-11\">.

On appeal appellant makes an ingenious argument that the meaning of \u201cexplosion\u201d should be expanded to include the vibrations caused by heavy equipment used on construction projects. (Brief for Appellant at 15-19.) We are unpersuaded by this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1079-7\">. During Corvick\u2019s presentation of his defense there were assertions that no blasting was done, including the following statements by Corvick himself:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-8\">Q. Did you do any blasting on that job?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-9\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-10\">Q. Do you know of anybody that did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-11\">A. No one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1079-12\">(J.A. 167.) The job inspector for the District of Columbia, Mr. McCarthy, also testified that there were no explosives used on this job:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-13\">Q. Do you know whether any explosives or any sort of dynamite or other explosives were used in any of this construction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-14\">A. Not on this particular job there were none, no.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1079-15\">(J.A. 177.) Because these statements occurred after the judge ruled that no explosion took place, we have not considered them in reviewing his ruling. They are merely indicative of the accuracy of the ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1079-26\">. Appellant\u2019s theory in support of the claim of \u201cvandalism and malicious mischief\u201d is that Corvick\u2019s \u201cwilful refusal to discontinue or quiet in any way his work near her premisos\u201d and the fact that he made \u201cno effort to avoid damaging her property\u201d constituted \u201cmalicious acts\u201d for which she should recover under the policy. (Brief for Appellant at 19.) Mrs. Souza therefore contends that, under the circumstances of this case, \u201ca jury may have found that, under the terms of her policy with Travelers, Mrs. Souza was entitled to indemnity.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>However, as appellee Travelers has noted in its brief, \u201cnothing could be more demonstrative of the complete absence of malice in this case than the jury\u2019s verdict that defendant Corvick was not even guilty of ordinary negligence. * * * \u201d (Brief for Appellees Travelers and Corvick at 11.) Once again, this is merely indicative of the accuracy of the judge\u2019s ruling; the ruling was completely justified as of the time it was made by the absence of evidence to prove the allegation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1081-16\">. Appellant now contends that even if there were no competent evidence of the amount of damage to her realty, the trial judge should not have directed a verdict in favor of Travelers because doing so denied her substantial justice; instead, he should have dismissed the case without prejudice to Mrs. Souza. (Brief for Appellant at 19-24.) We reject this contention in the circumstances of this case because it is clear from the record (Tr. 275-278) that the trial judge did everything within liis power and within reason to assist Mrs. Souza\u2019s counsel in presenting his case. We find it necessary to reach this point because although we eventually hold that the directed verdict in favor of Travelers as to Mrs. Souza\u2019s realty was improperly granted, we do not hold that Mrs. Souza should be allowed at retrial to introduce new evidence as to the amount of damage to her realty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1082-7\">. <em>See, e. g., </em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins.

It can be argued that the exceptions to the exclusions for \u201csettling\u201d are not surplusage. Perhaps these exceptions are meant to cover situations such as that in which an explosion loosens the ground and causes a house to \u201csettle\u201d in the gradual manner described in Webster\u2019s and are not meant to cover situations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>in which a house subsides in the rapid manner described at trial by Mr. Hall because these forms of subsidence would not fall within the exclusion for \u201csettling\u201d in the first place. However, it seems these rapid forms of subsidence <em>would </em>fall within the exclusion for \u201cearth sinking\u201d because the word \u201csinking\u201d normally does not connote any speed of subsidence. Thus, if the insurance company\u2019s interpretation of the exclusions is accepted, the exceptions would be surplusage at least with regard to the exclusion for \u201cearth sinking.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
