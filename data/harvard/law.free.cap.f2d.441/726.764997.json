Timely appeal was filed. It is urged on appeal, inter alia, that the local draft board failed to afford the defendant due process in refusing to reopen his I-A classification <em>after </em>the defendant had received his induction order. Defendant asserts that he filed as a conscientious objector <em>after </em>he had received his order to report. Defendant claims that this constitutes \u201ca change in the registrant\u2019s status resulting from circumstances over which the registrant has no control.\u201d 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1625.2. Defendant\u2019s challenge cannot be sustained. This case is controlled by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>recent decision in Ehlert v. United States, 402 U.S. 99, 91 S.Ct. 1319, 28 L.Ed.2d 625 (1971), which upholds the right of a local board to refuse to consider a late claim (after induction notice is received) for classification as a conscientious objector. We have considered the other alleged procedural irregularities in the induction process and find no prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Judgment affirmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b789-15\">. Defendant\u2019s late application prevented the Selective Service officials from processing his claim for exemption. Since it is now clear under <em>Ehlert, </em>supra, that Army regulations will be construed to allow the processing of a conscientious objector claim after induction, the district court may desire to consider, upon appropriate motion, a review of the sentence for the purpose of determining whether in the interest of justice the defendant should be placed on probation in order to afford him an opportunity to make arrangements to be inducted into the Army.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
