The district court denied the petition to remove and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>remanded the case to the state trial court. Spencer appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Removal is available under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1443 only when the defendant can claim rights under \u201cany law providing for specific civil rights stated in terms of racial equality\u201d; claims of rights under the constitutional guarantees of free speech and due process will not support removal. Georgia v. Rachel, 1966, 384 U.S. 780, 86 S.Ct. 1783, 16 L.Ed.2d 925.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">At best, Spencer can argue only that the state rule denying pre-trial discovery by the defendant denies him due process. His attempt to make out an equal protection argument is wholly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Where the allegations of the petition for removal, taken as true, do not support removal, there is no right to a hearing for factual development.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">The denial of the petition for removal is Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b459-22\">. On appeal the state argues that it allowed defendant to see the prosecutor\u2019s files and told him that a detective had statements of witnesses. The prosecutor refused only <em>to </em>furnish copies of the statements in the possession of the police detective. The state also argues that at a preliminary hearing counsel for Spencer cross-examined all government witnesses. Without determining the facts, we take Spencer\u2019s allegations as true for purposes of this disposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
