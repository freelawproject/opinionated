Joseph Blumenfeld, Judge, dismissing a complaint brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 seeking a declaratory judgment that Connecticut\u2019s prejudgment attachment statutes, specifically Connecticut General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-279, 52-280 and 52-285 are unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-23\">The claims arise out of certain real property owned by plaintiff-appellant in Hartford, Connecticut. The attachment was effected on behalf of L &amp; M Electric Company, Inc. in connection with a contract action brought in the state courts seeking to recover payment for certain electrical work performed at the attached premises. In that action the electric company sought to recover $3,000 and the attachment is for this amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-24\">The court below did not find it necessary to reach the merits of appellant\u2019s claim since it was of the view that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction either under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 (requiring an amount in controversy in excess of $10,000) or 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343. This disposition was clearly correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-25\">Hague v. C. I. O., 307 U.S. 496, 59 S.Ct. 954, 83 L.Ed. 1423 (1939) stands for the proposition that jurisdiction under section 1343 does not lie unless the rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>which the plaintiff seeks to vindicate are of the nature of \u201cpersonal\u201d as opposed to \u201cproperty\u201d rights. This court has considered this question on a number of occasions, most recently in Johnson v. Harder, 438 F.2d 7 (2 Cir. 1971) and Tichon v. Harder, 438 F.2d 1396 (2 Cir. 1971). In those cases we affirmed the continuing validity of Mr. Justice Stone\u2019s formula in <em>Hague </em>where the rights at issue are solely those of property. (See, Eisen v. Eastman, 421 F.2d 560 (2d Cir. 1969)). A three-judge court in this circuit has recently considered the same issues raised by appellant here and likewise found subject matter jurisdiction to be lacking. Lynch v. Household Finance Corp. and Toro v. Camposano, 318 F.Supp. 1111 (D.Conn.1970). The Supreme Court has recently noted probable jurisdiction in the <em>Lynch </em>case, 401 U.S. 935, 91 S.Ct. 962, 28 L.Ed.2d 214 (1971). Pending further instructions from the Supreme Court on this matter, we continue to follow the personal vs. property rights distinction. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
