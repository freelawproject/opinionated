The mark \u201cSI SE\u00d1OR\u201d, although not registered, has been used and promoted extensively by the appellant. Apparently considerable good will in the mark has been established. We note the board\u2019s finding on this point as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWL\">According to its record, opposer through an exclusive distributor has sold a cologne for men under the mark \u201cSI SE\u00d1OR\u201d in the United States in department stores, specialty stores, and drug stores continuously since a time prior to July 28, 1964. \u201cSI SE\u00d1OR\u201d cologne has been promoted through advertisements in consumer and trade magazines such as \u201cThe New Yorker\u201d and \u201cBeauty Fashion\u201d, the magazine section of the Sunday New York Times, newspapers through cooperative agreement with retailers, and by the distribution of mailing inserts, samples and testers, counter cards, window displays and the like. Advertising and promotion expenditures by opposer directed to \u201cSI SE-\u00d1OR\u201d cologne from 1964 through September 30, 1966 were in excess of sixty-four thousand dollars. During this same period, the retail dollar value of sales of \u201cSI SE\u00d1OR\u201d cologne approximated two hundred thousand dollars.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASP\">There is no dispute before us as to appellant\u2019s prior use or the fact that the goods of the parties are, at least in part, identical. The sole issue is whether the marks are so similar as to be likely to cause confusion, mistake or deception when applied to the relevant goods here involved. We hold that they are.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-20\">The words \u201cSE\u00d1ORITA\u201d and \u201cSE\u00d1ORIAL\u201d have the same number of letters and syllables. The first six letters of each word are identical. They look alike and sound alike. The \u201cSE\u00d1OR\u201d portion of \u201cSI SE\u00d1OR\u201d also contains the first five letters of \u201cSE\u00d1ORITA\u201d and \u201cSE\u00d1ORIAL\u201d. All of the marks are of Spanish origin and center around the word \u201cSE\u00d1OR\u201d. We note in partic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>ular that \u201cSE\u00d1ORITA\u201d is the female form of \u201cSE\u00d1OR\u201d, <em>i. e., </em>\u201cSE\u00d1ORITA\u201d means \u201cgirl, young lady, miss\u201d; \u201cSE-\u00d1OR\u201d means \u201clord, owner, master.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While it may be true, as indicated by the board, that to a Spanish-speaking person or one knowledgeable in that language the marks \u201cSI SE\u00d1OR\u201d and \u201cSE\u00d1ORIAL\u201d and the mark \u201cSE\u00d1ORITA\u201d would not be \u201cconfusingly similar\u201d, we point out that such is not the critical test under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">Referring specifically to the marks \u201cSI SE\u00d1OR\u201d and \u201cSE\u00d1ORITA\u201d, we feel that there is a strong likelihood that even the class of purchasers referred to above would be led to believe from the concurrent use of the marks on substantially identical or companion goods that a single commercial entity was attempting to trade on the male/female or masculine/feminine tie-in in order to appeal to both these markets. It is this likelihood of confusion as to <em>source </em>which the Lanham Act was designed to prevent. Any standard for registrability limited <em>solely </em>to the issue of the similarity of the marks is improper. Compare, General Time Corp. v. Dunbar Furniture Corp., 402 F.2d 806, 56 C.C.P.A. 721 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">With regard to comparison of the other marks in issue, we agree with the dissenting member of the board that the obvious Spanish significance coupled with the resemblance in sound and appearance of those two marks are also enough to generate a likelihood of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Finally, we invoke the axiom that if there is any question as to the likelihood of confusion the doubt should be resolved against the newcomer. See, Izod, Ltd. v. Zip Hosiery Co., Inc., 405 F.2d 575, 56 C.C.P.A. 812 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">For the reasons stated herein the decision of the board is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b736-14\">.
