The claims are both directed to methods. The opening sentence of the specification states that the invention relates to the processing of data by program and more particularly to the programmed conversion of numerical information. The particular conversion to which both of the claims on appeal are directed is the conversion of \u201cbinary coded decimal\u201d (BCD) numerical information in the form of \u201csignals\u201d (claim 8) or \u201crepresentations\u201d (claim 13) into binary number signals or representations, respectively. Though we presume this statement would be an adequate explanation to those skilled in the computer art, for the benefit of those not so skilled we will elucidate further.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-22\">Most digital computers perform their computing operations on information in binary form, a system of representation having only two elementary constituents, called \u201cbits,\u201d indicated by \u201c1\u201d and \u201c0\u201d. Men, on the other hand, are accustomed to quantitative information in decimal form and, for computer to work on or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>utilize it, it must be converted into binary form. It has become a general practice to make this conversion in two stages: from decimal to BCD; from BCD to binary. The following table shows the ten familiar decimal digits and their binary equivalents expressed in groups of four bits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-5\">decimal binary decimal binary</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKhp\">0 0000 5 0101</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aso\">1 0001 6 0110</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEC\">2 0010 7 0111</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1b\">3 0011 8 1000</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AM8\">4 0100 9 1001</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-32\">In BCD notation the decimal number 53 would be represented as 0101 0011, the binary form of 5 followed by the binary form of 3, each group of four bits being a BCD \u201cdigit.\u201d Although the BCD notation is in terms of \u201c1\u201d and \u201c0\u201d only and can be represented in a binary machine, it is not in a form in which the machine can utilize it to perform its computing operations. In true binary the decimal number 53 is represented by 110101. The problem is to convert the intermediate BCD representation into the true binary. Various ways of doing this were known prior to appellants\u2019 invention. They claim to have discovered a better and simpler way of doing it having various advantages recited in the specification such as reducing the number of steps required to be taken, dispensing with the repetitive storing and retrieval of partially converted information, eliminating the need for interchanging signals among various equipment components and the need for auxiliary equipment, and decreasing the chance of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-33\">The digital computer which is to receive the information in BCD form can itself be programmed to convert it into binary form. The specification gives as an illustrative example an actual program for converting a binary-coded decimal number to ordinary binary and apparatus is described in conventional block diagram form in which the program can be carried out.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-42\">The two claims on appeal read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-28\">8. The method of converting signals from binary coded decimal form into binary which comprises the steps of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-29\">(1) storing the binary coded decimal signals in a reentrant shift register,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-30\">(2) shifting the signals to the right by at least three places, until there is a binary \u201c1\u201d in the second position of said register,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-31\">(3) masking out said binary \u201c1\u201d in said second position of said register,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-34\">(4) adding a binary \u201c1\u201d to the first position of said register,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-35\">(5) shifting the signals to the left by two positions,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-36\">(6) adding a \u201c1\u201d to said first position, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-37\">(7) shifting the signals to the right by at least three positions in preparation for a succeeding binary \u201c1\u201d in the second position of said register.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-38\">13. A data processing method for converting binary coded decimal number representations into binary number representations comprising the steps of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-39\">(1) testing each binary digit position <em>i, </em>beginning with the least significant binary digit position, of the most significant decimal digit representation for a binary \u201c0\u201d or a binary \u201c1\u201d;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-40\">(2) if a binary \u201c0\u201d is detected, repeating step (1) for the next least significant binary digit position of said most significant decimal digit representation ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-41\">(3) if a binary \u201c1\u201d is detected, adding a binary \u201c1\u201d at the (i + l)th and (i + 3)th least significant binary digit positions of the next lesser significant decimal digit representation, and repeating step (1) for the next least significant binary digit position of said most significant decimal digit representaton;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-43\">(4) upon exhausting the binary digit positions of said most significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>decimal digit representation, repeating steps (1) through (3) for the next lesser significant decimal digit representation as modified by the previous execution of steps (1) through (3); and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-4\">(5) repeating steps (1) through (4) until the second least significant decimal digit representation has been so processed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">As to these claims, no prior art is cited and no question is raised as to utility, novelty, or unobviousness. The asserted advantages and the implicit advance resulting therefrom in the data-processing art, have not been questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">\n<em>The Rejection</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">The first problem it is necessary to settle is what the ground or grounds of rejection is or are. Appellants\u2019 brief correctly states, \u201cthe only explicit rejection outstanding against claims 8 and 13 is the rejection on the grounds [sic] that these claims are directed to subject matter not embraced by Section 101.\u201d Study of the two Examiner\u2019s Answers makes it clear that that was the only ground he relied on. In his first Answer the examiner specified that \u201call grounds of rejection are withdrawn, <em>except </em>the art rejections and nonstatutory subject matter rejections.\u201d We no longer have any art rejections. In his second Answer, on remand, he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-8\">In summary, the remaining ground or rejection of claims 8 and 13 now in the case is that these claims are directed to non-statutory subject matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">In reciting what the rejection was, the board opinion says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-10\">Claims 8 and 13 stand rejected as for subject matter not embraced by 35 U.S.C. 101 in that they set forth \u201cmental processes\u201d and \u201cmathematical steps,\u201d neither being an \u201cart\u201d as construed by a long line of decisions * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-11\">Nowhere does the board opinion indicate that any new ground of rejection is being made.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-12\">In. discussing appellants\u2019 arguments traversing the contention that the claims are directed to non-statutory subject matter, the board, answering the argument that \u201cThe only way applicants\u2019 claims can be construed to include mental steps is to construe them contrary to the disclosure rather than in accord therewith,\u201d made the following somewhat off-the-point observations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-13\">We are not convinced by appellants\u2019 arguments to the effect that the disclosure in an application, not the claims thereof, should be the proper basis for judging whether the claims are drawn to subject matter outside the statute. Certainly a claim which embraces that which was already in the prior art or was obvious therefrom could not be sustained under 35 U.S.C. 102 or 103 merely because there may have been something patentable disclosed in the specification. 35 U.S.C. 112 [2d par., 1st sentence] <em>requires the claim, to point out the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention so that a claim which is so broad and indistinct as to embrace within its terms subject matter that can not be patented under section 101 of the statute, similarly must be unpatentable. </em>[Emphasis ours.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-14\">While from that point on in its opinion the board discussed the breadth of the claims and what in its opinion they cover, it never so much as suggested that the claims are \u201cindistinct\u201d or do not point out \u201cthe subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention.\u201d The board did not again refer to section 112 nor in any way suggest failure of the claims to comply with the second paragraph of that section and merely affirmed the rejection on the ground that the claims, as it read them, were directed to methods which are non-statutory under section 101. It is our opinion that up until the time of the appeal to this court there was only one ground of rejection relied on and that was noncompliance with section 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-15\">However, apparently out of an abundance of caution and noting the board\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>reference to section 112 in the above-quoted passage, as well as a similar passage in the Examiner\u2019s Answer on Remand,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appellants\u2019 main brief, toward its end, says of the italicized passage in the above quotation from the board\u2019s opinion that it could be construed as another example similar to the sections 102 and 103 example preceding, <em>or it could also be construed as an entirely new ground of refection under section 112, </em>simultaneously deploring the \u201cvagaries of prosecution [which] leave some of the basic issues in doubt.\u201d Appellants thereupon spent a page of their brief stating their reasons why a rejection under the second paragraph of section 112, <em>if </em>such had been made, would be in error. That would seem a cautious thing to do but it does not bring such a rejection into the case unless it was already there.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">The brief for the Patent Office trades heavily on this situation. On page 2 it quotes appellants as saying that they \u201chave no alternative but to consider a rejection under Section 112 as having been raised and requiring a response\u201d and proceeds to the conclusion that \u201cA rejection under 35 U.S.C. 112, 2nd paragraph, would thus also appear to [be] present,\u201d pointing out that a reason of appeal in appellants\u2019 Notice of Appeal alleges that the board erred</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-9\">* * * in sustaining the Examiner\u2019s rejection of claims 8 and 13 as failing to point out the subject matter which appellants regard as their invention under 35 U.S.C. 112 in that the claims are so broad and indistinct as to embrace within their terms subject matter that can not be patented under 35 U.S.C. 101.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">This, it will be seen, is a close paraphrase of what the board said in the paragraph quoted above. It was an appropriate reason of appeal to file to cover the contingency that what the board said might be a new ground of rejection. The Patent Office brief goes on to argue, it would seem as its <em>principal </em>contention,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> not that the claims are directed to non-statutory subject matter because directed to mental or mathematical steps, which do not constitute an \u201cart,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>but </em>that \u201cthe rejection under 35 U.S.C. 112 should be affirmed\u201d because appellants admitted during prosecution that their process is capable of manual implementation with the aid of pencil and paper, that this is \u201cbeyond that which they presently regard as their invention,\u201d and that the claims must be rejected <em>under section 112 </em>by reason of our decision in In re Prater and Wei, 415 F.2d 1393, 56 CCPA 1381, (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>OPINION</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">We have decided a number of cases in the general field of computer science in addition to the <em>Prater </em>case, supra, since the briefs in this case were filed which we list here for convenient reference:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-5\">In re Bernhart, 417 F.2d 1395, 57 CCPA 737, (1969)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-6\">In re Mahony, 421 F.2d 742, 57 CCPA 939, (1970)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-7\">In re Musgrave, 431 F.2d 882, 57 CCPA 1352, (1970)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">In re Foster, 438 F.2d 1011, (1971) This is an appropriate place to point out a significant difference between most of those cases and the present case. The claims in this case are directed solely to the art of data-processing itself whereas in most of the above eases some subsidiary or additional art was involved. In <em>Bernhart </em>it was \u201cPlanar Illustration Method and Apparatus\u201d by which two-dimensional illustrations of three-dimensional objects could be produced; in <em>Mahony </em>we were concerned with data-processing itself in that the invention was a method of locating the framing bits in a bit stream; in both <em>Musgrave </em>and <em>Foster </em>computers were used to process seismograms; and in <em>Prater </em>the invention related to the spectographic analysis of gases. All of the above cases and the present ease have in common, however, the fact that they are the outgrowth of a blanket Patent Office policy, which remained in existence for some time after the decision of the board in this case, to deny claims such as those before us here on the ground that they were not for statutory subject matter.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This policy was later modified.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The decision here for review is a typical product of its time.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">Reverting now to the first problem which confronts us, what rejection do we have before us for decision? We conclude, appellants\u2019 apprehension notwithstanding, that the examiner and the board relied on only one ground, predicated on 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101, that claims 8 and 13 are either directed to or at least embrace non-statutory subject matter. Neither of them complained that the claims are unclear, ambiguous, indistinct, or otherwise incomprehensible so as not to comply with section 112, second paragraph. In <em>Mahony </em>we made it clear that \u201cTo inject any question of statutory subject matter into that paragraph is to depart from its wording and to complicate the law unnecessarily.\u201d The solicitor\u2019s attempt to build up a rejection on section 112 in order to defeat appellants under the second <em>Prater </em>case decision\u2014a decision not rendered until five months after appellants filed their main brief in this court\u2014must fail. It would have to fail in any case for, as appellants point out in their reply brief, in <em>Prater </em>appellants admitted in the course of the appeal that their claims read on a mental step implementation and we based our decision on that admission insofar as we affirmed the rejection, whereas here appellants have made no such admission and, for reasons hereinafter stated, we do not think the claims read on any \u201cmental step\u201d implementation.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-12\">We turn then to consideration of what the solicitor\u2019s brief admits is the \u201cprincipal rejection\u201d predicated on section 101, which we find to be the only rejection.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-13\">\n<em>Claim 8</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b748-14\"><em>We </em>have set forth claim 8 above and have stated that the examiner and board rejected it because they considered it to be directed to \u201cmental processes\u201d and \u201cmathematical steps.\u201d The reasoning of the board\u2019s opinion bears a remarkable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>similarity to the opinion of the board in <em>Musgrave, </em>which is not surprising since it was the same board and the opinion was by the same member. The same line of cases is relied on here that was relied on in <em>Prater </em>and <em>Musgrave </em>and we have given them full consideration before, particularly in those two cases in which we considered at length the \u201cmental steps\u201d doctrine. One of the many sound ideas expressed in the concurring opinion delivered by Judge Baldwin in <em>Musgrave </em>is \u201cthat in reality very little remains [as a result of our recent decisions] of the \u2018mental steps\u2019 doctrine.\u201d Another is that as a result of <em>Prater </em>and <em>Mahony\u2014if, </em>indeed, it has not always been so <footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\u2014there is a \u201cstandard of reasonableness\u201d in the interpretation of claims which is that they should be given the meaning they would have \u201cto one of ordinary skill in the pertinent art when read in light of and consistently with the specification.\u201d The question Judge Baldwin asked in <em>Musgrave </em>is the question we have here: \u201c * * * would a <em>reasonable </em>interpretation of the claims include coverage of the process implemented by the human mind?\u201d The answer clearly is \u201cNo,\u201d for the same reasons it had to be \u201cNo\u201d in <em>Mahony </em>and in <em>Musgrave. </em>Claim 8 is for a method to be practiced in part on particular <em>apparatus </em>specified to be a \u201creentrant shift register.\u201d The first sentence of a three-paragraph definition of \u201cshift register\u201d in the \u201cCondensed Computer Encyclopedia\u201d edited by Jordain, McGraw-Hill Book Co. (1969), is: \u201cA hardware element constructed so as to perform the shifting of its contained data.\u201d At argument, the Patent Office Solicitor admitted that the reference to this piece of apparatus in the claim was, for him, its \u201cmost embarassing phrase.\u201d It is not only a phrase, it is referred to expressly in elements (1), (2), (3), (4) and (7) and by implication in element (5) which refers to \u201cshifting.\u201d Claim 8, moreover, refers to the operations of storing, shifting, and masking \u201csignals\u201d which, by a <em>reasonable </em>interpretation in the light of the specification, can only mean signals of the kind upon which the disclosed electronic digital computer hardware operates. The signals are like the \u201cbits\u201d and \u201cbit streams\u201d with which we were concerned in <em>Mahony. </em>Claim 8 therefore covers only a machine-implemented process and the apparatus for carrying it out has been disclosed. The process can be carried out with no intervention by a human being once the apparatus is set up \u2014 that is to say, the appropriate computer system has been assembled and programmed. The solicitor would have us hold the method is not a \u201cprocess\u201d within section 101 on the ground that a programmable computer is merely a \u201ctool of the mind\u201d and the method is basically \u201cmental\u201d in character, apparently because the \u201cwork-stuff\u201d of the method is numbers which are mathematical abstractions. As the Patent Office would say, we do not find the argument persuasive. Cash registers, bookkeeping machines, and adding machines also work only with numbers but this has never been considered a ground for taking them out of the \u201cmachine\u201d category of section 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">\n<em>Claim 13</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">This claim was rejected on the same ground as claim 8 from which it differs in containing no reference to any apparatus and in referring to the thing opeated upon not as \u201csignals\u201d but as \u201crepresentations.\u201d The claimed method is one for converting \u201cbinary coded decimal number representations\u201d into \u201cbinary number representations.\u201d The supporting disclosure against which the claim must be reasonably interpreted is the identical programmed digital computer system which supports claim 8. The operational steps to be carried out call for \u201ctesting each binary digit position\u201d to determine whether it is a \u201cbinary \u20180\u2019 \u201d or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>a \u201cbinary \u20181\u2019 \u201d and performing a specified act according to what is found, i. e., moving to the next position if it is \u201c0\u201d and repeating the test or adding a binary \u201c1\u201d at two specified positions and then moving to the next position, and so on, each action being prescribed so that no human judgment or decision is required \u2014merely observation and taking prescribed action according to what is observed. Apparatus, machinery, \u201chardware\u201d \u2014 whatever it may be called\u2014is disclosed by which the steps <em>cam, </em>be carried out without human intervention but at the same time, since the claim does not itself call for any particular hardware, the method within the claim can be practiced either with apparatus other than that described or with the simplest of equipment which will enable one to provide and to manipulate \u201cbinary coded decimal representations\u201d and convert them into \u201cbinary number representations.\u201d This could <em>in theory </em>be any kind of writing implement and any kind of recording medium\u2014\u201cpencil and paper\u201d\u2014or even, we suppose, red and blue poker chips and a surface to put them on or slots to put them in so that \u201c0\u201ds and \u201c1\u201ds can be represented.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">It will aid in understanding the terms of claim 13 to state that the discovery which is the essence of appellants\u2019 invention was that, for each bit position in each BCD digit, conversion can be accomplished by adding a binary \u201c1\u201d to two specific bit positions of the next lesser significant BCD digit and that in normal notation \u201csignificance\u201d of bits or digits increases to the left, e. g., in the decimal number \u201c53\u201d the 5 is more significant than the 3. Thus conversion can be carried out by the steps of (1) testing each BCD bit position for all but the least significant BCD digit and (2) for each \u201c1\u201d bit detected, adding a binary \u201c1\u201d to each of two specified bit positions in the next lesser significant BCD digit.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The only argument put forward by the Patent Office for holding claim 13 non-statutory under section 101 is that the method is basically \u201cmental\u201d in character. Looking at the present case in the light of all its circumstances, we observe in claim 13 a process consisting of a sequence of steps which can be carried out by machine implementation as disclosed in the specification, by still another machine as disclosed during the prosecution, and even manually although in actual practice it seems improbable anyone would ever do that, speed measured in milli-or even micro-seconds being essential in the practical utilization of such a process. Only in the manual performance would it require the operator even to think and then only to the extent necessary to assure that he is doing what the claim tells him to do. In no case is the exercise of judgment required or even the making of a decision as between alternatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Realistically, the process of claim 13 has no practical use other than the more effective operation and utilization of a <em>machine </em>known as a digital computer. It seems beyond question that the machines\u2014the computers\u2014are in the technological field, are a part of one of our best-known technologies, and are in the \u201cuseful arts\u201d rather than the \u201cliberal arts,\u201d as are all other types of \u201cbusiness machines,\u201d regardless of the uses to which their users may put them. How can it be said that a process having no practical value other than enhancing the internal operation of those machines is not likewise in the technological or useful arts? We conclude that the Patent Office has put forth no sound reason why the claims in this case should be held to be non-statutory.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">The decision of the board is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b744-23\">. Consisting of Kreek, Keely, and Andrews, Examiners-in-Chief, opinion by Andrews.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b747-6\">. Continuing the statement quoted above as the first quotation in this section, the examiner said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-7\">The method set forth is by applicants\u2019 own assertion \u201cdirected to a machine algorithm\u201d; and as understood recites a series of steps for manipulation of data required to be carried out by a programmed computer. Such a method, set forth in this manner, is not considered to properly set forth a process within the meaning of 35 USC 101, in light of prior decisions and the requirements of 35 USC 112. The subject matter of the claims is thus deemed non-statutory.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">That paragraph by the examiner therefore begins and ends with the summary statement of his position that <em>the </em>single ground of rejection is that the claims are directed to non-statutory subject matter under 35 USC 101. In short, a method carried out by a programmed computer is non-statutory. His reference to section 112 is not clear as to its purpose and seems superfluous.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b747-12\">. More than 5 of the 7 pages of argument are devoted to this point.
