We deny the Company petition, retain jurisdiction, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-26\">The Company is a single integrated real estate enterprise engaged, so far as relevant here, in operation of three apartment buildings in or near <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Anchorage, Alaska.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Union began an organizational drive in July of 1966 among the Company\u2019s maintenance employees. On July 20 the Union made its first demand for recognition as employees\u2019 bargaining agent on the basis of a card majority of 14 of the 19 employees. The Company\u2019s response was a petition contesting Board jurisdiction, which the Regional Director denied.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thereafter, on request of the Union, the Director reconsidered and reversed his decision and directed an election on October 31, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">After issuance of the Director\u2019s order, the Union began its second drive and on October 13 made its second demand for recognition based on a card majority of 11 of the then 14 unit employees. The Company made no response. The election was held as directed and the Union lost 7 to 6.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Union filed objections to the election. The pending unfair labor practice and the objections to the election were consolidated for hearing before the Trial Examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The General Counsel\u2019s complaint charged 8(a)(1), (3) and (5) violations. The Examiner concluded that the Company had violated 8(a) (1) in interrogation and threats to employee Miller shortly after the Union\u2019s first demand of July 20, 1966; and that similar violations were committed as to employees Jackson, Kutas, Barton and Gibson shortly before the October 1967 demand. The Examiner concluded there was no 8(a)(3) violation with respect to employee Twitchell. On the basis of the October 1967 8(a)(1) violations, the Examiner concluded that the Company had violated 8(a)(5) in refusing to recognize the Union as bargaining agent upon its second demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">The Examiner\u2019s conclusions were based upon findings which included determinations of credibility and we cannot say that his determinations were not warranted. The Board adopted the findings and conclusions of the Examiner. We think the record as a whole justified the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-12\">Within a few days after the Union made its first demand, Manager Evarts interrogated employee Miller about his signing of an authorization card and threatened that Union success might cause the employees to lose \u201csome of the benefits that [they] at that time had,\u201d that there would \u201cprobably be a lot of new faces around here,\u201d and that \u201call of the maintenance work\u201d might be subcontracted.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-13\">In October, 1967, after the Union had begun its second organizational drive, employee Jackson, a woman, was summoned to Evarts\u2019 office, questioned in private, and told, \u201cI know you, Alma, won\u2019t be against us.\u201d On October 31, 1967, the election directed by the Board was held. Early that morning Supervisor Atkins told employees Kutas, Barton and Gibson, \u201cyou guys better watch out because if you go union you will see what will happen,\u201d that the employees \u201cdidn\u2019t know what was going to happen, but he [Atkins] did, and he wasn\u2019t going to tell.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-14\">Each 8(a) (1) violation contributed to an anti-union pattern which gave color to each. L. C. Cassidy &amp; Son, Inc. v. N. L. R. B., 415 F.2d 1358, 1361 (7th Cir. 1969). The statement made to Miller that \u201cif the Union goes through, there will probably be a lot of new faces around here\u201d could well be construed as \u201ca threat of retaliation based on misrepresentation and coercion\u201d and therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>not protected speech under Section 8(c). <em>See </em>N. L. R. B. v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. 575, 618-620, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1970). And the threats made the morning of election by Atkins, the only supervisor other than Evarts in contact with the employees, could be interpreted as not an expression of opinion but as a direct statement of facts to which he was privy. Atkins admitted at the hearing that he had discussed with Evarts the consequences of unionization and as a result thought that there would be changes in some of the working conditions and that some people would be replaced. The statement made to Jackson after being summoned to the manager\u2019s office, although admittedly \u201crelatively inconsequential\u201d if viewed \u201cstanding alone,\u201d could be construed as coercive in view of the other interrogations following the Union\u2019s organizational drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that each of the findings of violations of 8(a)(1) is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">On the basis of the 8(a)(1) violations with respect to Jackson, Kutas, Barton and Gibson, the Examiner found that although the Jackson interrogation \u201cseems relatively inconsequential\u201d it \u201cbuttressed\u201d the impact of the threats, on the morning of election, to the other three employees, which the Examiner thought \u201ccould have been the controlling circumstance\u201d in the 7 to 6 vote in the election; and that the Company undertook this course to destroy the Union majority. The Examiner concluded that the misconduct \u201csuggests\u201d rejection of the collective bargaining principle and constituted a violation of Section 8(a) (5). We think the record as a whole gives substantial support to the findings and conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">The Examiner applied the doctrine of Joy Silk Mills, Inc., 185 NLRB 1263, <em>enforced, </em>87 U.S.App.D.C. 360, 185 F.2d 732 (1950), <em>cert. denied, </em>341 U.S. 914, 71 S.Ct. 734, 95 L.Ed. 1350 (1951), in deciding that the Company\u2019s 8(a)(1) and (5) violations disclosed a lack of good faith in performing its duty to bargain. He recommended that the election be set aside because those violations may have affected employees\u2019 freedom of choice in the election, and that a bargaining order was the proper remedy. The Board adopted the recommendations, and the bargaining order before us was issued April 30, 1969.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">On October 23, 1969, the Board gave notice that it would reconsider its decision in the light of N. L. R. B. v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. 575, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969), and gave leave to the parties to file statements of position concerning the 8(a) (5) violation and bargaining order. The Company responded with a Motion to Reopen the Record to include an affidavit showing the post-election turnover of New Alaska employees and statements taken from present employees to the effect that a reliable rerun of the election could be conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">On January 27, 1970, the Board, in a supplemental decision, reaffirmed its original determination that the Company had violated 8(a) (5) and that a bargaining order was necessary. This supplemental decision is subject of the principal issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-12\">The Company argues, on authority of N. L. R. B. v. American Cable Systems, Inc., 427 F.2d 446 (5th Cir. 1970), that the Board\u2019s supplemental order erroneously denied its Motion to Reopen the Record for proof of employee turnover since entry of the original Board decision, and proof of lack of knowledge of current employees of the supervisor\u2019s 1967 threats. We find no error in the Board\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-14\">This court prefers\u2014over <em>American Cable</em>\u2014the rule of N. L. R. B. v. L. B. Foster Co., 418 F.2d 1, 5 (9th Cir. 1969), that a bargaining order may be enforced \u201cin spite of substantial changes in the situation occurring after the election.\u201d N. L. R. B. v. Kostel Corporation, 440 F.2d 347 (7th Cir. filed Feb. 25, 1971) . <em>See </em>N. L. R. B. v. Drives, Inc., 440 F.2d 354 (7th Cir. filed Jan. 20, 1971). <em>See also </em>N. L. R. B. v. Katz, 369 U.S. 736, 82 S.Ct. 1107, 8 L.Ed.2d 230 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>(1962). As we pointed out in <em>Kostel, </em>a remand for reconsideration on the basis of facts occurring after the Board\u2019s decision would place a premium upon protracted litigation and continuation of unlawful practices by the employer. If the bargaining order is valid and the current employees after a reasonable period desire, they may petition for a representative election. <em>See </em>N. L. R. B. v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. 575, 613, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969). The Board did not err in denying the Company\u2019s Motion to Reopen the Record.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">The Company also contends the bargaining order must be set aside under <em>Gissel </em>because the Board has not shown by analysis of the factual situation that \u201cthe possibility of erasing the effects of past practices and of ensuring a fair election (or a fair rerun) by the use of traditional remedies, though present, is slight.\u201d 395 U.S. at 614, 89 S.Ct. at 1940.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">The Board found the threats of such a nature as to preclude holding a \u201cfree and fair election,\u201d that the card majority was a more reliable test of employee desire and that the bargaining order was necessary to effectuate the policies of the National Labor Relations Act. Clearly this does not meet the \u201cprecise analysis\u201d required by <em>Gissel. </em>N. L. R. B. v. Kostel Corporation, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">So far as the record shows, neither the Examiner nor the Board panel took into consideration the \u201cextensiveness\u201d of the Company\u2019s election day threats and the impact of this unlawful practice upon the election; whether the practice might recur; whether there is only a slight possibility that the impact could be erased by \u201ctraditional remedies\u201d to ensure a fair election rerun; and whether on balance the employee sentiment in the pre-election cards would be better protected by a bargaining order.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Consequently, we remand the case for the proper analysis of the causal connection between the unfair labor practices and the conclusion that the election process was undermined.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Upon remand, the record alone should be the basis of the Board\u2019s \u201cproper findings.\u201d The Board may determine, for example, whether Kutas, Barton, and Gibson, the three most active employees in Union drives, were likely to have been influenced by the threats; <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> whether the three had a timely opportunity to spread the harmful influence among other employees; what effect, other than turnover, the time span between the threats and the bargaining order might have upon elimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>nation of the impact; and whether the Company\u2019s unlawful conduct might probably recur if an election were held.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">We deny the petition to review, retain jurisdiction, defer ruling upon the validity of the bargaining order and remand with direction to the Board to reconsider the record for the sole purpose of making the requisite <em>Gissel </em>findings and appropriate conclusions; and to certify to this court the findings made and conclusions drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Petition to review denied, jurisdiction retained, remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b553-14\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b553-27\">. General Laborers Union, Local 341.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b554-6\">. This court has jurisdiction under Section 10(e) and (f) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e), (f), since its corporate headquarters are in Chicago, Illinois, and it transacts business in Chicago.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b554-8\">. The Union then filed with the Board an unfair labor practice charge of violation of Sections 8(a) (1), (3) and (5) of the Act.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b554-15\">. One vote was challenged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b554-16\">. Although the Examiner thought this 8(a) (1) violation with respect to Miller had no substantial impact on the second Union drive in view of the Union\u2019s achieving a card majority in October, 1967, it is relevant as to the atmosphere surrounding the alleged 1967 violations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b556-6\">. The \u201cprecise analysis\u201d which the Court in <em>Gissel </em>thought was missing from the record, to justify the bargaining order, and for which the Court remanded for the Board\u2019s \u201cproper findings,\u201d is the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-7\">In fashioning a remedy in the exercise of its discretion, then, the Board can properly take into consideration the extensiveness of an employer\u2019s unfair practices in terms of their past effect on election conditions and the likelihood of their recurrence in the future. If the Board finds that the possibility of erasing the effects of past practices and of ensuring a fair election (or a fair rerun) by the use of traditional remedies, though present, is slight, and that employee sentiment once expressed through cards would, on balance, be better protected by a bargaining order, then such an order should issue (see n. 32, <em>supra).</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-9\">395 U.S. at 614-615, 89 S.Ct. at 1940.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b556-12\">. Ordinarily, it is not for the courts to make the analysis. The <em>Gissel </em>Court, in discussing whether a cease and desist order or a bargaining order was the proper remedy for eliminating the consequences of an unfair labor practice, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-13\">It is for the Board and not the courts * * * to make that determination, based on its expert estimate as to the effects on the election process of unfair labor practices of varying intensity. In fashioning its remedies under the broad provisions of \u00a7 10(e) of the Act * * *, the Board draws on a fund of knowledge and expertise all its own, and its choice of a remedy must therefore be given special respect by reviewing courts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai8\">395 U.S. at 612, n. 32, 89 S.Ct. at 1939.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b556-19\">. <em>See </em>Fremont Newspapers, Inc. v.
