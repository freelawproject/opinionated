We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">First, MacDonald argues that the trial judge erred in denying his motion to require the government to conduct a pretrial lineup. The decision on such a motion is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge. United States v. Williams (9 Cir. 1970), 436 F.2d 1166. \u201cAbsent abuse of that discretion resulting in procedure \u2018so unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification\u2019 as to amount to a denial of due process of law * * * we should not question the trial judge\u2019s ruling.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>supra, 436 F.2d at 1168-1169. There is no showing of abuse of discretion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-12\">Second, MacDonald\u2019s argument that the trial judge unduly restricted his cross-examination of the identifying witness is wholly without support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-13\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
