Appellant thereupon sought an order in the nature of mandamus to compel the Commissioner to accept and examine his patent application without payment of the statutory filing fee or, alternatively, that he be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>awarded damages in the sum of $100,000 with interest and costs. The District Court quite properly allowed<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the appellant to proceed in forma pauperis upon his showing of indigency. The Commissioner moved to dismiss, alleging lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter and failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Thereafter that motion was granted. We allowed an appeal in forma pauperis and appointed counsel who have here diligently represented this appellant\u2019s interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-5\">35 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 provides that an application for patent shall include a specification as prescribed by \u00a7 112, a drawing as prescribed by \u00a7 113, an oath as prescribed by \u00a7 115 and concludes, the \u201capplication <em>must be </em>signed by the applicant and <em>accompanied </em>by the fee required by law.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-7\"> None of various grounds for reversal urged upon us requires extended discussion, for we deem to be controlling as a necessary conclusion that appellant had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The district judge correctly so perceived, and we are bound to affirm his order of dismissal. It seems clear enough that the \u201cCommissioner <em>shall </em>charge\u201d (emphasis ours) the fees as specified in 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 41.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Note also that 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 42 provides that all \u201cpatent fees <em>shall </em>be paid to the Commissioner who <em>shall </em>deposit the same in the Treasury of the United States * * *.\"<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-15\">No person has a vested right to a patent, see McClurg v. Kingsland, 42 U.S. (1 Howard) 202, 206, 11 L.Ed. 102 (1843), but is privileged to seek the protected monopoly only upon compliance with the conditions which Congress has imposed. That rule applies to the payment of fees required for the administration of the patent laws just as it demands compliance with other conditions, statutorily imposed. Certainly the powers of Congress in the patent law field are plenary for they stem directly from the Constitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1105-16\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-17\">But, the appellant argues, granting that Sections 41(a) and 111 are not unconstitutional on their face, the Commissioner\u2019s treatment of the appellant\u2019s patent application brings it about \u201cthat poor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>people may be cavalierly discriminated against.\u201d He accordingly argues that he has been denied the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s assurance of equal protection and the Fifth Amendment\u2019s guaranty of due process.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He relies upon such cases as Harris v. Harris, 137 U.S.App.D.C. 318, 424 F.2d 806 (1970) and Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 76 S.Ct. 585, 100 L. Ed. 891 (1956) as typical and as illustrative of principles<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which, if here applied, would remedy his situation and would serve \u201ca social need.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\">Thus, he asks us to order the Commissioner to proceed with the examination of his application, even though he has not paid the fee prescribed by Congress and although Congress has accorded no authority to the Commissioner to waive the prescribed payment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He asks us, in effect, to <em>order </em>the Commissioner to permit him to proceed in the Patent Office just as pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a), he has been permitted to proceed in our courts. But that section clearly does not apply to the Patent Office. Its explicit language applies only to the Federal Courts: any court of the United States may authorize in forma pauperis proceedings as to any action \u201ctherein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-5\">We perceive here no constitutional deprivation, no arbitrariness on the part of the Commissioner, and no predicate for the appellant\u2019s claims. Accordingly, we decline to enter the order the appellant seeks. Rather, we do say that Congress has granted a privilege, open to all, and has created no requirements which can be said to be unnecessary to what Congress in the exercise of its plenary power deems essential to the effective working of the patent system. Obviously, there are differences in the economic circumstances of our citizenry which exist quite apart from any exercise of the privilege which Congress has conferred. Congress simply has here done nothing to alleviate the consequences of those differences.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-12\">This applicant in effect has asked this court to order discrimination in his favor. He asks to be permitted without charge to do what all others must pay for.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, where the <em>law </em>has not discriminated against him, he would have us say that the Commissioner is bound to discriminate to his advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-13\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-14\">To recapitulate, it is apparent that the duty of the Commissioner stems from a clear statutory requirement. There is no grant of discretionary power to him. Of course, if he had such power and had declined to exercise it, a very different question would be presented.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Under the circumstances here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>presented, mandamus surely is not available<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to us to the end that we substitute by our order a result for which Congress has made no provision.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1107-4\">This appellant\u2019s petition in the respects under consideration must be addressed to the law-making authority.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We have given him carefully the only consideration open to us and find ourselves forced to the conclusion that he has failed to state a claim for which relief may be had.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">The order of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"AZH\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1105-8\">. Despite the inartful pleading, we are satisfied that the appellant showed he was authorized to proceed in the District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a), Sikora v. Brenner, 126 U.S.App.D.C. 357, 359, 379 F.2d 134, 136 (1967), and that the court had jurisdiction of the action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338(a). The Commissioner\u2019s action here we take to he final. Cf. Commissioner of Patents v. Whiteley, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 522, 533, 18 L.Ed. 335 (1866). See generally, Adkins v. E. I. Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co., 335 U.S. 331, 69 S.Ct. 85, 93 L.Ed. 43 (1948) and the interesting outline in Smith v. Johnston, 109 F.2d 152 (9 Cir. 1940).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1105-11\">. The appellant has made no contention that he is entitled somehow to financial assistance in complying with the intricate requirements of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 112, 113 and 114 to the extent applicable. Compare Leighton v. Coe, 76 U.S.App.D.C. 212, 130 F.2d 841 (1942) where an in forma pauperis applicant sought an allowance for expenses to appear in the district court then reviewing Patent Office proceedings. We there observed that the court made no such allowance for it had no power under the statutes to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1105-19\">. \u201cShall\u201d is the language of command, Escoe v. Zerbst, 295 U.S. 490, 493, 55 S.Ct. 818, 79 L.Ed. 1566 (1935) as Mr. Justice Cardozo observed for a unanimous court. And see the discussion by Mr. Justice Stone in Richbourg Motor Co. v. United States, 281 U.S. 528, 534, 50 S.Ct. 385, 74 L.Ed. 1016 (1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-21\">We may note in passing that 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 145 in authorizing a civil action against the commissioner provides that \u201c[a] 11 the expenses of the proceedings <em>shall </em>be paid by the applicant.\u201d (Emphasis added). See Robertson v. Cooper, 46 F.2d 766, 769 (4 Cir. 1931) and Watson v. Allen, 107 U.S.App.D.C. 25, 274 F.2d 87 (1959).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1105-23\">. As to other comparable instances see Currin v. Wallace, 306 U.S. 1, 13-14, 59 S.Ct. 379, 83 L.Ed. 441 (1939) and Detroit Bank v. United States, 317 U.S. 329, 337-338, 63 S.Ct. 297, 87 L.Ed. 304 (1943).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1106-6\">. He realizes that the Fifth Amendment does not contain the equal protection clause to be found in the Fourteenth Amendment, applicable to the states, but treats the two concepts as elided, claiming that, basically, discrimination underlies either approach. Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499, 74 S.Ct. 693, 98 L.Ed. 884 (1954); cf. Lee v. Habib, 137 U.S.App.D.C. 403, 413-414, 424 F.2d 891, 901-902 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1106-7\">. But in <em>Harris </em>we noted the existence of a statutory right to file an action for divorce, and in <em>Griffin </em>the court had recognized a constitutional requirement which must be met.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1106-8\">. Cf. Miller v. United States, 317 U.S. 192, 198, 63 S.Ct. 187, 87 L.Ed. 179 (1942); Douglas v. Green, 327 F.2d 661 (6 Cir. 1964); In re Fullam, 80 U.S. App.D.C. 273, 152 F.2d 141 (1945).

We doubt that it could effectively be contended that one in appellant\u2019s circumstances would be entitled, without fee, to register an automobile in the District of Columbia when all others must pay a registration fee. Again, the Supreme Court has found no such invidious discrimination against an indigent as to render invalid a state law requiring him to provide compulsory liability insurance. See Ex parte Poresky, 290 U.S. 30, 54 S.Ct. 3, 78 L. Ed. 152 (1933).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1106-18\">. Coe v. United States ex rel.

Biddle, 177 F.2d 579, 581 (2 Cir. 1949), cert. denied 339 U.S. 949, 70 S.Ct. 803, 94 L.Ed. 1363 (1950).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1107-6\">LEVENTHAL, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ATfS\">(joining and concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-7\">I join in Judge Danaher\u2019s opinion, adding some observations because they help give me additional perspective for denying petitioner\u2019s claim of constitutional right, as an indigent, to process a patent application without payment of the statutory fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-8\">Equal protection concepts begin with the requirement of a standard that is non-discriminatory; here the statute obviously requires one and all to pay the fee. Constitutional requirements also dictate that in some matters the weak and helpless be relieved of burdens that may be and are applied generally without constitutional hindrance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-17\">Thus the Supreme Court has held that an indigent who is a defendant in a criminal case has the constitutional right to have the state supply him, without payment of fees, counsel and a transcript<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for which others must pay. In Harper,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> invalidating the poll tax, the Court said there is close scrutiny and careful confinement of classifications that affect \u201cfundamental rights and liberties,\u201d that wealth \u201cis not germane\u201d to voting and the right to vote is \u201ctoo precious, too fundamental\u201d to be conditioned on a fee. <em>Harper </em>indicates that the area of \u201cfundamental rights\u201d is not limited by the assumptions of the past. In Sniadach<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Court invalidated pre-judgment wage garnishments. The <em>Boddie </em>case involves the right of an indigent to access to civil courts for a divorce without payment of fee.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1107-18\">By no means, however, does the Constitution embody as a present requirement an egalitarian philosophy that supposes that all men can be put in exactly equal condition as to all matters involving the Government. As the learning cited by Judge Danaher indicates, a man cannot insist that his indigency establishes a constitutional right to drive a car without, <em>e. g., </em>paying the cost of insurance required for the protection of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>others,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or of safety devices and government inspection services.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1108-4\">Drawing the line between what is constitutionally permitted and prohibited will be an ongoing process. I think it clear, however, that in the case of a fee required as an incident to the Government\u2019s processing a request for an award of a monopoly of commercial value, there is no \u201cfundamental right\u201d that carves a constitutional exception for the indigent.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1107-21\">.

It may be that even where some fees are permissible, an indigent could raise a separate constitutional question protesting an invidious and unnecessary hardship wrought by a fee requirement totally disproportionate to any justified state interest. It seems obvious that the statutory fees, less than $100 for petitioner, make only a modest payment toward the cost to the Government of processing patent applications. There is no contention before us to the contrary.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
