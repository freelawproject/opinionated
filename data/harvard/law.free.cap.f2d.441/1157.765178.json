It shows that the State of Florida no longer holds any detainers against the appellant because the appellant now has been tried and convicted of two charges of issuing worthless checks, and the remaining three charges were nolle prosequied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-16\">Since the record before this court clearly shows that the complained-of detainers have been removed, the appeal from the district court\u2019s ruling has no merit. See Lackey v. Alabama, 5th Cir. 1970, 434 F.2d 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1220-11\">. It is appropriate to dispose of this pro se case summarily, pursuant to this Court\u2019s local Rule 9(c) (2), appellant having failed to file a brief within the time fixed by Rule 31, Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.
