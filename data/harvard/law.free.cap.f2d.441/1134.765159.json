Citizens Casualty Co. of New York et al., 5 Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 409.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1197-5\">AINSWORTH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1197-6\">Appellant David Johnson, Jr. appeals from his conviction under the National Firearms Act of 1968, of having knowingly and unlawfully possessed a sawed-off shotgun, which firearm had not been registered to him, in violation of Title 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1197-7\">On appeal Johnson contends that Section 5861(d) is violative of his privilege against self-incrimination, conflicts with his constitutional right to keep and bear arms, and is vague and indefinite. We have considered all of appellant\u2019s contentions and find them without merit, and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-8\">Appellant bases his self-incriminatory argument on Haynes v. United States, 390 U.S. 85, 88 S.Ct. 722, 19 L.Ed.2d 923 (1968), in which the Supreme Court held that petitioner\u2019s \u201cclaim of the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination provides a full defense to prosecutions either for failure to register a firearm under \u00a7 5841 or for possession of an unregistered firearm under \u00a7 5851.\u201d 390 U.S. at 100, 88 S.Ct. at 732. <em>Haynes </em>was decided under the then existing National Firearms Act. Congress subsequently amended the Act in its entirety and substituted the new National Firearms Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1197-9\">The recent Supreme Court decision in United States v. Freed, 401 U.S. 601, 91 S.Ct. 1112, 28 L.Ed.2d 356, in which Section 5861(d) (the section with which we are here concerned) was challenged, completely disposes of appellant\u2019s contentions that the Act is self-incriminatory. The Court expressly concluded \u201cthat the amended Act does not violate the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment which provides that no person \u2018shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u2019 As noted, a lawful transfer of a firearm may be accomplished only if it is already registered. The transferor\u2014not the transferee\u2014does the registering.\u201d 401 U.S. at 605, 91 S.Ct. at 1116.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Similarly, <em>Freed </em>is dispositive of appellant\u2019s subsidiary contention that compliance with the federal statute would result in self-incriminating admissions under state law. This argument was made and rejected in <em>Freed. </em>The Court said, \u201cSince the states and other federal agencies never see the information, he is left in the same position as if he had not given it, but \u2018had claimed his privilege in the absence of a * * * grant of immunity.\u2019 Murphy v. Waterfront Comm\u2019n., 378 U.S. 52, 79, 84 S.Ct. 1594, 12 L.Ed.2d 678. This, combined with the protection against use to prove prior or concurrent offenses satisfies the Fifth Amendment requirements respecting self-incrimination.\u201d 401 U.S. at 606, 91 S.Ct. at 1117.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-11\">Appellant\u2019s contention that the Act is unconstitutionally vague is likewise disposed of by <em>Freed. </em>Appellant argues that the statute fails to provide for the fortuity of possessing an abandoned weapon and for the criminal consequences thereof. It is evident from <em>Freed </em>that neither specific intent nor knowledge that the firearm is registered is required under the Act. 401 U.S. at 356, 91 S.Ct. at 1112. See also the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Brennan wherein he notes that \u201cno intent at all need be proved in regard to one element of the offense\u2014the unregistered status <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1136\">*1136</page-number>of the [firearm].\u201d 401 U.S. at 612, 91 S.Ct. at 1120. Thus possession of such a firearm, if unregistered, whether abandoned or not, is prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-4\">Appellant\u2019s remaining contention, that his constitutional right to bear arms has been infringed by the Act, misconstrues the Second Amendment which provides that \u201cA well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d The Supreme Court dealt with such a constitutional attack directed against the National Firearms Act of 1934 in United States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174, 178, 59 S.Ct. 816, 818, 83 L.Ed. 1206 (1939), in holding that \u201cIn absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a \u2018shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length\u2019 at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AZVi\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1197-12\">. Section 5861(d) makes it unlawful for any person \u201cto receive or possess a firearm which is not registered to him in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1197-13\">. The revision was made in order to eliminate the objectional provisions of the Act found in <em>Haynes. </em>See 1968 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Adm.News, pp. 4435, 6042, 6046; S.Rep.No.1501, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. 26, 42, 48, 52; H.Rep.No.1956, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. 35; United States v. Freed, 401 U.S. 601, 91 S.Ct. 1112; United States v. Black, 6 Cir., 1970, 431 F.2d 524.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1197-16\">. We used the same reasoning in upholding the constitutionality of a similar section of the Act in United States v. Ramsey, 5 Cir., 1970, 429 F.2d 565. See also Marshall v. United States, 5 Cir., 1970, 422 F.2d 185, and Burton v. United States, 5 Cir., 1969, 414 F.2d 261.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
