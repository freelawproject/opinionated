Taxpayer\u2019s claim is that the money he received from the University of Kansas Medical Center qualifies as a deduction from gross income as a fellowship under \u00a7 117 I.R.C. 1954.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-30\">The case was tried to Judge Oliver with jury waived. Judge Oliver made detailed findings of fact and concluded that the money paid taxpayer was compensation for his services as a resident physician and was not given to him as a scholarship. Judge Oliver\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1228-31\">We affirm upon the basis of Judge Oliver\u2019s opinion reported at 315 F.Supp. 34.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
