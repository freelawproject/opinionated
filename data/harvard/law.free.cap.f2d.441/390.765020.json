Army Reg. 635-5 \u00b6 7b (January 23, 1967). Under regulations implementing 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1163 (1964 and Supp.1971), various procedural rights are accorded a member of a reserve component who is separated for cause. Army Reg. 635-105 \u00a7 2-10 (1968). Officers with at least three years commissioned service are entitled to a board of inquiry and the concomitant procedural rights; in the case of officers with less service, a hearing is required only if an \u201cother than honorable\u201d separation is indicated. Army Reg. 635-105 \u00a7 2-15 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-19\">While appellee was on duty in Germany in 1969, his commanding officer recommended that he be discharged for \u201cMismanagement of personal affairs to the discredit of the service\u201d and \u201cConduct unbecoming an officer.\u201d The specific conduct charged against Lunsford involved passing dishonored checks, entering into financial transactions with an enlisted member of his unit, and ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>cepting quarters allowance though he was occupying government quarters. It was also charged that he was found in a room with a German woman at 5:00 a. m. and that this woman had in her possession an ID and ration card issued in the name of Lunsford\u2019s wife. Lunsford was advised that since he had not had three years service, he could not appear before a board of inquiry but could only submit a written rebuttal. After receiving this rebuttal, and after numerous procedural steps including a recommendation from a Lt. General Bennett that appellee \u201cbe furnished with a Discharge Certificate Under Other Than Honorable Conditions,\u201d the. Army determined to separate appellee with a General Discharge certificate, and ordered him to proceed from Germany to Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn, N. Y., for separation. Appellee then instituted this action claiming regulatory, statutory and constitutional violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Although Judge Dooling admitted that \u201cit is not clear from the final papers in the series of papers\u201d what discharge appellee was to receive, he decided that the Army was ignoring its own regulations requiring a board of inquiry if a discharge under \u201cother than honorable conditions\u201d was to be furnished. This he based on the assumption (which he indicated all parties assumed as well) that such discharge would be for \u201cmoral or professional dereliction.\u201d He therefore enjoined the appellants from giving effect to the determination to eliminate appellee \u201cuntil he is accorded the rights provided by Army Reg. 635-1025 \u00a7 2-10 (1968).\u201d Were the assumption under which Judge Dooling proceeded correct, we would agree with his holding. At the argument of this appeal, however, appellant\u2019s counsel affirmatively stated to this court that appellee was to be given a General Discharge Under Honorable Conditions. This statement has been confirmed by a letter from counsel. Though the confusion engendered at the district court level is understandable, and though Judge Dooling\u2019s assumption was justified under the circumstances, we feel that a remand is in order. The appellee is prepared to present argument based on the assumption that he will be given a General Discharge Under Honorable Conditions. These arguments should first be passed upon by the district judge. Consequently we remand the case to Judge Dooling on the basis of the explicit judicial admission made by the Army through counsel for appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Lunsford has also applied for an order restraining respondents from releasing him from active duty pending determination of his appeal. \u25a0 We remand this application to Judge Dooling to be dealt with in connection with his consideration of the issues of the discharge.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
