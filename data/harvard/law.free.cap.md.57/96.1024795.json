Biddison, Adm\u2019r of Lydia P. Millichopp vs. Lydia A. Mosely, et al. </em>It is really but a continuation of that case. We therefore refer <em>to </em>the statement of facts contained in that case, for the full understanding of this.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Subsequent to the order of the Orphans\u2019 Court, by \u2022which the appellant\u2019s letters of administration upon the estate of Lydia, P. Millichopp were revoked, and after the appeal from that order had been prayed and granted, the Orphans\u2019 Court passed an order dismissing that appeal, for the reasons stated in the former case. Having so done the Orphans\u2019 Court appointed the appellee administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of Lydia P. Millichopp. Afterwards on the 4th of January, 1881, upon the application of the appellee, the Orphans\u2019 Court passed the order of sequestration which forms the subject of appeal in this case. It does not appear that a formal appeal was taken from the order appointing the appellee administrator; hut the decision of this appeal involves the validity of the order; and the appellee\u2019s counsel say in their brief, that is the sole question in this case. At the hearing of the cause in this Court it was admitted, and we have so decided in the other case, that the order of the Orphans\u2019 Court, dismissing the \u25a0appeal of this appellant from the order revoking his letters, was a nullity and did not affect the appeal; but the same was heard and decided. Pending that appeal, the appellant remained the administrator, and could not he disturbed, in his office. <em>State, use of Calvert vs. Williams, </em>9 <em>Gill, </em>172. Any proceeding therefore which displaced him pending his appeal, and took the funds of the estate from Ills hands was unwarranted, and in flat violation of the rule laid down in <em>State, use of Calvert vs. Williams. </em>Section 74, page 776, of the Revised Code, which is relied on as justifying the proceeding cannot he held to sustain it. That provision is section 43 of Article 5 of the Code of 1860, and is one of the provisions of the Act of 1798. It was in force when this Court made the decision in the case just cited. 'Whatever was contemplated by it, it is clear that it does not authorize the appointment of a <em>new </em>administrator pending the appeal, and the sequestration of the other administrator\u2019s property; as was done here for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>money actually paid away, according <em>to his </em>sworn answer,, to persons entitled as distributees.
