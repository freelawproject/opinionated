Inst., </em>10 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>299, is identically similar to this, and precisely the same reasoning applies to both. At the time that decision was rendered, there was the same prohibition against the exercise of banking powers that is now contained in the Act of 18(58, oh. 471. It was contended there, that the Legislature had precluded itself from granting banking-powers to the corporation in question, just as it is argued hero, that the Legislature has prohibited any corporation from exercising such powers, and the reasoning with which the Court overruled the proposition in that case, applies with equal force to this. It has been supposed that this case has been overruled by an <em>obiter dictum, </em>that fell from this Court in <em>Hammond vs. Straus, </em>53 <em>Md., 1, </em>but a reference to that case shows that the case of <em>Duncan vs. The Savings Institution, </em>was not even referred to in the opinion of the Court; that in passing, this Court merely remarked that the Union Banking Company had exercised certain hanking privileges wbicli were not provided for in the general incorporation law, and which it must, therefore, have exercised under the special Act which was under discussion in that case. The question as to whether a savings institution could discount a negotiable promissory note, was not before the Court in that case, ' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>and was not even indirectly involved in the controversy. The hanking privilege, which the Legislature intended to-interdict, was the issuing of negotiable bills and notes,, as a circulating medium in the community. This is an important as well as a dangerous franchise, and it was intended that no corporation should exercise it, unless under the safeguards provided for by the Constitution. The discotinting of a note is not a privilege of any sort;, any individual can discount paper. The language of tlieAct is to invest its funds in good security; a note may he the very best sort of security. Commercial paper, as a general thing, is certainly a better security than speculative stocks or bonds. Why should the taking of that class of securities be excluded, then, from the, operation of the Act? Eeceiving deposits is a hanking privilege,, yet a savings institution, as has been said in the above-case, could receive deposits without any enabling Act of Assembly for that purpose. It will he furthermore noticed that there is no evidence in this record that the-corporation was in the habit of discounting notes, or invested all its funds in that way. On the contrary, the-only evidence before the Court was that it discounted this one single promissory note.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-5\">It is, therefore submitted, that this question is <em>res adjudicaba </em>in this State; that while decisions may he found which incline to the contrary in other States, they all rest upon statutory legislation, which expressly prohibits this class of corporations from exercising'the power of' discounting paper. In this State there exists no prohibitory legislation upon this subject; on the conti\u2019ary, the Act of Assembly, under which this institution was incorporated, in express terms, by any construction that can he placed upon its language, gives it the right and power to use its funds in this manner. <em>Duncan vs. The Maryland Savings </em>Institution, 10 <em>Gill &amp; John., </em>299; <em>Gee vs. The Alabama Life Insurance and Trust Company, </em>13 <em>Ala</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number><em>bama, </em>579 ; <em>U.

Corwin vs. The Urbana and Champaign Mutual Insurance Company, </em>14 <em>Ohio, </em>6.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-5\">The defendant, is estopped from questioning the right of the corporation to discount this note. The principle that a corporation cannot exceed its chartered powers, is invoked for the benefit of those who would suffer by the exercise of the unlawful power. This is not a case in which a stockholder or depositor of this institution is contending for the illegality of the transaction, or attempting to prevent the corporation from exercising a power not conferred by its charter; but it is the case of an executed contract, as far as the corporation is concerned, and of a party who has received the full benefit of the transaction attempting to evade the corresponding responsibility that he has incurred. The appellee presents this note to this corporation, procures it to be discounted upon the faith of his endorsement, and when the note matures, refuses payment, upon the ground that the corporation had no right to discount the note which it received upon the faith of his own act; and he does this without pretending to return the consideration that has been paid upon the note. What then would be the consequence of allowing the principle of <em>ultra vires, </em>to operate in a case of this sort. It would re-act upon the very class of persons, (creditors and stockholders,) for whose benefit and advantage alone it exists. They do not claim that the corporation could not exercise this power ; on the contrary, they depend upon the proceeds of this and other notes for a return of the money which they have deposited in this institution. To call into play the doctrine of <em>ultra vires, </em>in this case, would prevent the creditors of this insolvent corporation from following its funds into the hands of the persons who have received them; and would entirely preclude them from obtaining even the smallest return for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>the savings and earnings which they have entrusted to this corporation. Whatever conflict there may be in the earlier decisions on this subject, it is submitted that the-better considered authorities, and especially those in this State, establish the existence of the doctrine of estoppel <em>in pais </em>in a case of this sort. <em>Albert and Wife vs. The Savings Bank, et al., </em>11 <em>Md., </em>172 ; <em>Shoemaker vs. The National Mechanics\u2019 Bank, </em>31 <em>Md., </em>396 ; <em>Steam Navigation Company vs. Weed, </em>17 <em>Barbour, </em>378; 2 <em>Potter\u2019s Law of Corporations, p. </em>663, <em>secs. </em>538, 548, and cases referred to on said page;</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b148-5\"><em>H.

The Court said, \u201cto prove the fact of acceptance, it was only necessary to show, in connection with the Act of incorporation itsolfj that the parties incorporated had actually used and exercised the privileges conferred by the Act, and if such act of user and exercise of privileges could only be referred to the Act of incorporation, would fully justify the presumption that the Act of incorporation had been accepted,77 and \u201c that the facts and circumstances, in proof, required that the question of acceptance of the Act of incorporation should have been submitted to the jury,77 and \u201c that the Act contains the grant of large and valuable franchises, that the same parties named in the Act were afterwards found conducting a regular banking business, under a name substantially that authorized by the legislative Act of incorporation, with all the external <em>indicia </em>of a regularly organized bank of discount and deposit such as that Act authorized, and when the exercise of such power would have been illegal and wholly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>\u25a0unauthorized under the law if not derived from the Act of 1874, ch. 118,\u2018constituted evidence certainly tending'to prove that the Act of incorporation had been accepted.\u201d The Court had the precise question before it of what was, and what was not banking powers ; and the Court decided that conducting a bank of discount and deposit was illegal and wholly unauthorized under the Act of 1868, ch. 471. The case of <em>Hammond vs. Straus </em>in effect overrules <em>Duncan vs. Md. Sav. Inst., </em>10 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>299. The Court could not certainly have meant to decide that a corporation formed under the Act of 1868, ch. 471, could discount notes ; but that they could not receive deposits, and if they discounted notes and also received deposits they were doing a banking business, when the Act of 1868, ch. 471, sec. 152, under which the Union Banking Company, of Baltimore City was formed, same as the appellant, authorized it to receive deposits.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-5\">The contract was in violation of the appellant\u2019s charter, and Chief Judge GtA\u00ed\u00eddiker, of New York, speaking of contracts in violation of banking Acts, says : \u201c That the contract was not only unauthorized, but illegal.

Such cases rest upon the principle that the contract was an innocent or lawful one; and in this respect differs from a case where the act was illegal and expressly prohibited by law.

The second clause of its certificate states, \u201cthat the corporation so formed, is a corporation for the purpose of receiving from any person or persons or bodies corporate or politic, any deposit of money, which shall be invested or loaned out on good security, in the discretion of its directors, as provided for in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>Article 26, Maryland Code of Public General Laws, secs. 152 to 155 ; that the term of existence of the said corporation is limited to forty years ; and that the said corporation is formed upon the articles, conditions and provisions herein expressed, and subject in all particulars to the limitations relating to corporations, which are contained in the General Laws of the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The fourth clause of the certificate certifies, \u201c that the-aggregate of' the capital stock of the said corporation -is one hundred thousand dollars, and that the said capital is divided into four thousand shares of the par value of' twenty-five dollars each.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">In March, 1818, the note upon which this suit was. instituted, was discounted by this corporation, and its. collection is resisted on the ground, that having been incorporated under the provisions of the Act of J868, it not only acquired no power to discount, hut is, by the second section of that Act, expressly prohibited from doing such business.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">By the second section of this Act of 1868 it is provided \u201c that no corporation created or to he created, and not expressly incorporated for banking purposes, shall by any implication or construction be authorized to exercise banking privileges, or to issue any note, token, device, scrip, or other evidence of debt to be used as currency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">The lower Court instructed the jury \u201cthat if they shall find from the evidence that the plaintiff was incorporated under the provisions of the Act of 1868, ch. 411, secs. 152' to 155 inclusive, and was not expressly incorporated for banking purposes, then the said plaintiff was prohibited from discounting the promissory note which is the cause of' action in this case; and if they shall further find that the promissory note was discounted by the plaintiff, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover and their verdict must he for the defendant.\u201d The appellant contends this ruling was. error, and relies on the decision of this Court in <em>Duncan vs. The Maryland Savings Institution, </em>10 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>299.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>That there is strong analogy between that case and the one at bar cannot be denied ; but the analogy is not perfect ; and in view of the very broad language of the second section of the Act of 1868, ch. 471, as contrasted with the language of the several Acts of Assembly involved in the decision of the <em>Duncan Case, </em>we do not think that case can control the decision of this. In that case the Maryland Savings Institution had discounted a note and brought suit to collect it, as here the receivers of the United German Bank have done. As is done in \u2022 this case, payment was resisted on the ground, that the Maryland Savings Institution had no power to discount and in fact was prohibited from discounting, and therefore, could not recover. The institution was incorporated by ch. 189 of the Acts of 1826. The third section of the Act of incorporation among other tilings provides, that it shall be competent for the corporation <em>\u201c </em>to regulate the manner of receiving deposits,\u201d and \u201c to provide for the investment of the funds of the corporation in such manner as they shall deem most safe and beneficial.\u201d The fourth section provides that \u201csaid corporation shall be capable of receiving from any person, or persons, any deposit or deposits of money, and that all moneys so received shall be invested in stocks or other securities at the discretion of the directors, and in the manner deemed most safe and beneficial.\u201d The same section exempted the members of the corporation from personal liability for the debts of the corporation, and that no funds should, be loaned to an officer or director of the institution. By the sixth section of its charter, it was declared that nothing in this Act shall be held or construed to authorize the company incorporated by this Act, to do any act or acts inconsistent with the privileges secured to the existing banking institutions in the City of Baltimore, by the Acts of 1813, ch. 12*2, and 1821, ch. 131, or by any other Act or Acts now in force.\u201d The eleventh section of each of the last mentioned Acts had pledged the faith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>of the State, to the banks accepting the provisions of those Acts, and doing what was thereby required of them, not \u201c to grant to any other bank \u201d in Baltimore a charter until after a designated period, which had not expired when that charter was granted; and the sixth section above quoted was inserted in compliance with that pledge, for the purpose of restricting the institution thereby incorporated to a business not violative of the banks\u2019 rights under the State\u2019s pledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Judge Dorsey in delivering the opinion of the Court said, \u201cthat banking powers have been defined to consist of the right of issuing negotiable notes, discounting notes and receiving deposits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">He then said, \u201c if the creation of a corporation with any one of these banking powers is a violation of the faith of the State, then the incorporation of the Maryland Savings Institution is a violation of that pledge, whether the right of discounting be granted or not.\u201d He said that the right \u201c to receive deposits was a banking privilege,\u201d and although that was conferred, it was not contended that thereby the pledge of the State was violated. The Court therefore concluded that the right to discount was not intended to be prohibited, but that which was intended was the banking power of issuing notes to be used as a currency. The pledge of the State in the Acts of 1813 and 1821, was a sipiple pledge not to charter any other bank in Baltimore City within the designated period. It was a promise on the part of the State, in consideration of the acceptance by the banks then existing of the conditions of their existence and tax on them, not to create any other corporation with their collective or aggregate powers. Unless the institution therefore did or could use all the powers of a bank, it was not a violation of that pledge ;.and the sixth section of the charter of the Maryland Savings Institution was given a construction having that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>The law before us now for construction is broader and more emphatic. The second section of the Act of 1868, ch. 471, is very express. It says, <em>\u201c </em>no corporation not expressly incorporated for banking purposes shall by any implication or construction be authorized to exercise banking privileges, or to issue any note, token, device, scrip, or other evidence of debt to be used as currency.\u201d With the exception of the inhibition against implication or construction being resorted to, to accord to institutions not expressly incorporated as banks in their full sense, banking privileges, it is the same provision which is found in the seventeenth section of the Code of 1860; and that section is taken from the Act of 1852, ch. 231, sec. 5. The provision, in substance, is therefore not a new one, but an old one rendered more stringent and emphatic by the addition of the language forbidding the resort to implication and construction to accord privileges not expressly and unambiguously conferred. It is a plain declaration by the Legislature, that the natural meaning of language is not to be tortured by construction or implication to include privileges not expressly given. The charter of the institution in <em>express terms </em>gives nothing but the power to receive and invest deposits. The .language of the second section of the Act of 1868, is as plainly directed against other privileges as it is against the issuance of notes as currency, The only privileges belonging to banks besides issuing notes, are to receive moneys on deposit, and the right to discount promissory notes. These three privileges arc given by Judge Dorsey in <em>Duncan vs. The Maryland Savings Institution, </em>10 <em>G. &amp; </em>J., 299, as answering the definition of bank privileges.\u201d He cites <em>The People vs. President, &amp;c. of Manhattan Co., 5 Conn., </em>383 ; and <em>The People vs. Utica Insurance Company, </em>15 <em>Johns., </em>390. To these may be added <em>Morse on Banking, </em>2 ; <em>New York Fire Insurance Co. vs. Ely, </em>5 <em>Conn., </em>573.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Row, the prohibition of this second section of the Act of 1868, oh. 471, cannot mean the right or privilege of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>receiving deposits, to be included within the inhibition, for the very Act of which it is a part, allows the incorporation of institutions in express terms, with the power of receiving deposits. The. prohibition is, therefore, to be read as if it had said, \u201c such bank privileges as are not accorded by this Act.\u201d The right to receive deposits, then, is to be excluded, as not within the meaning and contemplation of the Legislature. But one privilege, included in the definition of \u201cbank privileges,\u201d is left to be intended by the words \u201cbanking privileges,\u201d which precede the words \u201cor issue any note,\u201d <em>&amp;'c., </em>as currency, in the section under discussion-. The first part of the section before thq express mention \u201c of notes to be used as currency,\u201d must mean something; and as receiving deposits is necessarily excluded, by subsequent express provisions in the Act allowing to corporations, such as this corporation is, the power of receiving deposits, discounting must be the thing intended to be prohibited by the phrase \u201c banking privileges.\u201d Any other construction would not accord to every word of the Act its full meaning. \u201cImplication or construction\u201d could not possibly set aside a direct inhibition of issuing notes as currency. Those words manifestly were introduced to prevent something else. If the issuance of notes as currency was alone intended to be prevented, that would have been effectually accomplished by omitting all that is said about banking privileges. It would seem as if language had been expressly chosen to prevent an interpretation such as was given the Acts of Assembly involved in the <em>Duncan Case; </em>for the law says, it shall not be held by \u201cimplication or construction \u201d to embrace banking privileges. In the case of <em>Hammond vs. Straus, </em>53 <em>Md., </em>1, this view was taken of the provisions of this second section of the Act of 1868, ch. 411; although it was only incidentally considered and applied, and that, without any special reference to the case of <em>Duncan, </em>in 10 <em>G. &amp; J. </em>; for it does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>appear that the case was cited in argument, or was in the mind of the Court. The language of the statutes considered in that case, was materially different; and we do not pretend to question the propriety of that decision. In this case, we think the statute, by logical test, is free from ambiguity, and properly controlled the decision of the case of <em>Hammond vs. Straus. </em>There the Court said, that \u201cdiscounting notes,\u201d among other acts, which could only be referred to the authority by legislative charter, to carry on banking was an act, with others, to go to the jury, from which the jury might find the \u201c Union Banking Company\u201d had accepted the charter given by the Legislature. To be evidence, the Court said, the several acts of the company must be such as could only be referrible to <em>banking </em>authority, \u201c and as <em>would be illegal and void\u201d </em>acts, unless they could be so referred. It was, therefore, a determination by the Court, that, by virtue of the charter, acquired by certificate, made, executed and certified under the Act of 1868, it could not discount; for, if it could do so under that charter, it was clearly not evidence of having accepted another.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Both, upon reason and upon authority therefore, we think the appellant, The United German Bank, had no authority to <em>discount </em>promissory notes. It does not follow, as a consequence of this view, that because the appellant exceeded its legitimate powers in procuring this note by discounting the same, that recovery cannot bo had. If he received the plaintiffs money, or was the knowing instrument of some one else doing so, he ought not to escape liability to paj^ on that ground. It might be good ground for proceedings to forfeit its charter, but, in a case Eke this, it is not available as a defence. In 2 <em>Potter\u2019s Laxo of </em>Corporations, 663, it is stated, that there are some well recognized legal and moral distinctions, in respect to this doctrine of <em>ultra vires ; </em>\u201cone of which is between executory and executed contracts.\u201d As to executory contracts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>\u201c if made in excess of authority the Courts, at the instance of.a stockholder, will interfere to prevent performance, because such contracts contemplate an unauthorized diversion of corporate funds, and are, therefore, a breach of trust. But the rule is different in regard to <em>executed </em>contracts ; these by the plainest rule of good faith should he permitted to stand.\u201d A large array of authorities is cited by the learned author in support of the statement in the text. And <em>Sedgwick </em>in his work on <em>Constitutional Laio, </em>page 73, says, that although a corporation in making a contract \u201c acts in disagreement with its charter,\u201d yet \u201c a party, who has had the benefit of the agreement, cannot be permitted to question its validity.\u201d The doctrine thus stated by these text-writers is fully sustained by judicial decisions in this State, the Supreme Court of the United States, and several States of the Union. <em>Abbott and Wife vs. The Savings </em>Bank, 2 <em>Md., </em>172 ; <em>National Mechanics\u2019 Bank vs. Shoemaker, </em>31 <em>Md., </em>396 ; <em>Steam Navigation Case, </em>17 <em>Barbour, </em>378; 53 <em>Howard\u2019s Practice Reports, </em>506; 6 <em>Otto, </em>258; 8 <em>Otto, </em>621; 63 <em>N. Y., </em>62.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">The principle upon which all these decisions proceeds is, that it is inequitable to permit one who has received the proceeds and benefit of the contract, to repudiate it on the ground, that the corporation from which he has obtained the benefit had no power to make the contract. It has been insisted in argument that the case of <em>Jesse Lazear vs. The National Union Bank of Baltimore, </em>52 <em>Md., </em>78, has established a different doctrine in Maryland. We do not understand that case to establish that where there is entire privity between the parties recovery may not be had. In that case the suit was upon the guaranty of the defendant, and he was not found to have been privy to the transaction by which the . money was procured. The distinction is material and substantial. It is the person who actually participates in the contract, that is to be held' liable, in the case of an executed contract, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>under the rule laid down in the authorities cited. In this ease the appellee endorsed with the knowledge that the note was to be taken by the bank by way of discount. He signed his name with the knowledge that the money was to be given by the bank upon that being done. He is shown to have gone to the bank to give his name on the paper. Whether he received the money personally or not is immaterial, if by his procurement some one else did get the money upon the faith of what he did. It was all one transaction. Under the circumstances we do not think he can be heard to dispute the bank\u2019s right to recover, on the ground that it. exceeded its charter rights in discounting the note. We think the Court erred in granting the instruction given.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b159-6\">(Decided 1st July, 1881.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">\n<em>Reversed and neio trial awarded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b159-7\">Babtol, C.

This is not, in my judgment, such an exercise of \u201c banking privileges\u201d as was intended tobe prohibited or forbidden by the <em>second </em>section of the Act.

In section 29 of that Act, Savings Institutions are mentioned as one of the classes of corporations authorized to be formed under the general provisions of the statute; and by section 152 it is enacted \u201cthat any Savings Institution incorporated under this Article, shall be capable of receiving from any person or persons, or bodies corporate or politic, any deposit of money, which <em>shall be invested or loaned out on good security in the discretion of the directors ; </em>provided no part of the funds of said corporation shall be loaned to any officer or director of such corporation.\u201d The power to receive deposits and the power to invest or loan them out on good security, are powers essential to the existence of such institutions. The question then is, does the power to invest or loan out the deposits on good security include the power to <em>discount </em>bills or notes. Thirty years before this Act was passed, language substantially and almost identically the same, had received an authoritative construction by the Court of Appeals in the case of <em>Duncan vs. Maryland Savings Institution, </em>10 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>299. In that case the institution sued the maker of a promissory note which it had <em>discounted, </em>and one of the main questions to be determined, as stated by the Court, was, had the plaintiff \u201cthe power of lending out any portion of its deposits, or of discounting therewith, promissory notes or other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>securities for debt?\u201d Its charter provided that \u201csaid corporation shall he capable of receiving from any person or persons, any deposit or deposits of money, and that all moneys so received shall he invested in stocks <em>or other securities </em>at the discretion of the directors, and in the manner deemed most safe .and beneficial,\u201d with a proviso that no part of its fund should be loaned to any officer or director of the corporation. This was the provision construed in that case, and it becomes necessary to quote the very language of the Court, as delivered by Judge Donsby, to see what construction was placed upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">\u201c In incorporating this company,\u201d say the Court, \u201cit was not the design of the Legislature to create a mere stock-jobbing institution, the funds of which were to he kept employed in buying and selling stocks, which, from the nature of business in receiving and paying off deposits, must have been the case, if all funds were exclusively-appropriated to the purchase of stocks. Its charter, therefore, gave to the directors a discretionary power to make investments in stocks or <em>oilier securities. </em>What is the nature of the security here alluded to? Anything given or deposited to secure the payment of a debt. The words \u2018other securities\u2019 therefore embrace hills, bonds, notes, mortgages, &amp;c., <em>and the authority to maize investments therein, clothes the institution with the power of making \u2022loans by way of discount. </em>The concluding proviso to this section of the Act of Assembly, \u2018 that no part of the funds of said corporation shall he loaned to any officer or director of said corporation,\u2019 demonstrates the existence of the power wo have ascribed to it. <em>The People vs. The Utica Insurance Company, </em>15 <em>Johns., </em>392.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">The decision upon this point, thus plain and emphatic, is not modified by, nor is it in any way dependent upon, anything else in the Court\u2019s opinion. The question whether the Savings Institution had the power, under this provision of its charter, to <em>discount </em>the note-sued on, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>necessarily arose, and had to he first decided, because it-was a vital part of the plaintiff\u2019s case. Whether the enactment of a charter containing such power as well asfhe power to receive deposits, was in violation of the pledge given to the existing hanks by antecedent laws, was a matter entirely apart from the question as to what, powers this clause of the charter <em>actually conferred. </em>I take it then, that this is an unqualified adjudication, that the-provision in the charter, above quoted, comprehended and granted the discount power. When, therefore, the Legislature of 1868, said that deposits in savings institutions,. \u201c shall be invested or <em>loaned out </em>on good \u25a0 s\u00e9curity in the-discretion of the directors,\u201d with a proviso that no loan shall be made to any officer or director of such corporations, they did not use' terms, <em>requiring a\u25a0 construction now to be placed upon them for the first time, </em>hut terms which long before had been construed by the Appellate Court,, as conferring the discount power, a power everywhere .acknowledged to be a <em>banking privilege; </em>and the inference seems to me irresistible, that they employed these terms for the very purpose of granting such power. ' Where the construction and effect of certain language in an antecedent statute, has been settled by the Courts, and the same-terms are found in a subsequent statute upon the same-subject, -the presumption is that the .Legislature had knowledge of, and adopted such construction, and that, they used the same language with the- intent that it; should have the same effect. Eor these reasons, I am convinced that sec. 152, confers the discount power, just as effectually as if it had been so stated <em>in totidem verbis; </em>and holding this to he the effect of that section I do not deem it necessary to consider the <em>general prohibitions </em>against the exercise of hanking privileges, contained in the second section of this Act, because it is a familiar canon of construction, that where there is a <em>general </em>intention expressed\u2019 in a statute, and in a subsequent part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>same statute, there is also a <em>particular </em>intention expressed <em>incompatible </em>with the previous general intention, the particular intention must he considered in <em>the sense of an exception. Dwarris on Statutes, </em>765; <em>Stockett vs. Bird, </em>18 <em>Md., </em>484. Upon this ground, I rest my dissent to so much of the opinion of the majority, as decides that this Savings Bank had no power to discount the note sued on.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Having decided that the plaintiff had no power to discount the note, the opinion of the majority further declares that it does not follow as a consequence, \u201cthat recovery cannot he had,\u201d and the judgment is reversed and a new trial awarded. To this also I am constrained to dissent, because I regard the proposition as in direct conflict with what was recently decided in the case of <em>Lazear vs. The National Union Bank, of Maryland, </em>52 <em>Md., </em>78. In that case the defendant had given the bank a written guaranty, to the effect that he would be responsible for \u201c all <em>liabilities </em>of Lazear Brothers to the bank,\u201d to the extent of $25,000, and the suit was brought on this instrument. Among the items which the bank claimed was a note for $5000, <em>drawn by Lazear Brothers </em>which it had <em>purchased. </em>The defendant contended that the bank had no power to purchase this note, and having no such power, Lazear Brothers were not <em>liable </em>therefor to the bank, and consequently it was not within the terms of his guaranty. The question was therefore directly presented whether the hank could recover upon this note against Lazear Brothers, the makers, or in other words, whether the makers were <em>liable </em>therefor to the bank, and it was expressly so treated by the Court. It was, moreover, a new question in this State, and was twice elaborately argued by eminent counsel. In the opinion of a majority of the Judges who heard the case on re-argument, delivered by Judge G-HASOif, it is said : \u201c This question was most thoroughly and ably argued by the counsel of the respective parties, and after a very careful consideration of the case, it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>held that the appellee acquired the note in question by <em>purchase </em>and not by discount, that such purchase was not authorized by the Banking Act, and that the appellee acquired <em>no title to 'the note and could not recover upon it. </em>The question has again been very fully argued upon notes filed by the counsel of the respective parties, and has again been carefully considered, and a majority of the Court concur in the opinion heretofore -filed in the case, and in the conclusions therein reached.\u201d Besides this, the two cases of <em>Farmers\u2019 &amp; Mechanics\u2019 Bank vs. </em>Baldwin, 28 <em>Minnesota, </em>198, and <em>First National Bank of Rochester vs. Pierson, 24 Minnesota, </em>140, referred to and relied on as sustaining the Court\u2019s own reasoning, upon the subject, were cases in which suits were brought directly by the banks against the makers and endorser of the purchased notes, and in both, after elaborate discussions of the question, it was decided the banks acquired no title to the notes by purchase, and therefore could not recover upon them. So far as my experience has gone, no question was ever more thoroughly argued, more carefully considered, or more deliberately decided, than was this in <em>Lazear\u2019s Gase. </em>I cannot suppose it is the intention of the majority of the Court in this case, to overrule that decision, but where the distinction is, I am unable to discover. If the Union Bank in <em>Lazear\u2019s Gase </em>acquired no title <em>to </em>the note, and could not recover upon it, because it had, under its charter, no power to purchase it, how can it be said that this bank <em>has </em>acquired title to this note, and <em>can </em>recover upon it, notwithstanding it has, under its charter, no power to discount it ? If want of power in the one case is fatal to title and recovery, it must be so in the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The position taken- is that if the defendant received the bank\u2019s money, <em>\u201c </em>or was the knowing instrument of some one else doing so, he ought not to escape liability to pay \u201d on the ground that the bank had exceeded its legitimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>powers in obtaining the note by discounting it. The defendant, as the record discloses, is the endorser of this negotiable promissory note, but it was not discounted for bis benefit, nor did he receive any of the hank\u2019s money in the transaction. It is true he placed his name upon the note as endorser at the time the bank discounted it, and he unquestionably did so for the purpose of given credit to the paper, and to aid the party who obtained the money, in having it discounted. In this sense, and in no other, was lie the \u201cknowing instrument\u201d of some one else receiving the hank\u2019s money. But the same thing may be said of every one who endorses a note under like circumstances. It is a common practice for parties desiring to borrow money, to draw notes, procure the endorsements of their friends, and then take them to banks to be discounted. A very large proportion of the paper discounted by banks comes to them in this shape, and it would he a novel doctrine to hold that a party who thus endorses a note, enters into any other contract, or incurs any other liability, than that of endorser. 1 take it for granted that no holder of such a note, no matter how or under what circumstances he obtained it, could recover against the endorser, except upon proof of demand and notice1. The suit, as against him, must therefore be <em>upon the note, </em>to on force his contract as endorser, and if the decision in <em>Lazear'/s Case </em>he law, it is competent for him to set up as a bar to the action, want of corporate power in the plaintiff bank to acquire the note either by purchase or discount. The Lazcar Brothers when they drew the $5000 note and placed it the hands of a broker to be sold or discounted, did so for the purpose of obtaining money from some one who would purchase or discount it, and they actually received the bank\u2019s money; and yet it was plainly decided in that case, that want of power in the bank to purchase the note, was a bar to recovery, and absolved them from all <em>liability </em>to the hank therefor. Upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>assumption then that this Savings Bank had no power to discount this note, I do not see how it is possible for the plaintiff to recover in this case, unless the recent and carefully considered decision in <em>Lazear\u2019s Case </em>he overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
