On the 19th January, 1881, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>leave of Court, the following amended declaration was. filed :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b619-5\">The plaintiff, by Robert D. Morrison, its attorney, sues the defendants for that the defendants, on the 26th day of June, 1878, made and executed a certain writing in the words following, to wit: Baltimore, 26th June, 1878. We, the undersigned, Commissioners of Madison Square, hereby promise to pay to the order of A. Betticord, or bearer, the sum of four hundred and seventy-six dollars and sixty cents, out of the appropriation for the said square for the year 1879, for lamps and fixtures furnished at Madison Square, according to contract, which is hereby approved.

Morrison, attorney for plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b619-7\">On the 21st January, 1881, a general demurrer to the amended declaration was entered short on the docket. On the 29fch January, 1881, issue was joined on the demurrer ; on the same day the demurrer was sustained, and judgment was entered for the defendants on the demurrer with costs. On the 22nd March, 1881, the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b619-8\">The cause was submitted to Bartol, C.

The appellees rest their demurrer upon two grounds : First, that the <em>chose in action </em>declared on is not a negotiable instrument, and therefore the plaintiff could not maintain the suit in its own name. Second, that the declaration is bad because it does not contain the averment \u201c for money payable by the defendants to the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">We concur with the appellees in not considering the instrument negotiable; because the time of its payment is uncertain, is subject to a contingency not inevitable, and it is made payable out of a particular fund. In <em>Story on Promissory Notes, </em>these characteristics are shown to he incompatible with negotiability, from the following sections :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\">\u201c 22. To make a written note for the payment of money a valid promissory note, the money must- he payable absolutely,,and at all events, and not be subject to any condition or contingency.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-9\">\u201c25. Where a written promise for money, which otherwise would be a good promissory note; is made payable out of a particular fund, so that the payment is to depend upon the existence or sufficiency of that fund, that will render it invalid as a promissory note.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-10\">\u201c 27. To constitute a valid promissory note, it should be for the payment of money at some fixed period of time, or on some event which must inevitably happen.\u201d See also <em>Byleson Bills, </em>(marginal) 95, 96, and <em>Parsons on Bills and Notes, </em>42.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">The instrument sued on being a <em>chose in action </em>not negotiable, an assignment of it in writing was necessary under our statute to enable the plaintiff to sue in its own name. In the absence of such an assignment, the suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>should have been instituted in the name of Petticord, to the use of the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">In the case of <em>Owens vs. Hampton, </em>55 <em>Md., </em>583, this Court expressly decided, that, where the entire and exclusive interest in a bill of exchange or other negotiable <em>chose in action </em>is vested in the holder thereof, he cannot institute an action upon it in the name of another party. Assignments of other <em>dioses in action </em>not negotiable, entitle the assignee to sue in the name of the assignor for the use of the assignee, or in his own name, by virtue of Art. IX, sec. 1, of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">There having been no assignment in writing of the instrument on which this suit was brought, the demurrer was well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">We deem it proper, however, to say further, as to the other ground of demurrer, that the words, \u201cfor money payable,\u201d \u00abfee., are omitted in the <em>nan'., </em>we do not think it necessary to state them where the cause of action is such as that sued upon. The appellees rely upon <em>Merryman vs. Rider, </em>34 <em>Md., </em>98. But the declaration in that case contained simply four of the common counts, which down to thirteen, inclusive, are expressly required by the Code to be preceded by the words \u201c for money payable by the defendant to the plaintiff.\u201d While deciding this requirement of the statute to be imperative, and stating these words to be of the <em>gist </em>of the <em>indebitatus </em>counts, which only were within the decision, it is evident from the comments upon certain cases referred to, the Court did not mean to pronounce these words essential where the instrument itself, whicli is the cause of action, and the averments of the <em>nan'., </em>show that the .debt was a money debt, and that it was due before the commencement of the suit. The Code confines their averment to the <em>indebitatus </em>counts, and dispenses with them in its forms for declarations on promissory notes, and other agreements which in terms provide for the payment of money, and for other causes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>of action set forth, which in their nature are of similar import.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b622-7\">(Decided 25th February, 1882.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Having already stated that the first objection to the <em>narr. </em>relied on is sufficient to sustain the demurrer, it follows that we concur in the ruling of the Court helow; and the judgment must he affirmed, hut without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
