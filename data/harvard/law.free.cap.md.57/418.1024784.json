That to constitute a change of residence, there must not only be a declaration of intention to change, but there must be an actual abandonment of a previous residence, before another can be acquired, and if the jury shall find from the evidence, that the defendant had his actual home and residence, claiming the same as such in Baltimore County, at or before the time of his appointment as postmaster of Baltimore City, and that he did not actually change his said residence from Baltimore County to Baltimore City, but continued with his family to use and occupy his said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>dwelling place in Baltimore County, as and for his home as before, and that he was so occupying, using and claiming it as his home before and at the time of the institution of this suit, then the plaintiff is not entitled to recover upon the issues joined, although the jur}r may further find that at and before the institution of this suit, the defendant held the office of postmaster for Baltimore City, under the United States Government.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b439-5\">3.

That the fact that the defendant was, at the time of the institution of this suit, the postmaster of the United States, for the City of Baltimore, and that in the discharge of the duties of said office, he was actually in the City of Baltimore daily, during the hours necessary for the discharge of the duties of the office,.to wit: from seven or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>eight o\u2019clock, a. m., to five or six o\u2019clock, p. m.; nevertheless, said facts do not constitute said defendant a resident of the City of Baltimore, so as to make him amenable to the process in this cause instituted and sued out; provided, the jury shall further find that the defendant lived at his place, called \u201cRosedale,\u201d in Baltimore County, with his wife, family and servants, lodging, eating and sleeping there regularly, and voting in said county, and being a registered voter in.said county, and the while using and claiming the said dwelling in Baltimore County, as and for his actual home and residence, and at the time of the institution of this suit, and for a long time prior thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-5\">5. That if the jury should find for the plaintiff upon the issue joined, that such finding is not by construction of law, nor in fact an admission by the defendant of committing any particular assault and battery, and before the jury can assess damages against the defendant by reason of any one or more of the specific acts of assault and battery described by the plaintiff in her evidence, the jury must be satisfied that the same or some one of them was actually committed by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-6\">6. That the jury should disregard all evidence offered by the plaintiff, tending to prove admissions made by the defendant, that he had changed his residence from Baltimore County to Baltimore City, or'of his intention so to do; if the jury shall find that said admissions were made at a period of time, several months prior to the institution of this suit, unless they shall further find, that the defendant did actually remove to Baltimore City, prior to the institution of this suit, and resided there at the time of the institution thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-7\">T.

That there should he excluded from the consideration of the jury all the evidence of the plaintiff, the same having been taken subject to exception, tending to establish the several alleged assaults and batteries, by her particularized, as having been made by the defendant, to wit: the assault and battery, which is alleged to have occurred some time in July, 1877, and also the three several assaults and batteries alleged to have occurred during the spring and summer of 1878, as detailed by her upon the witness stand, and each and every of said several assaults and batteries.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-6\">The Court granted the seventh of said prayers, and rejected eacli and all of the others, and gave an instruction in lieu of the first, second, third, fourth and sixth, so rejected, which was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-7\">\u201c If the jury find from the evidence that the defendant, in the year 1861).or 1870, dwelt at Rosedale, in Baltimore County, and that he has continued to dwell there ever since that time, with his family and servants, lodging there, and taking his meals with his family, and, from time to time, receiving the visits of, and entertaining his friends there, and claiming said place to he his residence, and that from the year 1870, lie has voted at elections in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>said county, then the defendant resided in Baltimore County, and did not reside in Baltimore City in December, 1879, when this suit was brought, and their verdict should be for the defendant, unless the jury find for the plaintiff on her first prayer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-5\">\u201c But if the jury do not find for the plaintiff on her first prayer, then, in considering the above and foregoing instruction, they will dismiss all evidence offered by the plaintiff, tending to prove declarations or admissions made by the defendant, that he had changed his residence from Baltimore County to Baltimore City, or of his intention so to do, if the jury shall find that said declarations or admissions were made at a period of time, several months prior to the institution of this suit, unless they shall further find that the defendant did actually remove to Baltimore City, prior to the institution of this suit, and resided there at the time of the institution thereof.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-6\">And to the action -of the Court in granting the said prayers of the plaintiff, and to the giving of said instructions by the Court, and to the rejection of the said prayers of the defendant, the defendant excepted; and the verdict and judgment being for the plaintiff, the defendant \u25a0appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b442-7\"><em>Henry Stochbridge, </em>and <em>William M.

It is an inquiry preliminary, and if decided in favor of the jurisdiction, the judgment must be <em>respondeat ouster, </em>and the defendant allowed to plead to the merits. <em>Foxwist, et al. vs. Tremaine, </em>2 <em>Williams\u2019 Saunders, </em>213; <em>Brown vs. Web</em>ber, 6 <em>Cush., </em>564; <em>Sheppard vs. Graves, </em>14 <em>How., </em>509, 510; 5 <em>Rob.

Code, Article 64, sec. 5,) the defendant relies upon the terms of the statute itself, and the uniform interpretation of it derived from the practice of the State, and the general opinion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>the profession from the adoption of the law by Act of 1801, ch. 74, secs. 11 and 12, down to the present time. He is amenable to civil process only at his permanent fixed- residence, that is, his home, to which he is bound by the ties of family and of the fireside, so that he returns to it and remains there after temporary absence on business or otherwise. <em>Hamilton vs. Hardesty, </em>32 <em>Md., </em>348; <em>Gittings vs. State, use of Ockerme, </em>33 <em>Md., </em>458 ; 35 <em>Md., </em>169; <em>Latrobe vs. M. &amp; C.

This provision for the contingency of the defendant\u2019s being absent from the place where <em>\u201c he lives </em>\u201d manifestly excludes the idea of a double residence, as also do the other terms of the statute; its words are, <em>\u201c </em>no person shall be sued out of the county in which he resides, until, &amp;c.;\u201d the county is one county; it does not say the county or <em>counties; </em>it means to designate one place in which every person may be sued, and to protect him from being sued in every other.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-6\">Residence and inhabitancy are usually synonymous and <em>where one \u201c resides </em>\u201d means a personal presence in a fixed or permanent abode \u2014 one\u2019s dwelling house and home in contradistinction to any place of business, trade or occupation. Sojourning or being in a place temporarily and without the intention of remaining, is not to reside there. 2 <em>Bouv. L.

This view is sustained at least by analogy in <em>Davis vs. Calvert, </em>5 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>269, and, the question of practice being apparently new and not without interest, it is submitted to the Court. But in considering this exception it need hardly he determined. The defendant sought to keep from the jury the statement of evidence as to damage, as he had previously sought to have the Court determine the issue joined on his plea of non-residence ; because he contended that this issue, if found against him, would not he decisive of the case; that he should, after a judgment of <em>respondeat ouster, </em>be allowed to plead to the merits, or at least, obtain an inquisition to assess the plaintiff's damages. The position of the plaintiff, sustained by both the lower Courts, was that the defendant, having staked his defence on this one plea, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>was bound by a verdict upon it, just as if he had pleaded limitations, accord and satisfaction or any other plea <em>purely </em>in confession and avoidance to the merits ; that the same jury which determined' the issue of residence <em>vel non, </em>must also,- if they found for the plaintiff, assess her damages; and for this reason, if for no other, the former duty could not, except hy consent, he assumed by the Court; and they were entitled to know what evidence bearing on the <em>quantum </em>of damages would he submitted to them. Undoubtedly the defendant could not <em>simultaneously </em>rely on his plea in abatement and plead to the merits, since by the latter defence he would waive the former; hut this arises from the repugnance of the law to dilatory defences, especially when found to be false in fact, and in nowise impugns the axiomatic principles that in actions at common law, the jury must try all issues of fact, whatever their nature or number, and that the same jury must also assess the plaintiff\u2019s damages. <em>McLaughlin vs. DeYoung, </em>3 <em>G. &amp; J., </em>6 ; 82 <em>Md., supra, </em>352; 1 <em>Chitty on Pl., 7th Ed., </em>481, 482; <em>Evans\u2019 Pr., </em>237, 238, 239; <em>Poe on Pl. and Pr., </em>504, 506, 508; 2 <em>Wms.

The appellant joined issue on the appellee\u2019s traverse which concluded to the country. Afterwards, appellant in person moved the Court to enter judgment of <em>nonpros. </em>against the plaintiff, for the same reasons stated in his plea. To this objection was made by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, because the motion \u201c was not filed in time under Bule No. 8 of the Court.\u201d The Court sustained the objection for the reason stated; and this action forms the point of the first exception. The Buie No. 8 not having been put in the record, we are bound to presume, that the Court acted rightly, and in accordance with its rules. <em>Cherry vs. Baker, </em>17 <em>Md., </em>75 ; <em>Morrison vs. Welly, </em>18 <em>Md., </em>169.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The second exception was to the overruling the defendant\u2019s motion, that the issue joined upon the first replication to the defendant\u2019s plea, should be submitted to.the Court without the aid of a jury. In this ruling the Court of Common Pleas committed no error. The Code, Art. 75, sec. 87, provides, that \u201cno person shall he sued out of the county in which he resides, until the sheriff,or coroner of the county in which he resides shall have returned a <em>non est </em>on a summons issued in such county.\u201d By several decisions of this Court it has been settled, that the question of jurisdiction and privilege, arising in any case on this provision of the Code, may he raised either by motion for <em>non joros, </em>or by plea \u201c in the nature of a plea of abatement.\u201d <em>Hamilton vs. The State, use of Hardesty, </em>32 <em>Md., </em>352; <em>Gittings vs. State, use of Ockerme, </em>33 <em>Md., </em>463. By the case last cited it was determined, that when the question was presented by a motion for a <em>non </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number><em>pros, </em>the enquiry was made before the Court, without the intervention of a jury, and that sucli practice was not obnoxious to any constitutional objection because of its infringing upon the right of trial by jury. Whether a jury trial may be had when the question is raised by plea, in the nature of a plea in abatement, does not seem to have been before raised in this State. The Court in the case of <em>Gittings vs. The State, use of Ockerme, </em>33 <em>Md., </em>expressly decline to say what ought to be allowed in such case, and cannot be taken, as the counsel for appellant insist, to have made an intimation adverse to the right of jury trial in such case, when craved. In <em>Anderson vs. Garrett, </em>9 <em>Gill, </em>120, there was a plea interposed, and it was disposed of by the Court; but it must have been done by consent; for there appears to have been <em>no traverse </em>of the allegation of the plea by way of replication with conclusion to the country, and a joinder of issue ; and the case was submitted to the Court on the plea denying jurisdiction, upon proof taken before the <em>Judge </em>in an application for <em>Habeas Corpus. </em>This case, therefore, settles nothing, except that such plea <em>may be </em>decided by the Court without a jury, <em>if the parties agree </em>; and does not certainly decide that the parties may not have a jury for the decision of the questions of fact on which the plea rests. In the case at bar, the appellee traversed the appellant\u2019s plea, and prayed that the same might be inquired of by <em>the country. </em>The appellant\u2019 accepted the issue, so presented for trial by jury,'and joined in it\u00a1\u2019 Nothwithstanding the appellant might have avoided a trial by jury, on that question, by electing in proper time, a motion of <em>non pros., </em>it\u2019 does not follow, that when he has elected to plead instead of moving for nonpros., and that plea has been replied to by a direct traverse concluding to the country, on which he joined issue, that then, as a matter of right, he may have that issue, <em>made for a jury, </em>tried before the Court, against the will of his adversary. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>think the Court of Common Pleas adjudged rightly. He had made his election and was hound by it; and the issue on his plea was properly allowed to go to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">In the first; volume of <em>Oldtty on Pleading, page </em>445, it is distinctly stated that if the replication to the plea to the jurisdiction denies the facts alleged, the <em>conclusion </em>is to the country. He recites numerous and valuable volumes of precedents to support his statement of the practice, in <em>Harris\u2019 </em>Entries, 270, we find the precedents of our own State sustain the same practice. The <em>conclusion </em>thus universally adopted, unerringly indicates that the facts alleged in support of the plea, are triable by a jury ; and that the Court only pronounces judgment for the defendant, or of <em>respondeat ouster, </em>in favor of the plaintiff, as the finding of the jury requires. <em>Mr. Poe </em>in vol. 1 of Ms work on <em>Pleading and Practice, p. </em>503, states this to he the practice in this State, unless the parties assent to the trial before the Court. We can find no authority for refusing a jury trial where the issue is made up for it; and we can see no good reason why the practice should not prevail of granting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">The third bill of exceptions, and the eighth prayer of the defendant, which was rejected by the Court, and is set out in the seventh hill of exceptions, present <em>substantially </em>the same question, namely, whether the plaintiff was entitled to state her grievances to the jury, offer proof of them, and have an assessment of damages therefor, until the question of jurisdiction had been fully passed upon and determined. After careful consideration of this question, and examination of numerous authorities we are satisfied that the learned Court which decided the question below, has fallen into error.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">A plea to the jurisdiction, though denominated a plea in abatement, differs from it in some particulars. It partakes also sometimes, as in this case, of the character of a a plea of privilege. <em>Oldtty </em>and <em>Stephen, </em>in their works <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>upon <em>Pleading, </em>treat of this plea under a special head, and' as differing from an ordinary plea in abatement. Ordinary pleas in abatements, are pleaded by an attorney after appearance. Pleas to the jurisdiction must be put in before imparlance ; and must be pleaded by the defendant in person. They cannot be pleaded by attorney, for that requires application to the Court for leave to imparl, and would submit to the jurisdiction. <em>Bacon\u2019s Abridg</em>ment;, <em>title </em>Abatement, 1 <em>and </em>2 ; 5 <em>Iiob. Pr., </em>7. Because it is a denial of jurisdiction ; it is not necessary to sa'y \u201c he defends force, injury, &amp;c.\u201d in the plea. 5 Rob. <em>Pr., </em>7. A plea to the merits and to the jurisdiction at one and the same time are so inconsistent, that k plea to the merits is waiver of the plea to the jurisdiction. In Supreme Court of the United States, in <em>Sheppard vs. Graves, </em>14 <em>Howard, </em>509, it is so decided; and the Court says, <em>\u201c </em>it has ever- been received as a canon of pleading, that matters which appertain solely to the jurisdiction of a Court, or the disabilities of the suitor, should <em>never be blended </em>with questions which enter essentially into the \u2022 subject-matter of the controversy.\u201d \u201cAll defences involving inquiries into that subject-matter imply, may admit the competency of the parties to institute such inquiries, and the authority of the Court to adjudicate upon them. Hence it is that pleas to the jurisdiction pr in abatement, are deemed inconsistent with those which appertain to the merits of the cause ; they are tried upon different views, and result in different conclusions.\u201d The case of <em>Sims vs. Hundley, </em>6 <em>Howard, </em>1, expressly affirms the common law principle of pleading, that the question of residence, or right of the parties to sue, cannot be inquired into under the general issue. If the party cannot be permitted to defend himself, and appear by attorney to do it, while he is denying the jurisdiction of the Court, and that is undetermined; it is most illogical and unjust for the Court, while inquiring into the question of jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>fcion, to assume jurisdiction over the subject-matter, and to decide that by denying jurisdiction he liad confessed the charge in the <em>narr., </em>and to proceed to assess the damages at one and the same time, that the questions of fact on which jurisdiction depends, are being settled. Judge Daniel, in <em>Sheppard vs. Graves, </em>most forcibly and convincingly says, that \u201c if it could be imagined that the plea to the jurisdiction and the plea to the merits could be regularly committed to the jury at one and the same time, the verdict might involve the following <em>absurdities. </em>Should the verdict he for the plaintiff, the judgment would be, as to the defendant, on one issue that he answer over; and as to the other, that he pay the debt, as to the justice of which he was to answer over.\u201d The present case illustrates the necessity for \u00e1 separate inquiry, even more strikingly; for in the case put by Judge Daniel, the party would he allowed to make his defence-on the merits, and the inconsistency would only he in the judgment entered. Here, there was no plea to the merits, and because he did not do that which he could not do without admitting jurisdiction, he was treated as if he confessed on the merits ; <em>or as </em>if', he was under judgment hy default, which the Court could not render ; and the question of jurisdiction and assessment of damages was settled hy one and the Eiame verdict. Practically, it was not only denying the defendant the benefit of his plea, to the jurisdiction; hut it was denying him regular trial on the merits. Verdict was for the plaintiff, and judgment was entered, not of <em>respondeat ouster, </em>hut for damages assessed and the costs. All authorities agree that the judgment on the plea to jurisdiction, when against the defendant, is that he shall answer over. The necessary consequence of the Court\u2019s ruling in this case, was the entry of judgment as made, and the defendant was denied his privilege of answering over. The application of the rule of pleading, that what is not denied is confessed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>to a case like this, was erroneous. The question presented was like that made hy demurrer, whether he was called on to plead at all. While that was pending he was under no rule to plead, and the Court's right to make him plead was the very question for trial. The appellant had the right to make that plea, and raise that point, and was as much entitled to have that settled <em>before </em>being required to plead, or go to trial on the merits;, as if he had demurred to the <em>narr. </em>In 1 <em>Sumner, </em>578, Judge Stoby says, the question of jurisdiction is a <em>preliminary one, </em>and must be taken hy plea. He further says, <em>\u201c </em>all pleas to the jurisdiction, are objections to entering into the <em>litis contestado, </em>and they <em>must and ought to precede </em>the <em>litis contestado.\u201d </em>It would seem that this question was hardly open in this Court, after what was said in <em>State, use of Ockerme vs. Gittings, </em>35 <em>Md., </em>174. In that case the Court below had refused a motion for judgment by default, pending the question whether the Court had jurisdiction by reason of alleged non-residence of the defendant; and this Court said \u201c the Court below was clearly right, because the question of jurisdiction having been made, it was <em>preliminary </em>to <em>all </em>others.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">To render judgment hy default, would have been an exercise of jurisdiction, which the Court said could not he done until jurisdiction was affirmatively determined to he possessed by the Court. If it was unwarrantable for the Court in that case, to entertain a motion for judgment by default, it was not less so in the case at bar for the Court, pending that question, to adjudge the defendant to- have confessed the grievances charged, by pleading a want of jurisdiction, and failing to plead to the merits, and to proceed to assess damages, and decide the questions arising on that inquiry. It results \u2019from what we have said, that the Court erred in its ruling in the third hill of exceptions, and on the defendant's eighth prayer, embraced in the seventh hill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>The jury should have been restricted to the single inquiry touching residence. If it did result in two jury trials in the same case, it would he upon two different phases of it, which could not be tried together. No inconvenience, hut delay, could result from it; and that the undeniable rights of the defendant involved. It is barely possible, the same jury might be selected, hut in that case, they would of necessity he sworn over again upon a different issue. The cases, where the same jury at the same time have passed upon the ahalement plea, and assigned damages also, were not cases like this, wherein the plea sets up exemption by statute of the defendant from suit, in the jurisdiction where the suit was brought; and cannot be followed in this case and Slate. We have found no case precisely like this, and if one exists, we should be loth to follow it, in view of the meaning and object of the statute, as we understand it.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">The remaining questions, which it is necessary for us to decide, dppend for their solution upon the construction of Art. *T5, sec. 8*7, of the Code of Genera] Laws; and what kind of residence that section contemplates and requires that a defendant shall have, in a county or city, to make him amenable to civil suit therein. Numerous definitions of residence are to he found in the hooks, and we have been cited to a-great many cases upon the subject in the hooks, to very few of which we shall refer; for what the word means in any particular statute, depends upon its purpose and the phraseology of the context. Each case must he decided upon the particular language of the statute, and the circumstances giving rise to the question. To fulfil the intention and requirements of some statutes, a commercial or business residence might he all the law required; whilst'to gratify the intention of another statute, it may he necessary to hold residence to he more than a business residence, and to mean all that the word domicile means in its strictest and most technical application. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>.the statute, we <em>are </em>considering the word <em>\u201clives,\u201d </em>is used as synon'omous with \u201cresides;\u201d and indicates that <em>more </em>than a bare business residence, or temporary sojourn in a place, whs intended by the law. In the <em>Gittings and Ockerme Case, (35 Md., </em>169,) this Court uses the word \u201chome,\u201d as synonymous with the word \u201c resides,\u201d as used in this statute; thereby indicating that such was the real meaning of the statute\u2019s language. Passing upon the question, whether a motion for <em>non pros, </em>was made in time, when it was not made till the first day of the term after the return day of the writ, this Court said: \u201c\"Looking to the object contemplated by this statute, that of preventing a party from being liable to suit, away from his home, and as it might be in a county remote from that of his residence, the provision should be applied in such reasonable manner, as not practically to render it useless.\u201d Here, they expressly recognize the meaning of the statute, not to be a temporary residence or a business residence, but to mean something very different, and what the Court there calls <em>home. </em>The statute contemplates the permanent fixed home of the party; whither, when the objects of temporary absence, (and it may be of business residence,) were accomplished, the person turned for social life; where his family, if he had one, usually dwelt; to which his mind turns when away, and where he has the present purpose of returning and remaining. It is not the place, where a man happens to be temporarily residing, even though it-be with his family; for, a man may, for convenience sake, have a 'temporary residence and <em>quasi </em>home, which is not his home and residence proper ; and, unless he has-abandoned the latter for the former, with intention of permanently remaining from it, the newly .chosen residence is not his domicile. <em>Dicey on Domicile, ,page </em>16, says, \u201cIf the intention of <em>permanently </em>-residing in a place exists, a residence in pursuance of that intention, however short, will establish a domicile.\u201d The quos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>tion of intention, is a material ingredient. This Court said, in <em>Dorsey vs. Kyle, </em>30 <em>Md., </em>512, that a man\u2019s domicile may he one place, while the .actual residence wa^ in another. Many illustrations of this might he dr\u00e1wn from the State officers in the various departments of the State, and United States Government. It is clear, the statute is not gratified by the defendant having less than a fixed home; which he has no present purpose of exchanging for another in a different jurisdiction ; or which, if he has, he has not yet executed. It is, at least, such a residence as will draw after it a man\u2019s personal property, for the purpose of taxation ; and to change it, must require the concurrence of the acts and intention requisite to change the <em>situs </em>of personal property, for the purpose of taxation. What is necessary, in such case, to effect a change of residence, this Court has determined in the case of <em>Stoddart vs. Ward, </em>31 <em>Md., </em>563. There the Court decided that the intention alone to remove, though definitely formed, was insufficient; it must he carried out by actual removal. We also refer to <em>Lamb vs. Smythe, </em>15 <em>Meeson &amp; Welsby, </em>433, where a like construction was given to the wmrd <em>residence, </em>in a statute of analogous character.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">Applying this view and construction of the statute to the rulings of the Court upon the various prayers submitted, it is clear that the Court erred in adopting a theory of business residence as sufficient to gratify the requirements of the statute. The first prayer of the plaintiff, (and contained in the seventh hill of exceptions) was granted by the Court. That prayer after reciting, the facts necessary to constitute a <em>business residence, </em>instructed the jury if they found those facts then the defendant had a <em>business residence </em>in Baltimore City, and the plaintiff <em>was entitled to recover. </em>This was clear error. And it is not helped by the fact that it was granted in connection with other instructions given by the Court in lieu of the defendant\u2019s prayers on that subject; for, if the first paragraph of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Court\u2019s instructions could be understood as intended to define tbe kind of residence necessary to maintain tbe suit\u2019 it is so wholly inconsistent with the first prayer of the plaintiff, it was error to grant both, for it was misleading to the jury, and they would not know which theory bound them. But the first part of the Court\u2019s instructions is followed by a paragraph indicating clearly, that if they found the facts in the first prayer, such finding would still entitle the plaintiff to recover. The Court erred in not putting distinctly before the jury the facts they were to find to constitute residence proper, and not <em>business </em>residence, which last the statute does not intend. The fourth prayer of the plaintiff which was granted was obnoxious to the same objection, that it conveyed the idea of a <em>business residence, </em>and did not define what was necessary to make a residence 'such as we have indicated; and left the jury too wide a' field for inferences. The first prayer of the defendant was properly rejected. It did not define what was necessary to constitute residence, but left it to the jury to determine for themselves. The second, third and fourth prayers of the defendant properly laid down the law, and ought to have been, granted. It is proper to remark, however, that they were constructed with reference to the case as then presented and being tried. Upon a new trial the question will first be confined to the single question of residence <em>vel non, </em>and those prayers should not conclude, as before, that the plaintiff <em>\u201c </em>is not entitled to recoverbut if these facts are found <em>\u201c </em>that the plaintiff cannot .maintain <em>this </em>suit.\u201d The sixth prayer of the defendant was correct; and ought to have been granted; for if the admissions referred to, were as stated, admissions long before suit brought, and the jury should find that when the suit was brought the defendant had his home in Baltimore County, and not in Baltimore City, the admissions did not establish a residence in the city when the suit was brought. The fifth prayer simply asserts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>that by pleading to the jurisdiction, the defendant had not admitted the assault or any assault, and that before the jury could find for the plaintiff, they must find some assault to have been committed. This was a proper legal proposition; but as we have before stated, the question of assault, nor the amount of damages was not then cognizable by the jury. The plea to the jurisdiction confessed nothing. If that was decided against him, he would then he entitled to demur to the <em>narr. </em>or to traverse its allegations in any way consistent with the rules of pleading applicable to such suits. And if after trial, the verdict and final judgment should be against.him, lie would be entitled to appeal, when alleged error in a ruling of the Court in either trial before the jury would he open for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">Inasmuch as we have decided, that no question concerning the assault, its character or measure of redress, ought to have been allowed till the question of jurisdiction was finally settled, it is not necessary for us to decide the question of election among the assaults proved, which is presented by the fifth bill 6f exceptions. It is hardly possible that the same question will again arise in this \u25a0 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The only remaining question in the case is presented by the fourth exception. Having announced that the plaintiff had closed her testimony on the subject of residence, the following offer was made in writing: \u201cThe plaintiff offers by competent testimony to prove the amount of damages claimed in the <em>narr.\u201d </em>The exception says \u201c hut the defendant objected to the proposal and offer, and moved the Court to instruct the jury that there was no legally sufficient evidence to sustain the issue joined on the part of the plaintiff.\u201d The Court overruled the objection and motion. So far as this exception presents the question whether the plaintiff should have been permitted to offer evidence of the assault and damages, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>have already expressed our opinion, that it was error to so permit, and it is not necessary to repeat. With respect to the motion that the Court take the case from the jury, on the question of residence, by instruction that there was no legally sufficient evidence to enable them to find for the plaintiff, on that issue, we cannot say there was error. There was some evidence on both sides of the question, and it was for the jury to weigh it, and find as they might think it compelled or warranted them. We will reverse and remand the cause for a new trial in accordance with'the views expressed in this opinion.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b462-6\">(Decided 19th January, 1882.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">\n<em>Reversed and new trial ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
