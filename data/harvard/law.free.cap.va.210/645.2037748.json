At the settlement of each property transfer, the taxes for the year 1967 were prorated between the Authority and the prior owners. Such owners assigned to the Authority any claim for a refund of these taxes to which they might be entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-17\">The Authority then applied to the Collector of City Taxes for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>refund of that portion of real estate taxes for the calendar year 1967 beginning with the date of acquisition of such real estate by the Authority and ending with the end of the calendar year. The Authority based its claim for a refund on Code \u00a7 58-822, which provides for a proration of real estate taxes whenever property is acquired by \u201cthis State or any county or <em>municipality thereof . </em>. .\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">The City denied that the Authority, as assignee, was entitled to the refund on the basis that the Authority was not embraced within the term \u201cmunicipality\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 58-822.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">The City instituted a Bill for Declaratory Judgment in the Law and Equity Court of the City of Richmond on March 27, 1968, in which it sought to have the court declare that the Authority was not a purchaser as contemplated by Code \u00a7 58-822 and therefore was not entitled to a pro rata refund of taxes for the year 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">The Law and Equity Court heard the case and entered a final decree on May 29, 1968, holding that Authority is embraced within the term municipality as used in Code \u00a7 58-822, and any person whose property is given to, sold to or taken in any manner whatsoever by the Authority is entitled to a credit or refund of taxes and levies in accordance with the provisions of Code \u00a7 58-822. To review this ruling we granted the City a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">\u201cBy both judicial recognition and common usage \u2018municipality\u2019 is a modern synonym of \u2018municipal corporation\u2019.\u201d <em>St. Louis Housing Authority </em>v. <em>City of St. Louis, </em>361 Mo. 1170, 1177, 239 S.W.2d 289. 294 (1951). See also <em>Neuenschwander </em>v. <em>Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission, </em>187 Md. 67, 74, 48 A.2d 593, 597 (1946) and <em>State ex rel Koontz </em>v. <em>Board of Park Commissioners, </em>131 W. Va. 417, 424, 47 S.E.2d 689, 694 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">There are a multitude of decisions in the various states concerning whether local governmental subdivisions are included within the term \u201cmunicipal corporation\u201d. The decisions, however, are far from uniform and often there are contradictions and conflicts even'within the same jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">This court has had occasion to consider this question in <em>Hampton Roads Sanitation District Commission </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>193 Va. 371, 376. 68 S.E. 2d 497, 500 (1952), where we set out the two basic factors which must be considered in determining whether or not a particular entity is in fact a municipal corporation. \u201cThe first is, how many attributes of a municipal corporation does the entity in dispute pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>sess? The second is, in the light of this initial consideration, what is the particular purpose for which it is sought to determine whether or not a municipal corporation is present?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">This court then went on to list those attributes of a municipal corporation which we deemed essential to viability as a municipal corporation in that instance. Those attributes set out are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-5\">(1) Creation as a body corporate and politic and as a political subdivision of the Commonwealth;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-6\">(2) Creation to serve a public purpose;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-7\">(3) Power to have a common seal, to sue and be sued, to enter into contracts, to acquire, hold and dispose of its revenue, personal and real property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-8\">(4) Possession of the power of eminent domain;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-9\">(5) Power to borrow money and issue bonds which are tax exempt, with interest on such bonds enjoying the same status under tax laws as the interest on bonds of other political subdivisions of the state;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-10\">(6) Management of the corporation vested in a board of directors or a commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b833-11\">With these essential characteristics in mind, we will now examine the legislation creating the Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-12\">The Richmond Metropolitan Authority was creat\u00e9d by Acts of Assembly of Va., Ch. 178 \u00a7\u00a7 33-255.44:11 to 33-255.44:32 (1966), The sections which are pertinent to our examination provide in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-13\">\u201c\u00a7 33-255.44:12. <em>Creation of the Authority .\u2014There </em>is hereby created a political subdivision and public body corporate and politic of the Commonwealth of Virginia to be known as the \u2018Richmond Metropolitan Authority\u2019 ... to be governed by a Board of Director consisting of eleven members ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b833-14\">\u201c\u00a7 33-255.44:13. <em>Powers of the Authority </em>.\u2014That in order to alleviate highway congestion, promote highway safety, expand highway construction, increase the utility and benefits and extend the services of public highways, . . . and otherwise contribute to the economy, industrial and agricultural development and welfare of the Commonwealth and the City of Richmond and Counties of Henrico and Chesterfield, the Authority shall have the following powers:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>\u201c(a) To contract and be contracted with; to sue and be sued; and to adopt and use a seal and to alter the same at its pleasure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-4\">\u201c(b) To acquire and hold real or personal property necessary or convenient for its purposes;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-6\">\u201c(f) The Authority is authorized and empowered to acquire by the exercise of the power of eminent domain any lands, property, rights, rights-of-way, franchises, easements ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-8\">\u201c(p) To borrow money and issue bonds, notes or other evidences of indebtedness for any of its corporate purposes ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b834-9\">\u201c\u00a7 33-255.44:21. <em>Exemption from Taxation\u2014 </em>All property, real and personal, and all rights and interests therein and the income of the Authority, the revenue bonds and the interest thereon, and the transfer thereof and any profit made on the sale thereof, shall at all times be free from taxation or. assessment by the Commonwealth and by any municipality, county or other political subdivision thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">Thus it is plain that the Authority possesses those attributes of a municipal corporation which we had earlier deemed essential to existence of a municipal corporation and is not a mere auxiliary of a city or county government.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-11\">The Proration Act, Code \u00a7 58-822, was enacted by the General Assembly in 1922 as a remedial statute to provide relief for taxpayers whose property \u201cshall have been or may be given to, sold to, or taken in any manner whatsoever by this State or any county or municipality thereof. . . .\u201d As a remedial statute it requires a liberal interpretation to meet those cases which are clearly within the spirit or reason of the law, provided such an interpretation is not inconsistent with the language of the statute. <em>Hampton Roads Sanitation District Commission </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>193 Va. at 377, 68 S.E. 2d at 501. See also <em>Virginia Brewing Company </em>v. <em>Webber, </em>167 Va. 67, 72, 187 S.E, 447, 449 (1936), and <em>Hasson </em>v. <em>City of Chester, </em>67 W. Va. 278, 282-83, 67 S.E. 731, 733 (1910).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-12\">Section 183 of the Virginia Constitution delineates property exempt from local taxation. Among others, it exempts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>\u201c(a) Property owned directly or indirectly by the <em>Commonwealth or any political subdivision thereof </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">The act creating the Authority specifically provides that the property, bonds and income of the Authority are exempt from taxation. Therefore, the property purchased by the Authority in 1967 would not be assessed for taxation subsequent to the date it was purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">In discussing the Proration Act in <em>Warwick County </em>v. <em>City of Newport News, </em>153 Va. 789, 817, 151 S.E. 417, 426 (1930), we quoted with approval the following language of the trial judge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-6\">\u201c Taxes are assessed against property and the owner for and in consideration of the use and enjoyment of property by the owner and in cases where the owner has been deprived of the use and enjoyment of his property by the State or municipality, or the property has been acquired by the State or municipality, it was competent for the legislature to provide that he should not be required to pay taxes when and after his use and enjoyment have ceased.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">In the present case the original property owners have been deprived of the use and enjoyment of their property by a \u201cpolitical subdivision and public body corporate and politic of the Commonwealth\u201d. After being acquired by the Authority, the property is exempt from further taxation by virtue of the enacting legislation and the Constitution of Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">We, therefore, conclude that it is within the purview of the Pro-ration Act and not inconsistent with the language of that Act to hold that the Richmond Metropolitan Authority is a \u201cmunicipal corporation\u201d and as such is embraced within the term \u201cmunicipality\u201d as used in the Proration Act, Code \u00a7 58-822.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
