Commissioner Miller conducted a hearing on the application and ruled that Tomko\u2019s alleged injury was not compensable. Upon review, the full Commission affirmed the ruling of Commissioner Miller and adopted his decision as the award of the Commission. Tomko was granted an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-21\">The evidence showed that at the time of the alleged injury to his back, Tomko was employed as a carpenter by Michael\u2019s Plastering and was engaged in the installation of sheetrock at Tysons Corner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>Shopping Center in Fairfax County. Tomko had been doing carpentry work for many years and had \u201cbeen lifting stuff ever since [he] was . . . little.\u201d He usually suffered \u201cmuscle soreness . . . through the middle of [his] back\u201d on weekends after he \u201chad worked hard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">During the week of July 22, 1968, Tomko was installing pieces of sheetrock weighing approximately 150 pounds each, or 30 pounds heavier than he normally handled. On Friday of that week, Tomko was \u201cmore sore . . . than usual.\u201d On Saturday, after working several hours, he was \u201cquite a bit\u201d sore. On Sunday, he \u201ccould hardly crawl\u201d and had \u201cpains just [shooting] down [his] legs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">On Monday, July 29, Tomko reported to work although he was \u201churting pretty bad.\u201d He worked \u201cputting this sheetrock up into the ceilings\u201d and \u201cmade some boxes to go around lights.\u201d He complained to a fellow employee, Bill McGlothlin, that \u201chis back [was] hurting real bad.\u201d Tomko also complained to Michael Picciolo, his employer, that \u201che had a pain in his leg.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">The work on Monday completed the Tysons Corner job, and Tomko was \u201cpaid . . . off.\u201d On Tuesday, Tomko went to see Dr. John T. Lynn, an orthopedic surgeon. An informal report of Dr. Lynn dated July 30, 1968, began: \u201cThis patient is seen today complaining of pain and discomfort to the back. He states he injured his back while lifting sheet rock while at work at the Tyson\u2019s Corner Shopping Center.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">In a report on a Commission form, Dr. Lynn answered an inquiry, \u201cEmployee\u2019s account of how injury . . . occurred,\u201d by stating that Tomko was \u201cPutting up sheet rock, slipped and wrenched back.\u201d Dr. Lynn diagnosed Tomko\u2019s condition as \u201ca herniated intervertebral disc at L5-S1 on the right side.\u201d The doctor recommended \u201cconservative care,\u201d including medication, therapy, and wearing of a brace. At the time of the hearing before Commissioner Miller in December, 1968, Tomko was st\u00fcl wearing the brace and could work only part time.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">On appeal, Tomko says that the question presented is: \u201cHow closely must a workman pinpoint the time of his injury?\u201d Tomko then claims that the Commission denied him relief solely because he failed to fix the specific date on which he suffered injury. Thus, Tomko argues, the Commission \u201cimproperly interpreted\u201d our holding in the case of <em>Aistrop </em>v. <em>Blue Diamond Coal Co., </em>181 Va. 287, 24 S.E.2d 546 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>It is true that Commissioner Miller stated at one point in his opinion that Tomlto \u201cmust, at the least, be able to point to a particular date as the time of his accident.\u201d But in another place in his opinion, the commissioner correctly stated the ruling enunciated in the <em>Aistrop </em>case to be that \u201cthe \u2018incident,\u2019 the act done or condition encountered, \u2018must be shown to have occurred at some reasonably definite time.\u2019 \u201d 181 Va. at 293, 24 S.E.2d at 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">An examination of Commissioner Miller\u2019s opinion shows that the ground for denial of relief to Tomko was that the evidence failed \u201cto show that [Tomko\u2019s] injury was \u2018by accident\u2019 within the meaning of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\u201d And Tomko acknowledges that the finding of no accident was the actual basis of the Commission\u2019s decision because he states in his brief that the \u201cCommission ruled that [his] herniated disc was of gradual growth and not compensable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">The real question before us, therefore, is whether Tomko sustained his burden of proving that he suffered injury \u201cby accident\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 65.1-7.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Unless we can say as a matter of law that the evidence submitted by Tomko was sufficient to sustain his burden, then the Commission\u2019s finding that he did not suffer injury by accident is binding and conclusive upon us. Code \u00a7 65.1-98; <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Fuqua, </em>199 Va. 709, 713, 101 S.E.2d 562, 566 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">In <em>Virginia Electric, Etc., Co. </em>v. <em>Quann, </em>197 Va. 9, 12, 87 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1955), relied upon by Tomko, we upheld an award of compensation for a ruptured disc. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b885-8\">. . [W]hen usual exertion results in actually breaking, herniating, or letting go with an obvious sudden mechanical or structural change in the body, whether external or internal, the injury is accidental....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">The evidence submitted by Tomko, however, did not show that there was an \u201cobvious sudden mechanical or structural change\u201d in his body or that there was any causal connection between his work-induced exertion and the physical change which he did experience. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>Therein lies the difference between Tomko\u2019s evidence and that of the claimant in the <em>Quann </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Quann showed that while helping to lift a coil of wire, he \u201cfelt something pop or make a definite snap in [his] back.\u201d He made immediate complaint of pain to fellow employees, who corroborated his testimony. And Quann presented medical evidence showing that the act of helping to lift the coil of wire caused his ruptured disc.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">Here, not even Tomko related his condition to any work-oriented event. Although he apparently told Dr. Lynn that he \u201cslipped and wrenched\u201d his back while \u201cputting up sheet rock,\u201d he was not willing to testify before Commissioner Miller that his condition resulted from any such source. The most he would say in his testimony was that he \u201cpresumed\u201d he hurt his back while at work on Friday or Saturday, July 26 or 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">Tomko\u2019s first complaint to anyone on the job was not until Monday, July 29, when he told fellow-employee McGlothlin that his back was \u201churting real bad.\u201d But even then, according to Mc-Glothlin\u2019s testimony, Tomko \u201cwondered how he hurt his back.\u201d The complaint made by Tomko to his employer on Monday was merely that \u201che had a pain in his leg\u201d with no assertion that he had hurt himself on the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">Tomko presented no medical opinion to show that his physical condition was work-connected nor was there any explanation of the lack of such evidence. It is significant that the opinion of Commissioner Miller made specific reference to the fact that \u201cno physician\u201d had said that Tomko\u2019s \u201cdisorder [was] the result of the work he performed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b886-9\">We cannot say as a matter of law that Tomko sustained his burden of proving injury \u201cby accident\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 65.1-7. Accordingly, the award of the Commission will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b885-10\"> \u201c\u00a7 65.1-7. <em>\u2018Injury\u2019 </em>defined.\u2014Unless the context otherwise requires, \u2018injury\u2019 and \u2018personal injury\u2019 mean only injury by accident, or occupational disease as hereinafter defined, arising out of and in the course of the employment and do not include a disease in any form, except when it results naturally and unavoidably from either of the foregoing causes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
