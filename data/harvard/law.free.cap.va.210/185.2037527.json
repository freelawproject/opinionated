W. &amp; W. Coal Company, Inc., the employer. On November 23, 1966, the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>sion, following a hearing, awarded the claimant compensation of $39.00 per week for 26 weeks from November 30, 1965, \u201con account of silicosis medically determined to be in the first stage.\u201d The award was paid as ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">On May 25, 1967, the claimant filed a new application alleging a change in his condition and asking for a review of the earlier award.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A hearing was held by Deputy Commissioner Rushbrooke who ruled that the application should be dismissed because the claimant had failed to prove a change in condition. This ruling was affirmed by the full Commission, and the claimant was granted an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The evidence before the Commission at the first hearing showed that the claimant had worked in coal mines for many years. In 1961, he went to work for P. W. &amp; W. Coal Company, Inc., and while in that employment was injuriously exposed to the causative hazards of silicosis. On November 30, 1965, he was diagnosed by a doctor as having silicosis and was told \u201cto quit work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">The medical evidence before the Commission at the first hearing was in conflict. The physicians employed by the claimant reported that he was suffering from second stage silicosis and was unable to work. The doctors employed by the insurance carrier of the employer reported that the claimant did not have silicosis but was suffering from emphysema, causing \u201ca 15% decreased capacity to do physical work.\u201d In view of the medical conflict, the Commission appointed a specialist in pulmonary disease to examine the X-ray films upon which the opinions of the other doctors had been based. The specialist reported that the claimant had \u201cstage I silicosis.\u201d The Commision\u2019s finding of first stage silicosis and the award of compensation for 26 weeks followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">At the second hearing, one of the physicians employed by the claimant reported that the latter was suffering from \u201cLate 2nd and Early 3rd Stage Silicosis,\u201d and another reported that the disease had \u201cadvanced to early 3rd stage.\u201d The physicians employed by the insurance carrier reiterated their view that the claimant did not have sili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>cosis. The carrier also submitted written opinions of an internist and of a roentgenologist who had studied X-ray films of the claimant and who reported that there had been no change in the claimant\u2019s condition since the time of the first hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">In dismissing the claimant\u2019s application for review, the Commission ruled that to show a change in condition, Code \u00a7 65-53 (20)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> [now Code \u00a7 65.1-56 (20)] required the claimant to prove by medical evidence that the silicosis from which he suffered had \u201cprogressed to a stage greater than first stage for which compensation was previously awarded.\u201d The Commission concluded that the medical evidence before it \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d demonstrated that there had been no such change in the claimant\u2019s occupational disease since the first hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\"> The claimant contends that the Commission erred at the second hearing in placing upon him the burden of showing that the silicosis from which he suffered had advanced beyond first stage and in requiring him to prove such change by medical evidence. The claimant says that medical evidence was unnecessary and that his own testimony to the effect he was totally disabled was sufficient to justify an award of compensation based upon a change in condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">However, at the opening of the second hearing, the claimant agreed that the change in condition upon which he relied was that he had \u201cdeveloped a greater stage of silicosis from that for which he was previously compensated.\u201d Thus, the claimant recognized and accepted the proposition that he was entitled to an additional award only if his condition had changed because his silicosis had advanced beyond the first stage. He had the burden of establishing that change. <em>Jones </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number><em>Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>198 Va. 370, 373, 94 S.E. 2d 202, 204 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">And Code \u00a7 65-53 (20) [now Code \u00a7 65.1-56 (20)] makes clear that each stage of silicosis must be \u201cmedically determined.\u201d Therefore, the burden of proof upon the claimant required him to establish by medical evidence the progression of his disease beyond the first stage, and the Commission did not err in placing that burden upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">The claimant also contends that the Commission erred in holding that the medical evidence did not show a change in condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">A finding of fact by the Commission, if supported by credible evidence, is conclusive and binding upon this court. Code \u00a7 65-94 [now Code \u00a7 65.1-98]); <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Lynchburg Foundry, </em>204 Va. 303, 305, 130 S.E. 2d 429, 431 (1963). And a finding upon conflicting medical evidence that a certain physical condition does or does not exist is such a conclusive finding of fact. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Capitol Hotel, </em>189 Va. 585, 588, 54 S.E. 2d 106, 107-108 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Here, there was evidence on behalf of the claimant that the silicosis from which he suffered had advanced beyond the first stage at the time of the second hearing. On the other hand, there was evidence on behalf of the employer that there had been no progression of the disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">It is obvious, from a reading of its written opinion, that the Commission gave greater weight to the doctors\u2019 reports submitted by the employer than to those submitted by the claimant. That is especially true with regard to the roentgenologist who, on behalf of the employer, compared the X-ray films taken of the claimant before the second hearing with those taken before the first hearing and who reported that there had been \u201clittle if any change\u201d in the claimant\u2019s condition in the interval.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">There is nothing in the record to suggest that the evidence submitted by the employer was other than credible. It was peculiarly within the province of the Commission to decide what evidence, if credible, was entitled to greater weight. <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Pendleton Const. Co., 182 </em>Va. 191, 194, 28 S.E. 2d 621, 623 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">The Commission resolved the conflict in the evidence before it and found as a fact that the claimant\u2019s silicosis had not advanced beyond the first stage at the time of the second hearing. That finding is binding upon us, and the award of the Commission will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-12\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b372-9\"> \u201c\u00a7 65-95. <em>Review of award on change of </em>condition\u2014Upon its own motion or upon the application of any party in interest, on the ground of a change in condition, the Industrial Commission may review any award and on such review may make an award ending, diminishing or increasing the compensation previously awarded, subject to the maximum or minimum provided in this Act, and shall immediately send to the parties a copy of the award.
