A jury trial resulted in a joint verdict against Stecker and Beale in the amount of $10,500. The trial court approved the verdict and entered judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">The judgment has become final as to Stecker. We awarded a writ of error to review the judgment as to Beale.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">The only question before us is whether there was sufficient evidence to sustain the jury\u2019s finding that Beale\u2019s negligence caused or contributed to cause the injuries sustained by the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-10\">Under these circumstances, the evidence and all proper inferences from the evidence will be stated in the light most favorable to the appellee since she was awarded the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Holbert </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>209 Va. 210, 163 S.E. 2d 187 (1968); <em>Laughorn </em>v. <em>Eanes, </em>207 Va. 584, 151 S.E. 2d 378 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-11\">Mrs. Jones was injured as the result of an automobile accident which occurred on July 3, 1966, at approximately 11:30 p.m. at the intersection of Lear Road (State Route 1606) and U. S. Route 58 in Isle of Wight County. At the time of her injury she was riding in a car driven by her husband, Archie Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-12\">The eastbound Jones car was making a left turn in a northerly direction from Route 58 into Lear Road when it was struck in the right side by the front of a westbound vehicle driven by Stecker. As the result of the impact with the Stecker car, the Jones car was knocked \u201csideways\u201d at least 10 or 15 feet and came to rest in the northwest corner of the intersection. Stecker\u2019s vehicle came to rest after this impact facing in a southerly direction blocking the westbound lanes of the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-13\">Shortly after the initial impact between the Jones and Stecker vehicles, a second collision occurred between the Stecker vehicle and the car being driven by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-14\">Beale\u2019s car sideswiped the rear of Stecker\u2019s car \u201ca pretty good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>whack\u201d and \u201cpulled him away from the Jones automobile and spun him around in the road.\u201d Beale\u2019s car did not strike the Jones vehicle and the second collision did not cause further impact between Stecker\u2019s car and the Jones vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Beale had been following Stecker from Gray\u2019s Texaco Station, which was located approximately six tenths of a mile east of the intersection of Lear Road and Route 58. The evidence was that Beale and Stecker had been \u201criding around\u201d in Beale\u2019s car in the vicinity of Franklin from a few minutes after 10:00 p.m. until a few minutes before the accident; that they had been drinking alcoholic beverages together; that Beale had been drinking to a considerable extent prior to the time that he and Stecker commenced \u201criding around\u201d together; and that Beale had been unruly, loud and profane on several occasions earlier in the evening. The evidence discloses that because of Beale\u2019s condition, Stecker and at least one other person had driven Beale\u2019s car during their meanderings in the vicinity of Franklin.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Shortly before 11:30 p.m. Stecker, who was then driving Beale\u2019s car, announced his intention of going home because he had to work the following day. He drove Beale\u2019s car to Gray\u2019s Texaco Station, where his car was parked. He left the Beale vehicle and proceeded in his own car in a westerly direction toward Franklin. Beale, who was accompanied by his wife, drove his car behind Stecker from the service station to the intersection. During this drive the evidence shows that both Stecker and Beale drove at speeds in excess of the speed limits and that Beale was traveling, at various times, from one to four car lengths behind Stecker\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Stecker was called as an adverse witness by the appellee. He testified that he was aware that Beale was following him; that he was aware of Beale\u2019s \u201cdrunken\u201d condition; that he was concerned about his presence behind him and \u201cI worried about what he was going to do.\u201d His testimony, however, was that Beale\u2019s conduct did not \u201cdetract\u201d his attention from the road ahead of him and that he kept his \u201ceyes on the road because I had to see what was in front of me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">When a defendant is called as an adverse witness the plaintiff is not bound by such of his testimony as is in conflict with evidence introduced by the plaintiff; but the plaintiff is bound by so much of the testimony of the defendant as is clear, reasonable and uncontradicted. <em>Weddle, Admx. </em>v. <em>Draper, </em>204 Va. 319, 322, 130 S.E. 2d 462, 465 (1963). See also <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>192 Va. 702, 66 S.E. 2d 559 (1951); <em>Crabtree </em>v. <em>Dingus, </em>194 Va. 615, 74 S.E. 2d 54 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>The proximate cause of an event is that act or omission which, in natural and continuous sequence, unbroken by an efficient intervening cause, produces the event, and without which that event would not have occurred. <em>Huffman </em>v. <em>Sorenson, </em>194 Va. 932, 937, 76 S.E. 2d 183, 187 (1953); <em>Long\u2019s Baggage Transfer Co. </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>198 Va. 608, 611, 95 S.E. 2d 221, 223 (1956); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Prater, </em>206 Va. 693, 698, 146 S.E. 2d 179, 183 (1966); <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Whittaker, </em>207 Va. 616, 622, 151 S.E. 2d 422, 428 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">To impose liability upon one person for damages incurred by another, it must be shown that the negligent conduct was a necessary physical antecedent to the damages. <em>Wells </em>v. Whittaker, <em>supra, </em>at 622, 151 S.E. 2d at 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">\u201cThe evidence tending to show causal connection must be sufficient to take the question out of the realm of mere conjecture, or speculation, and into the realm of legitimate inference, before a question of fact for submission to the jury has been made out.\u201d <em>Hawkins </em>v. <em>Beechum, </em>168 Va. 553, 561, 191 S.E. 640, 643 (1937); <em>Wilkins </em>v. <em>Sibley, </em>205 Va. 171, 174, 135 S.E. 2d 765, 767 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">The testimony of Stecker is clear, reasonable and uncontradicted that Beale\u2019s presence and conduct did not \u201cdetract\u201d his attention from the road ahead and that he kept his \u201ceyes on the road because I had to see what was in front of me.\u201d The record shows that Stecker underwent a rigorous examination as an adverse witness. At no place in this testimony did Stecker indicate that the operation of his car was affected by either Beale\u2019s presence behind him or the manner in which Beale operated his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">In view of this positive and uncontradicted testimony, we hold that Stecker\u2019s \u201cconcern\u201d and \u201cworry\u201d about what Beale might do was insufficient to create a jury issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-9\">Unquestionably Beale was guilty of negligence. To say, however, that this negligence was a proximate cause of appellee\u2019s injuries would require us to engage in conjecture or speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">Having found the evidence insufficient to support a verdict against the appellant, we reverse the judgment appealed from and set aside the verdict as to him. A final judgment will be entered here for the appellant, Jerry Wayne Beale.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
