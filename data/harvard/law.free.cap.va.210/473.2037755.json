Rosenfeld and others (the \u201cOwners\u201d) calling for Danter\u2019s construction of the building for $450,000. Being unable to post the performance bond required by the contract, Danter asked Atlantic States Construction Company, Inc. \u201cto take over this job\u201d. On May 31, 1965 Atlantic made a contract with the Owners calling for At<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>lantic\u2019s construction of the budding for $450,000, and the prior contract between the Owners and Danter was cancelled. Danter\u2019s contract dated April 16, 1965 and Atlantic\u2019s contract dated May 31, 1965 had the same terms and conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">To induce Atlantic to enter into the May 31, 1965 contract, Danter had agreed to deposit $30,000 with Atlantic to indemnify it from loss in constructing the building for $450,000. After Atlantic entered into the contract Danter failed to deliver the $30,000, but agreed instead to supply the necessary steel for construction of the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Steel for construction of the building was ordered by Danter and supplied by plaintiff McCann under a contract made with Danter on July 15, 1965.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Not having been paid for any of the steel, McCann filed a memorandum of mechanic\u2019s lien in October 1965. McCann admits that it did not receive any order for steel from Atlantic and, before McCann\u2019s memorandum was filed, McCann did not send any bill or invoice or other claim for payment to Atlantic.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">In December 1965 McCann instituted this suit to enforce the mechanic\u2019s lien against the Owners\u2019 property. With the court\u2019s permission Atlantic filed a surety bond conditioned for the payment of such judgment as might be rendered upon the merits, and the court released the Owners\u2019 property from the lien asserted by McCann.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Atlantic contended that since it owed nothing to Danter, the subcontractor to which McCann had furnished steel, Code \u00a7 43-9 precluded the assertion of a mechanic\u2019s lien by McCann. <em>Wilson Co. </em>v. <em>McManus, </em>162 Va. 130, 173 S.E. 361 (1934). The trial court held, however, that McCann was entitled to a mechanic\u2019s lien under Code \u00a7 43-19<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because Danter had assigned its contract for the construction of the building to Atlantic.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>The evidence in this case does not support the court\u2019s finding that Danter assigned its contract to Atlantic. Rather, the evidence shows that the Owners made a new contract with Atlantic and that the prior contract with Danter was cancelled. So Code \u00a7 43-19, n. 2 <em>supra, </em>is inapplicable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">The trial judge rejected as incredible Atlantic\u2019s testimony that it believed Danter had paid McCann for the steel before Atlantic entered into the contract of May 31, 1965. But even if that testimony is rejected, there is no basis for concluding from the evidence that Atlantic owed Danter anything when McCann\u2019s memorandum of mechanic\u2019s lien was filed. And since Atlantic owed Danter nothing, McCann, the supplier of materials to Danter, cannot assert a mechanic\u2019s lien. Va. Code Ann. \u00a7 43-9 (1953 Repl. vol.); <em>Wilson Co. </em>v. <em>McManus, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Our order will reverse the decree appealed from and remand the case for entry of a decree dismissing the bill of complaint filed by McCann Steel Company, Incorporated.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b660-8\"> Danter began negotiations with McCann for the purchase of steel for the building in March 1965. The evidence does not show when Danter and McCann made a contract for the sale and purchase of the steel, but McCann alleged in its bill of complaint that the contract was made on July 15, 1965.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b660-9\"> \u201c\u00a7 43-19.
