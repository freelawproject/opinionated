The petitioner wanted the transcript so that he could appeal his 1955 conviction to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-17\">Following his conviction in 1955, the petitioner advised his retained counsel that he wished to appeal. However, no action was taken because the petitioner\u2019s family could not provide the necessary funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-18\">On January 25, 1967, the petitioner filed in the trial court a petition for writ of habeas corpus alleging that he had been inadequately represented by counsel at his robbery trial and had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>denied the right to appeal his conviction. After a plenary hearing, the trial court dismissed the petition. We refused a writ of error. <em>Ringley </em>v. <em>Peyton, </em>208 Va. cv (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">The petitioner then applied for relief by way of habeas corpus to the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia. His petition was dismissed by that court on May 23, 1968, and he appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">The Court of Appeals, in an unreported memorandum decision, held that the petitioner \u201cwas not deprived of the effective assistance of counsel\u201d at his robbery trial. The court further held, however, that the petitioner was denied \u201chis right of appeal\u201d. Accordingly, the court vacated the order of the District Court and remanded with instructions \u201cto retain the case for a reasonable time to permit Virginia the opportunity to allow an appeal\u201d and if \u201csuch appeal is not now permissible or, if available, is not permitted within a reasonable time, the District Court will issue its writ of habeas corpus releasing Ringley from State custody\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Upon return of the case, the District Court entered an order retaining the case on its docket \u201cpending the outcome of the proceedings in the Virginia State Courts\u201d. A copy of the order was certified to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">The trial court then appointed counsel to represent the petitioner \u201cin attempting to perfect an appeal\u201d of his robbery conviction. Counsel filed a motion asking that the petitioner be provided a transcript of the evidence of his trial. The court ruled that a transcript could not be provided because the reporter who took the testimony was dead and her notes had been destroyed. The court noted in its order that the petitioner had entered a plea of guilty at his 1955 trial \u201cafter having been fully advised by the Trial Judge of his rights.\u201d Accordingly, the court denied the petitioner\u2019s motion and refused the transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">The records of the petitioner\u2019s trial in 1955 show that his conviction of robbery was, in fact, based upon a plea of guilty. Those same records, the evidence adduced at the 1967 state court habeas corpus hearing, and the memorandum decision of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit all demonstrate that the plea was voluntarily and intelligently entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-10\">At the time the Court of Appeals rendered its decision in the petitioner\u2019s case (April 9, 1969), we had not decided <em>Peyton </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number><em>King, </em>210 Va. 194, 169 S.E.2d 569, and <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Peyton, </em>210 Va. 199, 169 S.E.2d 460, both announced September 5, 1969. In those cases, we held that no appeal lies from a conviction based upon a voluntary and intelligent plea of guilty where no question of jurisdiction is involved and no claim is made that the sentence exceeds that authorized by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">Here, the petitioner has raised no jurisdictional questions and the sentence of which he complains is within the range fixed by law. Since his plea of guilty was voluntarily and intelligently entered, he is not entitled to appeal his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The trial court did not err, therefore, in refusing to provide the petitioner a transcript of the evidence of his trial. Accordingly, the petition for a writ of error will be refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">\n<em>Writ of error refused.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
