There, a judgment was entered against Combined Insurance Company of America in favor of Ralph Lee Mundy. Combined applied for an appeal (Code, \u00a7 16.1-106) and gave an appeal bond (Code, \u00a7 16.1-107). The judge of the county court approved the surety on the bond and allowed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-17\">The bond listed the names of Caleb L. Hall as principal and The Travelers Indemnity Company as surety. It was executed by Hall and by Travelers,, and its condition was that Combined abide by the judgment of the circuit court if the appeal was perfected or satisfy the judgment of the county court if the appeal was not perfected.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-18\">In the circuit court, Mundy filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the bond was \u201cdefective and [did] not comply with the statutes governing appeal bonds.\u201d The court granted the motion and dismissed the appeal. Combined was granted a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Code, \u00a7 16.1-107 provides, in part, that \u201cNo such appeal shall be allowed unless and until the party applying for the same <em>or someone for him </em>shall give bond, in an amount and with sufficient surety . . . to abide by such judgment as may be rendered on appeal if such appeal be perfected, or if not so perfected, then to satisfy the judgment of the court in which it was rendered.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The trial court was of opinion that the bond required by Code, \u00a7 16.1-107 \u201cmust be the bond of the appellant.\u201d The court held that Caleb L. Hall, shown as principal on the bond, executed the instrument \u201cnot for the appellant but for himself\u201d and that the bond did not comply, therefore,, with the provisions of Code, \u00a7 16.1-107.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">We do not agree. We believe the words \u201cor someone for him,\u201d appearing in Code, \u00a7 16.1-107, mean that the bond called for by that Code section may be given by someone other than the party taking the appeal, provided the bond is conditioned as required by the statute and carries sufficient surety. The bond filed in this case conformed to the requirements of the statute, and it was error, therefore, to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">The order dismissing the appeal will be reversed, the appeal reinstated, and the case remanded for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
