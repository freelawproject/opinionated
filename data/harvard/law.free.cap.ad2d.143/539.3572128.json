Kelly, as Superintendent of Attica Correctional Facility, Respondent.</parties>\n\n\n\n<opinion><p id=\"AMIL\">Judgment unanimously affirmed. Memorandum: The Hearing Officer determined that it would jeopardize insti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>tutional safety and correctional goals to transport four inmate witnesses from one correctional facility to another to testify at petitioner\u2019s disciplinary hearing; therefore, the Hearing Officer interviewed the witnesses when petitioner was not present. The Hearing Officer\u2019s determination had a rational basis and complied with the applicable regulation <em>(see, </em>7 NYCRR 254.5; <em>People ex rel. Bradley v Smith, </em>115 AD2d 225, <em>lv denied </em>67 NY2d 604).</p><p id=\"b588-3\">Petitioner was found guilty of four separate assaults upon correctional officers as well as unhygienic conduct, threats upon correctional officers, and the refusal to obey a direct order. In light of petitioner\u2019s lengthy institutional record of serious violations of inmate rules, the imposition of a penalty of 720 days\u2019 continuous confinement in special housing and loss of good time credits for two years was not so disproportionate as to shock one\u2019s sense of fairness <em>(Matter of Pell v Board of Educ., </em>34 NY2d 222).</p><p id=\"b588-4\">Petitioner\u2019s remaining claim lacks merit <em>(Matter of Coleman v Kelly, </em>130 AD2d 976, <em>affd </em>72 NY2d 850). (Appeal from judgment of Supreme Court, Wyoming County, Dadd, J. \u2014 art 78.) Present \u2014 Dillon, P. J., Callahan, Denman, Balio and Law-ton, JJ.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
