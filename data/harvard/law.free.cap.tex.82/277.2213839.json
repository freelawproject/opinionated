J. Sorrells, in the year 1884, the appellee, Mrs. C. V. Sorrells, owned in her own right, together with other separate property, two mules. These animals were then colts and worth $35 each, and a portion of their present value as a result of their growth and avoirdupois, augmented as the years rolled on, is the subject of this controversy. The appellant in the year 1888 held a just debt, merged into a valid judgment, for a small sum against the husband of the appellee, and in satisfaction of which he caused a writ of execution to be levied upon these mules of the wife during that year. At the time of the levy the animals were grown and each of them worth in the market $75, instead of $35 as originally. The husband had managed and cared for the mules since the marriage, and the community estate furnished the provender for the animals during the intermediate time. The appellee replevied the property and duly made her claim thereto under the statute \u201cto try the rights of property.\u201d The case came up to the District Court from a Justice Court, and the former court rendered a judgment in favor of the wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>The appellant insists that the enhanced value of the mules which has resulted from the attention of the husband and the food furnished by the community since the marriage amounts to $80, and is an <em>increase </em>of the separate estate of the wife, and consequently is community property and liable to his execution. There is a modicum of plausibility in his contention, based upon the construction given by the Supreme Court to \u201cthe increase of the lands\u201d of the wife; but these decisions were inspired by the necessity of protecting, not of destroying, her estate. Deblane v. Lynch, 23 Texas, 25; Forbes v. Dunham, 24 Texas, 611; White v. Lynch, 26 Texas, 195; Cleveland v. Cole, 65 Texas, 402; Epperson v. Jones, 65 Texas, 425; Braden v. Gose, 57 Texas, 37; Carr v. Tucker, 42 Texas, 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The Supreme Court has often decided what is <em>not </em>\u201cthe increase of the wife\u2019s lands,\u201d but so far as we are aware have not decided what <em>is, </em>and we are not required to do so now. The rule contended for would be most impracticable in application. The equitable criterion, if any were admissible in cases like the present, should be the expenses to the husband or the community, regarded as an investment, of rearing the mules, not the increased value, which may be due to other causes, subject to be offset by the value of their use, if anything. This would lead to \u201cconfusion worse confounded.\u201d As applied to live stock belonging to the wife, \u201cthe increase\u201d of such property (ever since the decision of the Supreme Court in Howard v. York, 20 Texas, 670) has been invariably recognized in the reported cases to denote the progeny of the original stock or their descendants. This construction comports with the etymology of the term and accords with the universal understanding. Deblane v. Lynch, supra. The record, therefore, develops no \u201cincrease\u201d of these particular mules in the sense that would add to or constitute a part of the- community \u00e9state. They are still the same animals which the wife owned at the time of her marriage, and, mule like, they have stubbornly refused \u201cto bring forth after their kind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">The sex of these particular mules and their capacity for reproduction, if any, is not disclosed by the record, but the general rule founded on common knowledge, with possibly some sporadic exceptions, must be recognized, that mules do not \u201cincrease, multiply, and replenish the earth\u201d according to the ordinary laws of procreation\u201d and the genesial command. It would seem, therefore, that there can be no \u201cincrease\u201d of the wife\u2019s separate estate if composed solely of specific mules at the time of her marriage. In cases of other live stock, his interest, recognized by law, in the offsprings thereof, compensates the husband and the community, but the erratic mule standeth apart, \u201clike patience on a monument, smiling at grief.\u201d It would tend to entirely destroy the corpus of the wife\u2019s estate, consisting of live personal property, to declare that an augmentation in weight or value should be deemed an \u201cincrease\u201d of the property itself so as to constitute a part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>of the community to that extent. Suppose it should decline under the ministrations of the husband\u2014what then would compensate the wife? Fortunately she does not hold her separate property by so precarious a tenure as to depend upon the fluctuations of weight or the prices in the market. If she did, then the alert creditor would only need to abide his time in confidence of ultimately seizing, upon a ruthless execution, the flock, the drove, and feathered tribe of the wife. The law too closely guards, \u201cwith flaming sword and cherubim,\u201d the sacred rights of the good housewife in her own \u201cseparate property,\u201d to admit of such grave consequences.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b299-8\">Adopted November 17, 1891.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">We need only to add that the use of the mules and the products of their labor may be supposed to compensate the community for the provender consumed, and the husband would scarcely demand any. recompense for the felicity of teaching them how \u201cto work in the traces.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">\u25a0 We conclude that the judgment of the District Court is a most righteous one, and ought to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
