Rule for Costs.\u2014The statute seems to contenvplate that a motion for security for costs may he made and the rule granted \u201cat any time before final judgment.\u201d Art. 1436. It was error to refuse a motion for reason that it came too late when made after the plaintiff had announced ready for trial. But where verdict and judgment were for the plaintiff the error was immaterial, no injury appearing from the ruling.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b362-15\"><em>2. </em>Master and Servant\u2014Contributory Negligence.\u2014In an action for damages for personal injuries caused by defective machinery in use, where, it appeared the servant had been in the employ for six months and had known of the defects within a few days after entering the service, he having called the attention of the foreman to the defect, and was assured by him that the defect would be remedied, it was error for the court to charge the jiiry that \u201cthe plaintiff would not be guilty of negligence in working with defective machinery, though he might know of its defects, if he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>informed the master or his agent of the defect and the master or his agent had promised to fix the machinery.\u201d This was upon the weight of testimony. Besides, negligence is a question for the jury to determine upon the entire facts.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b363-5\">3. Safe Machinery\u2014Master and Servant.\u2014It was error to instruct the jury that it was the duty of the railway company to furnish <em>safe machinery. </em>A railway company is hound to use a high degree of care in furnishing and keeping in repair ma-p chinery which its servants are to use, but it is not bound to furnish machinery which is absolutely safe.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-6\">Appeal from Smith.

Railway v. Smith, 52 Texas, 184; Hoover v. Railway, 61 Texas, 503; Railway v. Bisch, 41 Am. and Eng. Ry. Cases, p. 89; Railway v. Hoosey, 6 Am. and Eng. Ry. Cases, p. 459, and note on p. 462.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b363-9\">2. While it may not ordinarily be negligence for a servant to use defective machinery after the master has promised to repair it, yet if after the promise the master fails for an unreasonable length of time to repair the machine, the servant has no right to expect a repair; and he voluntarily assumes the risk of its dangerous condition and can not recover. The charge should have submitted the question of reasonable time to the jury. Railway v. Meyers, 55 Texas, 110; Railway v. Smith, 52 Texas, 178; 2 Ct. App. C.

Duncan, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABg\">Where a servant cognizant of defects in machinery furnished for his use complains thereof to his master and the latter agrees to remedy the defect, the master is liable to the servant for injuries received by him in the use of such machinery; and the servant is not chargeable with contributory negligence by remaining in the service, unless the danger is so great that a man of ordinary prudence would not remain.

The application for continuance did not show sufficient diligence to procure the attendance of the witness for whose absence a continuance or postponement of the trial was asked, and the court overruled the motion for rule for security for costs on the ground that the motion came too late after plaintiff had announced ready for trial, and on the further ground that the court had by previous order set the case for trial on the day it was called.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-3\">The statute seems to contemplate that such motions may be made and rule granted \u201cat any time before final judgment.\u201d Rev. Stats., art. 1436. But if a court should overrule such a motion urged within the time prescribed, it would seem that a judgment against a defendant which fixes upon it liability for all costs ought not to be reversed on this ground, unless it be shown that some injury resulted from the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">It appears from the evidence of the plaintiff himself that he had been in the employment, in which the hand car claimed to have been defective was used, for about six months, and that he knew of the defect within two days after he commenced work, and from time to time made the defect known to the section foreman, who repeatedly promised to have the defect repaired, but never did so. Notwithstanding these facts, he continued in the service in which the car was used.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">With others, the court gave the following charge: \u201cThe plaintiff would not be guilty of negligence in working with defective machinery, though he might know of its defects, if he had informed the? master or his agent of the defect, and the master or his agent had promised to fix the machinery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">The usual charge in reference to contributory negligence was given, and the charge closed as follows: \u201cIf you find for defendant, so say by your verdict. As before stated, it would not be negligence for the servant to remain in the employ of the master after the servant found out the machinery was defective, provided he notified the master, and the master or his agent promised to repair it. But if he knew the hand car was out of repair and did not report it to the master and continued to use it, then he can not recover, and you will find for de- \u25a0 fendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Adf\">The giving of the charge first copied is assigned as error. Whether the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence was a question of fact for the jury, and it was not proper for the court in effect to declare that he was not so guilty if for a period of about six months he had known of the defect and continued to work with it, provided he had informed the master or an agent of the defect and promise had been made to repair it, which he knew had not been complied with. The court might as well, as the evidence stood, have charged the jury that the plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b365-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Delivered November 27, 1891.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">\u00abThe court in effect further charged the jury that it was the duty of the appellant to furnish its servants with safe machinery, which was exacting too much. A railway company is bound to use a high degree of care in furnishing and in keeping in repair machinery which its servants are to use, but it is not bound to furnish machinery that is absolutely safe, and the charge given was calculated to induce the jury to believe that such a duty rested upon appellant in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">For the errors noticed, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
