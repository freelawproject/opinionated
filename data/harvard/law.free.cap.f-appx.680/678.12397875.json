McHugh, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b702-18\">Leslie Susan Harrison, a federal prisoner proceeding pro se,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> seeks a certificate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>appealability (COA) to challenge the district court\u2019s denial of her 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 application. Ms. Harrison also requests leave to proceed in forma pauperis. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we conclude that reasonable jurists would not find it debatable whether the district court was correct in denying Ms. Harrison\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion as untimely. Accordingly, we deny the COA, grant the motion to proceed in forma pauperis, and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Following a jury trial in June 2012, Ms. Harrison was found guilty of conspiracy to manufacture and distribute fifty or more grams of methamphetamine. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(A)(viii), 846. The district court sentenced Ms. Harrison to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment, and she appealed to this court. We vacated the sentence and remanded for resentencing. <em>United States v. Harrison, </em>743 F.3d 760 (10th Cir. 2014). On remand, the district court sentenced Ms. Harrison to 136 months\u2019 imprisonment. Ms. Harrison again appealed, but on January 30, 2015, we affirmed her sentence. <em>See United States v. Harrison, </em>591 Fed.Appx. 684 (10th Cir. 2015) (unpublished). Ms. Harrison did not seek rehearing or file a petition for writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">On August 15, 2016, Ms. Harrison filed a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct her sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and Amendment 794 of the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual. The district court first denied the motion as untimely, concluding Ms. Harrison\u2019s time to file a \u00a7 2255 motion expired on April 30, 2016. Second, the court concluded Amendment 794 is \u201cnot retroactive under the sentencing guidelines, federal statutes, or Tenth Circuit precedent\u201d and \u201cmay not serve as the basis on which to reduce [Ms. Harrison\u2019s] sentence.\u201d Ms. Harrison timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">Ms. Harrison seeks a COA to challenge the district court\u2019s order denying her 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 petition as untimely. \u201cThe issuance of a COA is a jurisdictional prerequisite to an appeal from the denial of an issue raised in a \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>596 F.3d 1228, 1241 (10th Cir. 2010). Where, as here, the district court\u2019s decision rests on procedural grounds, we will issue a COA only if the petitioner \u201cdemonstrate^] both that \u2018jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019\u201d <em>Clark v. Oklahoma, </em>468 F.3d 711, 713 (10th Cir. 2006) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)). Because we conclude jurists of reason would not find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling, we need not decide whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-12\">The district court ruled the \u00a7 2255 motion untimely under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f). This section establishes a one-year statute of limitations for filing a \u00a7 2255 motion, running from the latest of four possible dates. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(1)-(4). The district court determined \u00a7 2255(f)(1) applied to Ms. Harrison\u2019s motion\u2014the date of the final judgment of conviction. If a petitioner does not file a petition for writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court after her direct appeal, the judgment becomes \u201cfinal\u201d and the one-year clock starts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>when \u201cthe time for filing a certiorari petition expires.\u201d <em>United States v. Burch, </em>202 F.3d 1274, 1279 (10th Cir. 2000). The time for filing a petition for writ of certiorari expires ninety days after entry of the judgment. Sup. Ct. R. 13.1. Because Ms. Harrison did not file a petition for writ of certiorari, her one-year clock began running on April 30, 2015, ninety days after we affirmed her sentence on January 30, 2015. Thus, her time to file a \u00a7 2255 motion expired on April 30, 2016. She did not file her motion until August 15, 2016, which was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">In seeking a COA, Ms. Harrison does not dispute that her \u00a7 2255 motion was untimely under \u00a7 2255(f)(1), but contends the district court erred in failing to consider her motion under \u00a7 2255(f)(4), which provides that the statute of limitations begins to run on \u201cthe date on which the facts supporting the claim ... could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(f)(4). She claims that Amendment 794 of the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual constitutes a \u201cnew fact\u201d not discovered until the date the amendment went into effect\u2014November 1, 2015\u2014and accordingly, her petition was timely filed because it was filed before November 1, 2016.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">But Ms. Harrison cites no authority to support her assertion that an amendment to the sentencing guidelines constitutes a \u201cfact\u201d that would reset the one-year statute of limitations under \u00a7 2255(f)(4). A change or clarification of controlling law is not a \u201cfact\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2255(f)(4). <em>See Barreto-Barreto v. United States, </em>551 F.3d 95, 99 n.4 (1st Cir. 2008) (\u201c[T]he discovery of a new legal theory does not constitute a discoverable \u2018fact\u2019 for purposes of \u00a7 2255(f)(4).\u201d); <em>Lo v. Endicott, </em>506 F.3d 572, 575 (7th Cir. 2007) (state supreme court\u2019s clarification of the law is not a \u201cfactual predicate\u201d under \u00a7 2255(f)(4)); <em>E.J.R.E. v. United States, </em>453 F.3d 1094, 1097-98 (8th Cir. 2006) (a federal court of appeals decision is not a discoverable fact. under \u00a7 2255(f)(4)); <em>Shannon v. Newland, </em>410 F.3d 1083, 1088-89 (9th Cir. 2005) (state supreme court\u2019s decision is not a \u201cfact\u201d entitling application of \u00a7 2255(f)(4)); <em>United States v. Pollard, </em>161 F.Supp.2d 1, 10 (D.D.C. 2001) (concluding \u00a7 2254(f)(4) \u201cis only triggered when a defendant discovers facts, not the legal consequences of those, facts\u201d); <em>United States v. Hines, </em>592 Fed.Appx. 755, 756 (10th Cir. 2015) (unpublished) (holding a Supreme Court decision \u201cdoes not constitute a newly discovered fact under \u00a7 2255(f)(4)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">An exception to this rule, as detailed in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>provides that the vacatur of a prior conviction enhancing a defendant\u2019s sentence is a \u201cfact\u201d under \u00a7 2255(f)(4) that resets the statute of limitations. 544 U.S. 295, 302, 125 S.Ct. 1571, 161 L.Ed.2d 542 (2005); <em>cf. United States v. Cox, </em>83 F.3d 336, 339 (10th Cir. 1996) (\u201cIf a defendant successfully attacks state sentences, he may then apply for reopening of any federal sentence enhanced by the state sentences.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">Here, the district court found Ms. Harrison did not \u201cidentify any facts that could not-be discovered until months after her sentence was finalized,\u201d and \u201call the facts related to her sentence were necessarily available at her resentencing in 2014.\u201d Amendment 794 to the sentencing guidelines is not a \u201cfact\u201d relating to Ms. Harrison\u2019s criminal history and does not otherwise allow her to invoke \u00a7 2254(f)(4). <em>United States v. Bazaldua, </em>Nos. 06-CR-0100 (JNE/JSM) &amp; 16-CV-2479 (JNE), 2016 WL 5858634, at *1 (D. Minn. Oct. 5, 2016) (unpublished) (\u201cAmendment 794 to the Sentencing Guidelines ... is not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>basis for Bazaldua to invoke \u00a7 2255(f)(4).\u201d). Therefore, because we conclude reasonable jurists could not debate whether the district court correctly applied the date of the final judgment of conviction, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(1), we deny Ms. Harrison a COA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">As a final matter, we turn to Ms. Harrison\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal. After reviewing Ms. Harrison\u2019s affidavit in support of her motion, we conclude she has demonstrated \u201ca financial inability to pay the required fees and the existence of a reasoned, nonfrivolous argument on the law and facts in support of the issues raised on appeal.\u201d <em>McIntosh v. U.S. Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>115 F.3d 809, 812 (10th Cir. 1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). We therefore grant her request to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b705-11\">Reasonable jurists could not debate whether the district court correctly dismissed Ms. Harrison\u2019s \u00a7 2255 petition as untimely. Accordingly, we DENY her request for a COA and DISMISS the appeal; We also GRANT Ms. Harrison\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b702-19\"> This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b702-20\">. Because Ms. Harrison is proceeding pro se, we construe her filings liberally. <em>See Ogden v. San Juan Cty., </em>32 F.3d 452, 455 (10th Cir. 1994). \u2018\u2018[T]his rule of liberal construction stops, however, at the point at which we begin to serve as [her] advocate.\u201d <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number><em>States </em>v. <em>Pinson, </em>584 F.3d 972, 975 (10th Cir. 2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b705-6\">. We do not address whether Amendment 794 should be retroactively applied to Ms. Harrison's sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) because she has waived this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
