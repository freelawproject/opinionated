He argued that the calculation of his sentencing guideline range <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>had relied on the residual clause of USSG \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) and that the residual clause is unconstitutionally vague because it uses essentially the same language as the language in the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(b), which was held to be unconstitutionally vague in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015). The district court denied the motion but granted a certificate of appealability. We AFFIRM the decision below. In <em>Beckles v. United States, </em>No. 15-8544, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 137 S.Ct. 886, 197 L.Ed.2d 145, 2017 WL 855781 (S.Ct. Mar. 6, 2017), the Supreme Court held that the unconstitutional-vagueness holding in <em>Johnson </em>does not apply to the residual clause in the sentencing guidelines. The other issues raised by the parties are moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b809-26\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
