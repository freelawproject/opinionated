Holmes, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b674-12\">Defendant-Appellant Crystal Lynn Jones pleaded guilty to embezzling from her employer, Teel\u2019s Used Trucks (\u201cTeel\u2019s\u201d) in Hays, Kansas. She objected, however, to the amount of loss asserted in the Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) prepared by the U.S. Probation Office. Following Ms. Jones\u2019s plea, the district court held a sentencing hearing, at which the government presented evidence as to the amount of loss. The court then sentenced Ms. Jones to a term of imprisonment and restitution. She now appeals, arguing that (1) the district court impermissibly shifted the burden of proof at the sentencing hearing, requiring her to disprove the amount of loss in the PSR rather than requiring the government to prove it; and (2) the court erred in including in the restitution award amounts embezzled outside the temporal scope of the charge to which she pleaded guilty. We reject both arguments and affirm the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b674-16\">In 2014, Ms. Jones was charged with embezzling funds from her employer, Teel\u2019s, where she had worked as the office manager since 2007. Specifically, the one-count criminal information stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-17\">[cjommencing as early as 2008 and continuing through 2013, the defendant CRYSTAL LYNN JONES embezzled in excess of $500,000 from Teel\u2019s by writing unauthorized checks from Teel\u2019s company accounts at Commerce Bank and the Bank of Hays for her personal benefit. She also conducted [Automated Clearing House] transfers from Teel\u2019s accounts for her own personal benefit. JONES hid her scheme by altering entries in the company\u2019s accounting records via Quickbooks accounting software and by forging checks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>R., Vol. I, at 8-9. The information concluded that \u201c[f]rom on or about 2008 through 2013,\u201d Ms. Jones, \u201cknowing the same to have been stolen, converted and taken by fraud, transported, transmitted and transferred more than $500,000 in securities and money in interstate commerce. The foregoing is in violation of Title 18 United States Code, Sections 2 &amp; 2314.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9. Ms. Jones pleaded guilty (without a plea agreement). She was subsequently sentenced to a prison term of twenty-seven months and ordered\u2014pursuant to the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (\u201cMVRA\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A\u2014to pay restitution .to Teel\u2019s in the amount of $482,260.79. Two factors related to Ms. Jones\u2019s sentencing are at the center of the present appeal: (1) the amount of loss on which the district court based Ms. Jones\u2019s prison sentence and restitution amount, and (2) the time period during which Ms. Jones committed the offense. Below we summarize the facts relevant to each.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Beginning with the amount of loss, although the criminal information charged Ms. Jones with embezzling over $500,000 from Teel\u2019s, her plea petition stated only that she had embezzled more than $5,000, the amount required under the statute.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While addressing the court at the plea hearing, Ms. Jones\u2019s attorney specifically noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-7\">in the plea petition you might notice that the amount of the loss we\u2019ve listed at more than $5,000, and that\u2019s what the statute reads to make it a felony under 18 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 2314. And so that\u2019s what I\u2019ve advised Ms. Jones to plead guilty to. We didn\u2019t want to waive any potential issues with the amount of loss for sentencing guidelines purposes, but that was\u2014I wanted to point that out to the Court and that\u2019s what we were prepared to have her plead guilty to was an amount of loss of more than $5,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">R., Vol. II, at 36-37. The district court also used the over-$5,000 figure when questioning Ms. Jones at the plea hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-11\">THE COURT: Ms. Jones, the government has said that beginning as early as 2008 and continuing through 2013 you embezzled in excess of $5,000 from Teel\u2019s. Did you do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-12\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 38. Thus Ms. Jones pleaded guilty only to embezzling over $5,000, not the over-$500,000 figure in the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-14\">The PSR, however, asserted that Ms. Jones \u201cembezzled over $500,000 from Teel\u2019s.\u201d R., Vol. Ill, at 11. Specifically, it listed various time periods during which Ms. Jones wrote checks from a Teel\u2019s bank account to her own personal bank account, wrote unauthorized cheeks from a Teel\u2019s account for her personal benefit, or made unauthorized purchases with a Teel\u2019s credit card or by other means. Each entry lists the amount of funds embezzled during that time period. <em>See id. </em>at 11-12 (stating that \u201c[f]rom approximately December 1, 2007 to October 1, 2013, Crystal Jones wrote unauthorized checks from the bank accounts of Teel\u2019s Trucks at the Commerce Bank and the Bank of Hays for her own personal benefit in an amount totaling approximately $16,878.16\u201d). The various amounts listed total $517,464.91.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-15\">Ms. Jones challenged the amount of loss detailed by the PSR, asserting that \u201cthere were some expenses that were authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>by Teel\u2019s and others that were not. For example, Ms. Jones bought lunches and office supplies with a personal credit card (subject to reimbursement).\u201d R., Vol. III, at 30. For this reason, Ms. Jones requested that the amount of loss be proven at sentencing. She also specifically objected to the inclusion of a total of $35,018.86 paid to Blue Cross Blue Shield for insurance premiums for Ms. Jones and her family members, which Ms. Jones maintained was authorized by Teel\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">At the sentencing hearing, the government presented the testimony of Dana Snelling, who began working as the office manager at Teel\u2019s in January 2014. Ms. Snelling testified that she had provided the information on which the calculations in the PSR were based. The government proceeded to review each of the instances of embezzlement detailed in the PSR and ask if Ms. Snelling had supplied that information to the FBI and if that information was correct; in each instance, she answered in the affirmative. The government had noted in its response to Ms. Jones\u2019s objections to the PSR that Ms. Snelling would testify that \u201c[receipts were never found where [Ms. Jones] paid for things for Teel\u2019s with her own credit card. The only records of any reimbursements to [Ms. Jones] [were] in 2007 for $135.26 and $50.00,\u201d R., Vol. Ill, at 30, and Ms. Snelling confirmed at the hearing that those two reimbursements were the only instances in which she had found that money paid to Ms. Jones was in fact for an authorized reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">On cross-examination, Ms. Snelling admitted that when she arrived at Teel\u2019s \u201c[t]here was a lot of missing information\u201d from the business\u2019s record-keeping. R., Vol. II, at 81. She also agreed with defense counsel that she had found ledgers in the Teel\u2019s office that appeared to authorize payments for \u201cthings like bills and parts and things like that\u201d that Teel\u2019s made in connection with employees\u2019 overtime work, <em>id. </em>at 85, and that such payments \u201ccould be\u201d authorized to reimburse certain employees for personal credit card expenditures. <em>Id. </em>at 87. However, she had never come across such a ledger for Ms. Jones. She further testified that she simply did not know whether Ms. Jones and Teel\u2019s may have had some type of agreement under which she could use her personal credit card for business expenses and then be reimbursed.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">The court sustained Ms. Jones\u2019s objection as to the inclusion in the loss calculation of the $35,018.86 paid to Blue Cross Blue Shield in the amount of loss, but largely overruled her more general objection that the government had failed to prove the remaining amount of loss. Specifically, the court found that \u201cthere is certainly a flavor of wrongdoing around these [Blue Cross Blue Shield] insurance payments, but on the whole I find that the government has not shown by a preponderance of the evidence that this $35,000 figure was embezzled and so that is my ruling on [Ms. Jones\u2019s objection to the inclusion of that amount in the loss calculation]. It will be sustained.\u201d R., Vol. II, at 113-14. The court further found that \u201c[t]he defendant also has shown that personal credit cards were used to pay for another $185.26\u201d and accordingly reduced the amount of loss by that figure. <em>Id. </em>at 114. Subtracting the $35,018.86 and $185.26 from the $517,464.91 PSR figure, the court concluded that the amount of loss was $482,260.79. The court went on to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuK\">I note that the defendant, if in fact she had incurred substantial charges that were charged to her personal credit card for the benefit of the business and was not reimbursed for them, that she would have had every incentive to bring that proof forward, to itemize it and to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>it, and she has not done so. And so I am not persuaded by her argument that there is any reduction that is warranted below that $482,000 figure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Because the court found that the amount of loss was over $400,000, Ms. Jones\u2019s offense level was increased by fourteen under \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(H) of the 2014 version of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d or \u201cGuidelines\u201d). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(H) (providing for a fourteen-level increase when the amount of loss is over $400,000 but below $1,000,000). Given a base offense level of six and a reduction of three in connection with Ms. Jones\u2019s acceptance of responsibility, the court found the total adjusted offense level to be seventeen. In light of Ms. Jones\u2019s criminal history category of I, the corresponding advisory Guidelines range was twenty-four to thirty months; the court imposed a twenty-seven-month sentence. Additionally, the court ordered Ms. Jones to pay restitution equal to the amount of loss\u2014 that is, $482,260.79.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">The facts surrounding the time period during which Ms. Jones committed the offense are also relevant to the present appeal. As noted above, the criminal information states that Ms. Jones embezzled funds from Teel\u2019s \u201c[cjommencing as early as 2008 and continuing through 2013,\u201d and that her conduct \u201c[fjrom on or about 2008 through 2013\u201d constituted a violation of the statute. R. Vol. I, at 8-9. During the plea hearing, when asked to summarize the evidence that the government would have presented if the case had gone to trial, the prosecutor repeated this same language. <em>See </em>R., Vol. II, at 35-36 (stating that the criminal conduct took place \u201c[Commencing as early as 2008 and continuing through 2013\u201d and that \u201c[therefore, the evidence would have shown that between 2008 and 2013 [Ms. Jones violated the statute].\u201d). Furthermore, when the district court reviewed the charge in detail with Ms. Jones at the plea hearing, the court asked: \u201cMs. Jones, the government has said that beginning as early as 2008 and continuing through 2013 you embezzled in excess of $5,000 from Teel\u2019s. Did you do that?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 38. Ms. Jones replied that she had.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-10\">However, in calculating the loss amount, the PSR listed starting dates falling in 2007 in describing certain sets of alleged embezzlements. R., Vol. Ill, at 11-13 (noting that the total amount embezzled was $517,464.91 and that Ms. Jones \u201ccommitted the offense from August 2007 until November 2013\u201d). In particular, the PSR listed starting dates beginning in 2007 in describing the following five sets of embez-zlements (the numbers listed here correspond to the paragraph numbers in the PSR):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-11\">13. From August 2007 to February 2013, Crystal Jones wrote unauthorized checks from the accounts of Teel\u2019s Trucks at the Commerce Bank and the Bank of Hays. The checks were written for the personal benefit of Jones and/or her husband, John Jones. The total amount of unauthorized checks written by Jones was approximately $36,351.68.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayx\">14. From September 2007 to August 2013, Crystal Jones wrote unauthorized checks from the accounts of Teel\u2019s Trucks at the Commerce Bank and the Bank of Hays. The checks were written to make payments on Jones\u2019s HSBC/Discover credit card. The total amount of unauthorized checks written by Jones to HSBC/Discover account was approximately $28,705.68.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACd\">15. From September 2007 to September 2013, Crystal Jones wrote unauthorized checks from Teel\u2019s Trucks accounts at the Commerce Bank and the Bank of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>Hays to make payments for personal expenditures on her Washington Mutual/Chase credit card account. The total amount of unauthorized payments was approximately $157,814.91....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-4\">17. From approximately December 1, 2007 to October 1, 2013, Crystal Jones wrote unauthorized checks from the bank accounts of Teel\u2019s Trucks at the Commerce Bank and the Bank of Hays for her own personal benefit in an amount totaling approximately $16,878.16. The checks were used by Jones for personal miscellaneous expenses ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-5\">20. From September 2007 to October 2013, Crystal Jones wrote unauthorized checks from accounts of Teel\u2019s Trucks at the Commerce Bank and\u2019the Bank of Hays. The checks were written to make payments on Jones\u2019 Capital One credit card. The total amount of unauthorized checks written by Jones to her Capital One account was approximately $140,341.45.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">R., Vol. Ill, at 11-12. Because the amount listed for each set was included in the total of $517,464.91 on which the district court relied (as noted above, the court subtracted $35,018.86 and $185.26 from $517,464.91 to arrive at $482,260.79), Ms. Jones alleges that the district court must have improperly included <em>some </em>amounts related to 2007 embezzlements in its total loss (as well as restitution) figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">Ms. Jones argues that (1) \u201c[t]he district court used the wrong standard in determining the loss amount, putting the burden on Ms. Jones to show how it should be reduced,\u201d Aplt.\u2019s Opening Br. at 18, and (2) the court \u201cplainly erred in including in the restitution award amounts from conduct that occurred before the time specified in the information and to which Ms. Jones pleaded guilty,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 24. As explained below, under the particular circumstances of this case, we conclude that Ms. Jones cannot prevail on either argument. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b678-11\">Ms. Jones first argues that the district court erred in finding that the amount of loss\u2014for both sentencing and restitution purposes\u2014-was $482,260.79. Specifically, she contends, the court \u201cwrongly put the burden of proof on Ms. Jones with respect to the loss that it found.\u201d Aplt\u2019s Opening Br. at 20. Although, in her view, the district court properly found that the Blue Cross Blue Shield payments (amounting to about $35,000) should be excluded from the amount of loss calculation, it improperly required Ms. Jones to prove that the remaining contested amounts should <em>not </em>be included rather than requiring the government to prove that they should be included. <em>See United States v. Griffith, </em>584 F.3d 1004, 1011 (10th Cir. 2009) (\u201cThe Government bears the burden of proving loss by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d). In support, she points to the following language from the district court\u2019s discussion at the sentencing hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-12\">I note that the defendant, if in fact she had incurred substantial charges that were charged to her personal credit card for the benefit of the business and was not reimbursed for them, that she would have had every incentive to bring that proof forward, to itemize it and to show it, and she has not done so. And so I am not persuaded by her argument that there is any reduction that is warranted below that $482,000 figure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-13\">R., Vol. II, at 115. Ms. Jones argues that the court placed the burden on her \u201cto chip away at the claimed loss by showing amounts to be authorized, father than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>holding the prosecution to the burden of proving that loss in the first instance by showing the full sum to be unauthorized.\u201d Aplt\u2019s Opening Br. at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">Ordinarily, we would review Ms. Jones\u2019s contention that the district court erred in shifting the burden of proof to her regarding the loss amount\u2014which would be a species of legal error\u2014de novo. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Salazar-Samaniega, </em>361 F.3d 1271, 1278 (10th Cir. 2004) (noting that \u201cthe sentencing court\u2019s ... legal conclusions [are reviewed] <em>de novo\u201d); accord United States v. Isiwele, </em>635 F.3d 196, 202 (5th Cir. 2011) (\u201cWe review de novo the district court\u2019s method of determining loss.... \u201d). However, we agree with the government that Ms. Jones did not make such a burden-shifting objection before the district court and that, accordingly, we review only for plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">Specifically, Ms. Jones did not at any point object to the court\u2019s alleged burden shifting, despite having an opportunity to do so. <em>See </em>R., Vol. II, at 131 (court asking counsel, after announcing its ruling for each side, whether \u201cthere\u2019s something else from you,\u201d and Ms. Jones\u2019s counsel replying, \u201cNo, Your Honor.\u201d). In such circumstances, we review only for plain error. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Crim. P. 51(b); <em>United States v. Mendoza, </em>543 F.3d 1186, 1191 (10th Cir. 2008) (applying plain-error review where \u201c[b]efore ending the [sentencing] hearing ... the court specifically asked counsel for further comments or objections. \u2018Nothing\u2019 was the response.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Espinoza, </em>67 Fed.Appx. 555, 561 (10th Cir. 2003) (\u201cEspinoza ... did not object to the burden of proof employed by the district court at sentencing.... Consequently, we only review this issue [of whether the preponderance-of-the-evidence or clear-and-convincing-evidenee standard was appropriate] for plain error.\u201d); <em>United States v. Leachman, </em>309 F.3d 377, 386 (6th Cir. 2002) (\u201cLeachman claims the burden of proof was unconstitutionally shifted to him during the sentencing hearing. Leach-man failed to object on this point at the trial level. Hence, as with all objections not raised at trial, we review for plain error only.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">In an attempt to escape plain-error review, Ms. Jones argues that a party is not required to object to a legal error in a district court\u2019s sentencing explanation. She principally relies on our reasoning in <em>United States v. Maldonado-Campos, </em>920 F.2d 714 (10th Cir. 1990). There, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-10\">When <em>adjustments </em>under the guidelines are involved, a trial court is in no way required to make detailed findings, or explain why a particular adjustment is or is not appropriate. However, when it is apparent from the court\u2019s optional discussion that its factual finding may be based upon an incorrect legal standard, we must remand for reconsideration in light of the correct legal standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Avb\"><em>Id. </em>at 718. Ms. Jones observes that in <em>Maldonado-Campos </em>we did not hold that the defendant, in order to preserve a legal objection to what the district court stated in its \u201coptional discussion,\u201d had to contemporaneously make that objection before the district court. Furthermore, Ms. Jones continues, \u201cthere likewise has been no suggestion in the cases that have invoked the [.Maldonado-Campos] test that such an objection or request was made or was needed.\u201d Apli\u2019s Reply Br. at 2. In this regard, she cites to <em>United States v. Gallegos, </em>610 Fed.Appx. 786, 787 (10th Cir. 2015); <em>United States v. Herriman, </em>739 F.3d 1250, 1254 (10th Cir. 2014); and <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Padilla, </em>439 Fed.Appx. 754, 756 (10th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>But the question of preservation was not at issue in any of those cases. Specifically, we see no indication that, like here, the government challenged defendants\u2019 failure to preserve their legal objections or that defendants\u2019 lack of preservation of sentencing objections was otherwise brought to the courts\u2019 attention. Therefore, we are unwilling to infer that <em>Maldonado-Compos </em>or any of the other cited decisions ruled on the preservation issue that confronts us here, much less ruled in the defendants\u2019 favor, which would have effectively determined that a defendant has no obligation to contemporaneously object to legal errors in a district court\u2019s explanation of the basis for its Guidelines adjustment. <em>See United States v. Romero, </em>491 F.3d 1173, 1177 (10th Cir. 2007) (\u201cQuestions which merely lurk in the record, neither brought to the attention of the court nor ruled upon, are not to be considered as having been so decided as to constitute precedents.\u201d (quoting <em>United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Union, Local 1564 v. Albertson\u2019s, Inc., </em>207 F.3d 1193, 1199 (10th Cir. 2000))); <em>accord United States v. Taylor, </em>514 F.3d 1092, 1099 (10th Cir. 2008); <em>see also New York v.

United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (concluding that \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range\u201d was a \u201csignificant procedural error\u201d), <em>with United States v. Smart, </em>518 F.3d 800, 803 (10th Cir. 2008) (noting that \u201ca substantive component\u201d of the requisite reasonableness review of sentences \u201crelates to the length of the resulting sentence\u201d). Accordingly, we review Ms. Jones\u2019s burden-shifting objection only for plain error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">Under the stringent plain-error standard, Ms. Jones must establish: \u201c(1) an error, (2) that is plain, which means clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>or obvious under current law, and (3) that affects substantial rights. If [s]he satisfies these criteria, [we] may exercise discretion to correct the error if (4) it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Rosales-Miranda, </em>755 F.3d 1253, 1258 (10th Cir. 2014) (quoting <em>United States v. McGehee, </em>672 F.3d 860, 866 (10th Cir. 2012)). This she cannot do. Specifically, Ms. Jones\u2019s arguments fail to persuade us that the district court committed any error at all, much less clear or obvious error. Therefore, we conclude that her burden-shifting contention cannot satisfy even the first prong of the plain-error standard and, thus, cannot succeed.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">At the outset, we underscore that Ms. Jones\u2019s burden under the first prong is to show on the existing record that the district court erred; speculation or conjecture will not do. <em>See Sykes v. United States, </em>373 F.2d 607, 612-13 (5th Cir. 1966) (\u201cSpeculation wastes time and bears ephemeral fruit.... The burden of showing that the error was committed, and is not mere speculation, [under a plain-error standard] is on the appellant.\u201d). Yet, Ms. Jones\u2019s offering does not carry this burden. Her argument\u2014that the district court improperly shifted the burden of proof to her by requiring her to prove that particular dollar amounts should <em>not </em>be included in the amount of loss, rather than requiring the government to prove that they should be included\u2014seems to mischarac-terize the court\u2019s analysis. The comments that Ms. Jones identifies are reasonably interpreted as evincing nothing more than the court\u2019s efforts to summarize the evidence before it. Indeed, in ruling on Ms. Jones\u2019s objections to the amount of loss, the court clearly displayed its understanding that the proof burden rested on the government\u2019s shoulders. For example, the court began by addressing the Blue Cross Blue Shield payments and found that the government had \u201cnot shown by a preponderance of the evidence\u201d that those payments were unauthorized. R., Vol. II, at 114. The court only then went on to find that it was \u201cnot persuaded\u201d by Ms. Jones\u2019s argument that any further reduction in the loss amount was warranted. <em>Id. </em>at 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">The court\u2019s full discussion on the record seems to reflect its clear understanding that the government was required to prove the entire amount of loss by a preponderance of the evidence. Indeed, the government presented testimony from Ms. Snell-ing to establish this loss amount. And Ms. Jones fails to persuade us that her interpretation of the district court\u2019s comments is more likely correct. <em>Cf. United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1300 (11th Cir. 2005) (\u201cWhere errors could have cut either way and uncertainty exists, the burden is the decisive factor in ... the plain error test, and the burden is on the defendant.\u201d). In this regard, as we read the record, the court\u2019s specific comment that Ms. Jones would have had \u201cevery incentive to bring [proof that the purchases were authorized] forward,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 115, 96 S.Ct. 2868, simply reflects the court\u2019s awareness that Ms. Jones was free to present evidence at the sentencing hearing in support of her substantive loss-amount objection, <em>see </em>Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(i)(2) (\u201cThe court may permit the parties to introduce evidence on the objections.\u201d); it does not indicate that the court had abandoned its previously expressed understanding of the proper allocation of the burden of proof to the government, Thus, we conclude that Ms. Jones has not demonstrated that the district court erred at all\u2014i.e., the first requirement of the plain-error standard\u2014 with respect to her burden-shifting argument. Therefore, we reject this challenge to the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Ms. Jones next argues that the district court erred by including in its restitution calculation amounts that Ms. Jones allegedly embezzled outside the time period specified in the criminal information and in her plea. The information charged her with embezzling from Teel\u2019s \u201c[cjommencing as early as 2008,\u201d R. Vol. I, at 8; <em>see also id. </em>at 9 (noting the relevant conduct began \u201con or about 2008\u201d), and, at the plea hearing, she admitted that she had embezzled from Teel\u2019s \u201cas early as 2008,\u201d R., Vol. II, at 38. However, as Ms. Jones points out, in calculating the loss amount on which the restitution was based, the district court relied on the PSR, which lists dates in 2007 as the starting period of five sets of her alleged embezzlements. She reasons that the district court necessarily included <em>some </em>embezzlement amounts in its restitution order that are not causally connected to the time frame of her offense of conviction. Ms. Jones acknowledges that she makes this argument for the first time on appeal, but contends that reversal is appropriate because the court clearly or obviously erred under the MVRA. <em>See United States v. Alisuretove, </em>788 F.3d 1247, 1258 (10th Cir. 2015) (noting that the MVRA\u2019s limitation on permissible restitution \u201cnecessarily includes the temporal limits of the offense as outlined in the indictment\u201d); <em>United States v. Gordon, </em>480 F.3d 1205, 1211 (10th Cir. 2007) (\u201cThe MVRA ... did not change the general rale that restitution may only be ordered for losses caused by the offense of conviction.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. James, </em>564 F.3d 1237, 1248 (10th Cir. 2009) (noting regarding a restitution challenge that \u201cplain error review on appeal now requires [the defendant] to show a clear or obvious error affecting his substantial rights that seriously affected the integrity of the judicial proceedings\u201d). However, for the reasons explicated <em>infra, </em>we ultimately reject Ms. Jones\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Because Ms. Jones raised her restitution argument for the first time on appeal, we review only for plain error. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Zhou, </em>717 F.3d 1139, 1152 (10th Cir. 2013) (\u201cMr. Zhou\u2019s final argument is that the district court erred in ordering him to pay $417,396.39 in restitution .,. under the [MVRA].... Where the defendant failed to object [to a restitution award], ... we review only for plain error.\u201d). Again, this \u201cdemanding standard,\u201d requires Ms. Jones to \u201cdemonstrate (1) an error, (2) that is plain, which means clear or obvious under current law, and (3) that affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Rosales-Miranda, </em>755 F.3d at 1258 (quoting <em>McGehee, </em>672 F.3d at 876). If she does so, we may (4) \u201cexercise discretion to correct the error if ... it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We conclude that Ms. Jones cannot satisfy this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">Ms. Jones\u2019s attack on the restitution award fails at the outset. Specifically, Ms. Jones\u2019s contention of error is not cognizable on plain-error review because it turns on an unresolved factual issue\u2014that is, whether the district court actually included any money associated with 2007 embezzlements in its restitution calculation. <em>See United States v. Wright, </em>848 F.3d 1274, 1285, No. 15-5090, 2017 WL 677485, at *8 (10th Cir. filed Feb. 21, 2017) (\u201cOn appeal, despite his silence in the district court, Wright contends that the district court erred by failing to reduce the amount of loss and restitution by the amount recovered after the Bank foreclosed on the property. But under the plain error standard, Wright waived this challenge by failing to dispute this fact at sentencing.\u201d); Zhou, 717 F.3d at 1154 (\u201cTo the extent [the defendant] is attempting to raise unpreserved factual errors, we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>held under the plain error standard- that failure to assert a factual dispute at sentencing waives the challenge because it prevented the probation officer from reviewing and the district court from resolving the fact issue.\u201d)- In this regard, Ms. Jones relies solely on inferences from the PSR\u2019s language, which lists dates in 2007 as the starting period of five sets of her alleged embezzlements, to establish that <em>\u201csome </em>amount for each period was improperly included in the [restitution] award.\u201d Aplt.\u2019s Reply Br. at 7; <em>see also </em>Aplt.\u2019s Opening Br. at 26 (inferring from \u201cthe wording of the [PSR] \u201d that there is \u201cno doubt that losses for conduct from identified starting dates [were]' included\u201d); Aplt.\u2019s Reply Br. at 7 (noting that \u201cthe [2007] starting points [of the PSR] necessarily have meaning\u201d). But she never points to statements by the district court specifically indicating that it included any amounts based ion any 2007 embezzlements in the restitution order, nor does she identify any other evidence reflecting such inclusion (e.g., one or more cancelled checks in the record evincing 2007 dates related to her Teel\u2019s embezzlement that the PSR drafter relied on).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Without more, Ms. Jones\u2019s argument is simply speculation. She insists that \u201c[t]here is no other plausible way to read the [PSR],\u201d Aplt.\u2019s Reply Br. at 6; \u201cthe starting and ending dates used were meant to mark the point at which the first taking of funds within each set, and the last taking of funds within each set, was done,\u201d Aplt.\u2019s Opening Br. at 26. But this inference is not predicated on any evidence\u2014evidence which, judging from her appellate briefing, Ms. Jones cannot produce. <em>Cf. </em>Aplt.\u2019s Reply Br. at 6 (noting that \u201cit is impossible to say how many checks were included from 2007, or how much they totaled\u201d); <em>see also </em>Aplt.\u2019s Opening Br. at 31 (\u201c[T]here is no way to say how many checks were wrongly included in the restitution award.... It could have been [increased] by a small sum, or it could have been [increased] by a large one.\u201d). Accordingly, we conclude that Ms. Jones\u2019s restitution argument\u2014which turns, on the resolution of an unresolved factual issue\u2014is not cognizable under plain-error review. Consequently, we uphold the district court\u2019s restitution order. <em>See United States v. Royal, </em>100 F.3d 1019, 1033 (1st Cir. 1996) (\u201c[U]pon a review of the sentencing hearing transcript, it indeed appears unclear whether the sentencing court took into account acts that occurred prior to Royal\u2019s involvement. But the record also indicates that Royal waived this objection in the district court, and any hypothetical error in the calculation of loss does not rise to the level of plain error.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s sentencing order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b674-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.

Insisting that she had not forfeited her burden-shifting argument, Ms. Jones (tacitly) declined to contend in the alternative that she had satisfied the requirements of the plain-error standard. Consequently, \u201cwe could permissibly decline to consider the [burden-shifting] argument altogether,\u201d effectively treating the argument as waived. <em>Abernathy v.

However, it is fully within our discretion to consider issues that have not been properly preserved for appel late review. <em>See Exxon Shipping Co. v.
