McHugh, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b810-23\">On February 22, 2017, we issued an <em>Order Denying in Part and Granting in Part Certificate of Appealability, </em>in which we granted a certificate of appealability as to \u201c[w]hether, <em>post-Johnson [v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015) ], Mr. Tucker\u2019s conviction under Oklahoma law for discharge of a firearm into a dwelling constitutes a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a).\u201d That same day, we issued an order appointing counsel to represent Mr. Tucker, and setting a supplemental briefing schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-26\">On March 6, 2017, the Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>Beckles v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 137 S.Ct. 886, 197 L.Ed.2d 145, 2017 WL 855781 (March 6, 2017). In light of that opinion, we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>determined that the aforementioned certificate of appealability was improvidently granted. Accordingly, we RESCIND the certificate of appealability issued on February 22, 2017, and DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b810-31\">This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
