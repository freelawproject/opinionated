McHugh Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">De\u2019Shaughn Jahmall Mays appeals the district court\u2019s imposition of a 54-month sentence after he pled guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Mr. Mays argues his sentence, which falls above the applicable U.S. Sentencing Guidelines range of 30 to 37 months, is substantively unreasonable. Exercising jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-12\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b699-13\">On October 5, 2015, Mr. Mays was stopped by police for driving a stolen vehicle. During a search of the vehicle, the police found a loaded handgun, which also was stolen. In light of Mr. Mays\u2019s prior felony convictions, the United States government charged him with one count of unlawful possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Mr. Mays pled guilty to the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-16\">After the plea, a probation officer prepared a presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) for Mr. Mays. The PSR assigned Mr. Mays a total offense level of 19 and a criminal history category of V, which together yielded a U.S. Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d) range of 57 to 71 months\u2019 imprisonment. Mr. Mays .objected to the PSR, arguing for reasons not relevant here that his offense level should be 13. He also moved for a variant sentence, asking that the district court sentence him to 36 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-17\">At the sentencing hearing, the district court sustained Mr. Mays\u2019s objection and recalculated his total offense level as 13. Combining that figure with Mr. Mays\u2019s criminal history category of V, the district court arrived at a new Guidelines range of 30 to 37 months. The court then heard from the government, which argued for a 66-month sentence; from defense counsel, who argued for the same 36-month sentence already requested in the variance motion; and from Mr. Mays, who spoke on his own behalf in mitigation. After a lengthy discussion of its reasoning with respect to the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, the district court determined that an upward variance was appropriate and sentenced Mr. Mays to 54 months in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>prison and three years of supervised release. Mr. Mays now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Mr. Mays\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that his 54-month sentence is substantively unreasonable. Specifically, Mr. Mays claims the district court \u201cunreasonably weighed the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)\u201d by overemphasizing his adolescent behavior and dated convictions while undervaluing his life improvements and mental-health issues. Thus, according to Mr. Mays, the district court abused its discretion in imposing a 54-month sentence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">We review sentences for substantive reasonableness under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Gordon, </em>710 F.3d 1124, 1160 (10th Cir. 2013). \u201cIn considering whether a defendant\u2019s sentence is substantively reasonable, we examine whether the length of the sentence is reasonable given all the circumstances of the case in light of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Chavez, </em>723 F.3d 1226, 1233 (10th Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). A district court may impose a sentence outside the applicable Guidelines range \u201cso long as it does not do so arbitrarily and capriciously.\u201d <em>United States v. Worku, </em>800 F.3d 1195, 1208 (10th Cir. 2015). In reviewing an above-Guidelines sentence, \u201cwe \u2018may consider the extent of the deviation, but must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1207 (alteration omitted) (quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). That we \u201cmight reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal .of the district court.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Ultimately, we will reverse a sentence as substantively unreasonable only \u201cif, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it \u2018exceeds the bounds of permissible choice, given the facts and the applicable law.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Lucero, </em>747 F.3d 1242, 1250-51 (10th Cir. 2014) (quoting <em>Chavez, </em>723 F.3d at 1233).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">Here, we conclude the district court acted within its discretion in varying upward from the 30- to 37-month Guidelines range and imposing a 54-month sentence. The relevant \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors include \u201c(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant\u201d; and \u201c(2) the need for the sentence imposed ... to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, ... to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct[,] ... [and] to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1)-(2). Contrary to Mr. Mays\u2019s assertion, the district court\u2019s balancing of these factors was not \u201cmanifestly unreasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">Mr. Mays first argues the district court abused its discretion in concluding that he is a dangerous person \u201cbased only on [his] conduct from ten or more years [ago]\u201d and that this dangerousness outweighed all countervailing considerations and justified the sentence imposed. But the record belies this characterization of the district court\u2019s reasoning. For one, the district court did not conclude Mr. Mays is dangerous \u201cbased only on [his] life up to 2006.\u201d While it is true that the district court found Mr. Mays\u2019s 2006 burglary conviction to be \u201cparticularly egregious,\u201d and considered his 2006 robbery conviction and juvenile history, the court also considered Mr. Mays\u2019s recent statements about having homicidal \u201cfantasies\u201d or \u201cthoughts\u201d regarding a \u201clove rival\u201d, his \u201cdiscipline[ ] for assaults\u201d in prison, and indicia of his continued gang affiliation. The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>made clear that it was focusing on \u201ca pattern [of behavior] that extends across [Mr. Mays\u2019s] life.\u201d <em>Cf. United States v. Naramor, </em>726 F.3d 1160, 1172 (10th Cir. 2013) (affirming upward-variant sentence of statutory maximum and finding reasonable the district court\u2019s determination that defendant was dangerous based in part on his violent history, where defendant\u2019s criminal history consisted of a single assault conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">But more importantly, dangerousness was not the only aggravating factor the district court considered. Mr. Mays was caught with a stolen gun while driving a stolen car. He also had a more recent, 2012 felony conviction for forgery. Critically, too, he was recorded making jailhouse phone calls to his then-girlfriend in which he asked her \u201cto find his younger brother or one of his friends, possibly a juvenile, to come to court to take responsibility for the gun ... [and] to say that [Mr, Mays] did not know that the gun was in the car.\u201d This attempted scheme came to fruition when, during one of Mr. Mays\u2019s hearings, \u201ca woman identifying herself as [his] wife came to court ... and told ... [a] District Attorney that the gun did not belong to [Mr, Mays] and instead belonged to a male who had entered the courtroom with her.\u201d The district court reasonably found this conduct to be \u201ca particularly egregious 3553(a) factor\u201d because \u201cit speak[s] in the direction of obstructive conduct\u201d and shows Mr. Mays does not \u201crespect the law.\u201d As the district court observed, \u201c[t]o have somebody else obtain a conviction\u201d is inconsistent with Mr. Mays\u2019s professed goal of being \u201con a law-abiding path.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">We also disagree with the notion that the district court undervalued Mr. Mays\u2019s efforts to turn his life around and his history of mental-health issues. As the district court recognized, \u201cthe period of time in which we\u2019re talking about [Mr. Mays], quote/unquote, <em>doing well, </em>is like three months.\u201d But the \u201creality,\u201d as the court put it, is that \u201cfor eight of the last ten years [Mr. Mays] has been in some form of custody or another,\u201d largely because of repeated parole violations and his \u201cgetting arrested over and over again.\u201d All in all, \u201c[t]here is simply a long-standing, never-ending series of problems with the law.\u201d Moreover, the district court found that Mr. Mays\u2019s sympathetic explanations for his current crime and his claims of having turned his life around were undermined by his credibility issues, an assessment with which his psychiatrist agreed. <em>Cf. Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586 (explaining that a district court\u2019s superior ability to \u201cmake[ ] credibility determinations\u201d is one of the reasons appellate courts should accord deference to a district court\u2019s treatment of \u00a7 3553(a) factors). And the district court did accept Mr. Mays\u2019s mental-health issues as a mitigating factor; it simply found that the aggravating considerations warranted an upward departure from the Guidelines range nonetheless.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">\u201cOur role is not to second guess the district court\u2019s treatment of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Vasquez-Alcarez, </em>647 F.3d 973, 978 (10th Cir. 2011). The record here is replete with examples of the district court carefully balancing those factors with many different facets of Mr. Mays\u2019s history and thoughtfully considering its need to achieve the purposes of sentencing. In the end, \u201cwe are not persuaded that the district court\u2019s judgment fell outside the range of rationally permissible choices before it.\u201d <em>United States v. Chavez-Suarez, </em>597 F.3d 1137, 1139 (10th Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). We find neither error nor abuse of discretion in the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">The district court did not unreasonably balance the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>otherwise abuse its discretion in sentencing Mr. Mays to 54 months in prison. We therefore AFFIRM the sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b699-14\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
