We deny a COA and dismiss this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">Mr. Melot was convicted in 2011 of multiple tax-related offenses and making false statements to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7201, 7203 and 7212(a), and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 714m(a). We affirmed his convictions on appeal but remanded for resentencing. <em>See United States v. Melot, </em>732 F.3d 1234, 1245 (10th Cir. 2013). On remand, Mr. Melot was sentenced to 14 years\u2019 imprisonment and ordered to pay restitution to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the amount of $18,469,998.51 and to the USDA in the amount of $226,526. In 2014, he unsuccessfully moved to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-13\">. In October 2016, Mr. Melot filed a document entitled \u201cMotion for Amended Judgment and Sentence/New Trial, Correction of Restitution,\u201d in which he complained that the restitution order in his case disproportionate to other restitution orders in the District of New Mexico. The district court clerk docketed the motion as one under \u00a7 2255. Because it was an unauthorized, successive \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court dismissed it for lack of jurisdiction. Mr. Melot now seeks to appeal, contending that his motion was actually brought under Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 33 and 36, not \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-14\">To appeal, Mr. Melot must obtain a COA. <em>See United States v. Harper, </em>545 F.3d 1230, 1233 (10th Cir. 2008). Where, as here, a district court has dismissed a filing on procedural grounds, for a COA the movant must show both \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). We need not consider the merits aspect of the <em>Slack </em>test because Mr. Melot has not satisfied the procedural aspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-15\">No reasonable jurist could debate the district court\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Melot\u2019s filing, ostensibly under Rules 33 and 36, was in reality a \u00a7 2255 motion. \u201cThe exclusive remedy for testing the validity of a judgment and sentence, unless it is inadequate or ineffective, is that provided for in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Caravalho v. Pugh, </em>177 F.3d 1177, 1178 (10th Cir. 1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cIt is the relief sought, not his pleading\u2019s title, that determines whether the pleading is a \u00a7 2255 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>motion.\u201d <em>United States v. Nelson, </em>465 F.3d 1145, 1149 (10th Cir. 2006). Mr. Melot sought to attack the validity of his judgment by asserting that the restitution he owes was incorrectly calculated therein. Therefore, his motion was, in essence, a \u00a7 2255 motion, especially given that any claim under Rule 33 would be untimely. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Crim. P. 33(b)(1) (providing a motion for new trial must be filed within three years of the finding of guilt); Opening Br. at 2 (noting Mr. Melot was found guilty in April 2010). The district court did not err in treating the motion as one under \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Mr. Melot previously sought relief under \u00a7 2255, making this motion an unauthorized successive \u00a7 2255 motion. \u201c[I]f the prisoner\u2019s pleading must be treated as a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court does not even have jurisdiction to deny the relief sought in the pleading.\u201d <em>Nelson, </em>465 F.3d at 1148. Even reviewing Mr. Melot\u2019s application with the liberality due pro se litigants, <em>see Garza v. Davis, </em>596 F.3d 1198, 1201 n.2 (10th Cir. 2010), there is nothing debatable about the district court\u2019s procedural decision to dismiss the filing for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">The motion for leave to proceed on appeal without prepayment of costs or fees is granted. But only prepayment of fees is waived, not the fees themselves. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(1). We deny a COA and dismiss this matter.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b813-10\"> This order is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
