Phillips, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">A petitioner seeking habeas corpus relief on grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel faces formidable obstacles. He must show both (1) that his counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) that the deficient performance prejudiced him. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). To satisfy the prejudice prong, the petitioner must show \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">Thomas James Zajac claims that his counsel\u2019s deficient performance at his jury trial meets this standard. But the government presented overwhelming evidence supporting Zajac\u2019s conviction for the 2006 bombing of the Salt Lake City Library. Like most trials, Zajac\u2019s trial was imperfect, but the government presented strong evidence from multiple, independent sources that supported the jury\u2019s guilty verdict. In the face of this evidence, Zajac cannot demonstrate a reasonable probability that, absent the alleged deficient performance, his trial\u2019s outcome would have changed. Thus, we deny his request for habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">On September 15, 2016, a homemade pipe-bomb inside an Arb/s paper bag exploded on the third floor of the Salt Lake City Public Library. The explosion shattered a window and required people to evacuate the building, but, by luck, no one was injured or killed. Investigators soon found evidence pointing to Zajac as the bomber.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">I. Materials at the bombing scene linked Zajac to the bombing.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-12\">At the bombing scene, investigators found a torn piece of card-stock packaging from a model-rocket engine made by the Estes Company. A price sticker on the packaging showed that the rocket engine had been purchased at a Hobby Lobby store, and the last digit of the three-digit store number (the only one legible) was \u201c4,\u201d which was consistent with many Hobby Lobby stores, including \u201c204,\u201d the number of a store in Westmont, Illinois.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That store is a five-to-ten-minute drive from the apartment Zajac rented. In 2006, Utah had no Hobby Lobby stores.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-13\">In the bomb remnants, law-enforcement officers also recovered smokeless gunpowder, which visually matched a type of gunpowder called Alliant Blue Dot. Other remnants included stranded-metal wire with solder on it, a white adhesive, and alligator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"?\">*?</page-number>clips. Later, when police searched Zajac\u2019s apartment, they found similar materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-3\">II.A threatening letter about the bombing was postmarked from Omaha, Nebraska just after Zajac had visited the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">A month after the bombing, the chief of the Salt Lake City Police Department received a letter, postmarked.from Omaha, Nebraska.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The letter referenced the Salt Lake City bomb, used profanities against the police, blamed police for alleged abuses, and threatened more violence: \u201cI fired a shot over your bow as a punishment.... When you fucked with mine, you picked the wrong person. ... Had it been me, I would have shot your officers dead. And that is still on the table, picture it, coffee shop, back of head shot.\u201d R. vol. 24 at 68. The letter also threatened a future, larger bomb that would be \u201cdesigned to kill\u201d and \u201cplaced in a public place again, but in a crowd this time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf at least one person isn\u2019t killed, I will simply go again,\u201d the letter warned. <em>Id. </em>Zajac\u2019s adult daughter, Allison Zajac, testified at trial that he had visited her in Omaha, Nebraska the weekend before the Monday that the threatening letter was postmarked and on its way to the Salt Lake City Police Chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">III. The search of Zajac\u2019s apartment revealed materials linking him to the Utah bombing.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">Law-enforcement officers recovered a fingerprint from card stock among the bomb remnants. Using a national law-enforcement database, investigators found a match for the fingerprint on the card-stock packaging: Thomas Zajac. After obtaining warrants, ATF agents arrested Zajac and searched his Illinois apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">During the search of the apartment, agents seized physical evidence linking Za-jac to the Utah bombing. For instance, inside a vacuum cleaner in a storage locker in Zajac\u2019s basement, agents found smokeless gunpowder visually consistent with the Alliant Blue Dot powder used in the library bomb.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They also seized a container of silicone sealant containing adhesive visually and chemically consistent with that found in the bomb remnants, as well as pliers with that adhesive in the teeth; alligator clips similar to those used in the bomb; two rolls of solder; and two soldering irons. As mentioned, they had earlier recovered a strand of wire with melted solder from the bomb remnants.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">IV. At trial, witness testimony, phone records, bills, and Zajac\u2019s history with police bolstered the government\u2019s case against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">Prosecutors charged Zajac with seven felonies stemming from the bombing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>prosecution entered a wealth of physical, phone, video, and circumstantial evidence tying Zajac to the bombing. For instance, Allison Zajac and Zajac\u2019s ex-wife, Sharon Zajac, identified Zajac on a surveillance videotape entering the library with a black briefcase and remaining for just seven minutes, less than half an hour before the bombing. In addition, Zajac\u2019s credit-card records and cell-tower hits on his phone placed him in the Chicago area on September 12, and then showed him traveling across the country until reaching Evans-ton, Wyoming on September 14. Hotel receipts from the Days Inn in Evanston, three miles from the Utah border, showed that Zajac registered to stay there on the nights of September 14 and 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Zajac\u2019s known activities on the day of the bombing were highly probative. On September 16, by 10:12 a.m., he had checked out of the Days Inn in Evanston. At 11:31 a.m., he bought gasoline in Park City, Utah, about 50 miles south of Evans-ton. This placed him about 30 miles north of Salt Lake City. As described by the government during closing argument, the videotape revealed that at 12:14 p.m., a blue-shirted man carrying a black briefcase entered the Salt Lake City library. Nine minutes later, he left the library. At 2:12 p.m., again shown by videotape, the same man, later identified by his daughter and ex-wife as Zajac, returned to the library and left after seven minutes. Fifteen minutes later, at 2:34 p.m., the bomb exploded. By 4:31 p.m., Zajac had driven back to the interstate highway and traveled the 80 or so miles back to the Evans-ton Days Inn. Once there, he registered for the night.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">The prosecution also entered evidence concerning Zajac\u2019s motive. Adam Zajac, Zajac\u2019s son, testified that in 2004, Salt Lake City police officers had cited him for driving under the influence after he received medication as part of his medical treatment and later that day got into a car accident. Adam Zajac told his father about the incident. In addition, a Hinsdale, Illinois police detective testified that in 2005, after he had arrested Adam Zajac for an outstanding traffic warrant, Zajac went to the police station to bail his son out. While there, he berated the officers with profanities, and even angrily ripped a calendar off the wall. He also struck his wife in the face when she attempted to calm him (but the district court barred the prosecution from mentioning this conduct at trial). As Zajac was being booked for this battery, he repeatedly threatened the booking officer, warning that, \u201cI know where you work.\u201d R. vol. 24 at 361. The prosecution also presented evidence that Zajac was a generally volatile person prone to angry confrontations.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">Y. The jury and the district court found Zajac\u2019s explanations unconvincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">Before his trial, in statements later recounted at his trial, Zajac admitted that he had been in the Salt Lake City library around the same day as the bombing. He told one journalist, Todd Tanner, that it was not unusual for him to pass through Salt Lake City, and that he visited Salt Lake City in September 2006 to learn more about the Church of Latter-Day Saints, which his daughter was considering joining. Zajac told another journalist, Brian Mullahy, that in September 2006 he had traveled to Salt Lake City on his way from Chicago to Phoenix. He told Mullahy that, while there, he asked Mormon missionaries for information about their Church and that they directed him to the public library.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Zajac told Tanner that he visited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>the library within a few days of the bombing, and that because he had been on a diet heavy in fruits and vegetables, he had to use the library\u2019s most easily accessible restroom, located on the library\u2019s lower level.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">As for why he suddenly abandoned his trip to Phoenix, Zajac told Mullahy that he had begun feeling ill at the library and soon after learned from a call to his sister in Chicago that his mother was ill too. For these reasons, he said, he turned around and drove back to the Chicago area to be with her. But Zajac\u2019s phone records showed no such call. Nor did Zajac explain to Mullahy why he stopped at the Evans-ton Days Inn at 4:31 p.m., several hours before nightfall, when he wanted to see his sick mother. The jury could also consider that Zajac apparently did not tell Tanner, the other journalist, about his sick mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">At trial, Zajac\u2019s counsel argued that Za-jac\u2019s son Adam was the more likely culprit, and that he had gone to elaborate lengths to frame his father. Counsel pointed to Adam Zajac\u2019s proficiency with electrical work, his past unfavorable encounters with police, and his angry split with his father that caused Adam and his wife to move out of Zajac\u2019s home. Obviously, the jury did not believe this account.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">In addition to hearing from the government\u2019s expert that Zajac\u2019s known fingerprint was consistent with that left on the card stock in the bomb remnants, the distinct court also learned during the habeas hearing that Zajac had admitted in a letter to his counsel that the fingerprint indeed was his. And he offered a story for how it got there. As he approached the library\u2019s doors, Zajac said, he saw a piece of card stock blow between the legs of a woman wearing a red skirt. He claimed that he picked up the card stock and put it in the hoodie of a homeless person walking by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">VI. On habeas review, the federal district court found a number of trial errors, but no prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-11\">After the jury convicted Zajac on all counts, the district court denied Zajac\u2019s motions for a judgment of acquittal and for a new trial and sentenced him to four hundred and twenty months in prison. On direct appeal, we affirmed the convictions. <em>United States v. Zajac, </em>482 Fed.Appx. 336 (10th Cir. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-12\">Zajac then filed a pro se 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 habeas corpus petition to vacate his convictions, alleging prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel. After a three-day hearing, the district court denied relief, while still pointing to what it called \u201ca number of troubling issues.\u201d R. vol. 5 at 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-13\">First, the district court found that the prosecution had made numerous misstatements. For instance, the district court said that during the government\u2019s opening statement, it incorrectly said that investigators had found a model-rocket engine in the Salt Lake City bomb remnants.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The district court also faulted the government for misstatements in closing argument that the fingerprint on the card stock was \u201cof Thomas Zajac\u201d and \u201ccharacteristic of one and not any other,\u201d R. vol. 26 at 105-06, rather than simply using the court-approved language of \u201cmatch closely\u201d or \u201cconsistent with the known print of,\u201d R. vol. 25 at 371; that Zajac\u2019s fingerprint was recovered on the bomb; that two witnesses had said that Zajac told them he had been in the library on the day of the bombing (instead of a day or two before that day); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>that Allison Zajac identified Zajac from khaki pants worn by the man on the video (when she apparently identified him much better than that); that Alliant Blue Dot gunpowder was found in multiple locations in Zajac\u2019s apartment;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that agents found no ammunition in Zajac\u2019s apartment when they had found some ammunition; that a pipe-bomb with a timer was unusual (both the Salt Lake City and Hinsdale bombs had timers); that the batteries found in Zajac\u2019s apartment had their identifying labels scratched off;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and that the batteries found in Zajac\u2019s apartment were the same type as those found at the bomb scene.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Finally, the district court found that during its opening and closing arguments, the government had created an improper inference that Zajac had been arrested for hostile conduct toward the police instead of domestic violence against his wife. Zajac\u2019s defense counsel did not object to these alleged misstatements.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Second, the district court noted a number of what it believed were evidence-gathering deficiencies by the government. The court was troubled that the government had not retrieved surveillance videotape from 13 of the 31 possible areas in the library. Although finding that the video footage was \u201cirretrievably lost,\u201d the court did not attribute bad faith to the government. R. vol. 5 at 198-99. The court also criticized the government for returning two briefcases and one envelope seized during the search of Zajac\u2019s apartment to his sister, whom he had authorized to collect his belongings and with whom he had stayed in contact more than he had with his daughter or ex-wife. In the district court\u2019s view, this somehow prevented the three items from being tested for exculpatory evidence. The district court also found that the government\u2019s process for dusting and lifting fingerprints from the bomb timer had precluded any DNA analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-11\">Third, the district court criticized the government for not obtaining a surveillance videotape it believed local police had obtained from a store near the UPS store in Illinois, from where they alleged Zajac had mailed his second threatening letter\u2014 this one to the Hinsdale, Illinois police department.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In the district court\u2019s view, this somehow bore on whether it should have allowed evidence of the September 1, 2006 bombing in Hinsdale under Fed. R. Evid. 404(b). The prosecution had contended that Zajac was responsible for that bomb, too, and it relied in part on the threatening letter sent to Hinsdale police\u2014a letter that had three fingerprints that were consistent with Zajac\u2019s.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Illinois bomb and letter had many striking similarities to the Salt Lake City letter and bomb. For example, the Hinsdale letter stated that, \u201cI fired a warning shot\u201d as compared to the Utah letter\u2019s mention of a \u201cshot over your bow as a punishment.\u201d R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>vol. 24 at 68, 349. The Hinsdale letter warned that, \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t kill, I will repeat as necessary,\u201d similar to the Utah letter\u2019s warning that, \u201cIf at least one person isn\u2019t killed, I will simply go again.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68, 350. The. two letters also contained similar language about how the police had been \u201chumiliated,\u201d how the police had picked on the \u201cwrong person,\u201d and how the author would continue until the police were forced to take additional, costly security measures. <em>Id. </em>at 68, 349-50. Both letters contained the same ultimatum: \u201cIt\u2019s up to you, asshole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68, 350. But the district court thought that the video could conceivably have been exculpatory (obviously, it could also have been inculpatory). In any event, the district court commented that had it known during the trial that the government had not obtained the video from local Illinois police, it would not have admitted any of the Rule 404(b) evidence related to the Illinois bombing. We see no issues with the 404(b) evidence, with or without the store video.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">Fourth, the district court questioned why Zajac\u2019s defense attorneys had not interviewed certain witnesses when determining their defense strategy. Specifically, Zajac claimed that certain witnesses may have generally identified others who were near the bomb before it exploded. The district court further faulted defense counsel for not fully coordinating their opening statement with the evidence that they thereafter presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Despite these findings, the district court denied the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims because Zajac could not show that he suffered prejudice. But the district court did grant a certificate of appealability (COA) for those claims, meaning that it found that Zajac had \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Zajac filed a motion asking the court to reconsider its \u00a7 2255 denial. The court treated it as a motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) seeking relief from a judgment or order. The court certified an additional ineffective-assistance issue for appeal (counsel\u2019s failure to interview another witness), refused to certify other issues, and transferred Zajac\u2019s new arguments and issues to us because it found them to constitute a second or successive habeas petition requiring circuit authorization. Zajac moved for a remand, arguing that the district court had erred in construing two of his claims as second or successive claims. We denied the motion for remand. Zajac now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2255 ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AgI\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">To succeed on a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show both that his lawyers provided him with deficient representation and that the deficiencies prejudiced him. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. To perform deficiently, counsel must make \u201cerrors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel\u201d that the Sixth Amendment guarantees to a defendant. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, the defendant must show that his counsel fell below an objective standard of reasonably effective assistance. <em>Id. </em>at 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052. We must be highly deferential to the performance of counsel and maintain a strong presumption that counsel has performed within \u201cthe wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052. A deficiency prejudices a defendant if the defendant can show that, but for the deficiency, there is a reasonable probability that the jury would have reached a different result. <em>Id. </em>at 694, 104 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>S.Ct. 2052. \u201cThe result of a proceeding can be rendered unreliable, and hence the proceeding itself unfair, even if the errors of counsel cannot be shown by a preponderance of the evidence to have determined the outcome.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">As a practical consideration, we need not examine both prongs if one or the other is lacking. <em>Id. </em>at 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052. In reviewing \u00a7 2255 denials after a COA has been granted, we review the district court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo and its fact findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Viera, </em>674 F.3d 1214, 1217 (10th Cir. 2012). Mere speculation cannot satisfy the ineffective-assistance prejudice standard. <em>Byrd v. Workman, </em>645 F.3d 1159, 1168-69 (10th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"AoN\">II. Zajac cannot show prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">Because we find no prejudice, we address only that prong. Even if we agreed with the district court\u2019s findings of error, the overwhelming evidence leaves us confident that the jury would have convicted Zajac of all charges. None of the government\u2019s alleged errors furnished the foundation of the government\u2019s ease. The government proved Zajac\u2019s guilt with physical evidence tying Zajac to the bomb, circumstantial and witness evidence placing him at the library soon before the bomb exploded, and evidence of his motive for exploding a bomb in Salt Lake City. We affirm the district court\u2019s finding that any errors in the trial did not create a reasonable probability of a different outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">A. The trial errors were not enough to change the inferences of the jury or the outcome of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">As outlined above, strong physical, circumstantial, and witness evidence implicated Zajac. The government\u2019s alleged mistakes and the defense\u2019s failure to object to them did not undermine that strong foundation. For example, the government did overstate the fingerprint evidence: at trial, the court allowed the government\u2019s fingerprint-matching expert to testify that it was his opinion that the fingerprint from the card-stock packaging was consistent with Zajac\u2019s, but not that it was his. During closing, the prosecutor misspoke by saying that the fingerprint was \u201cof Thomas Zajac\u201d and \u201ccharacteristic of one and not any other.\u201d R. vol. 26 at 105-06. But that error was not so significant that the fingerprint evidence lost its highly probative value\u2014the fingerprint still pointed to Za-jac.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-12\">Likewise, the government also misstated that Zajac\u2019s daughter identified him in the library video based on his khaki pants. But that did not diminish that she and her mother positively identified Zajac on much firmer grounds,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> And in another example, the prosecution overstated the locations in Zajac\u2019s apartment where agents found gunpowder that visually matched the type used in the bombing\u2014yet some such gunpowder was indeed found in the vacuum in Zajac\u2019s storage locker.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-13\">Any errors the defense made in not objecting to any misstatements in the government\u2019s closing arguments were further blunted by the court\u2019s reminder to jurors before they began their deliberations that \u201c[statements and arguments of counsel are not evidence in this case.\u201d R. vol. 26 at 67. If jurors felt that the prosecutor\u2019s statements conflicted with their memory of the evidence, the court had told them that \u201cit is your recollection which should con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>trol during your deliberations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 80. We generally presume that juries follow the instructions of the court. <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>514 F.3d 1092, 1100 (10th Cir. 2008); see <em>also United States v. Batton, </em>527 Fed.Appx. 686, 688-89 (10th Cir. 2013) (unpublished) (finding that the defense\u2019s failure to object to the government\u2019s misstatement during the closing argument did not establish prejudice given the context of the whole trial and record).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Nor are we troubled by the district court\u2019s admission of Rule 404(b) evidence concerning the bombing in Hinsdale, Illinois. Prosecutors linked Zajac to that bomb by showing that the materials used\u2014such as an Estes rocket motor\u2014had similarities to items found in Zajac\u2019s apartment and at the library, and that the threatening letter that Hinsdale police received was similar to the one that Salt Lake City police received. Multiple witnesses discussed the Illinois bombing and the threatening letter, and the government emphasized the incident during closing arguments. Whatever the district court\u2019s misgivings on review, we see no issue with admission of the Rule 404(b) evidence\u2014the jury had more than enough evidence to convict solely from the' Salt Lake City bombing.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Even if the errors did not undermine the government\u2019s case, Zajac argues that in their absence, the jurors would have considered \u201cthe prosecution team\u2019s deceit\u201d and changed their inferences about the evidence. Appellant Opening Br. at 10. The jurors, who were allegedly \u201cbasking in the prestige of the articulate Assistant United States Attorneys,\u201d might have viewed the \u201cphalanx of the federal government\u2019s impressive witnesses\u201d with less credulity. <em>Id. </em>at 11. Or perhaps the errors were so pervasive that they might have affected the trial\u2019s outcome. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 695, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (holding that courts must assess the totality of the evidence presented when considering ineffective-assistance prejudice). We are not persuaded. The bulk of the government\u2019s case was untouched by the errors, and we will not assume that successful objections by the defense would have weakened otherwise strong evidence. The evidence presented against Zajac at trial was simply too great to permit speculation to undermine the jury\u2019s verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">B. Defense counsel\u2019s trial strategy did not prejudice Zajac.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">Zajac argues that his trial counsel inadequately investigated the case before deciding on a strategy and then failed to call a number of witnesses who might have provided alternative versions of events. Counsel alluded to some of these witnesses in the opening statement. But the impact that these different strategies and witnesses may have had is highly speculative. For example, Zajac argues that the defense should have called witnesses to prove that his stepson, Kirk Lauterback, was the actual bomber. But at the habeas hearing, defense counsel testified that he could find no proof that Lauterback had the motive or ability to bomb the library or that he had even been in Salt Lake City near the time of the bombing\u2014at the time, he lived in Omaha, Nebraska.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">Zajac also argues that he was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failure to call witnesses who might have established that his son Adam set off the bomb and then framed his father because of past family disagreements. But Zajac did not call Lauterback or any of the other possible witnesses to testify at the habeas hearing, preventing us from more fully assessing what effect their testimony might have had. Nor was the discrepancy between the defense\u2019s opening statement about witnesses and the evidence actually presented enough to ere-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>ate prejudice, especially given the significant amount of time and evidence that came between the opening statement and jury deliberations. We thus doubt that the defense\u2019s decisions about these witnesses and strategies were errors, let alone prejudicial ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">C. The errors did not amount to cumulative prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">Similarly, Zajac also argues that even if the trial, errors did not directly undermine specific pieces of the government\u2019s case, their absence would have eroded the jury\u2019s general trust of the government. \u201cA cumulative-error analysis aggregates all errors found to be harmless and analyzes whether their cumulative effect on the outcome of the trial is such that collectively they can no longer be determined to be harmless.\u201d <em>Cargle v. Mullin, </em>317 F.3d 1196, 1206 (10th Cir. 2003) (quoting <em>United States v. Toles, </em>297 F.3d 959, 972 (10th Cir. 2002)) (internal quotation marks omitted). But Zajac\u2019s cumulative-error claims do not rise above the level of hope and speculation. We have no reason to believe that any juror would have been persuaded away from a guilty verdict based on a vague sense of dubious impropriety alone, especially given the ample evidence supporting the government\u2019s theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">Zajac received a fair trial and was fairly convicted. The government presented a solid case and the jurors accepted it. The trial errors did not undermine the core of that case, nor were they collectively so pervasive as to change the character of the proceeding. As <em>Strickland </em>noted: \u201ca verdict or conclusion only weakly supported by the record is more likely to have been affected by errors than one with overwhelming record support.\u201d 466 U.S. at 696, 104 S.Ct. 2052. The verdicts in Zajac\u2019s case were decidedly the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">For these reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Zajac\u2019s \u00a7 2255 habeas petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b801-14\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.
