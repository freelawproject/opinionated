Tymkovich, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">Derrick Sandoval was convicted of various drug crimes. He contends the district court made a number of errors that undermined the fairness of his trial. Because he did not object at the time, we review most of his arguments for plain error. In sum, we conclude the district court did not plainly err in (1) allowing opinion testimony from the detectives who investigated the drug ring; (2) allowing an officer to testify both as a fact and expert witness; or (3) failing to exclude testimony regarding the <em>Miranda </em>warning given to Sandoval.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">Sandoval was subject to an investigation for distribution of methamphetamine in the Denver area. Based on surveillance and a recorded conversation from an attempted controlled purchase, Denver detectives obtained and executed a search warrant on Sandoval\u2019s residence, where they found various drug paraphernalia.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When confronted by officers, Sandoval made several incriminating statements. For instance, during the course of the search of his residence, Sandoval asked Detective Lov-eall about the drugs found and how much they weighed. Although he later disclaimed any ownership or knowledge of the guns, Sandoval also asked Detective Gutke if he liked the \u201cMAC 10\u201d found inside a sub-woofer, and admitted there was a handgun inside the house. Nor was Sandoval shy about his role in narcotics trafficking. He told Detective Gutke that he had been getting a pound or two of methamphetamine at a time from a person named \u201cPices\u201d and selling drugs to earn money because he had a hard time finding employment. He suggested the detectives would have found more incriminating evidence if they had searched his house a week earlier, but' that he was stopping drug distribution because he recently obtained a new job.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-14\">During a similar interaction with Detective Dompier, Sandoval said he had not sold drugs recently and was getting out of the business, planning on a new career path so he could turn his life around and take care of his eight-year-old daughter. While in jail pending trial, Sandoval engaged in numerous conversations regarding the items collected from his residence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>and, through these conversations, acknowledged his awareness of the specific firearms and narcotics recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Based upon the seized evidence, incriminating statements, and testimony presented at trial, Sandoval\u2014a previously convicted felon\u2014was convicted by a jury and sentenced to \u00e1 total of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment for: (1) possession of firearms and ammunition by a prohibited person in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1); (2) possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1); (3) possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c); and (4) possession of body armor by a violent felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 931.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Sandoval raises three issues related to the district court\u2019s trial rulings: (1) allowing two detectives to testify about linguistics and indicia of narcotics distribution without first qualifying the detectives as experts; (2) permitting an officer to testify as both an expert and fact witness without properly cautioning the jury about these dual roles; and (3) allowing a detective to mention that when arrested Sandoval invoked his <em>Miranda </em>rights to remain silent and not to incriminate himself. He also argues that the cumulative effect of these errors deprived him of a fair trial. -</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">\n<em>A. Opinion Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">Sandoval first contends portions of Detective Loveall\u2019s and Detective Dompier\u2019s testimonies were expert opinion wrongfully admitted in the guise of lay opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-12\">Sandoval failed to object to the detectives\u2019 testimony at trial and therefore did not put the district court on notice that the testimony was improper under the Federal Rules of Evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A district court\u2019s decision to admit expert or lay testimony is ordinarily reviewed for abuse of discretion but, as here, for plain error when a party fails to contemporaneously object. <em>United States v. Brooks, </em>736 F.3d 921, 929-30 (10th Cir. 2013). Plain error occurs when there is: (1) error; (2) that is plain; which (3) affects substantial rights; and which (4) seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 930. An otherwise plain error may be harmless and fail to constitute adequate grounds for reversal when it is unlikely that the testimony on a particular issue \u201chad any serious impact on the outcome of the <em>trial\u201d\u2014e.g., </em>when the jury has already heard similar testimony, or other evidence of a defendant\u2019s guilt presented at trial was \u201csubstantial\u201d or \u201cstrong.\u201d <em>See United States v. Hinson, </em>585 F.3d 1328, 1338 (10th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-13\">To properly preserve an issue, a party\u2019s contemporaneous objection must be sufficiently specific. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Battles, </em>745 F.3d 436, 452 (10th Cir. 2014) (\u201c[I]n light of Ms. Battles\u2019s failure to \u2018offer up a timely and specific trial objection\u2019 to the evidence, we review her claim for plain error.\u201d (alteration incorporated)). <em>See also Elonis v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 2001, 2017, 192 L.Ed.2d 1 (2015) (Alito, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\u201c[A] defendant [must] \u2018inform the court of the specific objection and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>grounds for the objection,\u2019 An objection cannot be vague or open-ended. It must <em>specifically </em>identify the alleged error. And failure to lodge a sufficient objection \u2018precludes appellate review,\u2019 except for plain error.\u201d (citations omitted)). Even if counsel \u201cmight \u2018not explain the evidentiary basis of his argument as thoroughly as might ideally be desired,\u2019 \u201d counsel must at least \u201csubstantially satisffy] the requirement of putting the court on notice as to his concern.\u201d <em>Prager v. Campbell Cty. Mem\u2019l Hosp., </em>731 F.3d 1046, 1054 (10th Cir. 2013) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Sandoval contends the detectives offered improper expert opinion testimony on linguistics and indicia of narcotics distribution. He argues the detectives were never endorsed as experts, never disclosed their probable testimony, and, in any event, were not permitted under the federal rules to offer expert opinion as lay witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Two federal rules explain the admissibility of opinion evidence. Under Rule 701, a non-expert witness\u2019s testimony \u201cin the form of an opinion\u201d is limited to (1) an opinion rationally based on the witness\u2019s perception; (2) that is helpful to clearly understanding the witness\u2019s testimony or to determining a fact in issue; and (3) is not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702 (pertaining to expert opinion). Fed. R. Evid. 701. If, on the other hand, a witness\u2019s opinion testimony does not meet the standards of Rule 701, the witness cannot be considered a lay witness and must be qualified as an expert pursuant to Rule 702. Rule 702 provides, among other things, that an expert must have specialized knowledge or expertise that will help the jury \u201cunderstand the evidence or [] determine a fact in issue.\u201d Fed. R. Evid. 702(a). Rule 702 requires a district court \u201cto assess proffered expert testimony to ensure it is both relevant and reliable.\u201d <em>United States v. Avitia-Guillen, </em>680 F.3d 1253, 1256 (10th Cir. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Endorsing a witness as an expert also triggers Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16\u2019s pretrial disclosure requirements, which ensure that an opposing party will have time to adequately prepare for trial <em>(e.g., </em>to prepare \u201can effective cross-examination challenging the experts\u2019 qualifications and conclusions,\u201d or to obtain a competing expert). <em>See United States v. Banks, </em>761 F.3d 1163, 1190 (10th Cir. 2014). To this end, Rule 16 provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-8\">At the defendant\u2019s request, the government must give to the defendant a written summary of any testimony that the government intends to use under Rule[ ] 702 ... of the Federal Rules of Evidence during its case-in-chief at trial. ... The summary provided under this subparagraph must describe the witness\u2019s opinions, the bases and reasons for those opinions, and the witness\u2019s qualifications.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(a)(1)(G). Failure to comply with a Rule 16 request could subject the government to sanctions, including exclusion of the expert testimony. Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(d)(2); <em>Banks, </em>761 F.3d at 1198. And a party may not circumvent the heightened requirements of Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and corresponding Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16 disclosure requirements by offering expert testimony in the guise of lay opinion. <em>See United States v. Richter, </em>796 F.3d 1173, 1195 (10th Cir. 2015), <em>cert. dismissed in part, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 136 S.Ct. 1511, 194 L.Ed.2d 600 (2016), <em>and cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 136 S.Ct. 2046, 195 L.Ed.2d 221 (2016); <em>James River Ins. Co. v. Rapid Funding, LLC, </em>658 F.3d 1207, 1216 (10th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-14\">We have repeatedly explained the contours of lay and expert opinion. A witness\u2019s conclusions and opinions fell under Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>701 when underlying mathematical calculations, for example, were \u201cnot so complex a task that litigants need to hire experts in order to deem the evidence trustworthy,\u201d but rather \u201cwell within the ability of anyone with a grade-school education.\u201d <em>James River, </em>658 F.3d at 1214 (quoting <em>Bryant v. Farmers Ins. Exch., </em>432 F.3d 1114, 1124 (10th Cir. 2005)). In contrast, a CEO\u2019s testimony about his business\u2019s lost profits was inadmissible under Rule 702 because his results were based on sophisticated economic models including \u201cmoving averages, compounded growth rates, and S-eurves\u201d beyond the ken of an ordinary juror. <em>James River, </em>658 F.3d at 1214 (quoting <em>LifeWise Master Funding v. Telebank, </em>374 F.3d 917, 929 (10th Cir. 2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">In short, Rule 701 \u201cdoes not permit a lay witness to express an opinion as to matters which are beyond the realm of common experience and which require the special skill and knowledge of an expert witness.\u201d <em>See James River, </em>658 F.3d at 1214 (quoting <em>Randolph v. Collectramatic, Inc., </em>590 F.2d 844, 846 (10th Cir. 1979)). A lay witness may offer only \u201cobservations that are common enough and require a limited amount of expertise, if any.\u201d <em>James River, </em>658 F.3d at 1214 (alterations incorporated) (quoting <em>United States v. VonWillie, </em>59 F.3d 922, 929 (9th Cir. 1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Sandoval claims Detective Loveall improperly relied on his background and experience in narcotics investigations to opine about the meaning of ostensibly coded language used in the course of the attempted controlled purchase. For example, Detective Loveall testified that the word \u201cpaper\u201d may refer to \u201cmoney,\u201d the number \u201c2\u201d may refer to ounces of methamphetamine, the numbers \u201c1,400\u201d and \u201c3,700\u201d may refer to \u201c$1,400\u201d and \u201c$3,700,\u201d and the word \u201cheads\u201d may refer to \u201ccustomers.\u201d R., Vol. 2, at 312-15, 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">Likewise, Sandoval claims Detective Dompier improperly relied on his background and experience in executing search warrants and narcotics trafficking to testify about indicia of distribution and drug ledgers. For example, Detective Dompier testified that when he conducts a search warrant he looks for \u201cindicia of distribution ... that would show the business side of narcotics distribution,\u201d including, \u201c[s]cales, paperwork, photographs, phone numbers, things along those lines,\u201d and \u201citems of paraphernalia,\u201d including \u201cpipes, scales, baggies, needles, spoons, cotton balls, on and on.\u201d R., Vol. 2, at 472-74. Detective Dompier also testified that he collected a \u201cpay/owe sheet\u201d or \u201cledger\u201d from Sandoval\u2019s residence, which he described as \u201cone piece of paper that had numerous names and s [sic] large number of phone numbers on it associated with another piece of paper, which [he] believed, due to the writing, to be a ledger, due to mathematics and some of the terms that were written ... such as \u2018payment,\u2019 \u2018balance,\u2019 and dates written in the form of \u20187-3,\u2019 \u20187-6,\u2019 \u20187-4.; \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 472, 476-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">In previous cases, we have considered the admissibility of non-expert witness testimony regarding the meaning of language used in the drug trade. For the most part, our cases have allowed witnesses to testify and explain coded language without first being qualified as experts. <em>See, e.g., Brooks, </em>736 F.3d at 927, 929 (key government witness explained \u201ccode words and drug lingo used\u201d); <em>United States v. Patterson, </em>713 F.3d 1237, 1240-41 (10th Cir. 2013) (DEA special agent interpreted a number of recorded conversations using \u201ccoded language\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">With this background in mind, the district court did not commit plain error. First, it is doubtful any error existed let alone that it was plain. Neither the translations of language from the recorded con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>versation nor the inferences drawn from them were beyond the capacity of an ordinary person. Detective Loveall\u2019s observations {e.g., that the word \u201cpaper\u201d may refer to \u201cmoney\u201d and the word \u201cheads\u201d may refer to \u201ccustomers\u201d) were not so complex as to require the special skill and expertise of an expert. Nor was Detective Dompier\u2019s testimony concerning evidence related to narcotics trafficking sufficiently specialized to trigger the requirements of Rule 702. We agree' with the government that the testimony elicited here was \u201cnot rocket science\u201d and a reasonable juror '\u201cin many eases could easily understand what was going on\u201d without the need to invoke the requirements of Rule 702. <em>See </em>Aple\u2019s Br. at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Moreover, both detectives were directly involved in the investigation and gave testimony that rationally could be based on their own perception of the events and evidence. Even if the detectives relied on some of their background experience and training, any such reliance was balanced with their personal experience with the case and evidence at hand. It is neither clear nor obvious that the challenged testimony falls outside of the scope of Rule 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">Finally, Sandoval has not made a showing under the third prong of plain error that his \u201csubstantial rights to a fair trial\u201d were implicated by the unobjected-to testimony. Sandoval\u2019s counsel suggested \u201cthat it would suffice that the prosecution simply didn\u2019t comply, as they were required to,\u201d [Oral Arg. Recording at 8:09-8:15.] with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16\u2019s pretrial disclosure requirements. But this broad allegation of mere noncompliance does not come close to satisfying the showing required by the third prong of plain error review, and Sandoval points to no specific prejudice arising from the challenged testimony, especially in light of the volume of other incriminating and probative evidence pointing to guilt introduced to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">In sum, the district court did not commit plain error in admitting the detectives\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">\n<em>B. Dual Capacity Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">Sandoval next contends the district court committed plain error when it allowed Officer Barben to testify as both an expert and as a fact witness without taking precautionary measures to avoid jury confusion. Sandoval neither requested any specific measures at trial nor objected to Officer Barben\u2019s testimony on these grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">We recognize that witnesses who testify in both a lay capacity and an expert capacity may present special risks at trial. The \u201caura of special reliability and trustworthiness surrounding expert testimony,\u201d may give the witness \u201cunmerited credibility\u201d and \u201ccreate[ ] a risk of prejudice \u2018because the jury may infer that the agent\u2019s opinion about the criminal nature of the defendant\u2019s activity is based on knowledge of the defendant beyond the evidence at trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Dukagjini, </em>326 F.3d 45, 53-54 (2d Cir. 2003) (citations omitted). In light of this concern, some circuits have encouraged district courts to take precautionary measures, including warning the jury about the witness\u2019s dual roles or bifurcating the questioning to clearly demarcate lay and expert testimony offered by the same witness, to protect against these dangers. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Rios, </em>830 F.3d 403, 414-15 (6th Cir. 2016), <em>cert. petition filed, </em>No. 16-7314 (Dec. 27, 2016); <em>United States v. Moralez, </em>808 F.3d 362, 365-67 (8th Cir. 2015); <em>United States v. Haines, </em>803 F.3d 713, 730-32 (5th Cir. 2015); <em>United States v. Vera, </em>770 F.3d 1232, 1242-43 (9th Cir. 2014); <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>752 F.3d 382, 392 (4th Cir. 2014); <em>United States v. Tucker, </em>714 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>F.3d 1006, 1016 (7th Cir. 2013); <em>United States v. Flores-DeJesus, </em>569 F.3d 8, 21 (1st Cir. 2009); <em>Dukagjini, </em>326 F.3d at 53-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Despite these risks, we have \u201cdeeline[d] to adopt a <em>per se </em>rule prohibiting the use of case agents as experts,\u201d choosing instead to rely on determinations made by \u201cthe trial judge who is attuned to the dynamics of the trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Mendoza, </em>236 Fed.Appx. 371, 384 (10th Cir. 2007) (unpublished). And Sandoval has not cited <em>any </em>case from <em>any </em>circuit finding a district court\u2019s failure to take such measures constitutes reversible error under a plain error standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">Sandoval fails to overcome plain error here. Officer Barben was present during the search of Sandoval\u2019s residence and called to testify about his participation in the search and observations of materials found in the home. But in addition, the prosecution went on to qualify Officer Bar-ben as an expert on whether the items found were consistent with involvement in the drug trade. Officer Barben thus testified, for example, about \u201csome of the common-known tools that go with drug dealing,\u201d including: (1) \u201cparaphernalia, such as the packaging you are going to use to sell; so small baggies, medium baggies, large baggies\u201d; (2) \u201cthe things, like, that you will need for protection of your product; guns, knives, stun guns, things of that nature\u201d; (3) \u201cscales, because you need something to weigh it out so the customer knows what they are getting\u201d; (4) \u201csurveillance equipment; cameras, especially on residential operations, ... to survey what is going on outside of your home\u201d and \u201cthwart robbery attempts of your product\u201d; and (5) \u201cuse of multiple phones that do not come back to the true identity of that person.\u201d R., Vol. 2, at 623-25. He also gave his opinion, based on his \u201cexperience in street-level narcotics,\u201d that 13.1 grams of methamphetamine <em>(ie., </em>the amount recovered from Sandoval\u2019s residence) was a \u201cselling amount\u201d more consistent with distribution than personal use, which was \u201ctypically half a gram to one-and-a-half grams, not 13.1 grams.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 628-29. Officer Barben further testified that the type of \u201cfold-top sandwich bags\u201d recovered from Sandoval\u2019s residence were \u201cpackaging for methamphetamine ... [i]n a certain technique,\u201d and that \u201crock\u201d may mean \u201ccrack cocaine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 630-31, 653-54. In both instances, however, the district court clarified that Officer Barben was not talking about the baggies collected in particular (but about that type of bag in general) and not saying \u201crock\u201d meant crack cocaine in the recorded conversation (but merely that it could have that meaning in general). <em>Id. </em>at 631, 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">Both lay and expert aspects of Officer Barben\u2019s testimony were independently admissible. Given this, Sandoval objects only that the district court erred by failing to instruct the jury as to the differences between Officer Barben\u2019s roles in providing the lay and expert testimony. None of our eases require a blanket instruction in such circumstances, so it is doubtful any error was plain. Nor has Sandoval pointed to any prejudice arising from the testimony or Officer Barben\u2019s dual capacity. To the extent Sandoval claims dual capacity testimony is presumptively, or at least inherently, prejudicial in the absence of proper prophylactic measures, Sandoval misunderstands the burdens associated with plain error review. Even assuming the district court erred in failing to take <em>sua sponte </em>precautionary measures concerning Officer Barben\u2019s dual role, Sandoval cannot show a plain error affecting his substantial rights or the integrity of the judicial process.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">C. Miranda <em>Reference</em></p>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">Sandoval also challenges the district court\u2019s failure to <em>sua sponte </em>correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>Detective Loveall\u2019s brief reference to Sandoval\u2019s invocation of his constitutional rights to remain silent and not incriminate himself. He claims the district court committed plain error by failing to strike the testimony or provide a curative instruction to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">It is axiomatic that the government cannot \u201cpenalize an individual for exercising his Fifth Amendment privilege\u201d and the \u201cprosecution may not, therefore, use at trial the fact that [a defendant] stood mute or claimed his privilege in the face of accusation.\u201d <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 468 &amp; n.37, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). <em>See also Doyle v. Ohio, </em>426 U.S. 610, 617-19, 96 S.Ct. 2240, 49 L.Ed.2d 91 (1976). But not all violations of this categorical prohibition constitute reversible error. Any error in allowing the prosecution to comment on a defendant\u2019s post-<em>Miranda </em>silence or invocation is likely to fail the third prong of plain error review when a \u201csingle, isolated reference ... could not have affected the jury\u2019s verdict, considering the substantial evidence supporting the verdict.\u201d <em>See Bland v. Sirmons, </em>459 F.3d 999, 1023 (10th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">The only mention of Sandoval\u2019s invocation of his <em>Miranda </em>rights was a one sentence reference in the midst of several hours of testimony from Detective Loveall, testimony that spans 123 pages of the voluminous record. The erroneous reference occurred as follows,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-6\">GOV\u2019T COUNSEL: Did you transport Mr. Sandoval?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-7\">DET. LOVEALL: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-9\">GOV\u2019T COUNSEL: Did you have any conversations during this transportation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-10\">DET. LOVEALL: I advised him of his Miranda rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-11\">GOV\u2019T COUNSEL: And what did Mr. Sandoval say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-12\">DET. LOVEALL: That he didn\u2019t want to speak with me or to incriminate himself any further.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-13\">GOVT COUNSEL: Did Mr. Sandoval make any further statements?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGS\">DET. LOVEALL: Not on the way to the jail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-14\">R., Vol. 2, at 324. This single, isolated reference could not have affected Sandoval\u2019s substantial rights required by the third prong of plain error review. The ample evidence of Sandoval\u2019s guilt\u2014including the drug paraphernalia and money seized from his residence; the numerous incriminating statements he made before and after he invoked his <em>Miranda </em>rights during the course of the investigation, pretrial preparations, and in jail; and other unchallenged evidence and trial testimony\u2014confirms the single comment did not have any influence upon the jury or the outcome of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-15\">To the extent Sandoval now complains of the district court\u2019s failure to correct the error by issuing a curative instruction, that argument is waived. Not only did Sandoval fail to contemporaneously object, but when Sandoval\u2019s counsel eventually raised the issue, the district court (1) explained its decision not to intervene <em>sua spont;</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(2) admonished the government to avoid mentioning the fact;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (3) <em>offered to give a </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number><em>curative instruction which Sandoval\u2019s counsel </em>declined.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Based on our review of the reference, its context, and the district court\u2019s and defense counsel\u2019s responses, we hold the decision not to bring further attention to the reference was a calculated strategic decision; not reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">In sum, the reference to Sandoval\u2019s invocation of his <em>Miranda </em>rights does not constitute plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">\n<em>D. Cumulative Error Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"APC\">Finally, Sandoval claims that even if each of the three alleged evidentiary errors were individually harmless, their aggregate negative effect requires reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">Cumulative error analysis generally \u201caggregates all errors found to be harmless and \u2018analyzes whether their cumulative effect on the outcome of the trial is such that collectively they can no longer be determined to be harmless.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Willis, </em>826 F.3d 1265, 1280 (10th Cir.) (citation omitted), <em>cert denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 137 S.Ct. 405, 196 L.Ed.2d 316 (2016). There \u201cmust be at least two errors before we may find cumulative error,\u201d otherwise \u201cthere are not multiple errors to cumulate.\u201d <em>Id, </em>Each error considered must be an \u201cactual error\u201d (ie., a matter deemed to be error); this court does not consider \u201cthe cumulative effect of non-errors.\u201d <em>United States v. Harlow, </em>444 F.3d 1255, 1269 (10th Cir. 2006). But this court need not determine there was error in order to dismiss a defendant\u2019s cumulative error argument; we can assume error for purposes of the analysis. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Toles, </em>297 F.3d 959, 972 (10th Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"Ae5\">Sandoval has established, and the government has conceded, only one actual error: Detective Loveall\u2019s comment regarding Sandoval\u2019s invocation of his Fifth Amendment <em>Miranda </em>rights. For this rea-sqn, his cumulative error argument fails. But even if the other claims on appeal had merit, Sandoval was still not deprived of a fair trial. In the aggregate, none of the claims affected Sandoval\u2019s substantial rights. The jury heard unchallenged testimony and evidence from a variety of witnesses that confirm the correctness of the jury\u2019s verdict. Upon consideration of all the claimed errors and the record as a whole, cumulative error analysis does not warrant reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-12\">III.
