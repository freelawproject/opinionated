We deny a COA and dismiss this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-19\">In 2009, Mr. Mowery pleaded guilty to possession with intent to distribute 500 grams and more of a mixture and substance containing a detectible amount of methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A). He voluntarily dismissed his direct appeal. In 2010, through counsel, he filed a \u00a7 2255 motion alleging that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in his plea negotiations and at sentencing. The district court de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>nied the motion, and this court denied a COA and dismissed the appeal, <em>United States v. Mowery, </em>512 Fed.Appx. 824, 830 (10th Cir. 2013). The district court then dismissed subsequent post-judgment motions as unauthorized second or successive \u00a7 2255 motions, and this court again denied a COA and dismissed the appeal, <em>United States v. Mowery, </em>594 Fed.Appx. 546, 548 (10th Cir. 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">In 2016, Mr. Mowery filed a document entitled \u201cDefendant\u2019s PRO SE Motion Requesting a Special Discovery Hearing to Determine if the Level of Court-Appointed Representation Was Adequate, Pursuant to the Criminal Justice Act (18 USC \u00a7 3006A),\u201d in which he complained that his counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness in his criminal case violated \u00a7 3006A and his constitutional rights. The district court clerk docketed the motion as one under \u00a7' 2255. Mr. Mow-ery objected to the clerk characterizing his motion as a \u00a7 2255 motion. The district court determined, however, that the motion attacked the validity of Mr. Mowery\u2019s conviction, and therefore it properly was a \u00a7 2255 motion. Because it was an unauthorized, successive \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court dismissed it for lack of jurisdiction. Mr. Mowery now seeks to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">To appeal, Mr. Mowery must obtain a COA. <em>See United States v. Harper, </em>545 F.3d 1230, 1233 (10th Cir. 2008). Where, as here, a district court has dismissed a filing on procedural grounds, for a COA the movant must show both \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). Although Mr. Mowery argues the merits of his claims, we need not consider the merits aspect of the <em>Slack </em>test because he has not satisfied the procedural aspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">Mr. Mowery objects that the district court clerk filed his document as a \u00a7 2255 motion. He states that by so doing, the clerk \u201cplace[d] the Appellant into the \u2018rabbit holes\u2019 of procedure,\u201d divested him of his constitutional rights to access the courts and to due process, and \u201cpreclude[d] the presiding District Court Judge to be able to investigate the claims properly for resolution, to keep pertinent information \u2018swept under the rug* of justice.\u201d Opening Br./Request for COA at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">Mr. Mowery misunderstands the situation. The clerk performed a merely ministerial action in docketing the document as a \u00a7 2255 motion. In due course, the district judge evaluated the filing and determined, in an exercise of judicial decision-making, that it should be treated as an unauthorized successive \u00a7 2255 motion. The clerk\u2019s actions did not constrain the judge\u2019s decision or have any effect on Mr. Mowery\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">Further, no reasonable jurist could debate the district court\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Mowery\u2019s filing, ostensibly under \u00a7 3006A, was in reality a \u00a7 2255 motion. \u201c28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is the exclusive remedy for a federal prisoner attacking the legality of his detention.\u201d <em>Caravalho v. Pugh, 177 </em>F.3d 1177, 1178 (10th Cir. 1999) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cA \u00a7 2255 motion is one claiming the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States.... \u201d <em>United States v. Nelson, </em>465 F.3d 1145, 1148 (10th Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cIt is the relief sought, not his pleading\u2019s title, that determines whether the pleading is a \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1149. Mr. Mowery sought to attack the validity of his conviction by asserting that his counsel\u2019s performance violated his stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>utory and constitutional rights. Therefore, his motion was, in essence, a \u00a7 2255 motion. The district court did not err in treating the motion as such.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Moreover, Mr. Mowery previously sought relief under \u00a7 2255, making this motion an unauthorized successive \u00a7 2255 motion. \u201c[I]f the prisoner\u2019s pleading must be treated as a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court does not even have jurisdiction to deny the relief sought in the pleading.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1148. Accordingly, no reasonable jurist could debate the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss the filing for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The motion for leave to proceed on appeal without prepayment of costs or fees is granted. But only prepayment of fees is waived, not the fees themselves. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(1). A COA is denied and this matter is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b684-11\"> This order is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cked, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R. App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
