Moritz Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"b792-14\">John Earley, Jr. was the named insured on \u00e1n aircraft insurance contract (the Policy) with'U.S. Specialty Insurance Company (U.S. Specialty). Earley and Michael Schlarb died during an instructional flight when an aircraft listed in the Policy crashed shortly after takeoff. U.S. Specialty sought a declaratory judgment that the Policy doesn\u2019t cover any potential claims arising from the crash. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of U.S. Specialty and against Earley\u2019s estate (the Estate). The Estate appeals. Because we agree with the district court that the Policy excludes coverage, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-15\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b792-16\">U.S. Specialty issued the Policy to Ear-ley to insure three aircraft he owned. The aircraft at issue is a 1944 North American P-51D Mustang. Because the Mustang\u2019s design and features are relevant to the coverage issue, we briefly describe them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-17\">The Mustang was originally built as a single-seat aircraft. Before Earley bought the Mustang, its prior owners modified it to (1) add a second, rear seat and (2) add limited controls to the rear seat: a control stick, rudder pedals, and a throttle control. According to one of the Estate\u2019s experts, such modifications are common in Mustangs because they allow an experienced pilot to instruct a new pilot from the rear seat. But the modifications to Earley\u2019s Mustang were limited. The rear seat didn\u2019t have access to the following controls: the landing. gear; the trim; the fuel selector; the propeller pitch; the brake; the hydraulics; the starter and magneto controls; the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>fuel boost pump; and the electrical controls.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">On July 4, 2014, Earley and Schlarb took off in the Mustang for an instructional flight. Earley occupied the forward seat, and Schlarb was in the rear seat providing instruction to Earley. The Mustang crashed just moments after takeoff. Both men died on impact, and the Mustang was totally destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">U.S. Specialty sought a declaratory judgment that the Policy doesn\u2019t cover any potential claims arising from the crash. In the district court, U.S. Specialty made two arguments relevant to this appeal. First, U.S. Specialty argued that the Policy prohibited Earley from receiving instruction in the Mustang. Second, U.S. Specialty asserted that Earley was the pilot flying the aircraft at the time of the accident\u2014 another violation of the Policy\u2019s provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">The district court agreed with U.S. Specialty on both grounds and granted summary judgment in its favor. The Estate appeals.'</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">We review the district court\u2019s decision granting U.S. Specialty\u2019s motion for summary judgment de novo, applying the same legal standard as the district court and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Estate. <em>See Zisumbo v. Ogden Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr., </em>801 F.3d 1185, 1196 (10th Cir. 2015). Colorado law controls in this diversity action. <em>See Hous. Gen. Ins. Co. v. Am. Fence Co., </em>115 F.3d 805, 806 (10th Cir. 1997) (\u201cThe interpretation of an insurance contract is governed by state law and, sitting in diversity, we look to the law of the forum state.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">The district court first concluded that the crash isn\u2019t covered because Earley\u2014 who isn\u2019t listed in the Policy as an approved pilot for the Mustang\u2014was operating the aircraft. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-11\">The Policy provision that controls this issue is the \u201cPILOT ENDORSEMENT.\u201d App. vol. 1, 38 (emphasis omitted). The relevant portion of the endorsement states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a0d-dedup-0\">9. THE PILOT FLYING THE AIRCRAFT The aircraft must be operated in flight only by a person shown below who must have a current and . proper (1) medical certificate and (2) pilot certificate with necessary ratings as required by the FAA for each flight. There is no coverage under the policy if the pilot does not meet these requirements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-12\">A. WITH RESPECT TO AIRCRAFT N1451D\u2014NORTH AMERICAN P-51D [MUSTANG] (LIMITED):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-14\">1. MIKE SCHLARB, Must be trained and signed off as qualified to act as PIC by a CFI<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> approved by us[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-15\">2. VLADO LENOCH</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-16\"><em>Id. </em>(emphases omitted). The effect of the endorsement is plain: if the Mustang was \u201coperated in flight\u201d by someone other than Schlarb or Lenoch, \u201c[t]here is no coverage under the policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn flight\u201d is a defined term, meaning \u201cwhen the aircraft movement begins for takeoff until completion of the landing run.\u201d App. vol. 1, 78 (emphases omitted). But the Policy doesn\u2019t define the term \u201coperated.\u201d Thus, this dispute turns on whether Earley \u201coperated\u201d the Mustang during the fatal flight.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-17\">The record contains no evidence showing whether Earley or Schlarb\u2014or both\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>touched any particular set of controls during the flight. But it is undisputed that Earley occupied the forward seat throughout the flight. Accordingly, the only question is whether Schlarb could have operated the Mustang from the rear seat. Because the Policy doesn\u2019t define \u201coperated,\u201d the district court applied Colorado law<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and consulted a dictionary to give that term its ordinary meaning: \u201c[to] control the functioning (of a machine, process, or system).\u201d App. vol. 3, 328 (citation omitted). The Estate doesn\u2019t contest this definition, and we adopt it for the purpose of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Relying on that definition, we conclude that Earley operated the Mustang in flight because he was the only pilot with access to all of the controls and instruments needed to \u201ccontrol the functioning\u201d of the Mustang. <em>Id. </em>In the district court, U.S. Specialty argued that \u201cthe rear seat passenger in this aircraft, given the lack of access to the critical controls ... cannot be the pilot flying the aircraft, or operating the aircraft in flight.\u201d App. vol. 1,108. To support that assertion, U.S. Specialty submitted an expert affidavit from Lee Lauderback that identified 24 controls and instruments that are the \u201cmost critical of the flight controls and instrumentation required to fly a Mustang.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 129. Only three of those 24 are accessible from the rear seat.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Lauder-back also provided a checklist of all operations required to carry out a complete flight in the Mustang. The pilot in the forward seat has the sole ability to conduct the vast majority of those operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">The Estate didn\u2019t dispute those facts below, and the district court properly credited them. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(2); <em>Nahno-Lopez v. Houser, </em>625 F.3d 1279, 1283 (10th Cir. 2010). On appeal, the Estate acknowledges that \u201cU.S. Specialty took the position [in the district court] that no one can \u2018pilot\u2019 the P-51 Mustang from the rear seat, which the district court ultimately adopted.\u201d Aplt. Br. 21. In response, the Estate asserts that its two expert affidavits \u201care in direct conflict with that position.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Not so. The relevant portions of the Estate\u2019s expert affidavits state that it\u2019s possible to serve as \u201cpilot in command\u201d from the rear seat\u2014a designation that is irrelevant to this coverage issue, as we explain below. <em>See, e.g., </em>App. vol. 3, 268 (\u201cI serve as the pilot-in-command when I am in the rear seat, even when the plane belongs to the pilot in the front seat.\u201d). But the Estate\u2019s experts never disputed the premise that the rear-seat occupant can\u2019t personally control most of the Mustang\u2019s critical functions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">We\u2019re also persuaded by the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s (FAA) requirements for converted, two-seat P-51D Mustangs. The FAA was required to approve the Mustang\u2019s conversion before it could return to service. <em>See </em>14 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 43.5, 43.9. For this particular conversion, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>FAA indicated that its \u201capproval is valid only if [the] aircraft is placarded to be flown from [the forward] seat only.\u201d App. vol. 1, 150 (capitalization altered). This requirement is consistent with Lauderback\u2019s assertion that only the forward seat contains all the controls and instruments necessary to operate the Mustang during its flight.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">On appeal, the Estate never seriously disputes this premise. Instead, the Estate argues for an entirely different interpretation of the Pilot Endorsement. That endorsement alters \u201cItem 9\u201d in the Policy, which has a heading titled \u201cTHE PILOT .FLYING THE AIRCRAFT.\u201d App. vol. 1, 38. The Estate argues that this phrase is actually a substitute for the term \u201cpilot in command.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Aplt. Br. 17. And based on its assertion that Schlarb was the pilot in command, the Estate argues that Schlarb was also the pilot flying the aircraft.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">The Estate offers several reasons why we should construe \u201cthe pilot flying the aircraft\u201d to mean \u201cthe pilot in command.\u201d But we decline to discuss these reasons because the Estate\u2019s argument is based on a flawed premise: that the phrase \u201cthe pilot flying the aircraft\u201d has any controlling effect on the coverage issue. It doesn\u2019t. That phrase is simply a heading; the operative language immediately follows it: \u201cThe aircraft must be operated in flight only by a person shown below.... There is no coverage under the policy if the pilot does not meet these requirements.\u201d App. vol. 1, 38 (emphasis omitted). The Estate argues that the district court erred by \u201cdetermin[ing] that the \u2018pilot flying the aircraft\u2019 meant the person who \u2018operated\u2019 the aircraft.\u201d Aplt. Br. 23. To the contrary, that\u2019s exactly what the Policy states. And for the reasons we\u2019ve already discussed, only the forward-seat occupant\u2014Earley\u2014 could have \u201coperated\u201d the Mustang.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">Finally, the Estate argues that our reliance on the term \u201coperated,\u201d instead of the \u201cpilot in command\u201d concept, creates a fact issue that precludes summary judgment. Specifically, the Estate argues that there\u2019s no record evidence showing \u201cwhich deceased pilot had [his] hands on a particular flight control at a certain point in time.\u201d Aplt. Br. 23. But our conclusion doesn\u2019t rely on that knowledge. Instead, it relies on the undisputed fact that Earley sat in the forward seat throughout the flight and, based on a standard definition of the term \u201coperate! ],\u201d only the forward seat contained all the controls and instruments necessary to operate the Mustang throughout the flight. App. vol. 1, 38. Accordingly, no factual issues preclude summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">Because we affirm the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment based on the Pilot Endorsement, we need not consider its alternative conclusion that the Policy prohibited Earley from .receiving instruction in the Mustang.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b792-11\"> This order and judgment isn\u2019t binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. But it may be cited for its persuasive value. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 32.1; 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b793-9\">.

The Policy doesn't define these acronyms; the Estate asserts that PIC means pilot in command and that CFI means certified flight instructor,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b794-5\">. \u201c[W]hen faced with terms in an insurance policy that are not defined, [Colorado law] dictates that such terms be given their plain, ordinary <em>meaning....\" Cyprus Amax Minerals Co. v.

Although Lauderback identified only two accessible controls, one of the Estate\u2019s experts asserted in his affidavit that a third set of controls\u2014the flaps\u2014is accessible from the rear seat. Because we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Estate, <em>see Zisumbo, </em>801 F.3d at 1196, we credit its expert\u2019s assertion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b794-11\">. The Estate maintains that \"Schlarb had access to the same controls necessary to perform the takeoff (throttle, rudder pedals, and yoke).\u201d Aplt. Br. 23. But the Estate cites no record evidence confirming that no other controls are necessary for takeoff, and Lauder-back\u2019s affidavit contradicts this assertion. Moreover, the Policy required Schlarb to operate the Mustang throughout the flight\u2014not only during takeoff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b795-6\">. The Estate argues that the placard requirement applies only to solo flights\u2014i.e., if there's only one pilot on board, the pilot must be in the front seat. The Estate\u2019s only support for this interpretation\u2014which is narrower than the placard\u2019s actual language\u2014is its expert\u2019s testimony. See Aplt. Rep. Br. 14 (\"Jackson ... makes clear that this placard only applies to solo flying.\u201d).
