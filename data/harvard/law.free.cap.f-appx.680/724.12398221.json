Holmes, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A-x\">Plaintiff-Appellant Youbyoung Park (\u201cMr. Park\u201d) filed this 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action against Officers Adam Gaitan (\u201cOfficer Gaitan\u201d), John Dykes (\u201cOfficer Dykes\u201d), and John Barricklow (\u201cOfficer Barricklow\u201d)\u2014collectively, \u201cDefendants\u201d\u2014 alleging that Defendants\u2019 execution of a search warrant at Mr. Park\u2019s self-service laundry facility and subsequent seizure of surveillance equipment violated his federal constitutional and state-law rights. Defendants moved for summary judgment, asserting their entitlement to qualified immunity on Mr. Park\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims, and to a favorable judgment on the merits of Mr. 'Park\u2019s state-law claims. The district court entered summary judgment in Defendants\u2019 favor, and Mr. Park appeals. Exercising our jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b750-14\">A<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-15\">On November 3, 2010, Officer Gaitan, a detective at the Bernalillo County Sheriffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>Office (\u201cBCSO\u201d) in New Mexico, visited Mr. Park\u2019s self-service laundry facility while investigating a recent stabbing incident at a nearby establishment. Although Mr. Park and his business had no involvement in the stabbing, Officer Gaitan believed that surveillance video recordings from the laundry facility might confirm or refute a suspect\u2019s claimed alibi. Accordingly, Officer Gaitan entered Mr, Park\u2019s business in plain clothes, displayed his badge and gun, and asked Mr. Park to show him the surveillance video. Mr. Park\u2014who was born in Korea and has limited English skills\u2014did not recognize Officer Gaitan as a law enforcement officer and believed he had come to inquire about some unknown \u201caccident\u201d; consequently, he refused to reveal the video recordings to Officer Gaitan, whom he believed was non-police personnel. Aplt.\u2019s App. at 153-54 (Park Dep., dated Oct. 9, 2013). Following his refusal, Officer Gaitan warned Mr. Park that he would go to jail if he failed to produce the video, but Mr. Park said nothing. Officer Gaitan then handed Mr. Park the following note: \u201cIf you are unwilling to assist me with my investigation I will get a search warrant for your property,\u201d Apli\u2019s App. at 166 (capitalization altered), and left the laundry facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">On the same afternoon (i,e., November 3), dressed in plain clothes, Officer Gaitan returned to Mr. Park\u2019s business with a search warrant for the surveillance video footage and recording equipment; he was accompanied by three plain-clothed BCSO detectives and two uniformed officers\u2014 Officers Dykes and Barricklow. When the officers entered the business, they found Mr. Park seated behind his counter. Officer Gaitan approached the counter, and briefly displayed his badge and gun, and a piece of paper. From there, the parties present vastly divergent accounts of the ensuing moments immediately before Mr. Park\u2019s arrest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">Under Mr. Park\u2019s version of events, Defendants approached him without explaining the purpose for the encounter, and without providing a copy of the search warrant or an opportunity to review its contents. Indeed, Defendants confronted him without uttering \u201cany orders\u201d or \u201csay[ing] anything.\u201d Aplt.\u2019s App. at 151, 175 (Park Dec., dated Dec. 23, 2012). While this encounter was taking place, Mr. Park displayed no observable signs of resistance, nor did he obstruct the officers\u2019 access to the video equipment. Nevertheless, after a few seconds of Mr. Park\u2019s silence, Officer Gaitan directed Officer Dykes to \u201cpull [him] out\u201d from behind the counter. <em>Id. </em>at 151. Officer Gaitan and Officer Dykes then lifted Mr. Park out of his chair, held him by the arms, and forci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>bly escorted him toward the building\u2019s exit. Initially, Mr. Park offered no resistance to the officers\u2019 use of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">As they approached the exit, however, Mr. Park began to tense his arms, brace his legs, and attempt to pull away from the officers. In light of these actions, Officer Gaitan forcibly took Mr. Park to the ground by giving \u201chim a knee strike to the side of his body.\u201d Aplt.\u2019s App. at 171. Once in a \u201cface down stabilization position,\u201d they \u201chandcuffed him,\u201d escorted him from the premises, and placed him in a patrol car. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">With Mr. Park in custody, one of the BCSO officers, Detective Kyle Hartsock (\u201cDetective Hartsock\u201d), began reviewing the contents of Mr. Park\u2019s saved video recordings. Detective Hartsock quickly determined, however, that the relevant recording had already been deleted or overwritten to make room for more recent recordings. As a result, Detective Hart-sock decided to take the video equipment and Mr. Park\u2019s connected laptop back to the computer-forensics laboratory to determine if he could recover the relevant footage. After concluding the search, Officer Dykes and Officer Barricklow transported Mr. \u25a0 Park to the South Valley BCSO Substation, and charged him with the misdemeanor offense of resisting an officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">During the pendency of the criminal charges, Mr. Park\u2019s defense counsel sought discovery concerning the evidence against him, including any recordings from the seized video equipment. The State of New Mexico (\u201cState\u201d), however, never provided responsive materials, and Officer Gaitan ultimately requested dismissal of the misdemeanor charge and the state court acceded to his request. In the meantime, Detective Hartsock informed Officer Gaitan that he could not extract any additional recordings from the video equipment. At that point, Officer Gaitan \u201cbelieved that the equipment and its contents had no evidentiary value\u201d and he deposited the DVR and laptop in the Albuquerque Police Department Evidence Room. Aplt.\u2019s App. at 250 (Gaitan Aff., dated July 26, 2013). Officer Gaitan then closed the stabbing investigation \u201cpending further information\u201d\u2014and \u201ccould have [immediately] released\u201d the seized video-related items to Mr. Park\u2014but he \u201chonestly forgot,\u201d despite his responsibility to return the seized property as the affiant on the search warrant. Aplt.\u2019s App. at 19-20. As a result, Mr. Park did not receive the items until December of 2012, when the district court in the present case ordered their return.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">On November 4,2011, Mr. Park filed the underlying civil action against Defendants, asserting constitutional claims for unlawful seizure and excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment, and tort claims under New Mexico law for assault, battery, false arrest, and false imprisonment. On December 7, 2012, Defendants moved for summary judgment on all of Mr. Park\u2019s claims. Citing newly discovery evidence, however, Mr. Park moved to amend his complaint on December 24, 2012, in order to assert a First Amendment claim against Officer Gaitan. The district court permitted the amendment on February 11, 2013, and Mr. Park filed his amended complaint on the same day. Officer Gaitan then filed an additional summary-judgment motion on Mr. Park\u2019s newly asserted First Amendment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-10\">The district court resolved the sum-maryrjudgment, motions in two separate decisions. First, on March 31, 2014, the district court granted Defendants\u2019 summary-judgment motion with respect to (1) Mr. Park\u2019s Fourth Amendment unlawful seizure and excessive force claims, notably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>finding that Mr. Park had failed to estab-' lish that his constitutional rights were violated, and (2) his related state-law tort claims. An order was entered in connection with this March 31 decision (the \u201cinitial summary-judgment decision\u201d), styled \u201cPartial Dismissal and- Partial Summary Judgment.\u201d Aplt.\u2019s App. at 343 (capitalization altered) (Partial Dismissal and Partial Summ. J., filed Mar. 31, 2014). On January 6, 2015, the district court then granted Officer Gaitan\u2019s summary-judgment motion on Mr. Park\u2019s First Amendment claims (the \u201cfinal summary-judgment decision\u201d), concluding again that Mr. Park had failed to demonstrate a constitutional violation. Accompanying this decision was a document styled, \u201cFinal Summary Judgment,\u201d stating that \u201cthis case is now terminated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 353 (capitalization altered) (Final Summ. J., filed Jan. 6, 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">In the aftermath of those decisions, on February 4, 2015, Mr. Park filed a notice of appeal \u201cfrom the Final Summary Judgment ... entered ... on January 6, 2015, and all interlocutory rulings adverse to Plaintiff, including the document entitled \u2018Partial Dismissal and Partial Summary Judgment\u2019 ... filed March 31, 2014.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Prior to reaching the merits, we first address Defendants\u2019 contention that we lack jurisdiction over the district court\u2019s initial summary-judgment decision. Specifically, Defendants submit that the district court\u2019s March 31, 2014, \u201cPartial Summary Judgment\u201d qualified as a final judgment for purposes of appeal, rendering Mr. Park\u2019s notice of appeal\u2014filed nearly one year later\u2014untimely relative to those claims. However, because the initial summary-judgment decision constituted a non-appealable interlocutory order, we conclude that our appellate jurisdiction extends to all claims that Mr. Park raises on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">Federal circuit courts have jurisdiction to review only \u201cfinal decisions\u201d of district courts. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Generally, \u201c[a] final decision must dispose of all claims by all parties.\u201d <em>New Mexico v. Trujillo, </em>813 F.3d 1308, 1316 (10th Cir. 2016). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54, however, allows a district court to \u201cdirect entry of a final judgment as to one or more, but fewer than all, claims or parties only if the court <em>expressly determines </em>that there is no just reason for delay.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b) (emphasis added). As we recently explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-11\">the \u201cexpressly determines\u201d language of the rule ... require[s] district courts to make two explicit determinations in the certification order. <em>First, </em>the district court must determine the judgment is final. <em>Second, </em>it must determine there is no just reason for delay of entry of its judgment. In doing so, district courts should \u201cclearly articulate their reasons and make careful statements based on the record supporting their determination of \u2018finality\u2019 and \u2018no just reason for delay\u201d so that we can review a 54(b) order more intelligently and thus avoid jurisdictional remands.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-12\"><em>Trujillo, </em>813 F.3d at 1316 (emphases added) (citations omitted) (quoting <em>Stockman\u2019s Water Co. v. Vaca Partners, </em>425 F.3d 1263, 1265 (10th Cir. 2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-13\">Despite Defendants\u2019 contention that the initial summary-judgment decision qualified as a final judgment, this decision fails to contain <em>any </em>of the requisite language, and no party requested a Rule 54(b) certification.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, we con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>elude that the initial summary-judgment decision constituted a non-appealable interlocutory order, which merged into the final judgment terminating the district court case. <em>See McBride v. CITGO Petroleum Corp., </em>281 F.3d 1099, 1104 (10th Cir. 2002) (concluding that \u201can earlier interlocutory order ... merged into the final judgment,\u201d allowing appellate jurisdiction over the earlier order). Importantly, Mr. Park timely filed a notice of appeal as to that final judgment, entered on January 6, 2015; accordingly, that appeal provides the basis for our jurisdiction, not only with respect to the final summary-judgment decision, but also as to the initial summary judgment decision, which merged into the final judgment. In other words, we properly exercise jurisdiction over all of Mr. Park\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Turning to the merits, Mr. Park argues that the district court improperly granted summary judgment to the Defendants on his \u00a7 1983 claims for violations of the Fourth and First Amendments, and on his state-law claims. The district court found, as detailed <em>supra, </em>that Defendants were entitled to qualified immunity on Mr. Park\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims, and to a favorable judgment on the merits as to Mr. Park\u2019s state-law claims. Reviewing each claim in turn, we conclude (1) that Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on Mr. Park\u2019s Fourth Amendment unlawful seizure and excessive force claims and on his First Amendment claim; (2) that the district court erred in entering summary judgment in Defendants\u2019 favor on Mr. Park\u2019s false arrest and false imprisonment claims; and (3) that the district court appropriately entered summary judgment in Defendants\u2019 favor on Mr. Park\u2019s assault and battery claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">\u201cWe review grants of summary judgment based on qualified immunity de novo.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Stonecipher v. Valles, </em>759 F.3d 1134, 1141 (10th Cir. 2014), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 881, 190 L.Ed.2d 705 (2014). At the summary judgment stage, the court may not weigh evidence and must resolve genuine disputes of material fact in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>See Tolan v. Cotton, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 134 S.Ct. 1861, 1866, 188 L.Ed.2d 895 (2014) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>However, when a defendant raises the qualified-immunity defense, the plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating \u201c(1) that the official violated a statutory or constitutional right, <em>and </em>(2) that the right was \u2018clearly established\u2019 at the time of the challenged conduct.\u201d <em>Quinn v. Young, </em>780 F.3d 998, 1004 (10th Cir. 2015) (quoting <em>Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, </em>563 U.S. 731, 735, 131 S.Ct. 2074, 179 L.Ed.2d 1149 (2011)). We may address the two prongs of the qualified-immunity standard in either order; \u201cif the plaintiff fails to establish either prong of the- two-pronged qualified-immunity standard, the defendant prevails on the defense.\u201d <em>A.M. v. Holmes, </em>830 F.3d 1123, 1134-35 (10th Cir. 2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">On appeal, Mr. Park challenges Defendants\u2019 entitlement to qualified immunity on his Fourth Amendment claims of unlawful seizure and excessive force and on his First Amendment claims. We address each claim in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">a</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">An officer violates a plaintiffs Fourth Amendment right to be free from unlawful seizure when the officer effectuates \u201ca highly intrusive or lengthy [warrantless] search or detention\u201d without \u201cprobable cause to believe that a criminal offense has been or is being committed.\u201d <em>Quinn, </em>780 F.3d at 1006 (first quoting <em>United States v. Villagrana-Flores, </em>467 F.3d 1269, 1273 (10th Cir. 2006); then quoting <em>Buck v. City of Albuquerque, </em>549 F.3d 1269, 1281 (10th Cir. 2008)). \u201cConsequently, in a \u00a7 1983 action based on a warrantless arrest, the defendant may be entitled to qualified immunity if he had probable cause to arrest the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">\u201cWe assess probable cause under an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d <em>id. </em>asking \u201cwhether the \u2018facts and circumstances within the officers\u2019 knowledge, and of which they have reasonably trustworthy information, are sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that an offense has been or is being committed,\u2019 \u201d <em>Fogarty v. Gallegos, </em>523 F.3d 1147, 1156 (10th Cir. 2008) (quoting <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>242 F.3d 928, 934 (10th Cir. 2001)). \u201cOur determination on this score is an independent and objective one,\u201d meaning that \u201can officer\u2019s own subjective reason for the arrest is irrelevant, and it does not matter whether the arrestee was later charged with a crime.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">Where a defendant\u2019s claim of probable cause rests on a state criminal statute, as it does here, \u201cthe precise scope of [the federal constitutional right] uniquely depends on the contours of a state\u2019s substantive criminal law.\u201d <em>Kaufman v. Higgs, </em>697 F.3d 1297, 1300-01 (10th Cir. 2012). Accordingly, we look to the state\u2019s highest court \u201cwhen inquiring whether the [defendants\u2019 interpretation of the [relevant criminal] statute was one that a reasonable officer would have held at the time of [the] arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1301. If, however, \u201ca state Supreme Court has not spoken on the question at issue, we assume (without deciding) that a reasonable officer would seek guidance regarding the scope of proper conduct at least in part from any on-point decisions of the state\u2019s intermediate court of appeals.\u201d <em>A.M., </em>830 F.3d at 1140-41; <em>cf. Kokins v. Teleflex, Inc., </em>621 F.3d 1290, 1297 (10th Cir. 2010) (noting in a civil diversity case that \u201c[t]he decision of an intermediate appellate state court is a datum for ascertaining state law which is not to be disregarded by a federal court unless it is convinced by other persuasive data that the highest court of the state would decide otherwise.\u201d (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Stickley v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>505 F.3d 1070, 1077 (10th Cir. 2007))).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>Applying these principles, our inquiry narrowly focuses on (1) whether Defendants had probable cause to arrest<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Mr. Park for violating New Mexico Statute Annotated \u00a7 30-22-1 (1978) (\u201cSection 30-22-1\u201d)\u2014specifically, subsection (A) of that statute\u2014by resisting, evading, or obstructing an officer;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and, if not, (2) whether clearly established law as of November 2010 made the illegality of that arrest indisputable. <em>See Quinn, </em>780 F.3d at 1007. Contrary to the district court, we conclude that Defendants lacked probable cause to arrest Mr. Park under Section 30-22-1(A), but we nevertheless affirm the court\u2019s judgment on the alternative ground that Mr. Park failed to demonstrate that clearly established law squarely condemned Defendants\u2019 conduct at the time of Mr. Park\u2019s arrest in November 2010. <em>See, e.g., Nakkhumpun v. Taylor, </em>782 F.3d 1142, 1157 (10th Cir. 2015) (noting that \u201cwe may affirm the judgment on any ground supported by the record\u201d), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 136 S.

Stat. Ann \u00a7 30-22-1(A). Section 30-22-1(A) is one provision of a multi-pronged statute that generally criminalizes \u201c[Resisting, evading or obstructing an officer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under that larger scheme, \u201c[resisting, evading or obstructing an officer consists of:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-11\">A. <em>knowingly obstructing, resisting or opposing any officer of this state or any other duly authorized person serving or attempting to serve or execute any process or any rule or order of any of the courts of this state or any other judicial writ or process;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-12\">B. intentionally fleeing, attempting to evade or evading an officer of this state when the person committing the act of fleeing, attempting to evade or evasion has knowledge that the officer is attempting to apprehend or arrest him;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-13\">C. willfully refusing to bring a vehicle to a stop when given a visual or audible signal to stop, whether by hand, voice, emergency light, flashing light, siren or other signal, by a uniformed officer in an appropriately marked police vehicle; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-14\">D. resisting or abusing any judge, magistrate or peace officer in the lawful discharge of his duties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-15\">N.M.

Borrowing from <em>Wade, </em>we have similarly concluded that, \u201c[u]nder New Mexico law, \u2018[r]esisting, evading, or obstructing an officer primarily consists of physical acts of resistance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Keylon v.

Diaz, </em>the New Mexico Court of Appeals defined \u201cresisting,\u201d as used in Section 30-22-1(D), to refer to a defendant\u2019s overt physical act <em>or </em>a defendant\u2019s refusal to obey <em>lawful </em>police commands. 121 N.M. 28, 908 P.2d 258, 259-62 (Ct.

Smith, </em>the New Mexico Court of Appeals construed \u201cresisting,\u201d as used in Roswell, N.M. Code Section 10-48(a)(2), which mirrors Section 30-22-1(D),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to include a defendant\u2019s failure to follow an officer\u2019s <em>lawful </em>instructions. 139 N.M. 381, 133 P.3d 271, 272-73 (Ct. App. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">In light of these decisions, we have found an arrest \u201cjustified\u201d under <em>various </em>provisions of the resisting statute where the defendant has refused to comply with an officer\u2019s command, but <em>only </em>under circumstances where the command precipitating the arrest was \u201cactually lawful.\u201d <em>Storey v. Taylor, </em>696 F.3d 987, 993 n.6 (10th Cir. 2012); <em>accord Romero v. Story, </em>672 F.3d 880, 889 (10th Cir. 2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">In <em>Storey, </em>for example, we considered whether a New Mexico police officer had probable cause to arrest Mr. Storey after he \u201cdisobeyed [an officer\u2019s] order to step out of [his] house\u201d during an investigation into an anonymous report of a domestic disturbance. 696 F.3d at 990-91, 993. Given the warrantless nature of the inquiry, however, we concluded that \u201c[the officer] had no [lawful] basis on which to order [Mr.] Storey out of his [own] house.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 993. Accordingly, we held that \u201c[Mr.] Storey\u2019s refusal to obey [the unlawful order] could not [by itself] justify his arrest\u201d under Section 30-22-1(D). <em>Id. </em>at 994.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>Analogously, in <em>Romero, </em>officers knocked on Mr. Romero\u2019s door to investigate reports of vandalism. <em>See </em>672 F.3d at 883-84. Although Mr. Romero initially compiled with their requests, \u201cnot understanding why law enforcement knocked on [his] door, [he ultimately] turned back toward the apartment and proceeded one or two steps.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 883. The officers \u201cgrabbed [Mr. Romero] to prevent [his] entry into the apartment\u201d and arrested him based on the \u201cflight\u201d and \u201cevasion\u201d provisions of Section 30-22-1(B). <em>Id. </em>However, because the officers lacked \u201creasonable suspicion or probable cause\u201d to \u201cdetain [Mr. Romero] for the vandalism,\u201d we concluded that the officers had no lawful basis \u201cto force [him] to speak\u201d and thus no grounds to justify his arrest under Section 30-22-1(B). <em>Id. </em>at 889.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">For our analytical purposes, it is important to underscore at the outset that <em>Diaz, Archuleta, Smith, Storey, </em>and <em>Romero </em>addressed Sections 30-22-1(B) and (D) (or an analogous municipal provision), <em>not </em>Section 30-22-1(A), the provision at issue here; therefore, these cases do not directly control our interpretation of the latter provision. But we acknowledge that an essential premise of those decisions\u2014viz., \u201c[resisting\u201d includes disobedience to a lawful police command\u2014lends persuasive support to Defendants\u2019 understanding of Section 30-22-1(A). That is particularly true because the term \u201cresisting\u201d appears in the prefatory portion of the resisting statute; that prefatory language clarifies that the statutory subsections that follow indicate what, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cresisting\u201d \u201cconsists of.\u201d <em>And </em>the term also appears not only in subsection (D), but also in the specific subsection at issue here, subsection (A). Therefore, one can reasonably infer that the New Mexico legislature intended \u201cresisting\u201d to have a uniform meaning throughout the resisting statute. <em>Compare Sorenson v. Sec\u2019y of Treasury, </em>475 U.S. 851, 860 (1986) (\u201cThe normal rule of statutory construction assumes that \u2018identical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning.\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Helvering v. Stockholms Enskilda Bank, </em>293 U.S. 84, 87, 55 S.Ct. 50, 79 L.Ed. 211 (1934))), <em>and First Nat'l Bank of Durango v. Woods (In re Woods), </em>743 F.3d 689, 697 (10th Cir. 2014) (same), <em>with State v. Jade G., </em>154 P.3d 659, 667 (N.M. 2007) (applying the same principle of statutory interpretation under New Mexico law). Nevertheless, even if we assume, without deciding, that the failure to follow a lawful police command constitutes a viable theory of \u201c[resisting\u201d under Section 30-22-1(A), Defendants\u2019 argument based on such a theory would still fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Importantly, Defendants\u2019 argument tacitly requires us to accept their view of the <em>facts\u2014viz., </em>that Officer Gaitan advised Mr. Park that he had a search warrant to review the video footage, <em>and </em>asked (or demanded) that Mr. Park help him access the video. As explained <em>supra, </em>however, our legal framework in this context requires us to reject Defendants\u2019 version of events, in favor of Mr. Park\u2019s account that (1) Defendants approached him without explaining the purpose for the encounter, (2) without providing a copy of the search warrant or an opportunity to review its contents, and (3) without issuing any orders or commands. Viewed that way, the record provides no factual basis to apply Defendants\u2019 lawful-order theory of criminal conduct to Mr. Park. In other words, accepting Mr, Park\u2019s version of the facts, Defendants never gave him an order\u2014 lawful or otherwise. Thus, even if we concluded that the failure to follow a lawful order constitutes a violation of Section 30-22-1(A) (despite the paucity of authority on that <em>specific </em>question), Defendants have not demonstrated probable cause under that theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>Lastly, Defendants also seek to bolster their assertion of probable cause with an unpublished decision of our court, <em>Boydston v. Isom, </em>224 Fed.Appx. 810 (10th Cir. 2007). Putting aside the fact that <em>Boydston </em>is not precedential, and therefore not controlling here, it does not help Defendants. A car dealer, the <em>Boydston </em>plaintiff was arrested for denying the request of New Mexico police officers \u201cto review the [temporary tag] records relating to the sale of a vehicle\u201d to a customer. <em>Id. </em>at 812. We analyzed whether the officers had probable cause to arrest the plaintiff under Section 30-22-1(D), and New Mexico Statute Annotated \u00a7 66-4-5(E) (\u201cSection 66-4-5(E)\u201d), which requires auto dealers to permit law enforcement officers to inspect temporary tag records, <em>id. </em>at 815 &amp; n.3, and concluded that they did, <em>id. </em>at 815-817. In doing so, we generally observed, \u201c[w]ith respect to each charge, the same facts demonstrate that a reasonable officer would have probable cause to believe [the plaintiff] violated New Mexico law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 815. We stated in this regard: \u201cIt is undisputed that Defendants went to [the plaintiffs auto store] during normal business hours and requested of [the plaintiff] that they be allowed access to the records, as permitted by [Section 66-4-5(E)]. It is also undisputed that [the plaintiff] denied Defendants access to the records.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\"><em>Boydston </em>is distinguishable and cannot advance Defendants\u2019 cause. First of all, even if we assume as we did <em>supra </em>that cases construing the probable-cause requirements for an arrest under Section 30-22-1(D) are applicable in the context of an arrest (as here) under Section 30-22-1(A), Defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Boydston </em>confronts the same insurmountable, factual obstacle as the other decisions that they cite: that is, accepting the facts as Mr. Park would have them, Defendants never asked (i.e., ordered) Mr. Park to provide them with the video recording. Accordingly, unlike the <em>Boydston </em>plaintiff, Mr. Park cannot be said to have violated the resisting statute by refusing a lawful police request for access to certain information. And, second, our analysis in <em>Boydston </em>of the plaintiffs arrest under Section 66-4-5(E)\u2014a provision of an entirely different statutory scheme than the one at. issue here\u2014is inapposite. Indeed, under that statute, the <em>Boydston </em>plaintiff had an affirmative obligation to provide the police officers upon request with access to the kind of records that they sought. <em>See Boydston, </em>224 Fed.Appx. at 815. However, there is no analogous language in Section 30-22-1(A), and, in any event, Defendants did not make a request for the video recording (under Mr. Park\u2019s version of the facts) that might have triggered any such purported affirmative obligation. Accordingly, Defendants\u2019 reliance on <em>Boydston </em>is unavailing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>For all of the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Defendants lacked probable cause to arrest Mr. Park for 'violating Section 30-22-1(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Despite our probable-cause conclusion, we still must consider whether clearly established law, at the time of Mr. Park\u2019s arrest, would have made the illegality of his arrest indisputable.

We conclude that Mr. Park cannot satisfy this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">The \u201cbody of relevant caselaw\u201d concerning any of the provisions of the resisting statute in November 2010 was (and still is) <em>\u201cvery </em>limited.\u201d <em>A.M., </em>830 F.3d at 1143 (emphasis added). Moreover, as explicated <em>supra, </em>far fewer cases mention, much less discuss, the <em>specific </em>provision implicated here\u2014Section 30-22-1(A). More importantly, <em>no </em>controlling decision from the United States Supreme Court, our court, or New Mexico appellate courts <em>\u201csquarely governs\u201d </em>whether Defendants lacked probable cause for Mr. Park\u2019s arrest under Section 30-22-1(A), <em>Mullenix, </em>136 S.Ct. at 309 (quoting <em>Brosseau, </em>543 U.S. at 201, 125 S.Ct. 596); <em>accord Aldaba II, </em>844 F.3d at 877, or places the resolution of this probable-cause question \u201cbeyond debate,\u201d <em>al-Kidd, 5</em>63 U.S. at 741, 131 S.Ct. 2074; <em>accord White, </em>137 S.Ct. at 551. In particular, the cases from the relevant time period that we discussed supra\u2014including <em>Diaz, Archuleta, Smith, </em>and Boydston\u2014 clearly do not satisfy this criteria. Though we determined that those cases do <em>not </em>support Defendants\u2019 claim that they possessed <em>actual </em>probable cause for Mr. Park\u2019s arrest, they also do not squarely condemn that arrest under the Fourth Amendment, such that we can conclude that Defendants lacked <em>arguable </em>probable cause for Mr. Park\u2019s arrest. Indeed, Defendants could have <em>reasonably\u2014but mis</em>takenly\u2014relied on cases like <em>Diaz </em>and its progeny, and <em>Boydston </em>to support their arrest of Mr. Park.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">At bottom, Mr. Park cannot supply \u201ca case where an officer acting under similar circumstances ... was held to have violated the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>White, </em>137 S.Ct. at 552. No decision would have \u201capprise[d] <em>every </em>objectively reasonable officer\u201d that he lacked probable cause under the circumstances of this case to arrest Mr. Park. <em>Aldaba II, </em>844 F.3d at 877 (emphasis added); <em>see id. </em>at 879 (\u201c[Because] [w]e have found no case presenting a similar situation^] [w]e certainly cannot say that every reasonable officer would know that the Fourth Amendment condemned [the officer\u2019s specific conduct]. No case renders a Fourth Amendment violation \u2018beyond debate.\u2019\u201d). Consequently, although we <em>now </em>conclude that Defendants lacked probable cause to arrest Mr. Park for violating Section 30-22-1(A), we cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>determine under the particular facts of this case that Mr. Park has carried his burden of demonstrating that Defendants\u2019 arrest violated clearly established law. <em>See, e.g., Cox v.

Nor, for that matter, has [she] attempted to shoulder her burden by showing that \u2018the clearly established weight of authority from other courts ... ha[s] found the law to be as [she] maintains.\u2019 <em>On this basis alone, </em>we could hold that [the plaintiff] has not properly laid the groundwork to defeat [the defendant\u2019s] assertion of qualified immunity.\u201d (second omission in original) (emphasis added) (footnote omitted) (citations omitted) (quoting <em>Becker v.

Therefore, we conclude that Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity with respect to Mr. Park\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim for unlawful seizure and affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on this alternative basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">We next address Mr. Park\u2019s Fourth Amendment excessive-force claim. In this claim, Mr. Park contends that Defendants used greater force than necessary to effect his arrest, by \u201capplying] a knee strike to [his] torso and forcing] him to the floor with their weight on top of him.\u201d Aplt\u2019s Opening Br. at 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">In <em>Cortez, </em>we recently discussed the analytical framework for analyzing \u201cclaims of both unlawful arrest and excessive force arising from a single encounter\u201d explaining, in that scenario, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ApS\">it is necessary to consider both the justification the officers had for the arrest and the degree of force they used to effect it. If the plaintiff can prove that the officers lacked probable cause, he is entitled to damages for the unlawful arrest, which includes damages resulting from any force reasonably employed in effecting the arrest. <em>If the plaintiff can prove that the officers used greater force than would have been reasonably necessary to effect a lawful arrest, he is entitled to damages resulting from that excessive force. </em>These two inquiries are separate and independent, though the evidence may overlap.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-8\"><em>Cortez, </em>478 F.3d at 1127 (emphasis added). When \u201cofficers move for qualified immunity on an excessive force claim,\u201d the plaintiff must show \u201cthat the force used was impermissible (a constitutional violation) and that objectively reasonable officers could not have ... thought the force'constitutionally permissible (violates clearly established law).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1128. In this case, we focus our attention only on the first inquiry (i.e., a constitutional violation <em>vel non), </em>ultimately concluding that Mr. Park has failed to demonstrate that Defendants violated his Fourth Amendment rights by using excessive force.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">In determining whether Defendants applied more force than would have been reasonably necessary (assuming, as we must, that Defendants effected a <em>lawful </em>arrest of Mr. Park), we consider the facts and circumstances confronting the officers, judging \u201creasonableness ... \u2018from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.\u2019\u201d <em>Cavanaugh v.

For example, \u201c[i]f an officer reasonably, but mistakenly, believed that a suspect was likely to fight back, ... the officer would be justified in using more force than in fact was needed.\u201d <em>Saucier, </em>533 U.S. at 205, 121 S.Ct. 2151. As part of the analysis, the relevant factors \u201cinclude, <em>but are not limited to, </em>\u2018[1] the severity of the crime at issue, [2] whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, and [3] whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cavanaugh, </em>718 F.3d at 1249 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Graham, </em>490 U.S. at 396, 109 S.Ct. 1865). These three factors\u2014first identified by the Supreme Court in Graham\u2014are often referred to as the <em>Graham </em>factors. <em>See, e.g., Fisher v. City of Las Cruces, </em>584 F.3d 888, 894-96 (10th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The district court focused on the three <em>Graham </em>factors, finding that the first two (the severity of the crime at issue and whether Mr. Park posed a threat to Defendants\u2019 safety) favored Mr. Park, while the third heavily favored Defendants. On that factor, the district court specifically concluded that Mr. Park \u201cactively resisted his continued arrest by physically tensing up and moving his arms in an attempt to get out of the escort hold and stay in the [ljaundromat,\u201d at which point \u201c[Officers] Gaitan and Dykes could have reasonably believed that [Mr. Park] was likely to fight back.\u201d Aplt-\u2019s App. at 339 (Mem. Op. &amp; Order, filed Mar. 31, 2014). In view of those circumstances, the district court found \u201c[Officer] Gaitan and [Officer] Dykes were justified in using more force than was actually needed to restrain [Mr. Park].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">On appeal, Mr. Park challenges this aspect (i.e., the third factor) of the district court\u2019s Graham-factor analysis and claims, in any event, that the \u201ccircumstances of [this] particular case ... require ... consideration of additional factors\u201d beyond those identified in <em>Graham. </em>Aplt.\u2019s Opening Br. at 53 (quoting <em>Aldaba v.

Under the third <em>Graham </em>factor (i.e., whether Mr. Park actively resisted or attempted to evade arrest), \u201cthe relevant inquiry is whether the [force used by the officers] was reasonable and proportionate given [the arrestee\u2019s] resistance.\u201d <em>Perea v. Baca, </em>817 F.3d 1198, 1203 (10th Cir. 2016); <em>see also Cortez, </em>478 F.3d at 1126 (\u201c[T]he excessive force inquiry evaluates the force used in a given arrest or detention against the force reasonably necessary To effect a lawful arrest or detention under the circumstances of the case.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">Here, the district court found that, a short time after the officers lifted him out of his chair to arrest him, Mr. Park fought back \u201cforcefully\u201d by tensing his arms, bracing his legs, and attempting to pull away from the officers. Aplt.\u2019s App. at 325. Indeed, Mr. Park\u2019s own brief concedes that he \u201ctense[d] his arms, brace[d] his legs, and tr[ied] to pull his arms away from [the officers]\u201d in an attempt \u201cto show that he did not want to leave his business.\u201d Aplt\u2019s Opening Br. at 10. In cases of physical resistance to an arrest, as here, officers may employ the amount of force necessary to complete the arrest, <em>see Perea, </em>817 F.3d at 1203; <em>Cortez, </em>478 F.3d at 1126, and\u2014if they believe (even mistakenly) that the arrestee will continue to fight back\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>they may use \u201cmore force than in fact\u201d necessary, <em>Saucier, </em>533 U.S. at 205, 121 S.Ct. 2151. Guided by the third <em>Graham </em>factor, and considering the totality of the circumstances, it is patent to us that Defendants\u2019 use of force\u2014including a knee strike to Mr. Park\u2019s torso and taking him to the ground\u2014was proportional and reasonable given the nature of Mr. Park\u2019s \u201cforceful[ ]\u201d physical resistance. Aplt\u2019s App. at 325. Accordingly, like the district court, we conclude that Mr. Park\u2019s conduct made Defendants\u2019 use of force reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">As to Mr. Park\u2019s contention that the circumstances of this case obliged the district court to look beyond the three <em>Graham </em>factors, we cannot properly quarrel with the notion that the <em>Graham </em>inquiry may \u201cnot always give a clear answer as. to [every] particular application of force.\u201d <em>Saucier, </em>533 U.S. at 205, 121 S.Ct. 2151 (\u201cThis is the nature of a test which must accommodate limitless factual circumstances.\u201d). <em>Graham </em>itself recognizes that the excessive-force analysis is not restricted to the three factors it identifies; instead, it \u201crequires careful attention to the facts and circumstances of each particular case.\u201d 490 U.S. at 396, 109 S.Ct. 1865; <em>see Cavanaugh, </em>718 F.3d at 1249 (noting that the relevant considerations under <em>Graham </em>\u201cinclude, but are not limited to\u201d the three identified factors). Indeed, as noted <em>supra, </em>in reaching our reasonableness conclusion, we considered the totality of the circumstances. The problem for Mr. Park is that the additional considerations that he identifies do not undercut the reasonableness of Defendants\u2019 use of force.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">First, Mr. Park urges us to account for the fact that he \u201cposed no obstacle to the execution of the search warrant\u201d when Defendants took him \u201cto the ground.\u201d Aplt.\u2019s Opening Br. at 53. Defendants, however, resorted to force because Mr. Park <em>physically resisted their arrest, </em>not because he impeded their execution of the search warrant. Next, Mr. Park says that our analysis here must consider his \u201cspecial characteristics\u201d that \u201cma[de] him more susceptible to harm from this particular use of force,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 53-54 (quoting <em>Aldaba I, </em>777 F.3d at 1156)\u2014namely, his difficulties with English, his age, and his physical stature. However, these factors did not justify Mr. Park\u2019s physical resistance to his arrest and that resistance precipitated Defendants\u2019 use of force. We have no doubt that this use of force was reasonable. And, under the circumstances of this case, Mr. Park\u2019s invocation of additional variables does not undercut that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Mr. Park has failed to demonstrate a violation of his Fourth Amendment right to be free from excessive force. Therefore, we conclude that Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on Mr. Park\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim of excessive force, and affirm the district court\u2019s judgment in this respect too.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">Next, we address Mr. Park\u2019s argument that the district court improperly granted summary judgmenton the basis of qualified immunity\u2014to Officer Gaitan on Mr. Park\u2019s First Amendment claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\">In reviewing the district court\u2019s judgment in the First Amendment context, we take care \u201cto make an independent examination of the whole record in order to make sure that the judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression.\u201d <em>Brammer-Hoelter v. Twin Peaks Charter Acad., </em>492 F.3d 1192, 1201 (10th Cir. 2007) (quoting <em>Citizens for Peace in Space v. City of Colo. Springs, 477 </em>F.3d 1212, 1219 (10th Cir. 2007)). Nonetheless, Mr. Park must still overcome both prongs of the qualified-immunity analysis. Because we conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>Mr. Park has failed to demonstrate that Officer Gaitan violated his clearly established First Amendment rights, we determine that the district court correctly granted summary judgment on qualified-immunity grounds.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">More specifically, Mr. Park has not cited any controlling authority that would have put \u201cevery reasonable official\u201d in Officer Gaitan\u2019s position on notice in November 2010 that he would be violating Mr. Park\u2019s First Amendment rights if he seized and retained video footage, and the equipment storing it, pursuant to a valid search warrant. <em>Mullenix, </em>136 S.Ct. at 308 (quoting <em>Reichle v. Howards, </em>566 U.S. 658, \u2014, 132 S.Ct. 2088, 2093, 182 L.Ed.2d 985 (2012)); <em>see id. </em>(noting that the plaintiff must demonstrate that \u201cthe violative nature of [the] <em>particular </em>conduct is clearly established\u201d (quoting <em>al-Kidd, </em>563 U.S. at 742, 131 S.Ct. 2074)); <em>accord Aldaba II, </em>844 F.3d at 877; <em>see also Quinn, </em>780 F.3d at 1005 (\u201cA plaintiff may satisfy [the clearly established law] standard by identifying an on-point Supreme Court or published Tenth Circuit decision; <em>alternatively, </em>\u2018the clearly established weight of authority from other courts must have found the law to be as the plaintiff maintains.\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Weise v. Casper, </em>593 F.3d 1163, 1167 (10th Cir. 2010))). Consequently, Mr. Park has failed to carry his burden of demonstrating that Officer Gaitan\u2019s conduct violated his clearly established First Amendment rights.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">Mr. Park does cite some Supreme Court cases, as well as one Tenth Circuit case, in an effort to carry his burden. But they <em>all </em>focus on officials\u2019 ability to limit speech deemed to be obscene, <em>not </em>on an officer\u2019s ability to inspect and seize video-related materials from a third-party for purposes of a criminal investigation, as we confront here. <em>See Fort Wayne Books, Inc. v. Indiana, </em>489 U.S. 46, 57, 109 S.Ct. 916, 103 L.Ed.2d 34 (1989) (determining whether \u201cthe Constitution forbids the use of obscenity violations as predicate acts for a RICO conviction [under state law]\u201d); <em>See Promotions, Ltd. v. Conrad, </em>420 U.S. 546, 547, 95 S.Ct. 1239, 43 L.Ed.2d 448 (1975) (addressing \u201cwhether First Amendment rights were abridged when respondents denied petitioner the use of a municipal facility ... for the showing of the controversial rock musical \u2018Hair\u2019 \u201d based on their understanding that \u201cthe musical ... involved nudity and obscenity on stage\u201d); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number><em>Roaden v. Kentucky, </em>413 U.S. 496, 497, 93 S.Ct. 2796, 37 L.Ed.2d 757 (1973) (\u201cThe question presented in this ease is whether the seizure of allegedly obscene material, contemporaneous with and as an incident to an arrest for the public exhibition of such material in a commercial theater, may be accomplished without a warrant.\u201d); <em>Heller v. New York, </em>413 U.S. 483, 484, 93 S.Ct. 2789, 37 L.Ed.2d 745 (1973) (addressing \u201cwhether a judicial officer ..., who has viewed a film and finds it to be obscene, can issue a constitutionally valid warrant for the film\u2019s seizure as evidence in a prosecution against the exhibitor, without first conducting an adversary hearing on the issue of probable obscenity\u201d); <em>Camfield v. City of Okla. City, </em>248 F.3d 1214, 1218 (10th Cir. 2001) (addressing the constitutionality of authorities\u2019 seizure of a film that they believed contained child pornography). Thus, Mr. Park has provided no Supreme Court or Tenth Circuit authority that <em>\u201csquarely governs </em>the case here,\u201d <em>Mullenix, </em>136 S.Ct. at 309 (quoting <em>Brosseau, </em>543 U.S. at 201, 125 S.Ct. 596).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">Nor has Mr. Park made a permissible alternative clearly established law showing by demonstrating that the clear weight of authority from our sister circuits favors his <em>specific </em>legal position. <em>See Quinn, </em>780 F.3d at 1005. Rather, he cites cases that generally discuss citizens\u2019 First Amendment rights to record law enforcement officers\u2019 activities without fear of arrest or prosecution, <em>not </em>the <em>specific </em>kind of conduct at issue here. For example, in <em>Glik v. Cunniffe, </em>which Mr. Park cites, officers arrested the plaintiff for violating a state wiretap statute after recording officers without their consent. 655 F.3d 78, 79-80 (1st Cir. 2011). The First Circuit held that the recording constituted protected First Amendment activity, because citizens have \u201ca constitutionally protected right to videotape police carrying out their duties in public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 82 (answering the \u201cfairly narrow\u201d constitutional question \u201cunambiguously in the affirmative\u201d). Thus, <em>Glik </em>makes clear to officers that arresting a person <em>based on his recording of them </em>violates that person\u2019s First Amendment rights under certain circumstances, but <em>Glik </em>offers little, if any, guidance to every reasonable officer in Defendants\u2019 position regarding when his seizure and retention of video recordings and the equipment housing them, pursuant to a valid search warrant, would run afoul of a person\u2019s First Amendment rights. The other cases from other circuits that Mr. Park identifies similarly stand on a distant shore from this case; they are factually distinct to say the least. <em>See Am. Civil Liberties Union of Ill. v. Alvarez, </em>679 F.3d 583 (7th Cir. 2012); <em>Jean v. Mass. State Police, </em>492 F.3d 24 (1st Cir. 2007); <em>Smith v. City of Cumming, </em>212 F.3d 1332 (11th Cir. 2000); <em>Fordyce v. City of Seattle, </em>55 F.3d 436 (9th Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Mr. Park has failed to demonstrate that Officer Gaitan violated his clearly established First Amendment rights; consequently, Officer Gaitan is entitled to qualified immunity on Mr. Park\u2019s First Amendment claims. We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">We now turn our attention to Mr. Park\u2019s state-law claims for false imprisonment, false arrest, assault and battery. The district court granted summary judgment to Defendants on all four claims; Mr. Park argues on appeal that the court erred as to each. \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, using the same standards applied by the district court.\u201d <em>Fuerschbach v. Sw. Airlines Co., </em>439 F.3d 1197, 1207 (10th Cir. 2006) (quoting <em>Baca v. Sklar, </em>398 F.3d 1210, 1216 (10th Cir. 2005)). \u201cThe court shall grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). As explained below, contrary to the district court, we conclude that Defendants are not entitled to summary judgment on Mr. Park\u2019s false imprisonment and false arrest claims, but we agree with the court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in Defendants\u2019 favor regarding Mr. Park\u2019s assault and battery claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">Beginning with the first two claims, we have previously explained that \u201c[u]nder New Mexico law, \u2018false imprisonment consists of intentionally confining or restraining another person without his consent and with knowledge that he has no lawful authority to do so.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fuerschbach, </em>439 F.3d at 1207 (quoting <em>Romero v. Sanchez, </em>119 N.M. 690, 895 P.2d 212, 215 (1995)). False arrest, a closely related claim, \u201coccurs when the \u2018facts available to [a] detaining officer would [not] warrant [a] person of reasonable caution to believe detention appropriate.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alterations in original) (quoting <em>Sanchez, </em>895 P.2d at 215). Additionally, \u201c[a] defendant possessed of a good faith and reasonable belief in the lawfulness of the action is not liable for false imprisonment or false arrest\u201d; <em>such a defense \u201cordinarily requires a shomng. of probable cause.\u201d Id. </em>at 1207-08 (emphasis added) (citing <em>State v. Johnson, </em>122 N.M. 696, 930 P.2d 1148, 1154 (1996); <em>Perea v. Stout, </em>94 N.M. 595, 613, 613 P.2d 1034 (1980)). Because the district court concluded in its analysis of Mr. Park\u2019s unlawful seizure claim that Defendants had probable cause for Mi\u2019. Park\u2019s arrest, it accordingly found that they had a good-faith defense to Mr. Park\u2019s false imprisonment and false arrest claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">On appeal, Mr. Park argues that the district court erred in finding that Defendants had probable cause for purposes of these state-law claims, just as the court erred in reaching a like conclusion for purposes of the Fourth Amendment unlawful seizure claim. Defendants, in turn, rely on their earlier argument that they had probable cause to detain and arrest Mr. Park because they reasonably believed he had unlawfully resisted an officer under Section 30-22-1(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">We reject Defendants\u2019 argument here for essentially the same reasons we rejected like contentions <em>supra </em>regarding Mr. Park\u2019s Fourth Amendment unlawful seizure claim. As we indicated there, Defendants did not have probable cause to arrest Mr. Park for violating Section 30-22-1(A) of the resisting statute. We will not repeat that probable-cause analysis here. Suffice it to say, that it follows ineluctably from that analysis that any good-faith defense as to these claims would fail. We accordingly reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Defendants on these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">Turning to Mr. Park\u2019s assault and battery claims, we agree with the district court that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment. Under New Mexico law, \u201c[f]or there to be an assault, there must have been an \u2018act, threat or menacing conduct which causes another person to reasonably believe that he is in danger of receiving an immediate battery.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fuerschbach, </em>439 F.3d at 1208 (quoting N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 30-3-1 (B)). \u201cBattery , occurs when an individual \u2018acts intending to cause a harmful or offensive contact with the person of the other or a third person, or an imminent apprehension of such a contact, and ... an offensive contact with the person of the other directly or indirectly results.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1208-09 (omission in original) (quoting <em>State v. Ortega, </em>113 N.M. 437, 827 P.2d 152, 155 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">The district court, relying on an unpublished decision from our court, noted that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>law enforcement officer can be held liable for assault and battery only when the officer \u201cuses more than necessary force to restrain a person.\u201d Aplt.\u2019s App. at 341 (citing <em>Reynaga v. Cty. of Bernalillo, </em>64 F.3d 670 (10th Cir. 1995) (unpublished table decision)). Because the district court concluded in its Fourth Amendment analysis that Defendants did not employ unconstitutionally excessive force in effectuating Mr. Park\u2019s arrest, the district court found (guided by <em>Reynaga) </em>that they could not be liable for assault and battery under New Mexico law.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion and, in this regard, note that we are persuaded by the panel\u2019s reasoning in <em>Reynaga. See, e.g., </em>10th Cir. R. 32.1(A) (\u201cUnpublished decisions are not prece-dential, but may be cited for their persuasive value.\u201d); <em>United States v. Scott, </em>529 F.3d 1290, 1299 n.9 (10th Cir. 2008) (same). Its holding appears to have accurately captured the import of New Mexico law. <em>See State v. Gonzales, </em>97 N.M. 607, 642 P.2d 210, 213 (Ct. App. 1982) (\u201cOfficers, within reasonable limits, are the judges of the force necessary to enable them to make arrests.... When acting in good faith, the courts will afford them the utmost protection, and they will recognize the fact that emergencies arise [in the course of an arrest].\u201d) (quoting <em>Mead v. O\u2019Connor, </em>66 N.M. 170, 344 P.2d 478 (1959)); <em>State v. Kraul, </em>90 N.M. 314, 563 P.2d 108, 112-13 (Ct. App. 1977) (noting that officers are entitled to use force necessary to effectuate an arrest, even an unlawful one).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">As noted above in our excessive-force analysis, even construing the facts in Mr. Park\u2019s favor, we cannot conclude that Defendants used more force than reasonably necessary to effectuate Mr. Park\u2019s arrest. Now, guided by <em>Reynaga </em>and related New Mexico authorities, we conclude that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on Mr. Park\u2019s assault and battery claims. <em>See Reynaga, </em>64 F.3d 670, at *2 (applying New Mexico law and noting that an officer may not be held hable in connection with the use of \u201creasonable force\u201d to effect an arrest). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Defendants on Mr. Park\u2019s assault and battery claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">IY</p>\n<p id=\"b768-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment as to (1) Mr. Park\u2019s Fourth Amendment claims of unlawful seizure and excessive force; (2) his First Amendment claims; and (3) his state-law claims for assault and battery. However, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s judgment as to Mr. Park\u2019s state-law claims for false imprisonment and false arrest, and REMAND the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this order and judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b750-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.

Because we review summary-judgment determinations de novo, \"we need not separately address [Mr. Park's] argument that the district court erred by viewing evidence in the light most favorable to [Defendants].\u201d <em>Rivera v. City and Cty. of Denver, </em>365 F.3d 912, 920 (10th Cir. 2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b756-8\">. It is undisputed for purposes of this appeal that Defendants seized Mr. Park within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment when Officer Gaitan and Officer Dykes removed him from his seat.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b756-9\">. The narrow focus of our inquiry makes this case distinguishable from cases like <em>Denver Justice </em>&amp; <em>Peace Committee, Inc. v. City of Golden, </em>405 F.3d 923 (10th Cir. 2005), which Mr. Park cites, which concerned officers\u2019 authority to conduct a ' 'suspicionless pat-down frisk\u201d of persons \"present during the execution of a search warrant,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 927, 932, which implicated a question of the existence of \"reasonable, individualized suspicion\u201d for the detention, <em>id. </em>at 932, not (as here) the existence of probable cause for an arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b757-7\">. <em>Archuleta </em>is an unpublished memorandum opinion of the New Mexico Court of Appeals. Although such opinions have \u201cno precedential value,\u201d <em>Gormley v. Coca-Cola Enters., </em>135 N.M. 128, 85 P.3d 252, 255 (Ct. App. 2003); <em>accord </em>N.M. R. App. P. 12-405(A) (explaining the limitations of \u201c[n]on-precedential dispositions\u201d by memorandum opinion), they may be cited in New Mexico courts \"for any persuasive value,\" N.M. R. App. P. 12-405(A). Applying these principles, we find <em>Archuleta </em>persuasive to the extent it recognizes the <em>Diaz </em>holding, which is equally reflected in our own precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b757-12\">. \"Section 10-48(a)(2) prohibits obstructing an officer, which it defines as '[rjesisting, obstructing or abusing any .,. peace officer in the lawful discharge of his duties.'\u201d <em>Smith, </em>133 P.3d at 272.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b759-4\">. Even if we could properly accept the idea (which we cannot) that Officer Gaitan issued an order, demanding that Mr. Park provide him with access to the video recording, Defendants have not demonstrated that they could prevail. Specifically, the relevant case-law discussed <em>supra </em>does not proscribe failure to follow just <em>any </em>order from a police officer; rather, the order must be a <em>lawful </em>one. <em>See, e.g., Diaz, </em>908 P.2d at 259-62; <em>Smith, </em>133 P.3d at 272-73; <em>Storey, </em>696 F.3d at 994; <em>Romero, </em>672 F.3d at 889. Applying these principles here, Defendants provide no support for the notion that Officer Gaitan\u2019s purported order was lawful or that, consequently, Mr. Parle was legally obliged to facilitate Defendants\u2019 access to the video recording and other items identified in the search warrant. Indeed, the search warrant possessed by Officer Gaitan imposed <em>no </em>obligations on the property owner. <em>Cf. Boydston, </em>224 Fed.Appx. at 815 (addressing a statute that imposed an affirmative obligation on auto dealers to provide the police officers upon request with access to temporary tag records). To the contrary, the search warrant \u201cCOMMANDED\u201d <em>Officer Gai-tan </em>to \"serv[e] [the] warrant and [a] copy of the\u201d supporting affidavit, \"to search ... the business ... for the [video tape],\u201d and \"to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>seize it.\u201d Aplt.\u2019s App. at 116. In this regard, New Mexico Rule 5-211\u2014which \"codifies the procedural requirements for issuance and execution of a search warrant in New Mexico,\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Malloy, </em>131 N.M. 222, 34 P.3d 611, 614 (Ct. App. 2001), imposed on <em>Officer Gai-tan </em>the obligation to show Mr. Park the search warrant <em>and </em>affidavit to provide him with adequate \"assurance and notice during the search,\u201d <em>State v. Boyse, </em>303 P.3d 830, 835 (N.M. 2013) (quoting <em>Malloy, </em>34 P.3d at 614). However, the videotape clearly indicates that Officer Gaitan failed to furnish the search warrant and affidavit to Mr. Park prior to his arrest (irrespective of whether, as Officer Gai-tan maintains, he actually showed the search warrant to Mr. Park), and Officer Gaitan has not testified to the contrary, <em>see </em>Aplt.\u2019s App. at 67. Therefore, even under a set of facts <em>more favorable </em>to Defendants\u2014where Officer Gai-tan issued an order to Mr. Park to assist Defendants in retrieving the surveillance video pursuant to a lawful search warrant\u2014Defendants have not demonstrated that they could prevail; that is, they have not shown that they possessed probable cause to arrest Mr. Park under Section 30-22-1(A) for failure to comply with a <em>lawful </em>order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b765-6\">. Mr. Park bases his First Amendment claim on theories of retaliation and prior-restraint. <em>See Brammer-Hoelter, </em>492 F.3d at 1202 (explaining the \"distinct\u2019\u2019 nature of claims brought under retaliation and prior-restraint theories). Mr. Park first claims that Officer Gaitan retaliated against him by returning to his business and arresting him, after Mr. Park initially declined to provide him with the video footage. Mr. Park then bases his prior-restraint claim on three distinct sets of facts: (1) the censorship of his video recordings, while his video equipment was retained by the APD (and inaccessible to Mr. Park), (2) the chilling effect on his future recording activity caused by the seizure of the video recorder, and (3) the chilling effect on his future recording activity caused by Officer Gaitan\u2019s alleged threat that Mr. Park would go to jail if he did not hand over his video recorder during the parties\u2019 initial encounter. Because Mr. Park fails to demonstrate that the underlying factual circumstances here support <em>any </em>First Amendment claim under clearly established law, we need not conduct a separate analysis as to his retaliation and prior-restraint theories.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b765-10\">. The district court did not rest its decision on the second prong of the qualified-immunity standard (i.e., the clearly established law prong), and Officer Gaitan does not pursue an argument along this line in his briefing, but \"we may affirm on any basis supported by the record, even if it requires ruling on arguments not reached by the district court or even presented to us on appeal.\u2019\u2019 <em>Richison v. Ernest Grp., Inc., </em>634 F.3d 1123, 1130 (10th Cir. 2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
