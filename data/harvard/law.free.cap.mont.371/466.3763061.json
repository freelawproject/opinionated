Section 49-2-304, MCA (the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>Public Accommodation Provision), makes it unlawful for a place of public accommodation to deny to a person its \u201cservices, goods, facilities, advantages, or privileges\u201dbecause of a person\u2019s sex. Section 49-2-305, MCA (the Real-Estate Transaction Provision), makes it unlawful for an owner, lessor, or manager of a \u2018housing accommodation or improved or unimproved property\u201d to discriminate in the use, sale, lease, or rental of the property because of a person\u2019s sex. In her complaint to the Human Rights Commission (the Commission), Neva alleged violation of the Public Accommodations Provision but made no mention of the Real-Estate Transaction Provision. The Commission nevertheless found that Bates violated the Real-Estate Transaction Provision by sexually harassing Neva while she was leasing commercial space from him. The District Court reversed that decision, holding that the Commission\u2019s action violated Bates\u2019s right to due process. We reverse, and address the issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">\u00b62 <em>Did the District Court err by concluding due process principles prohibited the Commission from ruling that Bates violated \u00a749-2-305, MCA, when Neva only specified a violation of \u00a749-2-304, MCA, in her pleadings?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">\u00b63 During June 2009, Neva agreed to rent from Bates a commercial building she hoped to turn into an art gallery. The building was not immediately tenantable, however. Its roof leaked and other repairs were needed before it was suitable for customers and safe to display artwork. Bates and Neva came to an agreement: Bates would pay for materials and make the repairs; in return, Neva would help with repairs, would not pay rent until the repairs were complete, and would receive a month\u2019s free rent once the building was ready to open for business. While they worked together during July 2009 to make the premises tenantable, the repairs were still unfinished months later, and Neva vacated the building without ever having paid rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">\u00b64 On January 21, 2010, Neva filed a handwritten complaint with the Commission entitled \u2018Sexual Harassment by Landlord.\u201d Neva alleged Bates sexually harassed her in person, over the telephone, and by email. Two weeks later, Neva filed an amended complaint, alleging that Bates was her landlord and that he had stopped making necessary repairs to the building when she rebuked his sexual advances, and, as a result, she was forced to find an alternative location. Neva claimed that Bates\u2019s conduct violated the Public Accommodation Provision of the Act. Neither the complaint nor the amended complaint mentioned the Real-Estate Transaction Provision. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Bates answered, denying the allegations of sexual harassment and arguing that Neva was never his tenant. In subsequent briefing, Neva and Bates argued over whether Neva was a tenant. Neva alleged that as a tenant she had the right to be free from discrimination from her landlord. Bates argued that no tenancy existed because he and Neva had never agreed to specific terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">\u00b65 On August 29 and 30, 2011, a contested-case hearing was conducted by a hearing officer. Neva and Bates testified. Neva described numerous instances of inappropriate conduct by Bates that made it uncomfortable for her to be in the building. Bates would routinely stand unnecessarily close to Neva while she was working. Once Bates grabbed her right breast to \u201cget her attention.\u201d He told her once that there was a \u201cproblem\u201d because he \u201cdidn\u2019t know what color underwear [she] was wearing.\u201d Another time, while Neva was on her hands and knees planting flowers, Bates approached her holding a strawberry in front of his crotch, telling Neva to \u201copen up and eat this.\u201d On another occasion when Neva was working on her knees, Bates made a comment about Monica Lewinsky. When Neva was using a power blower to clear debris from the roof, Bates told her \u201cwhat a nice blow job\u201d she was doing. Neva said that Bates would telephone to tell her that he was \u2018baked\u201d and getting in the shower and \u2018just wanted to give [her] some food for thought.\u201d The hearing examiner also admitted six emails Bates sent Neva over a two-day period in July 2009. In part, the emails discussed upcoming plans for repairs, but they also contained explicit sexual comments. Neva testified she never gave Bates reason to think his advances were welcome, but that she was careful not to upset him because she had yet to receive a written lease and was afraid he would renege on their verbal agreement. When she finally told Bates that he was \u2018bothing but a landlord\u201d to her, he stopped making repairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">\u00b66 Bates explained that he had never prepared a written lease for Neva because rent was not due until the repairs were completed, but testified to aspects of a tenancy relationship between them. Bates conceded he convinced Neva to rent the building instead of purchasing because of the disrepair, and because he felt it would be unwise for Neva, a new business owner, to incur so much debt. According to Bates, he did not withhold repairs because Neva rebuffed his advances; rather, he was unable to continue repairs because Neva installed a security system and refused him access to the building. Bates admitted to sending the emails to Neva and explained that he continued to send them even after she did not respond because he took her silence to mean she was not offended. Bates could not recall whether he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>commented on Neva\u2019s underwear, but said it would not surprise him because that was the type of \u201cwisecracks\u201d he routinely made.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">\u00b67 The hearing officer determined that Bates had sexually harassed Neva, and described Bates\u2019s conduct as \u201csevere,\u201d \u201cpersistent,\u201d and \u201cpatently unwelcome.\u201d He found that Bates discontinued making repairs because Neva rejected his advances and refused to grant him \u201cunfettered access to the premises.\u201d However, the hearing officer concluded that Bates\u2019s conduct did not violate the Public Accommodations Provision because Bates\u2019s building was private property not open to the public. Without citing the Real-Estate Transaction Provision, the hearings officer concluded that the Act only prohibited discrimination in housing leases, not commercial leases: \u2018The [Act] does not address illegal discrimination in commercial, as opposed to housing, leases between private individuals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">\u00b68 Neva appealed to the Commission, arguing the hearing officer had erred by concluding the Act did not prohibit discrimination in commercial-lease settings. The Commission agreed with Neva, reasoning that the term \u2018Improved or unimproved property\u201d in the Real-Estate Transaction Provision broadly applied to \u201call types of real estate,\u201d including commercial property. The Commission reversed the hearing officer\u2019s dismissal and remanded the case to the hearing officer with leave to take additional evidence as necessary to \u201cdetermine an appropriate damage award.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">\u00b69 Bates petitioned the District Court for judicial review of the Commission\u2019s decision. He argued that the Commission erred by (1) analyzing Neva\u2019s discrimination claim under the Real-Estate Transaction Provision, and (2) concluding the Act applied to commercial leases. Concurring with Bates\u2019s first argument, the District Court vacated the Commission\u2019s decision and reinstated the hearings officer\u2019s dismissal of Neva\u2019s complaint. The District Court reasoned that while Bates may have violated the Real-Estate Transaction Provision, \u00a7 49-2-305, MCA, Neva never alleged such discrimination. The District Court concluded that allowing Neva to recover under a statute she never cited would violate Bates\u2019s due process rights:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-7\">While the Commission determined that the Department had jurisdiction over Neva\u2019s Complaint under \u00a749-2-305, MCA, Neva pled and argued her claim under \u00a749-2-304, MCA. It is not the province of the Commission or this Court to re-characterize a specific claim brought under a specific statute on behalf of a complainant. Because Neva never requested relief under \u00a749-2-305, MCA, it would be a violation of Bates\u2019 due process rights to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>allow her to recover on this basis on remand. Notwithstanding Neva\u2019s argument that Bates was on notice of a possible claim under \u00a7 49-2-305, MCA, it is not Bates\u2019 responsibility to guess what is or might be the appropriate statutory claim providing Neva the opportunity for relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Thus, the District Court did not reach the issue of whether the Act applied to commercial leases. Neva appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">\u00b610 We review an agency\u2019s findings of fact to determine if they are clearly erroneous. Section 2-4-704(2)(a)(v), MCA; Owens <em>v. Mont. Dept. of Revenue, </em>2007 MT 298, \u00b6 12, 340 Mont. 48, 172 P.3d 1227. We review an agency\u2019s conclusions of law to determine if they are correct. Section 2-4-704(2)(a)(iv), MCA; <em>Owens, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">\u00b611 The Act prohibits discrimination \u201con the basis of race, creed, religion, color, sex, physical or mental disability, age or national origin\u201d in certain enumerated settings. <em>Arthur v. Pierre Ltd., </em>2004 MT 303, \u00b6 16, 323 Mont. 453, 100 P.3d 987; <em>see </em>\u00a749-2-303, MCA through 49-2-310, MCA. Two of those settings are relevant here: places of public accommodation and real-estate transactions. The Public Accommodation Provision provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-9\">[I]t is an unlawful discriminatory practice for the owner, lessee, manager, agent, or employee of a public accommodation:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-10\">(a) to refuse, withhold from, or deny to a person any of its services, goods, facilities, advantages or privileges because of sex[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">Section 49-2-304(l)(a), MCA. The Real-Estate Transaction Provision provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-12\">It is an unlawful discriminatory practice for the owner, lessor, or manager having the right to sell, lease, or rent a housing accommodation or improved or unimproved property or for any other person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-13\">(b) to discriminate against a person because of sex... in a term, condition, or privilege relating to the use, sale, lease or rental of the housing accommodation or property[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-14\">Section 49-2-305(l)(b), MCA. Sexual harassment is a form of sexual discrimination because it constitutes discrimination on the basis of the victim\u2019s sex. <em>See Harrison v. Chance, </em>244 Mont. 215, 220-21, 797 P.2d 200, 203-04 (1990) (holding \u201csexual harassment is sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>discrimination under the Montana Human Rights Act.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">\u00b612 <em>Did the District Court err by concluding due process principles prohibited the Commission from ruling that Bates violated \u00a749-2-305, MCA, when Neva only specified a violation of \u00a749-2-304, MCA, in her pleadings?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">\u00b613 The District Court concluded, without citation, that \u201c[bjecause Neva never requested relief under \u00a749-2-305, MCA [the Real-Estate Transaction Provision], it would be a violation of Bates\u2019s due process rights to allow her to recover on this basis on remand.\u201d Neva asserts error because her claim has always been that Bates, as her landlord, sexually harassed her and retaliated against her by halting building repairs when she refused his advances. She argues that, from the beginning, \u2018Bates was aware of and has had a full opportunity to defend himself against each of Neva\u2019s claims.\u201d Bates counters that he \u201cdid not have notice of [a \u00a749-2-305, MCA] claim and did not have the opportunity to defend that claim. ...\u2019\u2019because Ta]ll pleadings and other filings submitted by Neva in connection with the contested hearing phase of this litigation alleged discrimination in the area of public accommodation only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">\u00b614 Both the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, \u00a7 17 of the Montana Constitution provide that no person shall be deprived of property \u201cwithout due process of the law.\u2019Tt is axiomatic that \u201c\u2018due process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019State v. West, </em>2008 MT 338, \u00b6 32, 346 Mont. 244, 194 P.3d 683 (original brackets omitted) (quoting <em>Morrissey v. Brewer, </em>408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S. Ct. 2593, 1600 (1972)). \u2018Indeed, \u2018the very nature of due process negates any concept of inflexible procedures universally applicable to every imaginable situation.\u2019 \u201d <em>West, </em>\u00b6 32 (original brackets omitted) (quoting <em>Cafeteria &amp; Restaurant Workers Union v. McElroy, </em>367 U.S. 886, 895, 81 S. Ct. 1743, 1748 (1961)). \u2018Rather, \u2018 \u201casserted denial of due process of law is to be tested by an appraisal of the totality of facts in a given case. That which may, in one setting, constitute a denial of fundamental fairness, shocking to the universal sense of justice, may, in other circumstances, and in the light of other considerations, fall short of such denial.\u2019 \u201d\u201d <em>West, </em>\u00b6 32 (original brackets omitted) (quoting <em>County of Sacramento v.

Ct. 1252, 1256 (1942)).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">\u00b615 Consistent with this description of due process as \u201cflexible,\u201d we have, on occasion, permitted the resolution of issues not specifically raised in a civil complaint. While it is \u201cgenerally accepted\u201d that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>plaintiff \u201ccannot recover beyond the case stated by him in his complaint[,]\u201d <em>Gallatin Trust &amp; Sav. Bank v. Darrah, </em>152 Mont. 256, 261, 448 P.2d 734, 737 (1968), Rule 15(b) of the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure provides that an issue not explicitly pleaded but nonetheless \u201ctried by the parties\u2019 express or implied consent\u201dis to be \u201ctreated in all respects as if raised in the pleadings.\u201d <em>Reilly v. Maw, </em>146 Mont. 145, 154-55, 405 P.2d 440, 446 (1965) (quoting Rule 15(b)) (affirming district court\u2019s finding of oral contract even though the \u201cexistence of an oral contract is not claimed in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint\u201d); see <em>also McJunkin v. Kaufman &amp; Broad Home Systems, Inc., </em>229 Mont. 432, 437, 748 P.2d 910, 913 (1987) (\u2018Under Rule 15(b), M.R.Civ.P., when issues not raised by the pleadings or amended by the pretrial order <em>are tried by the express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated as if raised in the pleading.\u201d) </em>(emphasis added). Rule 15(b) is carefully cabined, so to avoid \u201cquestion[s] of due process,\u201d to the uncommon situation when an issue not pled is tried by the \u201cparties\u2019 express or implied consent.\u201d <em>Brothers v. Surplus Tractor Parts Corp., </em>161 Mont. 412, 418, 506 P.2d 1362, 1365 (1973). In order to find that an issue was litigated by \u2018implied consent,\u201d the other party must be \u201cput on notice that [the] issue was being raised[,]\u201d <em>Gallatin Trust &amp; Sav. Bank, </em>152 Mont. at 261, 448 P.2d at 737, and the parties must have \u201cactually tried\u201d the issue. <em>Reilly, </em>146 Mont. at 154, 405 P.2d at 446 (concluding that the parties \u201cactually tried\u201d unpleaded issue of the existence of an oral contract because \u201c[virtually every witness called, whether by plaintiffs or the defendants gave testimony about an agreement between the plaintiffs and defendant....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">\u00b616 These principles also apply in administrative proceedings. <em>See e.g. Golden Grain Macaroni Co. v. F.T.C., </em>472 F.2d 882 (9th Cir. 1972). Whether a party\u2019s due process rights have been violated by an administrative agency granting relief not specifically pleaded in an administrative complaint depends upon the specific facts of each case. <em>Golden Grain Macaroni, </em>472 F.2d at 885-86. \u2018[T]here is no due-process violation, if the party proceeded against \u2018understood the issue\u2019 and \u2018was afforded full opportunity\u2019 to justify its conduct.\u201d <em>Golden Grain Macaroni, </em>472 F.2d at 885-86 (quoting <em>NLRB v. Mackay Radio &amp; Telegraph Co., </em>304 U.S. 333, 350, 58 S. Ct. 904 (1938)). Conversely, if an issue was not fully litigated, and the \u201cparty proceeded against was not given an opportunity to defend himself, an adverse finding on that issue by the agency does violate due process.\u201d <em>Golden Grain Macaroni, </em>472 F.2d at 886 (collecting cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">\u00b617 In <em>Golden Grain Macaroni, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>the Ninth Circuit upheld, against a due process challenge, an administrative ruling that Golden Grain Macaroni Company had violated the Clayton Act, even though the administrative complaint alleged only a violation of the Sherman Act. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) instituted divestiture proceedings against Golden Grain, \u201cthe largest seller of dry-past[a] food products in the Pacific Northwest,\u201d for its unlawful acquisition of three other macaroni producers. <em>Golden Grain Macaroni, </em>472 F.2d at 884. The FTC\u2019s complaint alleged that Golden Grain violated \u00a72 of the Sherman Act by monopolizing or attempting to monopolize the market in the region. The complaint made Tn]o mention of Section 7 of the Clayton Act....\u201d <em>Golden Grain Macaroni, </em>472 F.2d at 884. Before the hearing examiner, both parties argued the \u201csole issue\u201d of monopolization. <em>Golden Grain Macaroni, </em>472 F.2d at 885. The hearing examiner determined that Golden Grain had not violated \u00a72 of the Sherman Act, but that it had nonetheless violated \u00a7 7 of the Clayton Act, which prohibited \u201cacquisitions the effect of which \u2018may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.\u2019\u201d <em>Golden Grain Macaroni, </em>472 F.2d at 885 (quoting \u00a77 of Clayton Act codified at 15 U.S.C. \u00a718). The FTC affirmed the hearing examiner\u2019s order, and Golden Grain petitioned for judicial review, arguing that its right to due process had been violated. <em>Golden Grain Macaroni, </em>472 F.2d at 884-85. The Ninth Circuit Court disagreed, holding that although the complaint was lacking, there was no due-process violation because both \u00a7 2 of the Sherman Act and \u00a7 7 of the Clayton Act dealt with impermissible monopolization, the facts of which the parties had \u2018fully litigated\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-4\">In the present case the initial complaint, while hardly a model of clarity, <em>put Golden Grain on notice </em>that the specific practices as well as the alleged over-all scheme of monopolization were being challenged. Moreover, an examination of the proceedings subsequent to the complaint demonstrates that while there was some confusion as to the nature of the charge, <em>all facts relevant to the alleged unlawful acts were fully litigated. </em>Actual litigation is often referred to in support of a holding that a party was not prejudiced by initially inadequate pleadings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-5\"><em>Golden Grain Macaroni, </em>472 F.2d at 886 (emphasis added). The court noted that Golden Grain was unable to point to evidence that was absent from the hearing record that it would have developed had it known of the additional charge under \u00a77 of Clayton Act. <em>Golden Grain Macaroni, </em>472 F.2d at 886-87 (\u201cif an evidentiary stone was left unturned on the central issues it has not been brought to our attention.\u201d). In sum, the court concluded that Golden Grain had notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>of the issue and was afforded an opportunity to defend where, despite differences between the Sherman Act and Clayton Act, the same facts were pertinent to both theories.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">\u00b618 In <em>Mackay Radio &amp; Telegraph, </em>304 U.S. at 349-51, 58 S. Ct. at 912-13, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a due process challenge to an administrative decision that ventured beyond the complaint. There, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) alleged a telecommunications company had violated the National Labor Relations Act by refusing to <em>re-employ </em>telegraph operators who had attempted to return to their jobs following a failed strike. <em>Mackay Radio &amp; Telegraph, </em>304 U.S. at 349, 58 S. Ct. at 912. However, the hearing officer determined that Mackay had violated the National Labor Relations Act by <em>wrongfully discharging </em>the telegraph operators byreplacing them with other workers. <em>Mackay Radio &amp; Telegraph, </em>304 U.S. at 349, 58 S. Ct. at 912. Mackay argued that this action violated due process because it was \u2018found guilty of an unfair labor practice which was not within the issues upon which the case was tried.\u201d <em>Mackay Radio &amp; Telegraph, </em>304 U.S. at 349, 58 S. Ct. at 912. The U.S. Supreme Court rejected Mackay\u2019s argument, describing it as \u2018highly technical.\u201d The Court reasoned that the record demonstrated that the parties understood the focus of the NLRB\u2019s complaint-Mackay\u2019s failure to give the telegraph operators their jobs back. <em>Mackay Radio &amp; Telegraph, </em>304 U.S. at 349, 58 S. Ct. at 912.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">\u00b619  The case here is strikingly similar to <em>Golden Grain Macaroni. </em>Although Neva\u2019s amended complaint could have been clearer in asserting a claim under \u00a749-2-305, MCA, the Real-Estate Transaction Provision, we hold it was sufficient to put Bates on notice of the nature of the claim Neva was bringing: that she rented commercial property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>from Bates who committed unlawful sexual harassment. In his briefing before the hearing officer, Bates framed one of the pertinent legal questions as: \u2018Is the relationship between a commercial building owner and a tenant or potential tenant subject to [the Act],\u201da reference to the applicability of the Real-Estate Transaction Provision. Further, the record reveals that Bates and Neva \u2018fully litigated\u201d the questions of the nature of their business relationship and whether Bates sexually harassed Neva. During the contested case hearing, both Neva and Bates testified at length about the lease agreement between them. Just as Golden Grain Macaroni was unable to point to evidence it would have developed had it been on notice it was being charged with a violation of \u00a77 of the Clayton Act, <em>Golden Grain Macaroni, </em>472 F.2d at 886-87, Bates has not brought to our attention any evidence that he would have developed had he known Neva was claiming a violation of the Real-Estate Transaction Provision. Rather, Bates\u2019s argument is akin to the \u2018highly technical\u201d difference between failure to re-employ and wrongful discharge argued by the telegraph company and rejected by the Court in <em>Mackay Radio &amp; Telegraph. </em>The essential difference between a \u00a749-2-304 claim and a \u00a749-2-305 claim is the setting of the discrimination-a place of public accommodation as opposed to a real-estate transaction. The setting here was fully litigated, as was the discrimination-Bates\u2019s sexual harassment of Neva. Bates \u201cunderstood the issue\u2019 and \u2018was afforded full opportunity\u2019 to justify [his] conduct.\u201d <em>Golden Grain Macaroni Co., </em>472 F.2d at 885-86 (quoting <em>NLRB v. Mackay Radio &amp; Telegraph Co., </em>304 U.S. at 350, 58 S. Ct. at 913). Therefore, Bates\u2019s due process rights were not violated.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Al8K\">\u00b620 As noted above, the District Court disposed of Neva\u2019s claim without addressing whether the Act applies to commercial leases. We reverse and remand this case to the District Court for further proceedings to analyze that question, in the first instance.</p>\n<judges id=\"b495-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, McKINNON and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b494-6\"> Other U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeal follow this framework. <em>See e.g. NLRB v. Blake Constr. Co., </em>663 F.2d 272, 283 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (\u2018Elemental due process prevents this court from granting enforcement of remedies that go beyond the scope of the complaint and are directed toward violations of the [National Labor Relations] Act <em>not noticed or actually tried </em>before the ALJ or the Board.\u2019) (emphasis added); <em>NLRB v. Local Union No. 25, </em>586 F.2d 959, 961 (2d Cir. 1978) (rejecting legal challenge to provision of National Labor Relations Act because its legality was \u201cnot raised in the amended complaint, in the briefs, or in oral argument, <em>and no evidence was presented concerning that issue.\u201d) </em>(emphasis added); <em>Bruhn\u2019s Freezer Meats of Chicago v. U.S. Dept. of Agric., </em>438 F.2d 1332, 1342 (8th Cir. 1971) (no due process violation where agency granted relief based on statute not alleged in complaint because the record showed that the issue was a \u2018live one\u2019); <em>J.B. Williams Co. v. F.T.C., </em>381 F.2d 884, 888 (6th Cir. 1967) (affirming relief on issue \u201cnot charged in the complaint\u201d because evidence of the issue was \u201cpresent throughout the record\u2019).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b495-5\"> Bates cites our line of authority that provides that courts are not to address issues raised for the first time on appeal or a change in legal theory. <em>See Day v. Payne, </em>280 Mont. 273, 276-77, 929 P.2d 864, 866 (1996); <em>Unified Ind., Inc. v. Easley, </em>1998 MT 145, \u00b6 15, 289 Mont. 255, 961 P.2d 100; <em>Gary &amp; Leo\u2019s Fresh Food, Inc. v. State, </em>2012 MT 219, \u00b6 16, 366 Mont. 313, 286 P.3d 317. This authority is unavailing because we have here determined that a new issue or legal theory is not being raised for the first time on appeal. Rather, the parties litigated Bates\u2019s sexual harassment of Neva and the setting of their commercial-lease agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
