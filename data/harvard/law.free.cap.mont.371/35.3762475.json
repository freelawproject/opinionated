We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">\u00b63 <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion in denying Champagne\u2019s for-cause challenge of a prospective juror?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-11\">\u00b64 <em>Whether Champagne\u2019s counsel provided ineffective assistance?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-12\">\u00b65 <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion in admitting the forensic interviewer\u2019s opinion testimony?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-13\">\u00b66 <em>Whether the District Court properly admitted J.B.\u2019s prior consistent statements?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-14\">\u00b67 <em>Whether the District Court imposed an illegal sentence?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-15\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AR\">\u00b68 J.B. stayed at her grandmother\u2019s house one night in 2010. Nobody remembers the exact date. J.B. was ten years old at the time. J.B.\u2019s grandmother, Ramona, previously had been married to Champagne. Champagne came to Ramona\u2019s house late that night. J.B. had known Champagne for most of her life. J.B. referred <em>to </em>him as Tapa.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-16\">\u00b69 J.B. was awakened the next morning by Champagne touching her inside her vagina. J.B. immediately told Ramona what had happened. Ramona asked Champagne about the incident. Champagne denied any inappropriate touching. Ramona told J.B. that Champagne probably just had given J.B. a hug. Ramona instructed J.B. not to tell her mother about the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>\u00b610 J.B. told her mother, Farrah Falcon (Falcon), about the incident several months later. Falcon alerted the police. The police initiated an investigation. J.B. talked with a forensic interviewer, Holly Matkin, about the incident. The State charged Champagne with felony sexual assault. The case proceeded to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">\u00b611 Prospective juror Pete Lamere (Lamere) replied during voir dire when asked by Champagne\u2019s counsel that he had \u201csome reservations\u201d about a defendant who did not testify. Lamere further admitted that he \u201cprobably\u201d would become suspicious if a defendant chose not to testify. Champagne challenged Lamere for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">\u00b612 The District Court instructed Lamere on the presumption of innocence, the State\u2019s burden of proof, a defendant\u2019s right not to testify, and the idea that a jury should not draw any negative inference from the defendant\u2019s election not to testify. The State questioned Lamere. Lamere agreed with the State that many reasons existed why a person would not want to testify that were unrelated to trying to hide something. Lamere agreed that he would follow the law and that he would not draw any negative inferences. The District Court denied Champagne\u2019s motion to remove Lamere for cause. Champagne used a peremptory challenge to remove Lamere. Champagne exhausted all of his peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">\u00b613 Another prospective juror, Andrew Herdina (Herdina), filed an Affidavit for Excusal with the clerk of court that requested permanent exclusion from jury service. Herdina stated, \u201cI am a federal law enforcement officer and feel I may be biased in a criminal trial.\u201d The clerk of court advised Herdina to discuss his potential bias with the lawyers in the case to which he would be assigned. The record does not reflect whether Champagne\u2019s defense counsel had knowledge of Herdina\u2019s affidavit. Herdina did not raise the issue of his potential bias during voir dire. Champagne\u2019s defense counsel did not question Herdina about his law enforcement background or his claimed bias. Herdina served on Champagne\u2019s jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">\u00b614 Champagne alleged at trial that J.B. had made up the story. Champagne claimed that J.B.\u2019s accusations against Champagne arose from a family feud. Champagne alternatively claimed that J.B. sought to protect her actual abuser by blaming Champagne.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">\u00b615 Matkin testified for the State. The State failed to qualify Matkin as an expert. The District Court nevertheless permitted Matkin to testify that her training as a forensic interviewer included whether a witness had been coached. The District Court further permitted Matkin to testify that she had seen no indications that J.B. had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>coached. Matkin and J.B.\u2019s mother, Falcon, also repeated J.B.\u2019s earlier statements to them regarding what Champagne had done to her. The jury convicted Champagne of felony sexual assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">\u00b616 The District Court imposed a sentence of 40 years at the Montana State Prison. The District Court imposed a restitution obligation in an initial amount of $1,583, with an ongoing obligation to the extent that J.B. requires additional or ongoing treatment. The District Court\u2019s judgment enumerated several recommendations for the Department of Corrections. These recommendations included that Champagne be required to pay $3,478.09 for legal fees and expenses, plus the costs of jury service, prosecution and pretrial, probation, or community service supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">\u00b617 We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s denial of a challenge for cause of a prospective juror. <em>State v. Jay, </em>2013 MT 79, \u00b6 15, 369 Mont. 332, 298 P.3d 396. We review de novo a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>State v. Upshaw, </em>2006 MT 341, \u00b6 13, 335 Mont. 162, 153 P.3d 579. We review for abuse of discretion rulings on the admissibility of evidence, including oral testimony. <em>State v. Henderson, </em>2005 MT 333, \u00b6 8, 330 Mont. 34, 125 P.3d 1132. We review for legality a sentence involving incarceration of a year or more. <em>State v. Heafner, </em>2010 MT 87, \u00b6 1, 356 Mont. 128, 231 P.3d 1087.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">\u00b618 <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion in denying Champagne\u2019s for-cause challenge of a prospective juror?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">\u00b619 A potential juror may be removed for cause if he possesses a state of mind that would prevent him from acting with entire impartiality and without prejudice to the substantial rights of either party. Section 46-16-115(2)(j), MCA; <em>Jay, </em>\u00b6 19. A court must look at the totality of the circumstances of the potential juror\u2019s voir dire examination. Jay, \u00b6 19. A court gives more weight to a prospective juror\u2019s \u201cspontaneous statements\u201d than to \u201ccoaxed recantations\u201d elicited by counsel. Jay, \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">\u00b620  A juror should not be removed merely because he voices a concern about being impartial. Every person comes to jury duty with preconceptions. Jay, \u00b6 20. It falls within the discretion of the district court to decide whether a juror will be able to be impartial when a juror makes comments that suggest a fixed opinion, but later says he can set that opinion aside and follow the law. <em>Jay, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"AG\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>\u00b621 We reversed the district court in <em>State v. Freshment, </em>2002 MT 61, 309 Mont. 154, 43 P.3d 968, for failing to dismiss two jurors for cause. The State charged Freshment with two counts of sexual intercourse without consent that involved two girls under age 16. The law provided that if Freshment reasonably had believed that the girls were 16 years old, the jury should acquit him of the charges. Defense counsel asked the potential jurors whether they could acquit Freshment if he had reasonably believed that the 15-year-old girls were actually 16 years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">\u00b622 Juror Paula Porter admitted that she would \u201clean towards not following the law\u201d if the law required acquittal under those circumstances. Porter also admitted that she \u201creally couldn\u2019t\u201d acquit under any circumstances. <em>Freshment, </em>\u00b6 8. Juror James Hansen similarly stated that he did not know if he would acquit Freshment even if Freshment reasonably had believed that the girls were 16 years old. <em>Freshment, </em>\u00b6 9. Both jurors stated an actual bias when they testified that they could not follow the law and acquit Freshment even if they found that Freshment reasonably had believed that the victims were 16 years old. <em>Freshment, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">\u00b623 Champagne challenged potential juror Lamere for cause. Lamere had responded fyes\u201d to a jury questionnaire that asked whether he preferred that a person charged with a crime prove his innocence. Lamere stated during voir dire that he would have reservations about a defendant not testifying. Defense counsel asked Lamere, \u201cdo you think if the Defendant didn\u2019t testify and chose not to, that suspicion arises? Do you think that maybe that could happen?\u201d Lamere responded, \u2018Ipjrobably, yeah.\u201d Champagne moved to dismiss Lamere for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">\u00b624 The District Court responded to this motion by instructing Lamere on the law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">[Tjhere is a presumption of innocence and the State has a burden of proving their case beyond a reasonable doubt. Part of that burden means that the Defendant does not have to testify. And if the Defendant does not testify I will instruct the jury that they are not to make any presumption or inference from that failure to testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-8\">You have to decide whether the case has been proven based on the evidence that has been presented and not draw any negative inference from the Defendant\u2019s failure to testify. That is the law. Now, with that said, would you be able to follow the law, sir?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Lamere responded, fyes, ma\u2019am.\u201d The District Court asked Lamere, Ta]nd you could follow the law and not draw any inference as to the Defendant\u2019s election not to testify?\u201d Lamere responded, T have never sat [on] a jury like that before, so I guess, you know, I\u2019m not sure what to say. But I will follow the law, you know, not that I would go against the law. I don\u2019t understand a lot about the law, I guess.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">\u00b625 The State asked Lamere whether he understood the presumption of innocence and a defendant\u2019s right not to testify. Lamere responded that he understood. Lamere also agreed with the State that there could be many reasons, unrelated to a person\u2019s guilt, that a person may choose not to testify. The District Court denied Champagne\u2019s motion to dismiss Lamere for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">\u00b626  The District Court possesses the ability to look into the eyes of the juror in question\u201d and to consider his responses in the context of the courtroom. <em>Jay, </em>\u00b6 20. Lamere made comments to suggest that he would prefer that a defendant prove his innocence and that he may draw a negative inference if a defendant chose not to testify. The District Court explained the presumption of innocence to Lamere and a defendant\u2019s right not to testify. Unlike the jurors in <em>Freshment, </em>who admitted that they may be unable to follow the law, Lamere readily admitted that he had been unfamiliar with the trial process and that he would follow the law as instructed by the court. <em>See Freshment, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8-9. The District Court determined that Lamere\u2019s responses demonstrated his ability to remain impartial. We cannot say that the District Court abused its discretion under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">\u00b627 <em>Whether Champagne\u2019s counsel provided ineffective assistance ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"AT\">\u00b628 Champagne argues that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to question Herdina about Herdina\u2019s affidavit constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. Herdina stated in his affidavit that his employment as a law enforcement officer may affect his ability to remain impartial in a criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">\u00b629 We first must determine whether Champagne properly presents allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel before this Court on direct appeal. <em>Upshaw, </em>\u00b6 33; \u00a746-21-105(2), MCA. We look to whether the record contains an answer as to \u201cwhy\u201d counsel took, or failed to take, action in providing a defense. <em>Upshaw, </em>\u00b6 33. Post-conviction proceedings represent the appropriate avenue for relief if the record does not fully explain \u201cwhy\u201d counsel acted or failed to act. <em>Upshaw, </em>\u00b6 33. An exception to the requirement for a record-based answer arises when \u2018ho plausible justification\u201d exists to counter a claim of ineffective assistance on appeal. <em>Upshaw, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>\u00b630 The record provides no explanation as to \u201cwhy\u201d Champagne\u2019s counsel failed to inquire about Herdina\u2019s affidavit. Champagne argues that \u2018ho plausible justification\u201d exists for this oversight. Upshaw, \u00b6 34. The record does not establish whether Champagne\u2019s counsel even knew of the existence of Herdina\u2019s affidavit. Herdina did not mention any potential bias during voir dire. In fact, Herdina stated during voir dire that he felt that he could be fair to both the State and to Champagne.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">\u00b631 Champagne\u2019s counsel\u2019s possible lack of knowledge regarding the affidavit creates a potential plausible justification for Champagne\u2019s counsel\u2019s failure to ask Herdina about his employment related bias. See <em>Upshaw, </em>\u00b6 34. Further, Herdina explicitly stated during voir dire that he was not biased. We cannot say that \u2018ho plausible justification\u201d exists for Champagne\u2019s counsel not to have questioned Herdina regarding his affidavit. See Upshaw, \u00b6 34. A post-conviction proceeding represents the appropriate avenue for Champagne to bring his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">\u00b632 <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion in admitting the forensic interviewer\u2019s opinion testimony?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">\u00b633 Champagne argues that the District Court improperly allowed Matkin to offer an expert opinion although she was not qualified as an expert. The State argues that Matkin provided a lay opinion, rather than an expert opinion, that the District Court properly admitted under M. R. Evid. 701.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">\u00b634 Champagne implied during cross-examination that J.B.\u2019s testimony may have been coached. Matkin testified after J.B. Matkin testified that she had received training to recognize whether a victim had been coached. The State asked Matkin, \u2018[d]id you observe any indications of coaching in [J.B.\u2019s] interview?\u201d The District Court overruled Champagne\u2019s objection. Matkin responded, \u2018[n]o, I did not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"APM\">\u00b635 A lay witness may testify to opinions or inferences that rationally relate to the perception of that witness and are helpful to a clear understanding of the witness\u2019 s testimony or the determination of a fact in issue. M. R. Evid. 701. A witness\u2019s training can provide a sufficient foundation for them to provide lay opinion testimony. For instance, in <em>State v. Frasure, </em>2004 MT 305, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18, 323 Mont. 479, 100 P.3d 1013, we recognized that a police officer may testify as a lay witness to matters to which he has extensive training and experience. The police officer\u2019s training and experience in <em>Frasure </em>provided a sufficient foundation for the police officer to testify as to his lay opinion that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>criminal defendant possessed drugs with the intent to sell the drugs. <em>Frasure, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">\u00b636  The State elicited testimony from Matkin to demonstrate that Matkin had training to identify whether a victim had been coached. The State asked Matkin whether she had seen any indication that J.B. had been coached. The District Court properly allowed Matkin to testify about a matter to which she had training and experience: whether a victim had been coached. <em>See Frasure, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">\u00b637 <em>Whether the District Court properly admitted J.B.\u2019s prior consistent </em>statements?</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">\u00b638 Champagne further argues that the District Court improperly allowed Matkin and Falcon to testify about J.B.\u2019s prior consistent statements. Montana Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1) provides that a party may admit a declarant\u2019s prior consistent statement if the party offers it to rebut an express or implied charge that the declarant had fabricated her testimony or had acted from an improper influence or motive in testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">\u00b639 Four requirements must be met to admit a statement as a prior consistent statement. <em>State v. McOmber, </em>2007 MT 340, \u00b6 13, 340 Mont. 262, 173 P.3d 690. First, the declarant must have testified at the trial. <em>McOmber, </em>\u00b6 13. Second, the declarant must have been subject to cross-examination concerning her statement. <em>McOmber, </em>\u00b6 13. Third, the prior statements to which the witness testifies must be consistent with the declarant\u2019s testimony at trial. <em>McOmber, </em>\u00b6 13. Finally, the prior statement must rebut an express or implied charge of subsequent fabrication or subsequent improper influence or motive. <em>McOmber, </em>\u00b6 13. In order to rebut a charge of subsequent fabrication or subsequent improper influence, the consistent statement must have been made before the motivation to fabricate a story arose, or before the improper influence occurred. <em>McOmber, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">\u00b640 The parties agree that J.B. testified at trial and that Champagne subjected J.B. to cross-examination. The parties also agree that Falcon\u2019s and Matkin\u2019s testimony of J.B.\u2019s prior statements comported with the testimony that J.B. had given at trial. The parties further agree that Champagne had opened the door to prior consistent evidence testimony when he attempted to impeach J.B. by claiming that she possessed a motive to fabricate her story or that she was subjected to improper influence. Champagne argues, however, that J.B. had made no prior consistent statements before the existence of the alleged motivation to fabricate.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>\u00b641 J.B. testified that her mother had taken her to a doctor to see \u2018If I still had my virginity.\u201d Champagne\u2019s counsel implied during cross-examination that J.B.\u2019s testimony had been coached. Champagne\u2019s counsel suggested that \u201cvirginity\u201d was a word that a twelve-year-old girl would not normally have in her vocabulary. Champagne\u2019s counsel asked J.B. whether she had spoken with a number of people about what had happened. J.B. admitted that she had talked to Falcon, to Matkin, to the County Attorney, and to her friend Brittany.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">\u00b642 Champagne\u2019s counsel next inquired whether the County Attorney had told J.B. what to say. J.B. denied that the County Attorney had told her what to say. J.B. admitted that she and the County Attorney had gone over questions to be asked during her direct examination. J.B. further admitted that the County Attorney had told J.B. what to expect at the trial and on cross-examination by Champagne\u2019s counsel. \u00b643 Champagne\u2019s counsel also asked J.B. whether Falcon, Matkin, or Brittany had told J.B. what to say. J.B. denied that any of them had told her what to say. Champagne\u2019s counsel pressed J.B. on her use of the word \u2018Virginity.\u201d Champagne\u2019s counsel stated, \u20181 never heard you use that word in any of your other interviews. Did somebody tell you whatthatwas?\u201dJ.B. responded, \u2018No.\u201dChampagne\u2019s counsel remarked, To]kay. You have a good vocabulary then. Okay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">\u00b644 The District Court determined that Champagne had opened the door to prior consistent statement evidence. Champagne had suggested on cross-examination that the County Attorney, Matkin, or Falcon, had coached J.B. in her trial testimony. Falcon testified about what J.B., then ten years old, had told her regarding the incident. Falcon\u2019s testimony of J.B.\u2019s prior statements comported with J.B.\u2019s testimony at trial. <em>See McOmber, </em>\u00b6 13. The conversation between Falcon and J.B. took place before J.B. had spoken with either Matkin or the County Attorney. <em>See McOmber, </em>\u00b6 15. J.B.\u2019s statements to Falcon took place before any alleged coaching by Matkin or by the County Attorney could have occurred. <em>See McOmber, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">\u00b645  Matkin also testified about what J.B., then ten years old, had told her. Matkin\u2019s testimony regarding J.B.\u2019s prior statement comported with J.B.\u2019s testimony at trial. <em>See McOmber, </em>\u00b6 13. The conversation between Matkin and J.B. took place before J.B. had spoken with the County Attorney. <em>See McOmber, </em>\u00b6 15. J.B.\u2019s statements to Matkin took place before any alleged coaching by the County Attorney could have occurred. <em>See McOmber, </em>\u00b6 15. The District Court properly admitted both Matkin\u2019s and Falcon\u2019s testimony of J.B.\u2019s description of what had happened to her under M. R. Evid. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>801(d)(1)(B), due to the fact that J.B. had made her statements to Matkin and Falcon before the alleged \u2018improper influence\u201d by the County Attorney. <em>See McOmber, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">\u00b646 <em>Whether the District Court imposed an illegal sentence?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">\u00b647 Champagne argues that the District Court improperly considered Champagne\u2019s denial of guilt when it sentenced Champagne. We will not uphold a sentence where a district court draws a negative inference of lack of remorse as a result of a defendant\u2019s invocation of his constitutional right to remain silent and refusal to admit guilt. <em>State v. Morris, </em>2010 MT 259, \u00b6 22, 358 Mont. 307, 245 P.3d 512; <em>State v. Shreves, </em>2002 MT 333, \u00b6 24, 313 Mont. 252, 60 P.3d 991. The district court must have based its decision \u2018in large part\u201d on the defendant\u2019s lack of remorse or failure to take responsibility for this Court to reverse the sentence. <em>Shreves, </em>\u00b6 24; <em>see also Morris, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">\u00b648 The district court in <em>Morris </em>provided eight valid reasons for the sentences, none of which relied on lack of remorse or lack of accountability. <em>Morris, </em>\u00b6 23. The district court in <em>Shreves, </em>in contrast, based its sentence and parole restriction, in large part, on his failure to show remorse or to take responsibility for the deliberate homicide for which he had been convicted. <em>Shreves, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7, 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">\u00b649 Here the District Court announced in the judgment that, \u2018Defendant has no empathy for the victim and he has even projected blame on to the victim.\u201d The District Court further pointed to Champagne\u2019s four prior felony convictions, his \u201cextensive chemical dependency history,\u201dand Champagne\u2019s diagnosis as a psychopath. The District Court noted that Champagne \u201cpossesses several psychopathic qualities; he is callous and predatory, deceptive and manipulative, he lacks empathy and does not feel genuine remorse for his socially deviant and criminal acts. [Champagne\u2019s] prospects at rehabilitation are slim.\u201d The District Court further noted that Champagne had been supervised by the Department of Corrections \u2018in one form or another almost his entire adult life.\u201d We cannot say that the District Court based its sentencing decision \u2018in large part\u201don Champagne\u2019s denial of guilt under these circumstances. See <em>Shreves, </em>\u00b6 24; <em>Morris, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">\u00b650 Further, a district court may sentence a defendant based on lack of remorse so long as affirmative evidence of the lack of remorse exists. <em>Morris, </em>\u00b6 22. The District Court noted that Dr. Michael Scolatti\u2019s psychological evaluation portrayed Champagne as a person who is \u2018lacking in empathy and does not feel genuine remorse for socially deviant and criminal acts. He usually does not feel guilt when he hurts, takes advantage of, or otherwise abuses other people.\u201d Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>Scolatti further opined that Champagne \u201cevidences little or no empathy for the victim.\u201d The record does not support Champagne\u2019s claim that the District Court improperly drew a negative inference from Champagne\u2019s denial of guilt. <em>See Shreves, </em>\u00b6 14; <em>Morris, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">\u00b651 Champagne next argues that the District Court\u2019s imposition of unspecified restitution costs represents an illegal sentence. The District Court required Champagne to pay restitution to J.B. The District Court recognized that J.B. may need additional and ongoing treatment. The District Court ordered Champagne to cover these future, unknown costs. The State admits that Montana law requires restitution obligations to be imposed in \u201ca specified amount.\u201d <em>Heafner, </em>\u00b6 13. We remand to the District Court to set a specified amount for restitution for future costs. <em>See Heafner, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">\u00b652 Champagne also challenges the District Court\u2019s recommended conditions \u201c[flor any term of community supervision.\u201d The District Court possesses authority to make non-binding recommendations to the Department of Correction\u2019s Board of Pardons and Parole as part of its judgment. <em>Heafner, </em>\u00b6 13. Champagne admits that this Court need not determine the legality of the District Court\u2019s order if the District Court merely made non-binding recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\u00b653 We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<judges id=\"b65-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, COTTER and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
