Marcial appealed to the Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Gallatin County, which affirmed the Municipal Court\u2019s denial of Marcial\u2019s motion. We affirm the District Court\u2019s decision to deny Marcial\u2019s motion to suppress, but rely on alternate grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">\u00b62 We restate and consider the following issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">\u00b63 <em>Whether the District Court erred by affirming the Municipal Court\u2019s denial of Marcial\u2019s motion to suppress based on the Community Caretaker Doctrine ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">\u00b64 On May 8,2010, at around 1:15 a.m., Bozeman Police Department Sergeant Travis Munter (Sgt. Munter) was traveling south on North Rouse Avenue in Bozeman. Sgt. Munter observed Marcial, who was driving northbound, execute a hard left turn in an area where Sgt. Munter knew there were no cross streets. Marcial drove up on the sidewalk and onto the grass before coming to an abrupt stop, nearly perpendicular to the street. Sgt. Munter then observed Marcial\u2019s vehicle back away from the curb area, where he saw a fire hydrant immediately next to the sidewalk. Concerned that Marcial had collided with the fire hydrant, Sgt. Munter turned his vehicle around and stopped behind Marcial\u2019s car just as Marcial was parking parallel to the street. Sgt. Munter activated his rear warning lights, but not his top lights.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">\u00b65 Sgt. Munter exited his car and approached Marcial\u2019s vehicle, knocking on the side of the car. Sgt. Munter testified that he did not observe any damage to Marcial\u2019s vehicle at that time and could see that the fire hydrant did not appear to be damaged. Marcial opened the door, and Sgt. Munter asked, \u201ceverything okay?\u201d Marcial responded affirmatively. While speaking to Marcial, Sgt. Munter noticed the smell of an alcoholic beverage and other indicators that Marcial was driving under the influence of alcohol. Sgt. Munter then asked Marcial for his license and vehicle registration and proceeded with a DUI investigation. Sgt. Munter administered several standard field sobriety tests, ultimately arresting Marcial and citing him for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>driving under the influence in violation of \u00a761-8-401, MCA. Marcial was not issued any other traffic citations.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">\u00b66 Marcial filed a motion to suppress the evidence from the stop, arguing that the community caretaker doctrine was not applicable and Sgt. Munter did not have the requisite particularized suspicion to make a traffic stop. A suppression hearing was held in Bozeman Municipal Court on November 1,2010, with Judge Karl Seel presiding. At the hearing, Sgt. Munter said he thought Marcial \u201cmight have collided with the fire hydrant,\u201d but that he had no intent to make a traffic stop. Sgt. Munter testified that his primary concern was to \u201ccheck his welfare\u201d after seeing Marcial make the abrupt turn and sudden stop, and after observing the nearby fire hydrant. On cross examination, Sgt. Munter confirmed that he did not cite Marcial for any other traffic offense and stated \u201cmy initial contact was merely for welfare and to ascertain if there was a crash.\u201d Sgt. Munter added, \u201ca lot of times when cars hit fire hydrants there is enough damage to report a crash.\u201d Sgt. Munter explained that while he was walking up to Martial's vehicle, he said he didn\u2019t \u201csee any damage on the fire hydrant\u201d adding \u2018those things are pretty hearty. So, you want to check the vehicle, and it was a low enough vehicle, like I said, once I made sure he was okay, I could look up and see that there didn\u2019t appear to be any damage on the front of the car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">\u00b67 Judge Seel ruled from the bench, denying Marcial\u2019s motion to suppress. The Municipal Court orally found that the \u201cofficer turned around believing there may have been an accident,\u201d \u201cthere was a fire hydrant close to that,\u201d\u2018the vehicle was already off the roadway at that point,\u201d and \u2018the officer turned around ... to see if there had been an accident to bring it within the caretaking doctrine.\u201d The Municipal Court found further that Sgt. Munter\u2019s \u201cfirst statements to the defendant were asking if he was \u2018okay\u2019 and he got an affirmative response that he was.\u201d The Municipal Court concluded that Sgt. Munter could have made \u201ca pretty good determination\u201d that there had not been a collision, but he \u201ccould not know with certainty until he had ... a good look and some conversation with defendant as to whether he had been injured because it was an abrupt stop.\u201d Denying Martial's motion to suppress, the Municipal Court stated, \u2018the caretaker doctrine started the stop and it ripened into a proper DUI investigation.\u201d On November 24, 2010, Marcial pled guilty to the amended charge of DUI per se subject to a plea agreement, reserving his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">\u00b68 Martial appealed to the Eighteenth Judicial District Court. Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>Holly Brown reviewed the Municipal Court\u2019s decision and affirmed the denial of Marcial\u2019s motion to suppress. The District Court\u2019s Order stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-4\">Sgt. Munter personally observed erratic driving behavior that caused him concern, both of a potential accident with property damage, and of a possible welfare issue with the driver. Sgt. Munter was well within the parameters under <em>State v. Lovegren </em>to have \u201cobjective, specific and articulable facts from which an experienced officer would suspect that a citizen is in need of help.\u201d <em>[State v. Lovegren, </em>2002 MT 153, \u00b6 25, 310 Mont. 358, 51 P.3d 471.] Upon contact with Defendant, the objective observations made by Sgt. Munter supported the shift to an investigation to determine if Defendant was operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The Order continued: Tt]he contact shifted to an investigation of DUI only after additional information became available to Sgt. Munter which shifted the focus from the welfare of Defendant to an investigation of Defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">\u00b69 Marcial appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">\u00b610 We review a district court\u2019s rulings on a motion to suppress to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether the court\u2019s interpretation and application of the law are correct. <em>State v. Spaulding, </em>2011 MT 204, \u00b6 13, 361 Mont. 445, 259 P.3d 793; <em>State v. Seaman, </em>2005 MT 307, \u00b6 10, 329 Mont. 429, 124 P.3d 1137. \u2018We review cases that originate injustice court and are appealed to district court \u2018as if the appeal originally had been filed in this Court.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019State v. Gai, </em>2012 MT 235, \u00b6 11, 366 Mont. 408, 288 P.3d 164 (citing <em>State v. Ellison, </em>2012 MT 50, \u00b6 8, 364 Mont. 276, 272 P.3d 646). \u2018We examine the record independently of the district court\u2019s decision\u201d to review the trial court\u2019s findings, conclusions, and ruling. <em>Ellison, </em>\u00b6 8. \u2018We will affirm the district court when it reaches the right result, even if it reaches the right result for the wrong reason.\u201d <em>Ellison, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">\u00b611 <em>Whether the District Court erred by affirming the Municipal Court\u2019s denial ofMarcial\u2019s motion to suppress based on the Community Caretaker Doctrine?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">\u00b612 We adopted the community caretaker doctrine in <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number><em>Lovegren, </em>2002 MT 153, 310 Mont. 358, 51 P.3d 471. We quoted <em>Cady </em>v. <em>Dombrowski, </em>413 U.S. 433, 441, 93 S. Ct. 2523, 2528 (1973), in which the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-4\">Local police officers, unlike federal officers, frequently investigate vehicle accidents in which there is no claim of criminal liability and engage in what, for want of a better term, may be described as community caretaking functions, totally divorced from the detection, investigation, or acquisition of evidence relating to the violation of a criminal statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-5\"><em>Lovegren, </em>\u00b6 17. After conducting an extensive review of the authority governing the community caretaker function and the approaches used in other jurisdictions, we adopted the following test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">First, as long as there are objective, specific and articulable facts from which an experienced officer would suspect that a citizen is in need of help or is in peril, then that officer has the right to stop and investigate. Second, if the citizen is in need of aid, then the officer may take appropriate action to render assistance or mitigate the peril. Third, once, however, the officer is assured that the citizen is not in peril or is no longer in need of assistance or that the peril has been mitigated, then any actions beyond that constitute a seizure implicating not only the protections provided by the Fourth Amendment, but more importantly, those greater guarantees afforded under Article II, Sections 10 and 11 of the Montana Constitution as interpreted in this Court\u2019s decisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Al6\"><em>Lovegren, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">\u00b613 The community caretaker doctrine encapsulates certain police-citizen encounters that are \u201cunrelated to the detection and investigation of crime.\u201d <em>Seaman, </em>\u00b6 15; <em>see also Lovegren, </em>\u00b6 16; <em>State v. Graham, </em>2007 MT 358, \u00b6 25, 340 Mont. 366, 175 P.3d 885; <em>Spaulding, </em>\u00b6 18. Community caretaker functions exercised by police officers may include \u201cassisting motorists who are stranded, involved in accidents, or otherwise in need of assistance.\u201d <em>Seaman, </em>\u00b6 15 (citing <em>Lovegren, </em>\u00b6 17). We have explained that \u201cthe community caretaker doctrine cannot be used as a pretext for an illegal search and seizure,\u201d <em>Spaulding, </em>\u00b6 24 (citing <em>Lovegren, </em>\u00b6 23), and the stop must actually involve a \u201cwelfare\u201dcheck. <em>Compare i.e. Seaman, </em>\u00b6 23 (officer conducted a \u201cwelfare\u201d check to determine whether Seaman\u2019s car was disabled or if Seaman was experiencing medical or physical problems), <em>with Graham, </em>\u00b6 30 (officer \u201cdid not stop and question Graham in order to assist them, but instead to \u2018move them along.\u2019 \u201d). Providing assistance to a motorist in peril or helping a person in need of aid is commonly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>viewed as an affirmative duty of a police officer. <em>Seaman, </em>\u00b6 15; <em>Lovegren, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">\u00b614 The doctrine recognizes that not all contact between law enforcement officers and citizens involves a \u201cseizure\u201d implicating the Fourth Amendment. <em>Seaman, </em>\u00b6 13 (citing <em>Lovegren, </em>\u00b6 13); <em>Graham, </em>\u00b6 26. Although we stated in <em>Spaulding </em>that \u201c[i]n the usual case, a welfare check by its very nature necessarily involves a brief seizure-but a seizure nonetheless-in order for the officer to ascertain whether the citizen needs assistance or is in peril,\u201d we nonetheless recognized that Tt]here may be fact-specific situations in which a welfare check does not involve a seizure.\u201d <em>Spaulding, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18,19. \u2018Each community caretaker case turns on its discrete facts.\u201d <em>Spaulding, </em>\u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"Al2\">\u00b615 It is our observation that the caretaker doctrine is increasingly being offered by the State as an alternate justification for police contact in addition to particularized suspicion of criminal activity. We underscore the doctrine\u2019s intended application to situations where a citizen \u2018is in need of help or is in peril,\u201d thus authorizing an officer \u201cto render assistance or mitigate the peril,\u201d <em>Lovegren, </em>\u00b6 25, in cases \u201cunrelated to the detection and investigation of crime.\u201d <em>Seaman, </em>\u00b6 15. A caretaker inquiry should not typically require a seizure. This caretaker premise is important, given Montana\u2019s express right to privacy and protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7\u00a7 10, 11. As one commentator cautions, \u201c[t]he restraint of a person\u2019s liberty under the public servant exception cannot exceed the purpose of that exception-bo determine if aid is necessary. The officer cannot constitutionally take any action that extends beyond the public servant role without another justification.\u201d Mary Elisabeth Naumann, <em>The Community Caretaker Doctrine: Yet Another Fourth Amendment Exception, </em>26 Am. J. Crim. L. 325, 341 (Spring 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">\u00b616 Marcial and the State both advance arguments urging us to modify the test we adopted in <em>Lovegren. </em>Marcial argues that a community caretaker check, like an investigative stop under <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S. Ct. 1868 (1968), is a seizure that is constitutionally permissible only if the officer can identity objective, specific, and articulable facts justifying a warrantless intrusion throughout the entire course of the procedure. In contrast, the State argues that \u2018Twjelfare checks are not by their very nature seizures\u201d and \u2018If a defendant can show he was seized-for whatever reason-bhe State may nonetheless demonstrate the seizure was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment pursuant to the community caretaker doctrine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>if it can show objective, specific and articulable facts existed from which an experienced officer would have suspected a citizen was in need of help or was in peril.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reject these entreaties to modify the <em>Lovegren </em>test. Rather, its application must be limited to proper cases.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqts\">\u00b617 Police officers are \u201cvested by law with a duty to maintain public order and make arrests for offenses while acting within the scope of the person\u2019s authority.\u201d Section 46-1-202(17), MCA. Law enforcement officers have an affirmative statutory duty to investigate motor vehicle accidents pursuant to \u00a761-7-109(3), MCA, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\">A law enforcement officer who in the regular course of duty investigates a motor vehicle accident in which a person is killed or injured or in which damage to the property of a person exceeds $1,000, either <em>at the time of and at the scene of the accident </em>or after the accident by interviewing participants or witnesses, shall within 10 days after completing the investigation forward a written report of the accident to the department.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Section 61-7-109(3), MCA (emphasis added). There is no requirement that police officers wait until an accident is reported to determine whether an incident they have observed first-hand requires an accident investigation. Further, officers have authority to investigate and cite motorists for traffic code violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\u00b618  \u2018To have particularized suspicion for an investigative stop, the peace officer must be possessed of (1) objective data and articulable facts from which he or she can make certain reasonable inferences and (2) a resulting suspicion that the person to be stopped has committed, is committing, or is about to commit an offense.\u201d <em>State v. Wagner, </em>2013 MT 159, \u00b6 10, 370 Mont. 381, 303 P.3d 285. We conclude that Sgt. Munter\u2019s testimony demonstrates that he had a particularized suspicion upon objective, articulable facts that Marcial had been involved in a property damage accident that would require an accident investigation and possible citation of Marcial under the traffic code. <em>See Wagner, </em>\u00b6 16 (vehicle straddling two lanes for 500-600 feet was particularized suspicion for violation of \u00a7 61-8-328(1), MCA, which requires motorists to operate a vehicle \u201cas nearly as practicable entirely within a single lane.\u201d); <em>Brown v. State, </em>2009 MT 64, \u00b6 23, 349 Mont. 408, 203 P.3d 842 (a \u201cbarely moving\u201d vehicle along a public roadway at 2:51 a.m. suddenly pulling over, coming to a stop, and shutting off its lights constituted particularized suspicion of DUI); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number><em>State v. Luckett, </em>2007 MT 47, \u00b6 11, 336 Mont. 140, 152 P.3d 1279 (slow driving and weaving was particularized suspicion of careless driving or DUI); <em>State v. Brander, </em>2004 MT 150, \u00b6 9, 321 Mont. 484, 92 P.3d 1173 (vehicle going 35 mph in a 70 mph zone, weaving, and crossing fog line was particularized suspicion of careless driving and DUI). Sgt. Munter witnessed Marcial\u2019s vehicle make an unexpected hard left turn into an area with no cross streets, drive up on the sidewalk and onto the grass, and come to an abrupt stop nearly perpendicular to the street at 1:15 a.m. Sgt. Munter then observed a fire hydrant that was in a position indicating it could have been hit by Marcial\u2019s vehicle, thus explaining the abrupt stop. His subjective feelings notwithstanding, Sgt. Munter\u2019s observation of objective data and facts gave rise to a particularized suspicion to approach Marcial\u2019s vehicle to inquire and investigate whether an accident requiring further police investigation and citation had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">\u00b619 After making contact with Marcial, Sgt. Munter observed definite signs of intoxication, giving him particularized suspicion to expand the investigation into a possible DUI, ultimately leading, after Marcial failed several standard field sobriety tests, to Marcial\u2019s arrest for DUI. This escalation of events leading to Marcial\u2019s arrest is appropriate under our decision in <em>Hulse v. DOJ, Motor Vehicle Dev., </em>1998 MT 108, 289 Mont. 1, 961 P.2d 75. <em>See also i.e. State v. Larson, </em>2010 MT 236, \u00b6 25, 358 Mont. 156, 243 P.3d 1130; <em>Brander, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">\u00b620  The District Court did not err by denying Marcial\u2019s motion to suppress. Though the District Court based its reasoning on the community caretaker doctrine, the motion was appropriately denied on the ground that there was particularized suspicion for the stop. \u201cWe will affirm the district court when it reaches the right result, even if it reaches the right result for the wrong reason.\u201d <em>Ellison, </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">\u00b621 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b375-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER and McKINNON concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b374-7\"> We refined the \u201cexperienced officer\u201d consideration of the particularized suspicion inquiry in <em>Brown v. </em>State, 2009 MT 64, \u00b6\u00b6 19, 20, 349 Mont. 408, 203 P.3d 842.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
