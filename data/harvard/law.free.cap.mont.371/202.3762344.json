We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b223-11\">\u00b63 <em>1. Did the District Court err by determining that Assurance had no duty to defend Landa because Alsup\u2019s claim did not involve an \u201coccurrence\u201das defined by the insurance policy ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-12\">\u00b64 <em>2. Did the District Court err by determining that Assurance had no duty to defend Landa because Alsup\u2019s claim did not involve a \u2018bodily injury\u201das defined by the insurance policy?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-13\">\u00b65 <em>3. Did the District Court err by determining that Assurance did not have a duty to conduct an independent investigation ofLanda\u2019s claim?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b223-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b223-15\">\u00b66 Leonard Landa was the sole managing member of Landa-Harbaugh &amp; Associates, LLC, a Montana limited liability corporation licensed to sell securities and insurance in this state. Landa carried commercial general liability insurance through Assurance, a New York entity licensed to do business in Montana. This appeal arises out of Assurance\u2019s refusal to defend Landa against claims made by O\u00edan L. \u2018Bubba\u201d Alsup (Alsup), a former employee ofLanda\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-16\">\u00b67 Alsup had previously worked as a salesman at Bretz RV &amp; Marine in Missoula, Montana. Landa approached Alsup and encouraged him to quit his job at Bretz and come to work at Landa selling insurance. Alsup claimed that Landa promised to train him to run the insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>business with an eye towards soon retiring and selling Asup the business for a \u201creasonable price.\u201d Asup claimed that he quit his job at Bretz based on these representations and he began to work for Landa in January of 2002. However, Asup claimed that Landa spent much of his time out of the office on vacation instead of training him or transferring him clients. Asup eventually came to believe that Landa had no intention of either retiring or selling him the insurance business. When Asup did approach Landa about buying the business, Landa repeatedly quoted prices that Asup considered to be unreasonable and unrealistic given his valuation of the business. Asup quit working at Landa in 2006 due to his belief that Landa\u2019s promises had been a ruse.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">\u00b68 Asup thereafter filed a complaint and demand for a jury trial on April 1, 2008, alleging that Landa had engaged in \u2018fraud and constructive fraud,\u201d \u201cmisrepresentation and deceit,\u201d \u201cdeception in the character of employment,\u201d \u201cnegligence,\u201d \u2018breach of contract,\u201d and \u2018tortious breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing\u201d by inducing Asup to come work for him under allegedly false pretenses. Landa tendered defense of Asup\u2019s claim to Assurance, through Zurich North America, on April 18, 2008. Landa included a copy of Asup\u2019s complaint with this request.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\u00b69 Assurance declined to defend Landa, asserting that the allegations set forth in Asup\u2019s complaint were not covered under Landa\u2019s policy. The policy sets out the following relevant coverages under \u2018Section I -Coverages\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">COVERAGE A. BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-8\">1. Insuring Agreement</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-9\">a.

However, we will have no duty to defend the insured against any \u2018suit\u2019 seeking damages for \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damages\u2019 to which this insurance does not apply....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">The bodily injury and property damage liability section also provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-11\">b.

This includes mental anguish, mental injury, shock, fright or death resulting from bodily injury, sickness, or disease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">13. \u2018Occurrence\u2019 means an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">14. \u2018Personal and advertising injury\u2019 means injury, including consequential \u2018bodily injury\u2019, arising out of one or more of the following offenses:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-9\">a.

Physical injury to tangible property ...; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-18\">b. Loss of use of tangible property ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-19\">\u00b610 Assurance specifically claimed that Alsup\u2019s complaint did not contain any allegations of \u2018bodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d as defined by the policy and that Landa\u2019s actions did not constitute a covered accidental \u201coccurrence.\u201d Assurance also asserted that none of Alsup\u2019s allegations fell within the policy\u2019s definition of\u2018Personal and Advertising Injury.\u201d Assurance\u2019s denial concluded with a request for \u201cany case law, authority or any other information at all that would cause Assurance to reconsider its position[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b225-20\">\u00b611 Landa again tendered defense of Alsup\u2019s claim to Assurance on January 16, 2009. This time Landa included a statement of claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>asserting that Alsup sought damages for emotional distress. This emotional distress claim, however, was not included in Alsup\u2019s complaint. Landa also attached a copy of our decision in <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. </em>Wagner-Ellsworth, 2008 MT 240, 344 Mont. 455, 188 P.3d 1042. Assurance again declined to defend Landa. Assurance essentially repeated its claims that Alsup\u2019s allegations did not amount to \u2018bodily injury\u201d caused by an \u201coccurrence\u201d under the policy. Landa and Alsup settled the underlying case in 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">\u00b612 Landa subsequently filed a complaint seeking declaratory relief establishing that Assurance had a duty to defend and indemnify Landa, alleging several violations of Montana\u2019s Unfair Trade Practices Act (UTPA), common law bad faith, negligence, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and breach of contract, and requesting attorney fees and punitive damages. Assurance filed a motion for summary judgment on all of Landa\u2019s claims, again arguing that Alsup\u2019s claims did not involve either a \u2018bodily injury\u201d or an \u201coccurrence\u201d while also asserting that several of the policy\u2019s coverage exceptions applied. The District Court granted Assurance\u2019s motion in an August 3, 2012 order, finding that Alsup did not experience a \u2018bodily injury\u201d as the result of an \u201coccurrence\u201d as those terms were defined by the \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d language of the policy. The Court also determined that Assurance was not liable under the UTPA because the denial of coverage was \u201cgrounded on a legal conclusion.\u201d Landa appeals the Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">\u00b613 We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling. <em>Johnston v. Centennial Log Homes &amp; Furnishings, Inc., </em>2013 MT 179, \u00b6 24, 2013 Mont. LEXIS 224. We apply the same M. R. Civ. P. 56 criteria as the district court, and summary judgment may be granted only \u201cwhen the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, affidavits, and admissions on file show no genuine issues of material fact exist and when the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Fasch v. M.K. Weeden Constr., Inc., </em>2011 MT 258, \u00b6 14, 362 Mont. 256, 262 P.3d 1117. The interpretation of an insurance policy presents a question of law, and we will review the District Court\u2019s legal conclusion for correctness. <em>Cusenbary v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>2001 MT 261, \u00b6 9, 307 Mont. 238, 37 P.3d 67. Findings of fact are reviewed to determine if they are clearly erroneous. <em>Plum Creek Mktg. v. Am. Econ. Ins. Co., </em>2009 MT 264, \u00b621, 352 Mont. 56, 214 P.3d 1238.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">\u00b614 <em>1. Did the District Court err by determining that Assurance had no duty to defend Landa because Alsup\u2019s claim did not invovle an \u201coccurrence\u201d as defined by the insurance policy ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">\u00b615 Assurance declined to defend Landa in part because it concluded that the allegations contained in Alsup\u2019s complaint did not constitute an \u201coccurrence\u201d as defined by the policy. As noted above, the policy provides that coverage extends only to \u2018bodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d caused by an \u201coccurrence.\u201d Thus, if Alsup\u2019s claims did not involve an \u201coccurrence,\u201d Assurance had no duty to defend Landa for claims alleging either \u2018bodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d under Coverage A of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">\u00b616 Landa generally argues that Alsup\u2019s complaint included allegations of negligent, accidental, or unintentional conduct sufficient to fall within the above definition of \u201coccurrence.\u201d Landa supports this argument with citations to cases from other jurisdictions that purportedly show that a \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d can be an \u201coccurrence\u201d and by arguing that Alsup\u2019s claims in Counts I, II, and III included allegations that Landa\u2019s statements were accidental. Landa further claims that we must look to the intended outcome from the perspective of the insured, \u2018hot the conduct itself,\u201d to determine what counts as an \u201coccurrence\u201d under the policy. From this perspective, Landa argues that it is \u201capparent that the unexpected [by Landa] impact of the conduct alleged by Alsup dictates that there has been an \u2018occurrence\u2019 in this instance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">\u00b617 In response, Assurance first broadly claims that Alsup\u2019s complaint \u201calleged only that Landa engaged in intentional fraudulent conduct-rather than any accidental conduct-purposefully designed to cause the harms Alsup allegedly suffered.\u201d Assurance also more specifically argues that the manner in which Alsup pled \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d under Count II \u201cmade clear that he was indeed alleging intentional conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">\u00b618 The District Court determined that \u201cthe allegations in Alsup\u2019s complaints clearly alleged that Landa\u2019s misrepresentations were intentional.\u201d We agree. Thus, we need not address Landa\u2019s extra-jurisdictional citations<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because a review of Alsup\u2019s complaint belies Landa\u2019s claim that Counts I-III include allegations of accidental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>conduct. <em>Lloyd A. Twite Family P\u2019ship v. Unitrin Mutli Line Ins., </em>2008 MT 310, \u00b6 7, 346 Mont. 42, 192 P.3d 1156; <em>Town of Geraldine v. Mont. Mun. Ins. Auth., </em>2008 MT 411, \u00b6 11, 347 Mont. 267, 198 P.3d 796 (\u201cAn insurer\u2019s duty to defend its insured arises <em>when a complaint alleges facts which represent a risk covered by the terms of an insurance policy.\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">\u00b619 It is well-settled that an insurer\u2019s duty to defend the insured arises when an insured sets forth facts which represent a risk covered by the terms of the insurance policy. <em>Farmers Union Mut. Ins. Co. v. Staples, </em>2004 MT 108, \u00b6 27, 321 Mont. 99, 90 P.3d 381. We have held that \u201c[t]he insurance company must look to the allegations of a complaint to determine if coverage exists under an insurance policy, thus giving rise to the insurer\u2019s duty to defend.\u201d <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 20. Thus, to determine whether Assurance had a duty to defend Landa, we will look first to the terms of the policy, and next to the facts alleged by Alsup\u2019s complaint. <em>Lloyd A. Twite Family P\u2019ship, </em>\u00b6 7. When doing so, we will give the terms in the policy their usual meaning and construe them using common sense. <em>Hardy v. Progressive Specialty Ins. Co., </em>2003 MT 85, \u00b6 14, 315 Mont. 107, 67 P.3d 892.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">\u00b620 Landa\u2019s policy defines \u201coccurrence\u201d as an \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\u201d The policy does not provide a separate definition for what constitutes an \u201caccident.\u201d We have previously held that, where a policy defines an \u201coccurrence\u201d as an \u201caccident,\u201d Tg]enerally, the term \u2018accident\u2019 from the standpoint of the insured reasonably refers to any unexpected happening that occurs without intention or design on the part of the insured.\u201d <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of Am. v. Liss, </em>2000 MT 380, \u00b6 36, 303 Mont. 519, 16 P.3d 399. A review of Alsup\u2019s complaint does not reveal allegations of the sort of accidental, unintentional conduct that the policy\u2019s definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">\u00b621 Specifically, Count I of Alsup\u2019s complaint alleged fraud and constructive fraud based on Landa\u2019s representations that Alsup \u201cwould be entering a profitable business and would be sold a business.\u201d In particular, Alsup claims that Landa\u2019s representations \u201cwere made with the intent that Plaintiff would quit his prior employment and begin working for Defendants ....\u201d Indeed, Count I focuses on Landa\u2019s purportedly \u2018false representations and improper motives\u201dand does not itself allege accidental conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">\u00b622 Count II presents a claim for \u201cmisrepresentation and deceit.\u201d The claim is based on Landa\u2019s alleged representations that he would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>able to provide Alsup with increased income, business opportunities, and the opportunity to purchase the insurance business. Importantly, negligent misrepresentation is neither mentioned nor alleged. Instead, as Assurance points out, Alsup plead \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d in the conjunctive, claiming:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-4\">27. When the representations by Defendants were made, Defendants: (a) knew that the representations were untrue; (b) had no reason to believe that the representations made to Plaintiff were true; <em>and </em>(c) made the representations to mislead Plaintiff into quitting his prior employment, work for defendants for little or no compensation and no opportunity to purchase the business.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">(emphasis added). Thus, Count II claims that Landa knowingly made false representations to Alsup concerning the nature of the work, persuaded Alsup to quit his job to pursue an illusory opportunity, and caused Alsup to suffer related damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">\u00b623 Count III presents a claim for \u201cdeception in the character of employment.\u201dThis claim is predicated on an alleged violation of \u00a739-2-303, MCA. Section 39-2-303, MCA prohibits a person or entity doing business in Montana from inducing, influencing, persuading, or engaging workers to change jobs \u2018by means of deception, misrepresentation, or false advertising ....\u201d Count III alleged that Landa violated \u00a7 39-2-303, MCA, \u2018by fraudulently inducing and/or misrepresenting to Plaintiff that his coming to work for Defendants would lead to greater income, advanced business opportunities, and the opportunity to purchase the business at a fair price.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">\u00b624  None of the aforementioned claims allege that Landa engaged in accidental conduct. Besides, Tt]he acts giving rise to the claim form the basis for coverage, <em>not any legal theories contained in the underlying complaint\u201d Travelers Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Ribi Immunochem Research, </em>2005 MT 50, \u00b6 40, 326 Mont. 174, 108 P.3d 469 (emphasis added); <em>see also Town of Geraldine, </em>\u00b6 24; <em>New Hampshire Ins. Group v. Strecker, </em>244 Mont. 478, 482, 798 P.2d 130 (1990). The underlying conduct alleged in Alsup\u2019s complaint is wholly comprised of Landa\u2019s intentional acts. Alsup claimed Landa approached him with false promises to lure him away from his job with Bretz RV. Alsup further claimed that Landa misled him regarding his intent to sell the business, provide training, or transfer clients. None of these claims involve accidental conduct. Rather, Alsup explicitly claimed that Landa \u2018lulled\u201d him into believing that he would be able to buy the business and that \u2018Landa would overvalue the business so that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>Plaintiff would become discouraged\u201d in his attempts to purchase it. The acts giving rise to these claims are not in dispute, and Alsup\u2019s complaint portrays a program of intentional misrepresentation. As noted, Landa\u2019s insurance policy with Assurance does not provide coverage for \u201cbodily injury\u201dor \u201cproperty damage\u201dcaused by intentional acts. \u201cIf there is no coverage under the terms of the policy based on the facts contained in the complaint, there is no duty to defend.\u201d <em>Steadele v. Colony Ins. Co., </em>2011 MT 208, \u00b6 25, 361 Mont. 459, 260 P.3d 145 (citing <em>Grimsrud v. Hagel, </em>2005 MT 194, \u00b6 34, 328 Mont. 142, 119 P.3d 47). Thus, the District Court correctly determined that Alsup\u2019s allegations did not fit within the policy\u2019s definition of \u201coccurrence\u201d and, as a result, did not give rise to a duty to defend Landa.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">\u00b625 This conclusion is supported by our analysis in <em>Blair v. Mid-Continent Cas. Co., </em>2007 MT 208, 339 Mont. 8, 167 P.3d 888. There, as here, the policy defined \u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201c \u2018[a]n accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blair, </em>\u00b6 9. Blair admitted that he intentionally removed gravel from his property, but he claimed that Montana law established that an intentional act is an occurrence under an insurance policy if the resulting injuries or damages were not the intended or expected result. <em>Blair, </em>\u00b6 17. We rejected that argument, holding that \u2018tujnder this definition, the proper focus in on whether Blair\u2019s deliberate operation of removing gravel is covered-not whether he intended the resulting damages allegedly stemming from the operation.\u201d <em>Blair, </em>\u00b6 18. Thus, we do not look to whether Landa intended the specific harm or damages that Alsup alleged. Instead, we must focus on the acts described in Alsup\u2019s complaint, which, as discussed, concerned Landa\u2019s deliberate, allegedly false representations. \u201cAn intentional act cannot be an \u2018occurrence\u2019 because it is not an accident and because it is intended or expected by the insured.\u201d <em>Farmers Mut. Ins. v. Kienenberger, </em>257 Mont. 107, 109, 847 P.2d 1360 (1993). Because Alsup\u2019s complaint alleged injuries caused by intentional acts, Assurance had no duty to defend Landa. We accordingly affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Alsup\u2019s claim did not constitute an occurrence as defined by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\u00b626 <em>2. Did the District Court err by determining that Assurance had no duty to defend Landa because Alsup\u2019s claim did not involve a \u2018bodily injury\u201d as defined by the insurance policy?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">\u00b627 Assurance also declined to defend Landa by asserting that Alsup\u2019s claim did not allege a \u201cbodily injury.\u201d The District Court agreed, finding first that \u201cAlsup did not allege damages of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>emotional distress in either [amended] complaint, although Alsup did claim emotional distress in his statement of claim.\u201d The Court also concluded that \u201c[u]nder the policy at issue here, emotional distress can amount to \u2018bodily injury\u201d only if the \u2018mental anguish, mental injury\u2019 results from \u2018bodily injury.\u2019 \u201d The District Court next found \u201cno allegations and no supporting facts in Alsup\u2019s complaints or statement of claim that his claimed emotional distress was a result of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or that there were physical manifestations of his emotional distress\u201d and determined that Alsup did not suffer \u2018bodily injury\u201d under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">\u00b628 Landa claims that the policy\u2019s definition of \u2018bodily injury\u201d is ambiguous and should be construed against Assurance. Specifically, Landa argues that the limiting language \u201cresulting from bodily injury, sickness or disease\u201d can be read two ways, either qualifying only \u201cdeath\u201d or qualifying \u201cmental anguish, mental injury, shock, fright or death.\u201dLanda argues that if this ambiguity is construed in favor of the insured, physical manifestations of emotional distress are not required to constitute \u2018bodily injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">\u00b629 However, Coverage A clearly states that Landa\u2019s insurance only applies if claims for \u2018bodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d result from an \u201coccurrence.\u201d As we discussed above, we have concluded that Alsup\u2019s complaint did not allege an \u201coccurrence.\u201d Under the clear language of Coverage A, this finding alone establishes that Assurance did not have a duty to defend Landa. We therefore need not determine whether Alsup suffered \u2018bodily injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">\u00b630 <em>3. Did the District Court err by determining that Assurance did not have a duty to conduct an independent investigation of Landa\u2019s claim?</em></p>\n<p id=\"AJe\">\u00b631  Landa claims that Assurance had \u201can affirmative obligation to make an investigation of the claim\u201d pursuant to the Unfair Trade Practices Act. Landa specifically cites \u00a7 33-18-201(3) <em>&amp; </em>(4), MCA, which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-7\">A person may not, with such frequency as to indicate a general business practice, do any of the following: ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-8\">(3) fail to adopt and implement reasonable standards for the prompt investigation of claims arising under insurance policies;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-9\">(4) refuse to pay claims without conducting a reasonable investigation based upon all available information; ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">Assurance responds that the both UTPA and our case law show that where an insurer has a reasonable basis in law for denying a claim, an insurer is not liable under the UTPA. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">\u00b632 First, the UTPA does not apply to Assurance in this instance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>because Assurance possessed a reasonable basis in law for denying coverage. Section 33-18-242, MCA, sets out the requirements of an independent cause of action under the UTPA. Section 33-18-242(5), MCA, states that \u2018Ta]n insurer may not be held liable under this section if the insurer had a reasonable basis in law or in fact for contesting the claim or the amount of the claim, whichever is in issue.\u201d The District Court concluded that Assurance had a reasonable basis in law to deny coverage based on its conclusion that Alsup did not allege either an \u201coccurrence\u201d or \u2018bodily injury.\u201d Having also concluded that Alsup\u2019s claims did not allege an \u201coccurrence,\u201d we similarly find that Assurance is not liable under the UTPA pursuant to \u00a733-18-242(5), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">\u00b633 Our case law also contradicts Landa\u2019s claim that Assurance had an affirmative obligation to make an investigation of the claim. In <em>Revelation Industry, </em>2009 MT 123, 350 Mont. 184, 206 P.3d 919 we discussed when insurers may or may not look beyond the contents of the complaint when deciding their duty to defend. <em>Revelation Indus., </em>\u00b6 22. We outlined three general scenarios addressed by our jurisprudence: in Scenario (1), where the complaint clearly alleges facts that come within the coverage of the policy, we have held that the insurer is required to defend the insured without looking beyond the complaint; in Scenario (2), where the complaint alleges facts that do not come within the coverage of the policy and the insurer has no knowledge of any other facts, we have held that the insurer has no duty to defend the insured; and in Scenario (3), where the complaint alleges facts that come within the coverage of the policy, but the insurer knows of other facts that negate coverage, we have held that the insurer has no duty to defend. <em>Revelation Indus., </em>\u00b6 22. The present case most clearly aligns with Scenario 2. Landa tendered defense of Alsup\u2019s complaint twice. Both times, Landa attached the complaint. The second time, Landa also attached a statement of claim alleging Alsup suffered emotional distress and our opinion in <em>WagnerEllsworth. </em>There is no indication that Assurance had any other outside sources of information concerning Alsup\u2019s complaint. As discussed, neither Alsup\u2019s complaint, nor the statement of claim, contained an allegation of an \u201coccurrence\u201d sufficient to trigger a duty to defend. In this situation, \u2018if the allegations in the complaint clearly present an event or occurrence that is not covered under the policy, the insurer may refuse to defend.\u201d <em>Revelation Indus., </em>\u00b6 27 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"AKE\">\u00b634  Indeed, our opinion in <em>Revelation Industry </em>expressly declined to require that insurers seek out facts beyond the complaint. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>instead concluded that an insurer could not \u201csimply ignore factual information supplied to them by their insured but not alleged in the complaint or petition, where those facts would trigger a duty to defend.\u201d <em>Revelation </em>Indus., \u00b6 30. We expressly noted that \u201c[t]his does not require an insurer to seek out such information-as we have previously held, insurers that look at facts beyond the allegations in the complaint do so at their own risk as they will be required to defend and/or indemnify based on the information discovered.\u201d <em>Revelation </em>Indus., \u00b6 30; <em>see also Lloyd A. Twite Family P\u2019ship, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7-8,16; <em>Staples, </em>\u00b6 24. The facts alleged in Alsup\u2019s complaint were outside the policy\u2019s coverage, as Assurance correctly concluded. Landa\u2019s second tender of defense, with a statement of claim and our <em>Wagner-Ellsworth </em>case attached, did not provide facts sufficient to bring the claim within the policy\u2019s coverage, and Landa does not argue that Assurance possessed other information that would have triggered a duty to defend. Assurance therefore properly denied coverage based on the complaint and the information it possessed. <em>Revelation Indus., </em>\u00b6 30. We accordingly conclude that the District Court correctly determined that Assurance is not liable under the UTPA, that Assurance had a reasonable basis in law for denying coverage, and that Assurance was not obligated to make any further investigation before declining to defend Alsup\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">\u00b635 Alsup\u2019s complaint did not allege an \u201coccurrence\u201d and, as a result, did not trigger a duty to defend under the policy. Because of this, Assurance correctly declined to provide a defense and the District Court correctly granted summary judgment on Landa\u2019s claims. Further, our decision to affirm the District Court\u2019s order with regards to Issue One renders a decision regarding Issue Two superfluous.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">\u00b636 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b233-7\">JUSTICES BAKER, RICE, McKINNON and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b227-9\"> However, even if we did, Landa\u2019s foreign cases explicitly focus on determining whether <em>negligent </em>misrepresentation can be an occurrence, which is not the question we are addressing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
