The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court abused its discretion by adopting the class definition proposed by Rolan and denying New West\u2019s motion to modify the class <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">\u00b63 Dana Rolan was injured in a vehicular collision on November 16, 2007 and sustained serious injury, resulting in medical expenses totaling approximately $120,000. Rolan carried health insurance through New West. The tortfeasor who caused the accident carried liability insurance through Unitrin Services Group (Unitrin). Unitrin accepted legal responsibility and paid approximately $100,000 of Rolan\u2019s medical bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">\u00b64 The policy under which Rolan was insured stated that, in addition to the right of subrogation, New West had a right to be reimbursed for benefits it paid to an insured who also had recovered or settled with a third party. The policy also contained an exclusion for injuries covered by a medical payments provision of another liability carrier:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">5.30.10 LIABILITY INSURANCE POLICY MEDICAL PAYMENTS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-9\">Healthcare services to treat any injury are not covered services if you receive payments for that injury under a medical payments provision of a liability insurance policy, whether insured by an insurance company or self-insured. Examples of liability insurance policies to which this section applies include, but are not limited to, automobile, homeowner and business liability policies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">\u00b65 On January 26, 2010, Rolan filed a complaint against New West alleging individual and class claims for breach of contract, violation of made-whole rights, and unfair claims settlement practices under \u00a7\u00a733-18-201, MCA, etseq., authorizing punitive damages. Rolan alleged that New West failed to pay approximately $100,000 of her medical expenses because Unitrin, the third party liability carrier, had \u201cpaid the majority of the bills.\u201d Rolan sought to certify a class under M. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) for declaratory and injunctive relief arising from the claims for breach of contract and violation of made-whole rights. She sought certification under Rule 23(b)(3) for damages arising from New West\u2019s alleged unfair claims settlement practices. Although Rolan asserted that a class definition was unnecessary at that time, she proposed the following class parameters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-11\">(1) All class members were insured by New West for the period commencing eight years prior to filing of this suit through the date this Court will enter judgment on the merits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>(2) All members incurred medical costs due to the negligence or wrongdoing of a third party tortfeasor or tortfeasors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-4\">(3) For all members, New West avoided paying benefits because the tortfeasor or tortfeasors paid medical costs as part of tort damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">(4) For all members, New West failed to perform a \u201cmade-whole\u201d determination before avoiding payment of benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\u00b66 New West filed an Answer on July 7,2010, denying that it refused to pay Rolan\u2019s medical expenses and opposing class certification. New West argued that the class should not be certified because Plaintiffs did not meet the Rule 23(a) criteria and \u201cfailed to appropriately define a class of persons.\u201d On November 17, 2011, the District Court held a hearing on the motion for class certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">\u00b67 On April 25, 2012, the District Court granted Rolan\u2019s motion to certify the class complaint. The District Court determined that Rolan had met the Rule 23(a) certification requirements and, citing our decision in <em>Diaz v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Mont. (Diaz I), </em>2011 MT 322, 363 Mont. 151, 267 P.3d 756, rejected New West\u2019s argument that the class was imprecisely defined. In <em>Diaz I, </em>considering whether a class should have been certified alleging similar claims, we concluded that \u2018the prerequisites set forth in Rule 23(a) sufficiently define a class in this case, and any additional definition by this Court, at this time, is unnecessary.\u201d <em>Diaz I, </em>\u00b6 30.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">\u00b68 On May 4, 2012, the District Court issued an order certifying the class under Rule 23(b)(2) for declaratory and injunctive relief. The Certification Order contained a class definition that substantially mirrored the definition proposed in Rolan\u2019s complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-9\">(1) They were insured by New West at any time from January 26, 2002 (eight years preceding the filing of this lawsuit) through the date that this Court will ultimately enter judgment on the merits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-10\">(2) They incurred medical costs due to the negligence or wrongdoing of a third-party tortfeasor or tortfeasors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-11\">(3) Some or all of the medical costs were not paid by New West, but were paid by the tortfeasors or insurance covering damages caused by the tortfeasors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>(4) New West failed to perform a \u201cmade-whole\u201d determination before avoiding payment of benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">The court then clarified how that class definition was to be interpreted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnY\">The term \u201cavoiding payment of benefits,\u201d is intended to include situations where New West did not make payment of benefits because a tortfeasor was paying medical costs. It also includes situations where New West received reimbursement from medical providers when a tortfeasor commenced paying medical costs. It includes traditional subrogation which was achieved without first making a made-whole determination. Finally, it includes what might be characterized as de facto subrogation as described by the Montana Supreme Court in <em>State Auditor v. Blue Cross Blue Shield of MT, </em>2009 MT 318, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">\u00b69 In its order granting class certification, the District Court noted that New West employed a company called First Recovery Group to assist it in subrogating against third-party liability carriers through the following procedures:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">New West contracted with a Michigan company called First Recovery Group to identify which of New West\u2019s insured[s] might have been injured in an accident where a liability carrier was involved. If First Recovery identified a carrier, <em>it would direct the carrier to pay the medical bills, allowing New West to avoid payment. </em>If New West had already paid the bills, First Recovery would direct the liability carrier to reimburse New West.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvL\">(Emphasis added.) The plaintiffs alleged that those procedures would result in New West being either reimbursed by a provider who had been paid by a liability carrier or not paying an insured\u2019s medical bill if the liability carrier already paid it-in both cases allegedly without first determining that the insured had been made whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">\u00b610 On July 12,2012, New West moved, pursuant to Rule 23(c)(1)(C), to limit the class to those insureds who timely filed claims for benefits covered by New West. In support of the motion, New West noted that, following remand in <em>Diaz I, </em>First Judicial District Court Judge Jeffrey Sherlock considered similar arguments regarding the appropriate class definition and decided to confine the class to those insureds who had timely filed claims for benefits covered under the State\u2019s health insurance plan. New West argued that, \u201c[i]n the event this case proceeds with a substantially different class definition, there is a strong likelihood for divergent legal conclusions that may not be reconciled between this case and <em>Diaz.'New </em>West thus sought to limit the class definition to those insureds who had met the claim filing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>deadline:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-4\">(1) individuals insured by New West who timely submitted claims for covered benefits pursuant to the terms of their health insurance plan(s) for health care services that took place no earlier than eight years prior to the filing of the Complaint in this action, which is January 26, 2010;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">(2) who were injured through the legal fault of persons who have legal obligations to compensate them for all damages sustained; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">(3) who have not been made whole for their damages (or for whom New West conducted no made whole analysis) because New West has programmatically failed to pay benefits for their covered medical costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">\u00b611 Rolan objected to modification of the class definition on grounds that New West\u2019s \u2018billing procedures and insurance practices\u201d would prevent numerous insureds from filing their claims with New West. Rolan stated that an insured generally submits claims to the medical provider, who in turn decides whether to bill New West or another liability carrier. Rolan also referred to New West\u2019s employment of First Recovery Group \u201cto get tortfeasors to pay rather than New West[.]\u201d She suggested, therefore, that New West was \u201cdirectly or indirectly encouraging its preferred providers to bill the tortfeasor,\u201d such that New West would not receive the claim when a liability carrier was involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">\u00b612 On September 17, 2012, the District Court denied New West\u2019s motion to modify the class definition. The court stated that it agreed with Rolan that \u2018if New West\u2019s customer service instructs their insureds to send their bills to the tortfeasor\u2019s liability carrier, no claim for benefits would be made to New West, thus defeating or compromising the insureds\u2019 made-whole rights.\u201dNew West appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">\u00b613 We review class certification orders for an abuse of discretion. <em>Chipman v. N. W. Healthcare </em>Corp., 2012 MT 242, \u00b6 17, 366 Mont. 450, 288 P.3d 193. We consider \u201cnot whether this Court would have reached the same decision, but whether the district court acted arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason.\u201d <em>Chipman, </em>\u00b6 17 (quoting <em>Newman v. Lichfield, 2012 </em>MT 47, \u00b6 22, 364 Mont. 243, 272 P.3d 625) (internal quotation marks omitted). A district court\u2019s class certification decision \u201cshould be accorded the greatest respect because it is in the best position to consider the most fair and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>efficient procedure for conducting any given litigation.\u201d <em>Chipman, </em>\u00b6 17 <em>(citing Diaz I, </em>\u00b6 10 and <em>Sieglock v. Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co., </em>2003 MT 355, \u00b68, 319 Mont. 8, 81 P.3d 495). A court abuses its discretion \u201cif its certification order is premised on legal error.\u201d <em>Mattson v. Mont. Power Co., </em>2012 MT 318, \u00b6 17, 368 Mont. 1, 291 P.3d 1209 (quoting <em>Hawkins v. Comparet-Cassani, </em>251 F.3d 1230, 1237 (9th Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">\u00b614 <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion by adopting the class definition proposed by Rolan and denying New West\u2019s motion to modify the class definition.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\u00b615 Our decision today in <em>Diaz II </em>addresses a substantially similar issue to that New West raises here, though in a slightly varied procedural posture. In <em>Diaz II, </em>the class plaintiffs sought review of Judge Sherlock\u2019s decision to limit the class to insureds who timely filed claims for covered benefits under the State\u2019s health insurance plan. This Court affirmed the District Court\u2019s narrower choice of class definition, based in part on the deferential standard of review we apply to interlocutory class action appeals. We reiterated that \"an appellate court\u2019s review under the abuse of discretion standard is limited to whether the court \u2018acted arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of <em>reason,\u2019\u2019\u2019Diaz II, </em>\u00b6 21 (quoting <em>Chipman, </em>\u00b6 17), and stated that \u201c[w]e are particularly reluctant to interfere with discretionary orders in the early stages of litigation.\u201d <em>Diaz II, </em>\u00b6 21 <em>(citing Hegwood v. Mont. Fourth Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>2003 MT 200, \u00b6 16, 317 Mont. 30, 75 P.3d 308). We emphasized that a district court has broad authority in assessing the manageability of a class action and, under M. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)(C), maintains discretion to modify the class definition at any time until final judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-7\">Issues bearing on the overall manageability of a class action properly are considered throughout the class action proceedings and fall particularly within the purview of the district court. <em>Blanton v. Dept. of Pub. Health and Hum. Servs., </em>2011 MT 110, \u00b6 38, 360 Mont. 396, 255 P.3d 1229 (citing <em>Sieglock, </em>\u00b6 8).... As is well-established, district courts have \u2018broad discretion in determining issues relating to trial administration.\u201d <em>Fink v. Williams, </em>2012 MT 304, \u00b6 18, 367 Mont. 431, 291 P.3d 1140. In exercising that discretion in the class action context, a district court \u201cmay consider any factor that the parties offer or the court deems appropriate to consider.\u201d <em>Blanton, </em>\u00b6 38.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Additionally, class action certification orders \u201care not frozen once made\u201d; instead, the District Court maintains discretion to alter the class definition as the case proceeds. <em>Amgen Inc. v. Conn. Ret. Plans &amp; Trust </em>Funds,_U.S._, 133 S. Ct. 1184, 1202 n. 9 (2013) (\u2018Rule 23 empowers district courts to \u2018alter or amend\u2019 class-certification orders based on the circumstances developing as the case unfolds.\u201d) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1) and 23(c)(1)(C)); <em>see Howe v. Townsend, </em>588 F.3d 24, 39 (1st Cir. 2009) (\u2018Courts can amend certification orders to reflect major changes or minor adjustments to the class.\u201d) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)(C)). Accordingly, Plaintiffs may seek to alter or amend the class definition as discovery progresses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-6\"><em>Diaz II, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 27-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">\u00b616 Importantly, the same principles apply here. We now consider defendant New West\u2019s contention that the District Court\u2019s choice of class definition constituted an abuse of discretion on grounds that the current definition (1) is imprecise, (2) improperly diverges from the definition adopted by Judge Sherlock following remand in <em>Diaz I, </em>and (3) will necessitate de-certification of the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">\u00b617 <em>1. Whether the class definition is imprecise.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">\u00b618 New West argues that \u201cidentifying class members who never submitted claims requires proof of legal and factual issues that are not readily determinable.\u201d According to New West, the class parameters are not sufficiently precise because the District Court did not define the term \u201cavoiding payment of benefits.\u201d New West suggests that it cannot be held accountable for avoiding payment to an insured who did not file a claim. Citing <em>Polich v. Burlington N., Inc., </em>116 F.R.D. 258, 261 (D. Mont. 1987), New West thus argues that the class cannot be defined \u201cusing objective criteria.\u201d Additionally, if the broad class definition is used, New West argues that Rolan would be an inadequate representative of the class claims because her experience varies factually from that of other class members. New West contends that in Rolan\u2019s case, New West was alleged to have \u2018improperly accepted reimbursements from providers who were double paid for Rolan\u2019s medical expenses,\u201dbut the District Court broadened the class to include any circumstances where \u2018New West failed to perform a \u2018made-whole\u2019 determination before avoiding payment of benefits.\u201dNew West again denies that it avoided paying Rolan\u2019s claims and contends that it did not fail to perform a made-whole analysis because \u2018it never asserted a claim for subrogation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">\u00b619 As Rolan suggests, our decision in <em>Diaz I </em>disposes of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>arguments. There, named plaintiffs Diaz and Hoffman-Bernhardt were insured under the State group insurance plan and suffered injuries in vehicular collisions caused by insured tortfeasors. They filed a class complaint alleging that the State and the third-party administrators of the State\u2019s group health insurance plan-Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Montana (BCBS) and New West-exercised their subrogation rights without conducting made-whole analyses of the insureds. As in Rolan\u2019s case, the State through its third-party administrator, BCBS, allegedly refused to pay Diaz for medical expenses already paid to her medical provider by the tortfeasor\u2019s insurer. Under a factual scenario that varies only slightly from Rolan\u2019s, New West allegedly refused to pay Hoffman-Bernhardt the reimbursement it already had received from her medical providers following payment by the tortfeasor\u2019s insurer to the medical providers. <em>See Diaz II, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 4-6. Employing a class definition essentially identical in scope to the one at issue here, the District Court initially determined that Plaintiffs failed to meet the Rule 23 criteria. <em>Diaz I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6, 28. The plaintiffs appealed and we reversed the order denying class certification, though we affirmed the court\u2019s decision that the third-party administrators were not liable under the made-whole laws. <em>Diaz I, </em>\u00b6 26. As in this case, the defendants, relying on <em>Polich, </em>argued on appeal that the class had been imprecisely defined.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Diaz I, </em>\u00b6 29. This Court rejected that argument, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae-\">First ... it is clear the members of the class will be individuals insured under the State plan, just like Diaz and HoffmannBernhardt. Second, the prerequisites set forth in Rule 23(a) sufficiently define a class in this case, and any additional definition by this Court, at this time, is unnecessary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-4\"><em>Diaz I, </em>\u00b6 30. Because the class was sufficiently precise for purposes of certification, we remanded the case for further proceedings and did not consider any other arguments regarding suitability of the class parameters. <em>See Diaz II, </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">\u00b620 Rolan also cites <em>Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Mont., Inc. v. Mont. State Auditor, </em>2009 MT 318, 352 Mont. 423, 218 P.3d 475, in arguing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>that the class definition is sufficiently precise. There, we affirmed a decision of the Montana State Auditor and Commissioner of Insurance to disapprove the coverage exclusions contained in BCBS\u2019s insurance forms. <em>State Auditor, </em>\u00b6 1. We recognized that the exclusions \u2018Violate Montana statutory and case law on subrogation\u201d because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-4\">The exclusions allow BCBS to avoid any payment of benefits to its insured if the insured is \u201centitled to receive\u201d benefits from any other auto or premises liability policy, whether or not the insured actually receives any of those benefits, and whether or not the insured has been made whole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-5\"><em>State Auditor, </em>\u00b6 19. While that case was not a class action and thus did not discuss class definition, we agree with Rolan that the language supports the District Court\u2019s inclusion in the class of members for whom New West \u201cavoid[ed] payment of benefits\u201d without first conducting made-whole analyses of its insureds. The District Court adequately explained the parameters for determining whether New West was \u201cavoiding payment\u201d to keep the class definition from becoming amorphous.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">\u00b621 In summary, New West\u2019s policy exclusion is comparable to those discussed in <em>State Auditor </em>and <em>Diaz I, </em>both of which, like this case, involved allegations that the insurer is withholding payment to the insured-of either the reimbursement or the covered benefits. Additionally, Rolan\u2019s experience is comparable to that of the named plaintiffs in <em>Diaz I, </em>where we concluded that a similarly broad class definition was adequately precise to certify the class. That conclusion also applies in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">\u00b622 <em>2. Whether the class definition improperly diverges from the definition adopted by Judge Sherlock following our remand in </em>Diaz I.</p>\n<p id=\"Aol\">\u00b623 Following our remand in <em>Diaz I, </em>the State requested the district court in that case to modify the class definition under Rule 23(c)(1)(C) to, among other things, include the one-year filing limitation applicable for receipt of benefits under the terms of the State\u2019s group insurance plan. As already noted, Judge Sherlock\u2019s certification order narrowed the class definition by including the filing limitation and we have affirmed that decision today in <em>Diaz II. </em>Judge Sherlock\u2019s choice of class definition appeared to be based on the State\u2019s argument that, of the approximately 32,000 individuals insured under the State\u2019s plan, a large number failed to file their claims with the State and there appeared to be no manageable means by which the non-filing insureds could be identified. Even if they could be identified, the State argued that their eligibility for class membership would require innumerable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>mini-trials to determine which of those non-filing insureds failed to file as a direct result of the policy exclusion, rather than for other reasons. <em>See Diaz II, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">\u00b624 We reemphasize that, under the abuse of discretion standard of review, district courts may reach different determinations of substantially similar questions, as long as neither court has \u201cacted arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason.\u201d <em>Chipman, </em>\u00b6 17. We do not consider whether we would have reached the same decision. <em>Chipman, </em>\u00b6 17. While we affirmed Judge Sherlock\u2019s choice of the narrower class definition in <em>Diaz II, </em>our decision in <em>Diaz I </em>made clear that the class also could have been certified under the broader definition. We stated that \u201ccertification \u00a1orders are not frozen once made.\u201d <em>Diaz II, </em>\u00b6 28. Instead, under Rule 23(c)(1)(C), the District Court maintains discretion to alter or amend the class definition at any time until final judgment. The same is true here. New West may seek to modify the class definition as discovery progresses.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">\u00b625 The District Court in this case considered a different record from that presented to the court in <em>Diaz II, </em>and the two courts defined the classes in response to the particular arguments supporting the parties\u2019 proposed class definitions in each case. We disagree with New West\u2019s contention that the record fails to support divergence from Judge Sherlock\u2019s choice of class definition. The State argued on remand following <em>Diaz I </em>that identification of the non-filing insureds eligible for class membership was highly burdensome, perhaps impossible, because there was no record of which insureds had failed to file due to the involvement of another liability carrier. <em>Diaz II, </em>\u00b6 25. Here, Rolan offered evidence that New West hired First Recovery Group specifically for the purpose of identifying insureds whose injuries were covered by other liability carriers, and to assist New West in exercising its subrogation right against the other insurers-allegedly without first made-whole analyses.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">\u00b626  New West\u2019s appellate argument focuses on whether the class definition is sufficiently precise-a question we addressed in <em>Diaz </em>I-and has not persuaded us at this stage in the proceeding that identification of class members will be overly burdensome or impossible in this case. The District Court acted within its discretion in determining that the broader class definition should be used in light of Rolan\u2019s evidence supporting her claim that New West used practices and procedures \u201cto get tortfeasors to pay rather than New West.\u201d <em>See Diaz I, </em>\u00b6 47; <em>State Auditor, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>\u00b627 <em>3. Whether the class definition necessitates de-certification of the class.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">\u00b628 The foregoing analysis makes clear that the District Court\u2019s class definition does not require decertification of the class as the case now stands. New West argues that a class that includes both filing and non-filing insureds \u201ccannot meet the remaining requirements of Rule 23(a) and (b) because it is not properly defined.\u201d In particular, New West asserts that, as the class is defined, its members do not share a common question of law or fact under Rule 23(a)(2), but it has not appealed the District Court\u2019s determination of the Rule 23(a) and (b) prerequisites. We already decided in <em>Diaz I </em>that a class of similar parameters met the Rule 23(a) and (b)(2) certification criteria.
