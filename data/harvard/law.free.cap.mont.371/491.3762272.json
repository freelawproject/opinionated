Aker appeals his conviction on the grounds that the prosecutor committed plain error during closing argument and that Aker\u2019s counsel provided ineffective assistance during the trial. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">\u00b63 1. <em>Whether plain error review should be exercised to grant Aker a</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">\n<em>new trial on his claim of prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">\u00b64 2. <em>Whether Aker received ineffective assistance of counsel due to his counsel\u2019s failure to object to hearsay testimony that bolstered the victim\u2019s credibility.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">\u00b65 On June 10, 2010, the Powell County Attorney filed an information charging Aker with one count of sexual intercourse without consent, a felony, in violation of \u00a745-5-503(1), MCA, and two misdemeanor charges that are not at issue in this appeal. The felony count alleged that between November 1,2009, and December 31,2009, Aker engaged in sexual intercourse without consent with C.Y. The date of the offense was in dispute, but alleged to have been near C.Y.\u2019s twelfth birthday, which was in late November 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-12\">\u00b66 As is common in cases alleging sexual contact with a minor child, the defendant was well known to the alleged victim and there were no eyewitnesses to the event. As such, the outcome of the trial depended on who the jury believed. Each party called numerous witnesses in its case in chief and both sides conducted vigorous cross-examination in order to undermine the other\u2019s theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-13\">\u00b67 At trial, C.Y. testified that in November or December of2009, she was babysitting L.L., her cousin, and several other small children, at her cousin\u2019s house. When she arrived at the house, L.L.\u2019s mother Amie and stepfather Donald, as well as two other adults, were making dinner for the children. At some point after dinner, all of the adults left the house, leaving C.Y. in charge. After C.Y. had put the children to sleep, she testified that she went downstairs to watch a Hannah Montana television show.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>\u00b68 Aker previously had dated C.Y.\u2019s aunt, and C.Y. testified that \u2018he was like an uncle\u201d to her. While C.Y. lay on the couch watching television in her pajamas, Aker entered the room. C.Y. testified that he walked over to her, pulled down her pajama pants and underwear, and \u201cput his first two fingers inside [her vagina]\u201d while \u2018he had the other hand on [her] chest.\u201d C.Y. pretended that she was sleeping during the incident, which she stated lasted for twenty minutes; afterwards, Aker washed his hands and, before leaving, he told C.Y. that she \u201ccouldn\u2019t tell anyone or [she] would get in trouble and he would too.\u201d C.Y. then went to the bathroom and, when she wiped herself, she discovered that she was bleeding, which scared her. For several weeks, C.Y. did not tell anyone what had happened because she felt like she had done something wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">\u00b69 C.Y. testified that, eventually, she confided in her mother\u2019s best friend, Cari, and told her what Aker had done. Cari testified that C.Y. gave her a \u201cfull account\u201d of what happened. Cari\u2019s recollection of her conversation with C.Y. was consistent with C.Y.\u2019s testimony, with some differences. Cari testified that C.Y. told her that she and Aker had a short conversation before he \u201cwalked over and he kind of grabbed her by the shoulders ... and laid her down on the couch.\u201d Cari also recalled that C.Y. said that she struggled, and Aker told her \u201cthis is normal,\u201d before unbuttoning her pants. C.Y. also told Cari that the incident lasted half an hour and that she waited until she heard Aker\u2019s car leave before she used the bathroom. Aker\u2019s attorney did not object as Cari relayed what C.Y. had told her. Cari also testified about the conversation she subsequently had with C.Y.\u2019s mother, Jennifer.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">\u00b610 The State called Jennifer as its next witness. Although C.Y. has never spoken with her mother about what Aker did to her, Jennifer did testify about her phone conversation with Cari after C.Y. informed Cari of what had happened. Jennifer testified that Cari told her that C.Y. \u2018had been sexually molested... [by] Jim Aker.\u2019\u2019Aker\u2019s attorney did not object as Jennifer recalled what Cari previously had told her on the telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">\u00b611 After Jennifer testified, the State called Dr. Michelle Corbin, an expert in family medicine. Dr. Corbin testified that Powell County Sheriff Scott Howard referred C.Y. to her and that she performed a sexual abuse examination of C.Y. nearly two months after the assault. Dr. Corbin explained that C.Y. had described the incident to her-fehat it was a one-time event that lasted for twenty minutes and that Aker had penetrated her vagina with two fingers. Dr. Corbin also explained that, even though she did not find any physical evidence of the assault, that did not surprise her and it did not call into question the veracity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>of C.Y.\u2019s account because such an injury usually heals within twenty-four to forty-eight hours. Aker\u2019s attorney did not object during Dr. Corbin\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">\u00b612 Next, the State called Kristi Rydeen, a licensed clinical professional counselor, to testify. In addition to testifying about C.Y.\u2019s general demeanor during counseling sessions, Rydeen testified that C.Y. told her about \u2018the incident of abuse perpetuated by Jimmie Aker.\u201d On redirect, the prosecutor asked Rydeen, Ti]n your discussions with [C.Y.] did she reference or did you find any other trauma that would explain the symptoms you were observing and having been reported, other than sexual abuse by [Aker]?\u201d Rydeen responded \u201cno.\u201d Aker\u2019s attorney did not object to those statements identifying Aker as the assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">\u00b613 The defense theory was that Aker could not have committed the crime because he \u201cdidn\u2019t go to that house\u201d on the night C.Y. was there and because, due to a recent back injury, he physically was incapable of being in the position C.Y. claimed he took during the assault. Though he did not object to their direct testimony, Aker\u2019s counsel cross-examined the State\u2019s witnesses about certain details in C.Y.\u2019s statements to them to illuminate inconsistencies. For example, he established that C.Y. had related different dates when the offense occurred, whether Aker was standing, kneeling, or on the couch when he assaulted her, where his hands were on her upper body, and whether any of the adults had come home while she was still awake. He also brought out through the State\u2019s witnesses other issues and circumstances in C.Y.\u2019s life as alternative explanations for her anxiety and nightmares, including, in part, bullying at school and by her brother and having a father in jail and a mother in military combat duty overseasr</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">\u00b614 In his case in chief, Aker called Sheriff Howard to testify about prior inconsistent statements C.Y. made to Howard regarding the date on which the incident occurred and what Aker had told her that night. Under questioning by Aker\u2019s counsel, Howard acknowledged that C.Y. had mistakenly or erroneously alleged that Aker saw her and waved to her during a community gathering months after the assault; an investigation determined that it could not have been Aker. On cross-examination by the State, Howard testified about additional statements C.Y. made during the interview that were consistent with C.Y.\u2019s trial testimony. Aker\u2019s attorney did not object to that testimony. \u00b615 Aker also presented evidence that C.Y. only stayed the night at her cousin\u2019s house on one occasion in November and December of2009. Aker called three adult witnesses who shared the home-L.L.\u2019s mother, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>Amie, L.L.\u2019s step-father, Donald, and Donald\u2019s sister, Angela. All three testified that they were friends with Aker, that C.Y. stayed overnight at the house only one time during the period charged, and that Aker did not visit the house on that night. Aker also called nine-year-old L.L., who testified that C.Y. had only spent the night at her house once, that Aker was not there that night, and that she never told C.Y. that Aker had touched her. That statement contradicted the testimony of Mary Pat Hansen, a nurse practitioner who had conducted a forensic interview of C.Y. and testified in the State\u2019s case in chief. Hansen acknowledged on cross-examination that C.Y. reported to her that L.L. told C.Y. that Aker also had \u201ctouched her\u201d in her \u201cprivate spots.\u201d Aker also introduced testimony, including his own, that he could not have sexually assaulted C.Y. in the manner that she described because he was recovering from a severe back injury in November and December of 2009. The State attempted to discredit Aker\u2019s witnesses, pointing out that they all were very close friends and that Aker spent considerable time at their home during the time period in question, when both he and Amie were off work recovering from injuries. The State impeached Amie with evidence that she had lied about whether she sustained her injury from an assault at work or a slip and fall.</p>\n<p id=\"AMs\">\u00b616 In closing arguments, the prosecutor argued that C.Y. was a credible witness because the core details of the statements she provided to Cari, Sheriff Howard, Dr. Corbin and Rydeen were consistent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-4\">And what you heard when she testified is that the core, core details about Mr. Aker coming into that home when the kids were sleeping, walking across that room, coming up to her while Hannah Montana was on, sexually assaulting her, pushing her down, placing his fingers in her. Those core details have never changed. Hannah Montana was always on tv every time she told the story.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">Those core details, the details that we would expect a child to remember, the blood, the spotting, the blood, those details have never ever changed. How in the world would [C.Y.] discuss blood in these interviews, the spotting afterwards, wiping herself when Mr. Aker left the house; unless this actually happened.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">\u00b617 After recounting the evidence and discussing C.Y.\u2019s testimony and her demeanor in the courtroom, the prosecutor argued that C.Y.\u2019s testimony was truthful:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-7\">I\u2019d ask you to consider this, Ladies and Gentlemen, that this case is not overly complicated, it\u2019s rather simple. I ask you to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>this; that when [C.Y.] came into the courtroom and told you her story, that she did so for the simple reason that she was telling you the truth; no motive, no other reason.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">\u00b618 The prosecutor contrasted C.Y.\u2019s allegedly truthful testimony with the testimony of the defense witnesses. He argued that, in spite of a bad back, Aker was capable of doing many things and could have committed the act alleged, and that Aker\u2019s friends had \u201c[come] into this courtroom and lied\u201d when they stated that Aker did not visit the house the one night C.Y. was there:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">[Y]ou need to look at these people that testified. Certainly they had a strong, strong motive to lie. And it\u2019s really, it\u2019s kind of, if you knew what was going on in the case, it\u2019s pretty unsophisticated really. I mean it\u2019s an unsophisticated lie. \u2018We all just say that we were there that night, and we never left, we never left that night. We\u2019ll just say that.\u2019 And that Jim Aker never came over. Pretty unsophisticated. \u2018That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to remember.\u2019 \u2018Let\u2019s just all remember that, that we never left that night\u2019. Pretty unsophisticated. It\u2019s not really hard to remember that part of it. And I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re unsophisticated, I\u2019m saying the lie is unsophisticated. \u2018That we just say we were there that night.\u2019 Like very, very powerful if you believe it. That unsophisticated lie has the power to rob [C.Y.] of justice for the rest of her life. So we think about this case. Look at their testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">\u00b619 The prosecutor elaborated on the credibility of the defense witnesses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-7\">So it\u2019s very important that you assess ... the credibility of those three people. And keep in mind that idea, [because] we\u2019re all in from different parts of society, from different social stratus [sic]. Think about those people. I don\u2019t want to disparage them anymore, but these are people who couldn\u2019t be asked to take the gum out of their mouth when they were testifying, to change into jeans in the courtroom, to wear something other than sweats and sandals. In that group of people where you\u2019re unemployed and collecting unemployment or workers\u2019 comp, and you play video games all day, that, there is a nobility for them in the idea that you protect your innocent friend. You rally around him. The problem with that, Ladies and Gentlemen, is that by doing so they are attempting to rob that little girl of the justice that she requires, the justice that we all require. And that\u2019s why we can\u2019t let it go, and that\u2019s why we have to tell you that they\u2019re not being truthful.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Am_\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>So it\u2019s not about them just protecting their friend too. Let\u2019s also consider their own self-interest. Consider this, how much would they want to admit, and again I have to draw you back to their social strata. How much would they want to admit that on that Friday night when they were staying up until 2:00 o\u2019clock in the morning. We didn\u2019t ask them what they were doing, we didn\u2019t ask them if they were drinking or if they were doing drugs, I think we knew that they would say \u2018no\u2019. But how much would they want to admit that they left on that Friday night, their two, 2 year old kids alone, even asleep, and little 8 year old [L.L.], and left her in the care of a 12 year old girl? That\u2019s their own self-interest. Do you think they\u2019re cognizant of maybe Child Protective Services hearing about that? So it\u2019s not just them protecting their friend. They\u2019ve got their own reasons to protect themselves.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">\u00b620 Aker\u2019s counsel did not object to any of these statements. Before concluding, the prosecutor reminded the jury that his argument \u2018isn\u2019t evidence. If I said anything here, if you think in any way that I misstated the evidence, disregard it. It\u2019s your job to. I don\u2019t get to testify.\u201d The jury returned a guilty verdict. Aker appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">\u00b621 We generally \u201cdo not address issues of prosecutorial misconduct pertaining to a prosecutor\u2019s statements not objected to at <em>trial.\u201dState v. Longfellow, </em>2008 MT 343, \u00b6 24, 346 Mont. 286, 194 P.3d 694. We may review such an issue, however, under the plain error doctrine. State <em>v. Lacey, 2012 </em>MT 52, \u00b6 14, 364 Mont. 291, 272 P.3d 1288. We apply plain error review only \u2018in situations that implicate a defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights when failing to review the alleged error may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>State v. McDonald, </em>2013 MT 97, \u00b6 8, 369 Mont. 483, 299 P.3d 799 (citing <em>State v. Hayden, </em>2008 MT 274, \u00b6 17, 345 Mont. 252, 190 P.3d 1091). The decision to invoke plain error review is \u201ca discretionary one.\u201d <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">\u00b622 \u201cOnly record-based ineffective assistance of counsel claims are considered on direct appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Howard, </em>2011 MT 246, \u00b6 18, 362 Mont. 196, 265 P.3d 606. To the extent such claims are reviewable, \u201cthey present mixed questions of law and fact that we review de novo.\u201d <em>Howard, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">\u00b623 <em>1. Whether plain error review should be exercised to grant Aker a new trial on his claim of prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">\u00b624 Both the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution guarantee criminal defendants \u201cthe right to a fair trial by a jury.\u201d <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 27. A prosecutor\u2019s misconduct \u201cmay be grounds for reversing a conviction and granting a new trial if the conduct deprives the defendant of a fair and impartial trial.\u201d <em>McDonald, </em>\u00b6 10 (quoting <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 27). We \u201cconsider alleged improper statements during closing argument in the context of the entire argument.\u201d <em>State v. Makarchuk, </em>2009 MT 82, \u00b6 24, 349 Mont. 507, 204 P.3d 1213. We do not presume prejudice from the alleged prosecutorial misconduct; rather, the \u201cdefendant must show that the argument violated his substantial rights.\u201d <em>McDonald, </em>\u00b6 10 (quoting <em>Makarchuk, </em>\u00b6 24).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">\u00b625 Aker contends that \u201cthe State improperly commented on witness credibility\u201d during closing arguments in contravention of his right to a fair trial by characterizing C.Y.\u2019s testimony as truthful and by portraying the defense witnesses as liars and unproductive members of society. Although he recognizes that his attorney did not object to any of the comments he claims were improper, Aker argues that plain error review is warranted under <em>State v. Hayden. </em>The State counters that declining to review the alleged misconduct would not result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the fundamental fairness of the trial, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process. Instead, the State argues that the prosecutor \u201cappropriately explained to the jury that it would have to resolve issues of credibility\u201d and further explained \u201cwhat factors it could consider in doing so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">\u00b626 An attorney \u2018invades the jury\u2019s province and engages in highly improper behavior when [he] characterizes the defendant or witnesses as liars or offers personal opinions on a witness\u2019s <em>credibility.\u201dState v. Racz, </em>2007 MT 244, \u00b6 36, 339 Mont. 218, 168 P.3d 685 (citing <em>State v. Hanson, </em>283 Mont. 316, 326, 940 P.2d 1166, 1172 (1997)); <em>see also </em>Mont. R. Prof. Cond. 3.4(e) (lawyer shall not state personal opinion as to the credibility of a witness). On the other hand, \u2018it is proper \u2018to comment on conflicts and contradictions in testimony, as well as to comment on the evidence presented and suggest to the jury inferences which maybe drawn therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Daniels, </em>2003 MT247, \u00b6 26, 317 Mont. 331, 77 P.3d 224 (quoting State <em>v. Gladue, </em>1999 MT 1, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 293 Mont. 1, 972 P.2d 827). Moreover, to properly preserve the issue for appeal, \u201cthe defendant must make a timely objection or it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>considered waived.\u201d <em>Racz, </em>\u00b6 36 (citing \u00a746-20-104(2), MCA); <em>see also State v. Rose, </em>2009 MT 4, \u00b6 106, 348 Mont. 291, 202 P.3d 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">\u00b627 As we recently discussed in <em>McDonald, </em>although a prosecutor must avoid offering personal opinion, comment is appropriate \u201con \u2018the gravity of the crime charged, the volume of evidence, credibility of witnesses, inferences to be drawn from various phases of evidence, and legal principles involved\u2019 \u201din the instructions to the jury. <em>McDonald, </em>\u00b6 14 (quoting <em>State v. Green, </em>2009 MT 114, \u00b6 33, 350 Mont. 141, 205 P.3d 798). A prosecutor\u2019s argument is not plain error if made in the context of discussing the evidence presented and how it should be used to evaluate a witness\u2019s testimony under the principles set forth in the jury instructions. <em>McDonald, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">\u00b628 Aker\u2019s reliance on <em>Hayden </em>is unpersuasive. While we faulted the prosecutor in that case for voicing his \u201copinions during closing arguments regarding the credibility of witnesses,\u201d <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 29, our decision was based on \u201cmultiple errors committed by the prosecutor.\u201d <em>McDonald, </em>\u00b6 12. Most notably, the prosecutor had elicited what amounted to expert opinion testimony from its law enforcement witness that the victim and another key fact witness were telling the truth. In closing argument, the prosecutor then told the jury it could \u201crely on\u201d the officer and that both the officer and the victim were \u2018believable.\u201d <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 32. Additionally, the prosecutor improperly testified \u2018by vouching for the efficacy of the search of [the defendant\u2019s] residence\u201d and by \u201cstating his opinion that a scale found in the residence was used for drugs.\u201d <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6 32. We invoked plain error review because the cumulative effects of these instances of prosecutorial misconduct \u201c[left] unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the proceedings.\u201d <em>Hayden, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 29-33; <em>see also McDonald, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">\u00b629 As the State points out, there are numerous instances in which we have refused to conduct plain error review of a prosecutor\u2019s comments regarding witness credibility in closing arguments, even in cases where we have concluded that the comments were improper. We declined review, for example, when a prosecutor categorized a defense witness \u201cas a \u2018liar,\u2019 while arguing the State\u2019s evidence was genuine and truthful[.]\u201d <em>State v.

Aker points to no other case where we invoked plain error review on these grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">\u00b631  Since there were no witnesses to the claimed encounter, the entire trial of this case was about who was telling the truth. As the prosecutor argued, the jury either could believe twelve-year-old C.Y. or could believe Aker and his three friends. Though the prosecutor used the word \u201clie,\u201d defense counsel had used that same word in questioning Aker\u2019s witnesses whether they had \u201ccook[ed] up a story\u201d to protect their friend and whether they would \u2018lie for Jimmie [Aker] even though he\u2019s [like] family.\u201d The prosecutor tied his remarks to evidence presented at trial and to the court\u2019s instruction that, in determining witness credibility, the jury was to consider \u201cevery matter in evidence that tends to indicate whether a witness is worthy of belief.\u201d Each party\u2019s closing argument focused on why the jury should believe that party\u2019s witnesses and not those of the other side. Without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>parsing each of the prosecutor\u2019s comments, in the final analysis-having reviewed the trial transcript and considered the comments in the context of the entire argument and in light of the specific evidence presented by both sides-we are not convinced that failure to review Aker\u2019s claims will result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the fundamental fairness of his trial, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process. By failing contemporaneously to object to the prosecutor\u2019s comments concerning witness credibility, Aker waived his right to do so on appeal. Rose, \u00b6 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">\u00b632 2. <em>Whether Aker received ineffective assistance of counsel due to his counsel\u2019s failure to object to hearsay testimony that bolstered the victim\u2019s credibility.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">\u00b633 Aker contends that his lead trial attorney, William Hooks, provided ineffective assistance of counsel when he failed to object at numerous points during the trial, including: (1) when Cari, Jennifer, and Sheriff Howard testified about statements C.Y. made describing the alleged abuse; (2) when Dr. Corbin testified about statements that C.Y. made to her describing the abuse; (3) when Dr. Corbin testified that the lack of any physical findings two months after the assault did not \u2018have any reflection on the veracity of [C.Y.\u2019s] report\u201d because C.Y.\u2019s injuries would have healed within a few days; and (4) when Rydeen testified that C.Y. had identified Aker as the perpetrator during counseling sessions. Aker contends that \u201ca failure to raise an objection, generally, has been deemed record based, and therefore appropriate for direct appeal.\u201d The State counters that \u201cthere is a plausible explanation for defense counsel\u2019s decision not to object.\u201dThe State argues that Hooks\u2019s lack of objection reflected a broader trial strategy designed to allow Aker to expose \u201cinconsistencies in C.Y.\u2019s prior statements in order to highlight those inconsistencies to the jury during cross examination of the State\u2019s adult witnesses\u201d without directly cross-examining the young victim about discrepancies in her story.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">\u00b634 The right to effective assistance of counsel is guaranteed by both the United States and Montana Constitutions. <em>State v. Kougl, </em>2004 MT 243, \u00b6 11, 323 Mont. 6, 97 P.3d 1095. Before reaching the merits of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim in a direct appeal, we \u201cmust first determine whether the allegations are properly before the Court on appeal or whether the claim should be raised in a petition for post-conviction relief\u2019pursuant to \u00a746-21-101, MCA. <em>State </em>v. Upshaw, 2006 MT 341, \u00b6 33, 335 Mont. 162, 153 P.3d 579. To make this determination, we ask \u201c\u2018why\u2019 counsel did or did not perform as alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>and then seek to answer the question by reference to the record.\u201d <em>Howard, </em>\u00b6 21 (quoting <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 14). If the claim is based on matters outside of the record, Ve will refuse to address the issue on appeal.\u201d <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 14. Only through a petition for postconviction relief may the record be developed to explain \u201cwhy\u201d counsel acted as alleged, which then allows a reviewing court to determine \u201cwhether counsel\u2019s performance was ineffective or merely a tactical decision.\u201d <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 14. \u00b635 We have regarded an alleged failure to object to witness testimony as \u201crecord-based, and therefore appropriate for direct appeal.\u201d <em>State v. White, </em>2001 MT 149, \u00b6 15, 306 Mont. 58, 30 P.3d 340. We also have recognized, however, that \u201cdecisions regarding the timing and number of objections lie within counsel\u2019s tactical discretion, which would indicate that non-record based information explaining the tactic may be involved, and thus should be barred from review on direct appeal.\u201d <em>White, </em>\u00b6 16 (citing <em>State v. Brown, </em>228 Mont. 209, 212, 741 P.2d 428, 430 (1987)). If the record does not \u2018fully explain\u201d why the attorney failed to object, the matter \u2018is best suited for post-conviction proceedings.\u201d <em>Upshaw, </em>\u00b6 33; <em>see also State v. Dyfort, </em>2000 MT 338, \u00b6\u00b6 9-12, 303 Mont. 153, 15 P.3d 464 (holding that, because the record was silent as to the attorney\u2019s trial strategy regarding his failure to object, the defendant\u2019s objections were not record based).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">\u00b636 We agree with the State that it is plausible that Aker\u2019s attorney made a tactical, strategic decision by not objecting to the testimony that Aker now contests on appeal. Hooks did object, successfully, to numerous questions during the State\u2019s cross-examination of Aker\u2019s witnesses. \u2018Counsel\u2019s use of objections lies within his or her discretion.\u201d <em>Riggs v. State, </em>2011 MT 239, \u00b6\u00b6 53-54, 362 Mont. 140, 264 P.3d 693 (rejecting ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on failure to object to child victim\u2019s prior consistent statements in light of counsel\u2019s postconviction testimony that he wanted to point out inconsistencies in the witnesses\u2019 testimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">\u00b637  Hooks argued in closing that it was not unreasonable for the defense witnesses, all of whom shared the home where the assault allegedly occurred, to talk to each other about the fact that someone they considered family was accused of a crime \u2018they know he could not have committed,\u201d and that this did not mean the three had conjured a lie to protect their friend. His closing argument focused on all the mistakes C.Y. made in the stories she told others and on the inconsistencies in her various statements about the event. Hooks told the jury it could not ignore those inconsistencies in judging the credibility of her accusations. Without directly attacking the victim, he suggested the evidence showed other anxiety-producing factors in her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>life that could explain her accusations. While it was impossible to know the cause, Hooks argued, that wasn\u2019t Aker\u2019s burden to demonstrate, and the State had not proven guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Because the trial record does not include Hooks\u2019s explanation of his trial strategy concerning C.Y.\u2019s prior consistent statements, this Court \u201cwill not speculate\u201d on the claimed error. <em>See Dy fort, </em>\u00b6 11. Consequently, we conclude that Aker\u2019s allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel are not record based and we dismiss this portion of the appeal without prejudice. <em>Dyfort, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">\u00b638 For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b523-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b520-6\"> <em>Lindberg </em>was decided on November 18, 2008, three months after <em>Hayden.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b523-6\">JUSTICE McKINNON,</author>\n<p id=\"AQ0\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">\u00b639 I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s decision on both issues.</p>\n<p id=\"Ala\">\u00b640 As to Issue 1, I believe prosecutor Thompson\u2019s remarks about three of the defense witnesses (Amie Manahan, Angela Zinke, and Donald Zinke Jr.), and his assertions about the truthfulness of these witnesses\u2019 testimony, constitute plain error requiring a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">\u00b641 In his rebuttal closing argument, prosecutor Thompson chose not only to \u201cdisparage\u201d(Thompson\u2019s own word) Amie, Angela, and Donald, but also to tell the jury that he had personally determined that these witnesses were liars.

Determinations of the credibility and weight of testimony are exclusively within the province of the jury, not the prosecutor. <em>State v.

This is precisely the sort of prosecutorial misconduct that we recently condemned in <em>State v. Criswell, </em>2013 MT 177, \u00b6 49, 370 Mont. 511, 305 P.3d 760. As Chief Justice McGrath observed in his concurring opinion, \u201c[a] prosecutor is an officer of the court\u201d who \u201cmust strive to promote justice and the rule of law.\u201d <em>Criswell, </em>\u00b6 57 (McGrath, C.J., concurring). \u201c \u2018Unfortunately, some prosecutors have permitted an excess of zeal for conviction or a fancy for exaggerated rhetoric to carry them beyond the permissible limits of argument.\u2019 \u201d <em>Criswell, </em>\u00b6 55 (McGrath, C.J., concurring) (quoting <em>ABA Stands, for Crim. Just: Prosecution Function and Def. Function, </em>Stand. 3-5.8, Commentary, 107). In this regard, Tpjrosecutorial conduct in argument is a matter of special concern because of the possibility that the jury will give special weight to the prosecutor\u2019s arguments, not only because of the prestige associated with the prosecutor\u2019s office, but also because of the fact-finding facilities presumably available to the office.\u201d <em>ABA Stands, for Crim. Just.: Prosecution Function and Def. Function, </em>Stand. 3-5.8, Commentary, 107. \u2018Expressions of personal opinion by the prosecutor are a form of unsworn, unchecked testimony and tend to exploit the influence of the prosecutor\u2019s office and undermine the objective detachment that should separate a lawyer from the cause being argued.\u201d <em>ABA Stands, for Crim. Just.: Prosecution Function and Def. Function, </em>Stand. 3-5.8, Commentary, 108. Such personal opinions have no place in a prosecutor\u2019s closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">\u00b644 We have explained that the applicability of plain error review must be decided on a \u201ccase-by-case\u201d basis. <em>State v. Sullivant, </em>2013 MT <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>200, \u00b6 17, 371 Mont. 91, 305 P.3d 838; <em>State v.

Gallagher, </em>2001 MT 39, \u00b6 21, 304 Mont. 215, 19 P.3d 817. Here, however, the Court presents a string-cite of cases in which we have not exercised plain error review of a prosecutor\u2019s comments. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 29-30. Far from a \u201ccase-by-case\u201d approach, the Court asserts as a \u201cgeneral\u201d rule that we do not review improper remarks by a prosecutor under the plain error doctrine-even going so far as to fault Aker for not pointing to any case other than <em>Hayden. </em>Opinion, \u00b6 30. In my view, however, the Court\u2019s precedent shows something else: that nine times out ten, this Court is willing to overlook improper remarks by prosecutors. The message that this increasingly prevalent practice is sending, unfortunately, is that prosecutors in this State can be assured of having their convictions upheld despite comments made during trial which violate ethical rules and \u201crun the risk of undermining the fundamental fairness of the judicial process.\u201d <em>State v. Lindberg, </em>2008 MT 389, \u00b6 34, 347 Mont. 76, 196 P.3d 1252. Until there are actual consequences, such as reversal of the conviction, the problem is going to persist.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">\u00b645 We must evaluate whether plain error is appropriate in light of the facts of the case before us. Thompson\u2019s remarks during closing argument plainly exceeded the bounds of proper argument. In so doing, his conduct compromised the integrity of the judicial process and calls into question the fundamental fairness of Aker\u2019s trial. Under such circumstances, it is this Court\u2019s \u201cparamount obligation\u201dto review Aker\u2019s prosecutorial misconduct claim and grant appropriate relief. <em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 137, 915 P.2d at 215. In my view, the Court misapplies our plain error doctrine in reaching a contrary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">\u00b646 Turning now to Issue 2,1 conclude that defense counsel rendered constitutionally deficient representation by failing to object to the prosecution\u2019s presentation (through multiple witnesses) of C.Y.\u2019s hearsay statements about the offense. Given that the State\u2019s case against Aker depended entirely on C.Y.\u2019s credibility, I would hold that counsel\u2019s deficient performance prejudiced the defense, thus requiring that Aker be granted a new trial. While the Court theorizes that defense counsel made a \u201ctactical, strategic decision\u201d not to object to C.Y.\u2019s hearsay statements, and then speculates further about what defense counsel\u2019s supposed reasons might have been, Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 36-37, it is my view that, regardless of why defense counsel remained silent, his doing so was objectively unreasonable, <em>Whitlow v.

One such exception, although infrequently applied, is where there is \u2018ho plausible justification\u201d for what defense counsel did. If it is apparent that there is no plausible justification for defense counsel\u2019s conduct, then \u2018[w]hether the reasons for defense counsel\u2019s actions are found in the record or not is irrelevant. <em>What matters is that there could not be any legitimate reason for what counsel did.\u201d Kougl, </em>\u00b6 15 (emphasis added). We applied this exception in <em>Kougl </em>and determined that there was no reason for trial counsel not to ask for a jury instruction to view the testimony of the defendant\u2019s accomplices with suspicion. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 20. We noted that trial counsel had nothing to lose in asking for the instruction. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">\u00b649 We also applied the exception in <em>State v.

Similarly, in <em>State v.

Where the victim is young and unable to testify about a secretive encounter, there often is no other evidence for a prosecutor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>to rely on in proving the State\u2019s case. Following many child sexual abuse investigations, a prosecutor unfortunately may be forced not to proceed because he is ethically bound to pursue only those prosecutions which he can, by applicable law and rules of evidence, prove. Many states, Montana included, have addressed these difficulties by allowing expert witnesses to testify directly about the credibility of a victim who testifies in a child sexual abuse trial, <em>see State v. Scheffelman, </em>250 Mont. 334, 342, 820 P.2d 1293, 1298 (1991), and have enacted statutes to assist in the prosecution of child sexual abuse, <em>see </em>\u00a7 46-16-220, MCA (child hearsay exception in criminal proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">\u00b651 The instant proceedings involved an allegation of sexual intercourse without consent perpetrated upon a 12-year-old victim. There were no eyewitnesses to the offense, and while she clearly was competent to testify, C.Y.\u2019s credibility-like that of any child witness-was subject to attack. This was apparent from the beginning of trial: in voir dire, the prosecution suggested that \u201cwhat the girl has to say when she comes into court and testifies is the most important piece of evidence in these types of cases,\u2019\u2019and in his opening statement, defense counsel told the jury that, \u2018Tf]or whatever reason, [C.Y.] was mistaken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">\u00b652 C.Y testified first and provided sufficient details to satisfy the elements of the offense. Aside from circumstantial evidence regarding C.Y.\u2019s demeanor following the offense, described by persons who were not witnesses to the crime, the prosecution had very little more that it could present. The State offered no expert witnesses pursuant to the requirements of <em>Scheffelman, </em>250 Mont. at 342, 820 P.2d at 1298, and the State\u2019s case, therefore, necessarily would rise or fall on the credibility of C.Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">\u00b653 In the context of a child sexual abuse prosecution, there can be \u2018ho plausible justification\u201d for the admission of hearsay, without objection, that corroborates the child victim\u2019s story. Nevertheless, defense counsel did not object to the admission of C.Y.\u2019s hearsay statements through five different witnessesAwo laypersons, a physician, a counselor, and a law enforcement officer-which bolstered C.Y.\u2019s testimony and corroborated the details of the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">\u00b654 Cari, a \u201csecond mom\u201dto C.Y., was asked by the prosecution to give \u201ca full account\u201d of what C.Y. had told her.

What is her demeanor when she is telling you about this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-5\">A. She\u2019s crying. Her whole body is still shaking. Almost like she\u2019s just cold, she just, her whole body is just absolutely shaking. But I gave her her time, you know, I didn\u2019t rush her. I told her, I said \u2018you know, you just need to tell me what happened and make sure that you\u2019re telling me the truth.\u201d And so she started proceeding to tell me about how he took his hand and separated her legs and he was kind of holding her down with one hand and pulling her legs apart with the other. And he took his fingers, and I stopped her there and I asked her; T know this sounds funny, but how many fingers\u201d, and she said \u201ctwo\u201d that she could think of. She said he had very big hands. And he proceeded to rub her vagina and started going up inside of her and was, she was; he was going in and out of her with his fingers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">\u00b655 Cari provided significantly more detail of the incident than C.Y. had given during her testimony. The evidence was clearly hearsay. Yet, Aker\u2019s attorney did not object to these statements corroborating and supplementing C.Y.\u2019s own testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">\u00b656 The prosecution next called Jennifer, C.Y.\u2019s mother. Jennifer stated that Cari had told her C.Y. was sexually molested by Jim Aker. Specifically, Jennifer testified: \u2018She told (inaudible-crying) Cari told me that my daughter had confided in her that she had been sexually molested.\u201d When Jennifer asked who had molested C.Y., \u2018[Cari] said that it was Jim Aker.\u201d This evidence was clearly hearsay. Aker\u2019s attorney did not object to these statements which corroborated and verified the occurrence of the assault and identified Jim Aker as the assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">\u00b657 The State called Dr. Michelle Corbin, who testified that she had conducted a sexual abuse examination of C.Y. Dr. Corbin stated that C.Y. \u201ctold me there was digital penetration,\u201d \u201ctold me it lasted approximately 20 minutes,\u201d \u201ctold me that she thought it happened at the end of November,\u201d and \u201creported that there was some bleeding afterwards.\u201d Dr. Corbin opined that the lack of physical findings, as in C.Y.\u2019s case, did not reflect on the veracity or truth of C.Y.\u2019s report. No <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>objection was made to any of this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">\u00b658 The State called Kristi Rydeen, a licensed clinical professional counselor, who testified that C.Y. had told her about \u201cthe incident of abuse perpetrated by Jimmie Aker.\u201d The prosecution asked Rydeen, \u201cIn your discussions with [C.Y.] did she reference or did you find any other trauma that would explain the symptoms you were observing and having been reported, other than the sexual abuse by [Aker]?\u201d Rydeen replied, \u201cNo.\u201d Defense counsel did not object to these statements identifying Aker as the assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">\u00b659 The defense called Sheriff Scott Howard, who had been the lead investigator in the case. Defense counsel covered four areas of examination: C.Y.\u2019s statements as to the date of the offense; C.Y.\u2019s statements as to how she was initially accosted; the Territorial Days Celebration, held seven months after the offense, where C.Y. mistakenly thought she saw Aker; and <em>Aker\u2019s Miranda </em>rights. In cross-examination, however, the prosecutor was allowed to describe C.Y.\u2019s hearsay statements that Aker had put his fingers inside her, that it lasted 20 minutes, that Aker used his hand to hold her down, and that C.Y. bled as a result. Sheriff Howard confirmed the following details of the incident on which C.Y. had been consistent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\">Q. But [C.Y.] told you some other things during that [interview] as well, didn\u2019t she?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-7\">A. She did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-8\">Q. She told you she was watching a show, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-9\">A. She did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-10\">Q. And she told you she was sitting on a couch when she was watching her show, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-11\">A. She did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-12\">Q. And you indicated to Mr. Hooks that she also said \u2018he told me to lay down,\u201d right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-13\">A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-14\">Q. And that \u201ceverything was going to be okay\u2019?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-15\">A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-16\">Q. And that he put his hand on her chest, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-17\">A. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-18\">Q. And he stuck his fingers inside of her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-19\">A. He did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-20\">Q. And pulled her pants down, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-21\">A. That\u2019s what she said, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-22\">Q. This is what [C.Y.] is telling you on January 14th, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-23\">A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-24\">Q. Approximately 5-6 weeks after the alleged incident, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>A. That\u2019d be fair, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-4\">Q. She said it lasted about 20 minutes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">A. She did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">Q. And even at that time she said she had her eyes closed, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-8\">Q. And then she told you afterwards she was bleeding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-9\">A. She did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-10\">Q. And she also said at that time that Mr. Aker told her that [she] and he would be in trouble if she told anybody?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-11\">A. She did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-12\">Consequently, in addition to C.Y.\u2019s testimony, the jury heard the core details of the incident on five more occasions through five different witnesses. All of these witnesses\u2019 testimony about the incident came from C.Y.\u2019s hearsay statements. None of the witnesses had personal knowledge of the facts of the incident. All of this testimony was admitted without objection from Aker\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-13\">\u00b660 The State argues that Aker\u2019s counsel failed to object to C.Y.\u2019s prior consistent statements, presented through five other witnesses, in order to emphasize \u2018inconsistent details\u201d in C.Y.\u2019s retelling of the incident. However, the admission of prior inconsistent statements is not contingent upon the admission of prior consistent statements. Prior inconsistent statements are admissible pursuant to M. R. Evid. 801(d)(1)(A). Prior consistent statements, on the other hand, are not admissible unless they are \u201coffered to rebut an express or implied charge against the declarant of subsequent fabrication, improper influence or motive.\u201dM. R. Evid. 801(d)(1)(B). We have held that the prior consistent statement rule applies only when the declarant\u2019s in-court testimony has been impeached by another party\u2019s allegations of subsequent fabrication, improper influence, or motive. <em>State v. McOmber, </em>2007 MT 340, \u00b6 15, 340 Mont. 262, 173 P.3d 690; <em>see also State v. </em>Champagne, 2013 MT 190, \u00b6 39, 371 Mont. 35, 305 P.3d 61. Here, there were no allegations of subsequent fabrication or that C.Y. had been improperly coached or influenced. Thus, it is not plausible to allow the admission of prior consistent statements, which corroborated C.Y.\u2019s testimony, for the purpose of emphasizing prior inconsistent statements. Aker\u2019s counsel could have had the inconsistent statements admitted under M. R. Evid. 801(d)(1)(A) and objected to C.Y.\u2019s prior consistent statements under M. R. Evid. 801(d)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-14\">\u00b661 The Court\u2019s reliance on <em>Riggs v. State, </em>2011 MT 239, 362 Mont. 140, 264 P.3d 693-see Opinion, \u00b6 36 is unpersuasive. There, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>district court found in the postconviction proceeding that \u201cthe alleged prior consistent statements were not hearsay, were successfully objected to, or were inconsistent with other statements made by the girls.\u201dRiggs, \u00b6 52. Here, in contrast, C.Y.\u2019s statements-as repeated at trial by Cari, Jennifer, Dr. Corbin, Rydeen, and Sheriff Howard-were plainly hearsay. They were not objected to at all. And they were not inconsistent with C.Y.\u2019s testimony, but were in fact consistent with C.Y.\u2019s description of the \u201ccore details\u201d of the incident-something the prosecution hammered during its closing arguments. <em>Riggs </em>is simply not on point.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">\u00b662 The notion that Aker\u2019s counsel endeavored in his cross-examination of the State\u2019s witnesses to Illuminate inconsistencies\u201d in C.Y.\u2019s statements, Opinion, \u00b6 13, is speculation. It also misstates counsel\u2019s argument. For example, regarding the date of the offense, C.Y. originally told Sheriff Howard that the incident occurred in the third or fourth week of November 2009, but further investigation revealed that the actual date was December 4, 2009. Aker\u2019s counsel argued in closing that this was \u201cnot an inconsistency. It\u2019s a mistake.\u201d He added: \u2018We know that [C.Y.] was wrong, verifiably wrong in other regards.\u201d Counsel later reemphasized that \u201cwe know that the child in question, [C.Y.], had made mistakes.\u201dThe point of this argument was not that C.Y. gave inconsistent stories to different people; counsel\u2019s argument, more precisely, was that C.Y. was a child who tended to make \u201cmistakes.\u201dHe used this term continually throughout his closing. Clearly, however, it was not necessary for counsel to allow repeated recitations of C.Y.\u2019s prior consistent statements in order to show that C.Y. was a child who makes mistakes.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">\u00b663 Based upon the foregoing, I believe it is not necessary to ask \u201cwhy\u201d counsel failed to object to the admission of C.Y.\u2019s hearsay statements. In my view, there is no plausible justification for failing to object and we thus may rule on the merits of Aker\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim on direct appeal. Further, having determined that Aker\u2019s counsel could have no plausible justification for failing to object, counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and the first prong of the test is satisfied. <em>See Riggs, </em>\u00b6 9 (to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the defendant must first demonstrate \u201cthat counsel\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">\u00b664 To establish prejudice under the second prong of the test, Aker must show \u201cthat a reasonable probability exists that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Riggs, </em>\u00b6 9. \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>confidence in the outcome of the proceeding.\u201d <em>Riggs, </em>\u00b6 12. Here, the cumulative effect of counsel\u2019s errors prejudiced Aker\u2019s right to a fair trial. <em>State v. Ferguson, </em>2005 MT 343, \u00b6 126, 330 Mont. 103, 126 P.3d 463. It is reasonably probable that the outcome of the proceeding would have been different had counsel objected to the introduction of all of C.Y.\u2019s prior consistent statements. Indeed, this is clear from the prosecution\u2019s heavy emphasis, during closing argument, on the fact that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-4\">the core, core details about Mr. Aker coming into that home when the kids were sleeping, walking across that room, coming up to her while Hannah Montana was on, sexually assaulting her, pushing her down, placing his fingers in her. Those core details have never changed. Hannah Montana was always on tv every time she told the story [to the various witnesses who then repeated her statements at trial].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Permitting the jury to hear improper hearsay testimony from five different witnesses which corroborated the victim\u2019s testimony and the specific details of the sexual assault prejudiced Aker\u2019s right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">\u00b665 For the foregoing reasons, I would reverse Aker\u2019s conviction based upon prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel. I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s contrary decision.</p>\n<judges id=\"b532-7\">JUSTICE COTTER joins the Dissent of JUSTICE McKINNON.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b523-10\"> Thompson used the word \u201cstratus.\u201d However, I presume he meant \u201cstratum,\u201d given that \u201cstratus\u201drefers to a type of cloud formation.
