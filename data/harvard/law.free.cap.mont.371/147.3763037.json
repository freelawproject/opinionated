State Farm answered that there was no coverage for Sharon\u2019s claim due to a family member exclusion in the umbrella policy. The Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Gallatin County, concluded that the policy was not ambiguous, did not violate the McCartneys\u2019 reasonable expectations, and did not violate Montana public policy, but that the exclusion was unconscionable. The District Court entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>summary judgment in favor of the McCartneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">\u00b62 State Farm appeals. In their arguments, both State Farm and the McCartneys challenge portions of the District Court\u2019s orders.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> State Farm argues that the District Court\u2019s unconscionability determination is erroneous and should be reversed, and summary judgment be entered in its favor. McCartneys argue that the District Court\u2019s entry of summary judgment in their favor should be affirmed, but that this Court should \u201creverse the District Court\u2019s ruling regarding ambiguity and direct it to enter an order declaring that the family member exclusion at issue .... is ambiguous and violates the McCartneys\u2019 reasonable expectations,\u2019\u2019thus arguing that the District Court erred by not entering judgment in their favor on additional grounds. To address the parties\u2019 arguments, and because the issues are interrelated, we take up the issues in the following order:</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">\u00b63 <em>1. Did the District Court err by concluding that the Umbrella Policy unambiguously excluded Sharon\u2019s claim from coverage and that the Family Member Exclusion did not violate the McCartneys\u2019 reasonable expectations?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">\u00b64 <em>2. Did the District Court err by concluding that the Family Member Exclusion did not violate Montana public policy ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">\u00b65 3. <em>Did the District Court err by concluding that the Family Member Exclusion was unconscionable ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">\u00b66 Upon review of these issues, we reverse the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">\u00b67 On December 30,2007, Les and Sharon were involved in a motor-vehicle accident near Townsend. Les was driving his vehicle when he negligently struck a vehicle parked on the side of the road. Sharon, a passenger in Les\u2019s car, sustained serious injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">\u00b68 Les has two insurance policies pertinent to this dispute. The first is Les\u2019s State Farm Automobile Liability Policy (Auto Policy), which provided bodily injury limits of $250,000 per person and $500,000 per accident. Les paid an annual premium of $289.16 for this coverage. The second policy is Les\u2019s State Farm Personal Liability Umbrella Policy (Policy or Umbrella Policy), with a stated limit of $2,000,000. Les paid an annual premium of $201 for this coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>\u00b69 State Farm paid Sharon the full per-person bodily injury liability limit of $250,000 under the Auto Policy for the injuries she received as a result of the accident. State Farm denied Sharon\u2019s claim to additional coverage for her injuries under the Umbrella Policy because that policy excluded claims brought by Les\u2019s relatives who lived with him pursuant to an exclusion denominated by the parties as the Family Member Exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">\u00b610 Sharon sought a declaratory judgment that she was entitled to coverage for her injuries under the Umbrella Policy. Les sought the same relief. The McCartneys argued that the exclusion was unenforceable because it was ambiguous, violated Montana public policy, violated their reasonable expectations of coverage, and was unconscionable. State Farm answered that Sharon\u2019s claim was properly excluded by the Family Member Exclusion. The District Court granted summary judgment to the McCartneys, holding the Exclusion was unconscionable because it denied coverage to family members, a class of victims the District Court reasoned was most likely to need coverage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">\u2018[This innocent class of victims] is exposed to negligent operation of the covered vehicle more than included victims, because typical family relations require family members to ride together on the way to work, church, school, social functions, or family outings. Thus, these individuals cannot practically avoid exposure to the risk for which they [are] uninsured. [This is unconscionable.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4\">(Quoting <em>Safeco Ins. Co. of Ill. v. Auto. Club Ins. Co., </em>31 P.3d 52, 54-55 (Wash. App. 2001)) (brackets in District Court Order).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">\u00b611 We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant or denial of summary judgment, applying the same criteria as the district court. <em>Modroo v. Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>2008 MT 275, \u00b6 19, 345 Mont. 262, 191 P.3d 398. The District Court\u2019s interpretation of an insurance contract is a question of law this Court reviews de novo. <em>Stutzman v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Am., </em>284 Mont. 372, 376, 945 P.2d 32, 34 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">\u00b612 <em>1. Did the District Court err by concluding that the Umbrella Policy unambiguously excluded Sharon\u2019s claim from coverage and that the Family Member Exclusion did not violate the McCartneys\u2019 reasonable </em>expectations?</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">\u00b613 When interpreting an insurance contract, we accord the usual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>meaning to the terms and the words used, and we construe them using common sense. <em>Modroo, </em>\u00b6 23. The Umbrella Policy contains the following pertinent policy provisions, with bolded words defined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AO2\">COVERAGE L -PERSONAL LIABILITY</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-3\">If a claim is made or suit is brought against an insured, for damages of a loss for which the insured is legally liable and to which this policy applies, we will pay on behalf of the insured, the damages that exceed the retained limit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-4\">EXCLUSIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-5\">There is no coverage under this policy for any:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-6\">13. bodily injury or personal injury to any insured as defined in part a .... of the definition of insured[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">Thus, the Policy generally covers claims in excess of the insured\u2019s primary insurance but does not cover claims brought by an insured. The Policy defines who is an insured:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-8\">DEFINITIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqW\">\u2018insured\u201d means:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-9\">a. you and your relatives whose primary residence is your household[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-10\">\u2018Relative\u201d means any person related to you by blood, adoption, or marriage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-11\">\u2018you\u201d and \u2018your\u201d mean the person or persons shown as the \u2018Named Insured\u201d on the declarations page. If a named insured shown on the declarations page is a human being then you and your includes the spouse of the first person listed as the named insured if the spouse resides primarily with that named insured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AnH\">Les was issued the Umbrella Policy and is named on the declarations page. Applying the definitions of \u2018you\u201d and \u2018your,\u201d he is an insured. \u2018Relative\u201d is defined by the policy as \u201cany person related to you by blood, adoption, or marriage.\u201d Sharon is related to Les by marriage. <em>See also Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 379-80, 945 P.2d at 36 (\u2018In accordance with prevailing case law, and applying a common sense interpretation of the terms at issue, we conclude that the average consumer of insurance would, in reading the [policy], conclude that the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>\u2018relative\u2019 includes reference to his or her spouse.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Sharon is an \u2018insured\u201d by virtue of being Les\u2019s relative who primarily resides with him. The Umbrella Policy excludes Sharon\u2019s claim because, under the Family Member Exclusion, there is no coverage for bodily injury sustained by an insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">\u00b614 Having determined that the Umbrella Policy facially excludes coverage for Sharon\u2019s bodily injuries, we next consider if public policy or principles of contract interpretation prohibit the enforcement of the exclusion. <em>See Augustine v. Simonson, </em>283 Mont. 259, 264, 940 P.2d 116, 119 (1997). We first address principles of contract interpretation under this issue, and then turn to principles of public policy under Issue 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">\u00b615 The interpretation of an insurance contract is a question of law. <em>Modroo, </em>\u00b6 23. \u2018We accord the usual meaning of the terms and the words in an insurance contract, and we construe them using common sense.\u201d <em>Modroo, </em>\u00b6 23. An insurance contract is ambiguous if it is \u201c\u2018reasonably subject to two different interpretations.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Modroo, </em>\u00b6 23 (quoting <em>Mitchell v. State Farm Ins. Co., </em>2003 MT 102, \u00b6 26, 315 Mont. 281, 68 P.3d 703). Whether a provision of an insurance contract is \u201creasonably susceptible to two different interpretations,\u201dis determined from \u201cthe viewpoint of a consumer with average intelligence, but untrained in the law or the insurance business.\u201d <em>Modroo, </em>\u00b6 23. However, a provision is not ambiguous \u2018just because a claimant says so or just because the parties disagree as to [its] meaning ....\u201d <em>Giacomelli v. Scottsdale Ins. Co., </em>2009 MT 418, \u00b6 32, 354 Mont. 15, 221 P.3d 666 (internal citations omitted); <em>Johnson v. Eq. Fire &amp; Mar. Ins. Co., </em>142 Mont. 128, 131, 381 P.2d 778, 789 (1963). \u2018Courts should not ... \u2018seize upon certain and definite covenants expressed in plain English with violent hands, and distort them so as to include a risk clearly excluded by the insurance contract.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Travelers Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Ribi Immunochem Research, Inc., </em>2005 MT 50, \u00b6 17, 326 Mont. 174, 108 P.3d 469 (internal citation omitted). Because insurers draft the language of insurance contracts and the object of an insurance contract is to give protection to the insured, we construe ambiguous provisions \u201cagainst the insurer and in favor of extending coverage.\u201d <em>Modroo, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>\u00b616 The McCartneys first argue that the Umbrella Policy is ambiguous because, although it excludes claims brought by relatives of the person(s) listed as a \"named insured\u201d on the declaration page, the term \u201cnamed insured\u201d itself does not also appear on the declaration page. While the McCartneys are correct that the term \u201cnamed insured\u201d does not appear on the declaration page, \"named insured\u201d has a common sense meaning: it refers to the party the insurance policy was issued to cover. The policy refers to that party by name. <em>See </em>6C Appleman, <em>Insurance Law &amp; Practice, </em>\u00a74354, at 51 (West Publishing Co., 1979) (\u2018Whenever the term \u2018named insured\u2019 is employed, it refers only to the person specifically designated upon the face of the contract^]\u201d); <em>Waller v. Rocky Mt. Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>535 P.2d 530, 534 (Or. 1975) (\u201cWherever the description \u2018named insured\u2019 is used, the only person named in the declarations of the policy is meant.\u201d). Here, the Umbrella Policy was issued to Les E. McCartney and Frances D. McCartney.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Policy further directs that the named insureds are the person(s) listed on the declaration page, and the names of Les E. McCartney and Frances D. McCartney are listed there. Thus, Les E. McCartney and Frances D. McCartney are clearly the \u201cnamed insureds\u201d under the Umbrella Policy, and there is no ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">\u00b617 The McCartneys also argue the Family Member Exclusion is ambiguous because the Policy uses the term \u201cspouse\u201d in the definition of Nou and your,\u201d but does not likewise use \u201cspouse\u201d in the definition of \u201crelative.\u201d McCartneys argue that this discrepancy could lead an average person to believe that a \u201cspouse\u201d is not a \"relative\u201d within the meaning of the Umbrella Policy. However, the Policy\u2019s definition of \u201crelative\u201d is \u201cany person related to you by blood, adoption, or marriage.\u201dHere again, the terms are clear. Although the term \u201cspouse\u201d is not included within the definition of \u201crelative,\u201d a common sense reading of this provision leaves only one reasonable meaning: that one related by \"marriage\u201d is also a \u201cspouse.\u201d <em>See </em>MerriamWebster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary, Tenth Edition 1138 (MerriamWebster, Inc. 1998) (spouse: \u201cmarried person: husband, wife\u201d). Under the Policy\u2019s definitions, Sharon is both Les\u2019s \u201cspouse\u201d and his \u201crelative,\u201d and there is no ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">\u00b618 McCartneys further contend the District Court erred by holding the Umbrella Policy did not violate their reasonable expectations. The District Court concluded that, because the exclusion \u201cclearly\u201d excluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Sharon from coverage, any expectation that a claim brought by Sharon would be covered was not \u201cobjectively reasonable.\u201d The McCartneys argue that the Exclusion is not sufficiently \u201cclear\u201d because an average person reading the policy would not be able to navigate the Umbrella Policy and the declaration page to effectively discern that Sharon was excluded from coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">\u00b619 The question of whether a provision is sufficiently \u201cclear\u201d to render the reasonable expectations doctrine inapplicable is a different question than whether a provision is ambiguous. If the reasonable expectations doctrine only applied when a provision was ambiguous, there would be no need for the doctrine, as Montana law independently construes ambiguous provisions against the insurer and in favor of coverage. <em>C.f Bailey v. Lincoln Gen. Ins. Co., </em>255 P.3d 1039, 1050 (Colo. 2011) (en banc) (TT]he doctrine of reasonable expectations applies when policy coverage-provisions may not be ambiguous in a technical sense, and hence subject to the rule that ambiguities must be construed against the drafter....\u201d). However, a finding that a provision \u201cunambiguously precludes coverage\u201d is a factor to be considered in determining whether it violates reasonable expectations. <em>Am. Family Mut. Ins. Co. v. Livengood, </em>1998 MT 329, \u00b6 38, 292 Mont. 244, 970 P.2d 1054.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">\u00b620 We first recognized the reasonable expectations doctrine in <em>Transamerica Ins. Co. v. Royle, </em>202 Mont. 173, 656 P.2d 820 (1983): \u201c\u2018The objectively reasonable expectations of applicants and intended beneficiaries regarding the terms of insurance contracts will be honored even though painstaking study of the policy provisions would have negated those expectations.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Royle, </em>202 Mont. at 180-81, 656 P.2d at 824 (quoting Robert E. Keeton, <em>Insurance Law Rights Variance with Policy Provisions, </em>83 Harvard L. Rev. 961, 967 (1970)). However, \u201cthe reasonable expectations doctrine is inapplicable where the terms of the policy at issue clearly demonstrate an intent to exclude coverage.\u201d <em>Livengood, </em>\u00b6 33 (citing <em>Wellcome v. Home Ins. Co., </em>257 Mont. 354, 359, 849 P.2d 190, 194 (1993)). \u2018The reason, of course, is that \u2018expectations which are contrary to a clear exclusion from coverage are not \u201cobjectively reasonable.\u201d\u2019 \u201d <em>Livengood, </em>\u00b6 33 (quoting <em>Wellcome, </em>257 Mont. at 359, 849 P.2d at 194).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">\u00b621 In <em>Livengood, </em>a coverage exclusion in an automobile liability policy was challenged as violating the reasonable expectations doctrine. Henninger was driving her roommate\u2019s vehicle when she negligently caused an accident, injuring the Livengoods. Henninger\u2019s automobile liability policy on her own vehicle contained a nonowned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>automobile/household exclusion that excluded coverage for injuries arising from her use of a vehicle \u201cowned by or furnished or available for regular use by you or any resident of your household.\u201d <em>Livengood, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-17. Livengoods argued the exclusion violated the reasonable expectations of Henninger, the insured. This Court unanimously upheld the exclusion, reasoning that the provision \u201cclearly demonstrate[d] an intent to exclude coverage while Henninger was using a vehicle owned by ... a resident of her household, and any expectation by Henninger to the contrary would not be objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Livengood, </em>\u00b6 38 (citing <em>Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 381, 945 P.2d at 37).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">\u00b622 The Family Member Exclusion here is similarly clear. The Umbrella Policy exclusion provides that \u2018ho coverage\u201d is available for \u2018bodily injury or personal injury to any insured.\u201d As demonstrated above, Sharon is an \u2018Insured\u201d under the Policy. These provisions \u201cclearly demonstrate an intent to exclude coverage\u201dfor Sharon\u2019s claim. <em>Livengood, </em>\u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\u00b623  McCartneys urge that necessary clarity would have been provided had State Farm simply stated: \u2018NOTICE: THIS POLICY PROVIDES NO LIABILITY COVERAGE TO YOUR SPOUSE.\u201d However, this simple proposed clarification is incorrect. The Policy <em>does </em>provide liability coverage to Sharon. She is an insured, and the Policy provides excess liability protection to Sharon \u2018if a claim is made or suit is brought against\u201d her by a third party. <em>See Rowe, </em>245 Mont. at 417, 800 P.2d at 160 (\u201cexcess coverage of an umbrella or catastrophe policy protects an insured ... against liability from third parties\u201d). Regarding McCartneys\u2019 arguments about having to navigate the Policy, there is nothing unusual about a policy that requires the insured to read the exclusion section, the definition section, and the declaration page to determine the scope of coverage. <em>See e.g. Meyer v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins., </em>2000 MT 233, \u00b6\u00b6 8-11, 303 Mont. 1, 15 P.3d 899 (upholding exclusion in auto liability policy that required insured to review the definition section, the exclusion section, and the declaration page). A person of average intelligence would be able to determine that claims made by Sharon against Les were excluded by a review of these provisions of the Policy, and any expectation of coverage to the contrary was not objectively reasonable, as the District Court correctly concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\u00b624 <em>2. Did the District Court err by concluding that the Family Member Exclusion did not violate Montana public policy ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">\u00b625 Insurance agreements are contracts that are subject to general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>rules of contract law. <em>Ribi </em>Immunochem, \u00b6 17. Unambiguous insurance provisions are to be enforced unless the provision violates public policy or is against good morals. <em>Hein v. Fox, </em>126 Mont. 514, 520, 254 P.2d 1076, 1079 (1953); <em>Youngblood v. Am. States Ins. Co., </em>262 Mont. 391, 395, 866 P.2d 203, 205 (1993); <em>Modroo, </em>\u00b6 49. \u201cAs a general rule, the Montana public policy is prescribed by the legislature through its enactment of statutes.\u201d <em>Hardy v. Progressive Specialty Ins. Co., </em>2003 MT 85, \u00b6 32, 315 Mont. 107, 67 P.3d 892 <em>(citing Duck Inn, Inc. v. Mont. St. Univ., </em>285 Mont. 519, 523-24, 949 P.2d 1179, 1182 (1997)). Insurance provisions which \u2018Violate express statutes\u201d are contrary to public policy and void. <em>Mont. Petroleum Tank Release Comp. Bd. v. Crumleys, Inc., </em>2008 MT 2, \u00b6 55, 341 Mont. 33, 174 P.3d 948.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">\u00b626 The McCartneys argue that the Family Member Exclusion violates public policy because it is inconsistent with \u00a761-6-103 and 301, MCA. McCartneys argue that these statutes insure protection for \u2018innocent victims of automobile accidents,\u2019\u2019citing <em>Iowa Mut. Ins. Co. v. Davis, </em>231 Mont. 166, 752 P.2d 166 (1988), and that \u00a761-6-301, MCA, requires further identification of those who are \u201cnamed insureds\u201d than that provided under the Umbrella Policy. However, McCartneys read \u201cpublic policy\u201d into these statutes that go far beyond their wording or meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">\u00b627 In <em>Davis, </em>at issue was the validity of a \u201cnamed driver exclusion,\u201d which removed from coverage persons expressly excluded on an automobile liability policy. <em>Davis, </em>231 Mont. at 167, 752 P.2d at 167. The Davises requested that their children be excluded from their policy to lower their premiums. <em>Davis, </em>231 Mont. at 167, 752 P.2d at 167. Nonetheless, one of their sons drove the Davises\u2019 vehicle and crashed it, injuring his passenger. <em>Davis, </em>231 Mont. at 167, 752 P.2d at 167. Iowa Mutual denied all coverage for the passenger\u2019s injuries under the exclusion. <em>Davis, </em>231 Mont. at 168, 752 P.2d at 167. This Court struck down the exclusion as against public policy because it left the passenger in the insured vehicle <em>without any coverage, </em>in violation of the mandatory liability insurance statute. <em>Davis, </em>231 Mont. at 170, 752 P.2d at 168. Our general statement in <em>Davis </em>that the liability insurance law protects \u2018innocent victims of automobile accidents\u201d was made in the context of our holding that the minimum coverage limits required by \u00a761-6-103, MCA, and 61-6- 301, MCA, are applicable to all vehicles insured under an automobile policy. <em>Davis, </em>231 Mont. at 170, 752 P.2d at 169. We further explained that this public policy did not prevent insurers and insureds from <em>limiting </em>coverage to the mandatory minimum levels required by the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Our decision does not, however, read the named driver exclusionary endorsement out of the contract entirely. Rather, contracting parties are <em>free to limit coverage </em>in excess of the minimum required limits, and the exclusion found in the contract is valid in relation to any coverage exceeding the minimum amounts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-4\"><em>Davis, </em>231 Mont. at 172-73, 752 P.2d at 170 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Allstate Ins.

Our cases contain numerous examples of claims to coverage that were denied because of valid exclusions. <em>See e.g. Livengood, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6, 9, 27 (no insurance coverage to injured party because tortfeasor driver was excluded by \u201cnonowned automobile exclusion\u201d); <em>Rowe, </em>245 Mont. at 414, 418, 800 P.2d at 158, 161 (denying underinsured motorist coverage to estate of \u2018fatally injured\u201d man because umbrella policy excluded such coverage); <em>Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 375, 945 P.2d at 33 (no underinsured coverage for wife injured in accident because of policy exclusion that defined \u201cunderinsured motor vehicle\u201d not to include vehicles owned by named insured or any \u201crelative\u201d); <em>Newbury v.

Indeed, all policy exclusions operate to deny coverage in some way, but not necessarily in violation of Montana public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">\u00b629 Section 61-6-301(l)(a), MCA, requires all motor vehicles to have a minimum level of liability insurance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-6\">[A]n owner of a motor vehicle that is registered and operated in Montana by the owner or with the owner\u2019s permission shall continuously provide insurance against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury or death or damage to property suffered by any person caused by maintenance or use of a motor vehicle in an amount not less than that required by 61-6-103[.]<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Section 61-6-103(l)(b)(i)-(iii), MCA, requires motorists to obtain automobile liability insurance covering, at a minimum, bodily injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>limits of $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident, and a property damage limit of $10,000 per accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">\u00b630 Our cases illustrate the reach of these provisions to void coverage exclusions. In <em>Royle, </em>a woman sued her parents for injuries she sustained while a passenger in a vehicle driven by her mother. <em>Royle, </em>202 Mont. at 174, 656 P.2d at 821. The automobile liability policy excluded coverage for \u201c \u2018bodily injury to any person who is related by blood, marriage, or adoption to the insured, if that person resides in the insured\u2019s household at the time of loss.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019 Royle, </em>202 Mont. at 174, 656 P.2d at 821 (original brackets omitted). Under this household exclusion, the daughter was not covered. We struck down the exclusion as contravening the requirements of \u00a7 61-6-301(l)(a), MCA, that vehicle owners \u201ccontinuously\u201d provide minimum liability coverage for bodily injury to \u201cany person,\u201d which included household members. <em>Royle, </em>202 Mont. at 177-79, 656 P.2d at 823-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">\u00b631 Conversely, in <em>Stutzman, </em>we upheld a household exclusion within underinsured motorist coverage as not inconsistent with \u00a7\u00a761-6-301 and 61-6-103, MCA. After she was injured as a passenger in her husband\u2019s vehicle, Stutzman sought payment under the liability and underinsured motorist coverages. <em>Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 375, 945 P.2d at 33. Safeco paid under the liability coverage but denied Stutzman\u2019s demand for payment of underinsured motorist coverage based on an exclusion that removed from the definition of \u201cunderinsured motor vehicle\u201d any vehicle \u201c \u2018owned by or furnished for the regular use of the named insured or any relative ....\u2019 \u201d <em>Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 378, 945 P.2d at 35. Stutzman asked the court to void the exclusion on public policy grounds, arguing that under <em>Royle, </em>all \u2018household exclusion clauses in bodily injury liability policies are void.\u201d <em>Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 380, 945 P.2d at 37. We rejected such a broad application of <em>Royle </em>and upheld the exclusion, reasoning that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\">Although this Court may indeed invalidate a household exclusion clause which violates Montana\u2019s mandatory insurance law, there is no statutory mandate for underinsured motorist coverage in Montana. Pursuant to \u00a761-6-103(8), MCA, optional underinsured motorist coverage is not subject to the provisions of Montana\u2019s Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act. Therefore, the parties may freely contract to produce exclusions or limitations on underinsured motorist coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-7\"><em>Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 380-81, 945 P.2d at 37. Because the exclusion in the underinsured coverage did not nullify the mandatory liability limits, the exclusion did not violate public policy and the parties were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>free to contract for this policy limitation. <em>Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 380-81, 945 P.2d at 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\u00b632 Sections 61-6-301 and 61-6-103, MCA, thus prohibit exclusions that result in failure to provide the minimum coverage required under the statutes. We have voided exclusions as against public policy when they contravene these mandatory statutory minimums. <em>See Davis, supra </em>(invalidating \"named driver exclusion\u201d that removed entirely from coverage those expressly excluded in auto policy as violating \u00a761-6-301(1)); <em>Royle, </em>202 Mont. at 181, 656 P.2d at 824 (invalidating household exclusion in auto policy as violating \u00a761-6-301(1) because it removed <em>all </em>coverage to household members); <em>Bill Atkinson Volkswagon v. McClafferty, </em>213 Mont. 99, 104, 689 P.2d 1237, 1240 (1984) (holding \u00a761-6-301(1), MCA, requires an automotive dealership to maintain the statutory minimum insurance on the dealership\u2019s \u201cloaner\u201d vehicles); <em>Swank v. Chrysler Ins. Corp., </em>282 Mont. 376, 383, 938 P.2d 631 (1997) (voiding exclusion in liability policy for vehicle dealership that provided coverage for customers only if the customer was uninsured or underinsured). We have upheld exclusions as not violative of public policy and subject to the parties\u2019 freedom to negotiate when they limited other, nonmandatory coverages. <em>See Stutzman, supra </em>(exclusion of family member vehicles from definition of \"underinsured motor vehicle\u201d upheld because the parties were free to \u201ccontract to produce exclusions or limitations on [optional] underinsured motorists coverage\u201d); <em>Livengood, </em>\u00b6 27 (\u201cnonowned automobile exclusion\u201d did not violate Montana public policy because the policy at issue provided the \"mandatory liability coverage required by \u00a761-6-301(1) and 61-6-103(2)(b)\u201d). The Family Member Exclusion within Les\u2019s optional Umbrella Policy does not violate \u00a761-6-103 and 61-6-301(1), MCA. Because the Exclusion does not \u2018Violate express statutes,\u201d <em>Crumleys, </em>\u00b6 55, it does not contravene public policy in that way. <em>See Newbury, </em>\u00b6 36 (\u2018In Montana, parties to an insurance contract may include provisions that exclude coverage without violating public policy if the exclusion applies to optional, rather than mandatory coverage.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\u00b633 We have also voided insurance clauses as against public policy in other situations. We have voided a subrogation clause in a policy if it undermines the judicially recognized made-whole doctrine. <em>See Youngblood, </em>262 Mont. at 400, 866 P.2d at 208 (voiding medical payment subrogation clause because it contradicted the made-whole doctrine); <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Reitler, </em>192 Mont. 351, 355, 628 P.2d 667, 670 (1981) (same). Also, we have voided provisions that render <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>coverage \u2018illusory\u201d by \u201cdefeating] coverage for which the insurer has received valuable consideration.\u201d <em>Bennett v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>261 Mont. 386, 389, 862 P.2d 1146, 1148 (1993); <em>Hardy, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 25-29 (holding as violative of Montana public policy anti-stacking provision in a policy that permitted insurer to receive valuable consideration for coverage not provided); <em>Mitchell v. State Farm, Ins. Co., </em>2003 MT 102, \u00b6 42, 315 Mont. 281, 68 P.3d 703 (same). These situations do not exist here. There is no subrogation clause, and exclusion of Sharon\u2019s claim does not render coverage under the Umbrella Policy illusory. The Policy provides the liability coverage for which the premium was paid, protecting Sharon from third-party automobile claims as well as farm, residential, business and office premises liability, watercraft liability, false arrest, defamation, invasion of privacy and other tort claims. As demonstrated here, umbrella policies are written to provide broad coverage for numerous risks against third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">\u00b634 The McCartneys cite three cases from other jurisdictions that voided household exclusions in umbrella policies as against public policy when applied to automobile accident victims. <em>See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Marley, </em>151 S.W.3d 33 (Ky. 2004); <em>Safeco Ins. Co. v. Auto. Club Ins. Co., </em>31 P.3d 52 (Wa. App. Ct. 2001); <em>GEICO Ins. Co. v. Welch, </em>90 P.3d 471 (N.M. 2004). However, the reasoning of these courts is inapposite with Montana law and public policy. First, unlike Montana, where the mandatory insurance laws provide <em>minimum coverage </em>for the purpose of protecting victims of automobile accidents, the Washington, Kentucky, and New Mexico courts cited by the McCartneys interpret their mandatory insurance laws to require <em>full compensation </em>to injured victims. <em>Safeco, </em>31 P.3d at 55-56; <em>Welch, </em>90 P.3d at 474; <em>Marley, </em>151 S.W.3d at 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">\u00b635 Second, these courts reasoned that the distinction between mandatory coverage (primary automobile liability policies) and optional coverage (umbrella policies) was \u2018irrelevant\u201d to the question of whether public policy voided the household exclusion. <em>Marley, </em>151 S.W.3d at 36 (internal citation omitted); <em>accord Safeco, </em>31 P.3d at 56; <em>Welch, </em>90 P.3d at 474-76. In contrast, our precedent clearly distinguishes between mandatory coverage and optional coverages that fall outside the ambit of Montana\u2019s mandatory insurance laws. <em>Newbury, </em>\u00b6 35; <em>Stutzman, </em>284 Mont. at 380-81, 945 P.2d at <em>37; Davis, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>231 Mont. at 172, 752 P.2d at 170-71.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">\u00b636 Finally, these courts found the household exclusion to be an \u201carbitrary\u201d provision that denied coverage for \u2018ho legitimate reason.\u201d <em>Safeco, </em>31 P.3d at 56; <em>accord Welch, </em>90 P.3d at 475; <em>Marley, </em>151 S.W.3d at 36. Many other courts have found reasons to conclude such exclusions are not arbitrary. The exclusion helps keep umbrella policies affordable by avoiding \u201c\u2018coverage for those in the family circle, who, on account of their close intimacy, may be expected to be riding at frequent intervals in the insured car.\u2019 \u201d <em>Alfa Ins. Co. v. Hasselle, </em>74 So. 3d 371, 375-76 (Miss. Ct. App. 2011) <em>(quoting Perry v. S. Farm Bur. Cas. Ins. Co., </em>170 So.2d 628, 630 (Miss. 1965)). This has allowed insurers to offer umbrella policies at a cost far less than auto policies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEQ\">\u201c[UJmbrella policies\u2019 raison d\u2019etre is to provide individuals with affordable protection against excess judgments of third parties, rather than provide individuals with automobile insurance. This fundamental difference is underscored by the difference in premiums that an insurance company charges for the two types of policies. Due to the relative risks associated with each, the premiums that insurance companies charge for umbrella policies are substantially lower than the premiums that insurance companies charge for automobile insurance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-5\"><em>Kromer v. Reliance Ins. Co., </em>677 A.2d 1224, 1228 (Pa. Sup. 1996) (rejecting argument that umbrella polices must conform to requirements of Pennsylvania\u2019s mandatory auto insurance laws) (quoting <em>Stoumen v. Pub. Serv. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>834 F. Supp. 140, 143 (E.D. Pa. 1993)). Consistent therewith, the record of this case indicates that Les paid $289 annually for $250,000 per person and $500,000 per occurrence liability protection under his automobile policy, but only $201 annually for $2,000,000 per occurrence liability protection under the Umbrella Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">\u00b637 Other courts have noted the insurer\u2019s interest in avoiding the risk of collusive claims amongst family members:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>The concept of a household exclusion is a common one which has long enjoyed judicial support. Its purpose is to prevent suspect inter-family legal actions which may not be truly adversary and over which the insurer has little or no control.

Abolishment of spousal immunity no doubt prompted insurers to exclude spousal claims from coverage, but upholding the Exclusion in this Policy does not frustrate the abolishment of such immunity. Nothing in this decision prevents Sharon from bringing a negligence claim against Les, and she did so successfully, collecting pursuant to Les\u2019s automobile liability coverage. <em>See Costello v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>795 A.2d 151, 159 n. 3 (Md. App. Ct. 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">\u00b638  In conclusion, the Family Member Exclusion does not contravene an express statute, undermine the made-whole doctrine, constitute illusory coverage that \u201cdefeats coverage for which the insurer has received valuable consideration,\u201d or violate public policy in any other way. <em>Bennett, </em>261 Mont. at 389, 862 P.2d at 1148.

Did the District Court err by concluding that the Family Member Exclusion was unconscionable ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">\u00b640 In a very brief analysis, the District Court held that the Family Member Exclusion was unconscionable because it excluded from coverage a class of victims most likely to be exposed to injury, quoting Safeco\u2019s statement that \u201ctypical family relations require family members to ride together on the way to work, church, school, social functions, or family outings.\u201d <em>Safeco, </em>31 P.3d at 54-55. We have discussed above the dispositive distinctions between <em>Safeco </em>and Montana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\u00b641 \u2018Unconscionability requires a two-fold determination: that the contractual terms are unreasonably favorable to the drafter and that there is no meaningful choice on the part of the other party regarding acceptance of the provisions.\u201d <em>Summers v.

In <em>Leibrand v. Natl. Farmers Union Prop. &amp; Cas.

The McCartneys have not demonstrated that the coverages provided by the Umbrella Policy in exchange for the premium paid were rendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>oppressive because Sharon\u2019s excess liability claim against Les was excluded. Nor have they shown, by statistics or otherwise, that the exclusion of family members enabled State Farm to reap a benefit from an oppressive term or from illusory coverage. They have not shown that higher liability coverage for injuries suffered by family members was not available on the open insurance market.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AL1\">\u00b644  The only argument offered by McCartneys to demonstrate that the Family Member Exclusion unreasonably favors State Farm is that fit allows State Farm to arbitrarily deny coverage to any family member.\u201d As discussed above, however, \u00b6\u00b6 36-37, the Family Member Exclusion is not arbitrary in this manner. The exclusion makes it possible to make broad excess coverage available at an economical cost by excluding from coverage \u201cthose in the family circle, who, on account of their close intimacy, may be expected to be riding at frequent intervals in the insured car,\u201d <em>Perry, </em>170 So. 2d at 630, and by \u201cpreventing] suspect inter-family legal actions which may not be truly adversary and over which the insurer has little to no control.\u201d <em>Cocking, </em>628 P.2d at 4. The McCartneys\u2019 premiums for $2,000,000 in umbrella <em>coverage </em>were more economical than the premiums for $500,000 in automobile liability coverage. Permitting frequent family passengers to turn economical excess coverage into expensive liability coverage would be contrary to the Umbrella Policy\u2019s purpose and undermine its viability. We conclude that McCartneys have not carried the burden of establishing that the Family Member Exclusion is unconscionably one-sided, and the District Court erred in so concluding.

U.S., </em>132 U.S. 406, 415, 10 S. Ct. 134, 137, 33 L. Ed. 393, 397 (1889) (an unconscionable bargain is \u201csuch as no man in his senses and not under delusion would make on the one hand, and no honest and fair man would accept on the other[.]\u2019).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b184-6\"> The parties disputed in their briefing whether Les had purchased the highest limits of liability insurance available to him from State Farm. During oral argument, counsel for State Farm stated the record did not support Les\u2019s contention and that Les could have purchased higher liability limits, but that State Farm had not been given the opportunity to submit evidence of this fact for the record. McCartneys did not dispute this position at oral argument. As noted above, it was McCartneys\u2019 burden to establish the factual record necessary to support their unconscionability claim. <em>Westlake, </em>220 Mont. at 96, 713 P.2d at 552.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
