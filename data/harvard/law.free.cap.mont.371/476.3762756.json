Fred Weaver, Joan Weaver and Vicki Weaver (the Weavers) from the State\u2019s negligent fire containment procedures on their real property. The Weavers cross-appeal the Third Judicial District Court\u2019s denial of their post-trial motion for sanctions. The State raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b497-13\">\u00b62 <em>1. Whether the District Court erred when it denied the State\u2019s motion to dismiss the Weavers\u2019 negligence claim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-14\">\u00b63 <em>2. Whether the District Court erred when it granted the Weavers\u2019 motion to strike and prohibited the State from asserting a public duty doctrine defense.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-15\">\u00b64 <em>3. Whether the District Court incorrectly allowed the jury to find the State negligent in the absence of expert testimony establishing the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number><em>standard of care.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">\u00b65 <em>4. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by denying the State\u2019s motion to change venue.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">\u00b66 The Weavers raise one issue in their cross-appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">\u00b67 <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion by denying the Weavers\u2019 motion for discovery sanctions against the State.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">\u00b68 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">\u00b69 On August 7, 2000, a wildland fire started in the Ryan Creek drainage north of Interstate 90 in Granite County, near the Weavers\u2019 real property. Among other procedures employed to contain what became known as the Ryan Gulch Fire, the State initiated a \u2018back burn\u201d fire, a technique used to decrease the amount of flammable material in the fire\u2019s path. On August 13, 2000, fire spread onto the Weavers\u2019 property, causing substantial damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">\u00b610 On December 17, 2002, the Weavers filed a complaint alleging that the State failed to \u201cexercise ordinary care in the control, suppression and containment of the Ryan Gulch Fire.\u201d The Weavers alleged that their property was not damaged by the original Ryan Gulch Fire, but instead by the back burn fire, which the State had failed to control. The Weavers alleged that the State negligently started the back burn fire, in \u2018high wind conditions without adequate means of control and/or suppression.\u201d Additionally, the Weavers alleged that the back burn fire was unnecessary because the original wildland fire already had been contained through the efforts of local ranchers and farmers. The Weavers sustained damage to \u201ctimber, grazing land, natural resources and other property.\u201d On February 13, 2003, the State filed an answer denying liability for negligence and inverse condemnation and pleading several defenses. The parties engaged in discovery for some period of time and the case then lay dormant for approximately six years before the Weavers obtained new counsel in 2010. In November 2010, the District Court issued a scheduling order directing the parties to submit all motions by December 16, 2011, and to present the pretrial order and file all trial briefs by March 16, 2012. The court set the trial date for April 9,2012. \u00b611 The Weavers amended their complaint on April 21, 2011, to add a claim of inverse condemnation, alleging that the State damaged their property for public use. The State answered the amended complaint, again asserting several defenses. Neither answer raised the public duty doctrine as a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">\u00b612 In accordance with the scheduling order, the parties submitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>their proposed pretrial order and respective trial briefs on March 16, 2012. The Weavers\u2019 trial brief was directed exclusively to their inverse condemnation claim. The pretrial order included the State\u2019s contention that it was not liable to the Weavers under the public duty doctrine because, when a \u201cgovernmental entity owes a duty to the general public, that duty is not owed to any specific individual.\u201d The State presented legal argument on this contention in its trial brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">\u00b613 Both parties filed motions in response to the other\u2019s trial brief. The Weavers moved to strike the public duty doctrine defense because the State raised it for the first time in the proposed pre-trial order; they argued that the public duty doctrine is an affirmative defense under M. R. Civ. P. 8(c) that is waived if not pleaded. The District Court agreed that the State was required to plead the public duty doctrine as an affirmative defense and granted the motion to strike. The court held that, even if it was not an affirmative defense, the State\u2019s \u201cfailure to plead or otherwise raise the defense has prejudiced Plaintiffs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">\u00b614 In response to the Weavers\u2019 trial brief, the State moved to dismiss based on an alleged judicial admission in the brief that the State\u2019s fire management procedures were \u201creasonable and necessary,\u2019\u2019rather than negligent. The next day, the Weavers filed a Notice of Errata to correct the language the State had cited in support of its motion. Following argument from both parties, the District Court denied the State\u2019s motion in open court at the conclusion of a pretrial hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">\u00b615 The State moved for a change of venue on March 29, 2012, due to publication of three articles in the March 8, 2012 edition of the local newspaper, which the State argued contained biased and inflammatory comments that contaminated the potential jury pool. The District Court denied that motion in open court as well. The court considered whether the State had shown either presumed or actual prejudice, pursuant to <em>State v. Kingman, </em>2011 MT 269, 362 Mont. 330, 264 P.3d 1104. The court determined that the State failed to show presumed prejudice and that the existence of actual prejudice could not be evaluated until the parties had conducted <em>voir dire.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">\u00b616 After eight days of trial, the jury reached a verdict against the Weavers on their claim of inverse condemnation, but decided that the State negligently caused damage to the Weavers\u2019 property. By a vote of nine to three, the jury awarded damages to the Weavers in the amount of $730,000. Following the trial, the Weavers filed a \u2018Motion for Entry of Judgment on Jury Verdict,\u201d requesting sanctions on the ground that the State had committed \u201cprejudicial discovery abuse\u201dby providing inaccurate dates in the captions of photographs of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>wildfire, some of which were produced during discovery. A witness for the State had corrected the photograph dates at trial. The District Court denied the motion, \u201cgiven the verdict in favor of the Plaintiffs\u201d and \u2018lack of prejudice and bad faith.\u201d The State appeals the jury\u2019s verdict and the Weavers cross-appeal the District Court\u2019s denial of sanctions. Additional facts from the record and applicable standards of review will be discussed with respect to each issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">\u00b617 <em>1. Whether the District Court erred when it denied the State\u2019s motion to dismiss the Weavers\u2019 negligence claim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">\u00b618 As noted, the State sought dismissal of the negligence claim based on the statement in the W eavers\u2019 trial brief that the State\u2019s firefighting measures were \u201creasonable and necessary\u201d-a statement the State argues constituted a judicial admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">\u00b619 Where error has been predicated on the determination of a judicial admission, our cases have applied the typical standard of review for findings of fact and conclusions of law. That is, we review a district court\u2019s factual findings to determine whether they are clearly erroneous and its conclusions of law for correctness. <em>See e.g. Hart v. Hart, </em>2011 MT 102, \u00b6 10, 360 Mont. 308, 258 P.3d 389; <em>Conagra, Inc. v. Nierenberg, </em>2000 MT 213, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23, 301 Mont. 55, 7 P.3d 369. Whether a statement is one of fact or law, for the purpose of determining if the statement should be considered a judicial admission, is a question of law. <em>See Stevens v. Novartis Pharms. Corp., </em>2010 MT 282, \u00b6 75, 358 Mont. 474, 247 P.3d 244 (\u2018The District Court correctly ruled that Stevens\u2019 statements made in prior pleadings were not judicial admissions because they were not statements of fact.\u201d}. Ultimately, a district court\u2019s determination whether a statement constitutes a judicial admission \u201cdepends upon the circumstances of each case.\u201d <em>Kohne v. Yost, </em>250 Mont. 109, 113, 818 P.2d 360, 362 (1991). As such, we will review that determination for an abuse of discretion. <em>American Title Ins. Co. v. Lacelaw Corp., </em>861 F.2d 224, 227 (9th Cir. 1988) (\u201c[Statements of fact contained in a brief <em>may </em>be considered admissions of the party in the discretion of the district court.\u201d); <em>see also Gospel Missions of Am. v. City of L. A., </em>328 F.3d 548, 557 (9th Cir. 2003) (\u2018We have discretion to consider a statement made in briefs to be a judicial admission, ... binding on both this court and the trial court.\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">\u00b620 A judicial admission is a statement or \u201cexpress waiver\u201d made in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>a court proceeding by a party or its counsel \u201cconceding the truth of an alleged fact.\u201d <em>Bitterroot Int\u2019l Sys. v. Western Star Trucks, </em>Inc., 2007 MT 48, \u00b6 41, 336 Mont. 145, 153 P.3d 627. Judicial admissions may be made at \u201c \u2018any point during the litigation process,\u2019 including \u2018during discovery, pleadings, opening statements, direct and cross-examination, as well as closing arguments.\u2019 <em>\u201dNovartis, </em>\u00b6 74 (quoting <em>In re Est. of Hill, </em>281 Mont. 142, 149-50, 931 P.2d 1320, 1325 (1997)). \u201cA judicial admission has a conclusive effect upon the party who makes it, and prevents that party from introducing further evidence to prove, disprove, or contradict the admitted fact.\u201d Hart, \u00b6 14 (quoting <em>Bitteroot Int\u2019l Sys., </em>\u00b6 41). A judicial admission is not binding unless it is \u201can unequivocal statement of fact and not the expression of an opinion or a legal conclusion.\u201d <em>Papich v. Quality Life Concepts, </em>Inc., 2004 MT 116, \u00b6 31, 321 Mont. 156, 91 P.3d 553 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">\u00b621 The Weavers\u2019 trial brief did not address their claim of negligence, but focused exclusively on their inverse condemnation claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\">This was not an irrational decision given the cost to society in shutting down the power supply for hundreds of thousands of people in Missoula and the Inland Northwest, in destroying telephone and 911 equipment, in closing [Interstate 90], in burning up the radio gear at Union Peak or losing the historic site of Garnet. It was surely a reasonable and necessary decision to direct the fire to the east, or to at least let it move across the Weaver property to flatter, defensible space. But the destruction of the Weaver Ranch to serve the great[er] good was, ultimately, a taking.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">\u00b622 The day after the State moved to deem the above statement a judicial admission, the Weavers filed a notice of errata due to an alleged \u201cscriveners\u2019 error,\u201d amending their trial brief to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\">Whether or not it was a reasonable and necessary decision to direct the fire to the east, or to at least let it move across the Weaver property to flatter, defensible space, the destruction of the Weaver Ranch to serve the greater good was, ultimately, a taking.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYY\">The State asserted that even the amended trial brief reflected a theme that the State\u2019s fire-fighting measures were reasonable and appropriate given the circumstances. The District Court denied the State\u2019s motion based on its observation that the statement concerned the Weavers\u2019 alternative inverse condemnation claim and its determination that the disputed portion of the Weavers\u2019 trial brief constituted a conclusion of law, not an admission of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">\u00b623 The State argues that the above-quoted language characterizes what the firefighting team did while suppressing the fire and thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>constitutes an admission of fact. According to the State, \u201cthe Weavers conceded the State acted reasonably.\u201d The Weavers assert that they \u201cadmitted no facts\u201d in their trial brief and point out that the issues of law stipulated in the pretrial order included whether the State\u2019s actions in fighting the fire were reasonable. In the event that the statement in their pretrial brief amounted to a judicial admission, the Weavers argue that they promptly withdrew it upon discovery of their \u201cscrivener\u2019s error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">\u00b624 We agree with the District Court that the relevant language in the Weavers\u2019 pretrial brief was not an \u201cunequivocal statement of fact.\u201d <em>Papich, </em>\u00b6 31. As the District Court noted, the trial brief addressed the Weavers\u2019 inverse condemnation claim, not their alternative claim of negligence. <em>See Novartis, </em>\u00b6 70 (pleadings \u201cpermit hypothetical and inconsistent claims\u201d). Further, whether the State \u201cacted reasonably\u201d in directing the fire to the east was not a fact, but a legal conclusion to be based on the facts found by the jury. <em>Novartis, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 73-75 (statement in pleading that doctor was negligent for failure to communicate risk was a conclusion of law and therefore not a judicial admission).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">\u00b625 <em>Kohne v. Yost, </em>on which the State relies, is not controlling. There, we held that a jury verdict finding the defendant not negligent could not stand where defense counsel conceded negligence during closing arguments and admitted that his client had fired a B.B. gun at the plaintiff. <em>Kohne, </em>250 Mont. at 110-111, 818 P.2d at 360-361. We held that the \u201c[d]efense counsel\u2019s unequivocal statements, taken in full context with the rest of his closing argument, constituted judicial admissions on the issue of negligence binding his client.\u201d <em>Kohne, </em>250 Mont. at 113, 818 P.2d at 362. The <em>Kohne </em>court did not analyze separately which of counsel\u2019s statements were admissions of fact as opposed to conclusions of law, but examined the statements as a whole in light of the circumstances of the case. <em>Kohne, </em>250 Mont. at 113, 818 P.2d at 362. Here, in contrast to <em>Kohne, </em>the context surrounding the Weavers\u2019 statement indicates it was not an admission of fact on their alternative theory of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">\u00b626  In further contrast to <em>Kohne, </em>the Weavers immediately modified the disputed language to clarify their intended meaning. <em>See Conagra, Inc., </em>\u00b6 45 (a judicial admission is \u201cnot effective if it was subsequently modified or explained so as to show that the litigant was mistaken\u201d (quoting <em>Griffin v. Superior Ins. Co., </em>338 S.W.2d 415, 418 (Tex. 1960)) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Based on its review of the circumstances of this case, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the statement did not constitute a judicial admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>\u00b627 <em>2. Whether the District Court erred when it granted the Weavers\u2019 motion to strike and prohibited the State from asserting a public duty doctrine defense?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">The District Court\u2019s Ruling</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u00b628 The Weavers\u2019 amended complaint alleged that the State \u201cowed a duty to [the Weavers] to act in a reasonable manner and to exercise ordinary care in the control, suppression and containment of the Ryan Gulch Fire.\u201dThe State answered that allegation as follows: \u201cAnswering paragraph 13, admits that the State owed to the Plaintiffs any duties prescribed by law, but deny the remaining assertions of said paragraph.\u201d The State did not mention the public duty doctrine in its answer or file any pretrial motions on the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">\u00b629 On March 16, 2012-three weeks before the trial began-the State filed its trial brief. For the first time since the Weavers filed their complaint in 2002, the State asserted in that brief that the Weavers\u2019 negligence claim was fatally flawed because they could not establish that the State owed them a duty of reasonable care pursuant to the public duty doctrine. The State summarized its position in the Pretrial Order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-7\">The existence of a legal duty is a question of law to be determined by the Court. If there is no duty, there can be no breach of duty and a requisite element of a negligence claim is missing. Montana has adopted the public duty doctrine[,] which provides that where a governmental entity owes a duty to the general public, that duty is not owed to any specific individual. Montana Code Annotated \u00a776-13-115, which sets forth the State fire policy[,] provides in part, \u2018X.5) all private property in Montana has wildfire protection from a recognized fire protection entity.\u2019\u2019Thus, with regard to [the State\u2019s] efforts to suppress the Ryan Gulch fire, there was no duty to specific individuals such as the [Weavers,] but only to the general public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">\u00b630 In the Weavers\u2019 motion to strike this argument from the Pretrial Order, they argued that the \u2018State should not be allowed to include ... matters in the Pretrial Order that it did not include in its pleadings\u201d as either contentions or affirmative defenses because allowing such a tactic deprived the Weavers of\u2018fair notice, possible] discovery, and the opportunity for motion practice ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">\u00b631 After determining that the public duty doctrine was an affirmative defense that should have been raised in the State\u2019s answer, the court ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-10\">Even if the public duty doctrine does not constitute an \u201cavoidance\u201d or affirmative defense under M. R. Civ. P. 8(c), Defendants\u2019 failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>to plead or otherwise raise the defense has prejudiced Plaintiffs. Defendants\u2019 pleadings do not provide Plaintiffs with notice that the public duty doctrine would be asserted as a defense. The [State\u2019s] Amended Answer does not assert any specific defenses with respect to a duty. The Court\u2019s review of the file indicates that the public duty doctrine was not raised by Defendants at any time prior to its inclusion in the [Pretrial Order]. Defendants\u2019 failure to raise the public duty doctrine earlier in this case has prejudiced the ability of Plaintiffs to conduct discovery and gather facts that might defeat the defense. Under these circumstances, it would be prejudicial and unfair to permit Defendants to assert the public duty doctrine on the eve of trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">\u00b632 Because the District Court granted the motion to strike based on its determination that the Weavers would be prejudiced by the State\u2019s failure to raise the issue until three weeks before trial, we review its determination for abuse of discretion as a matter of trial administration. <em>Fink v. Williams, </em>2012 MT 304, \u00b6 18, 367 Mont. 431, 291 P.3d 1140; <em>Blanton v. Dep\u2019t of Pub. HHS, </em>2011 MT 110, \u00b6 22, 360 Mont. 396, 255 P.3d 1229.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">\u00b633 The State asserts that the District Court erroneously held that it was required to plead the public duty doctrine as an affirmative defense. Since the public duty doctrine \u201casks whether liability exists in the first place-whether a duty is owed under the facts-not whether the defendant can avoid liability despite the existence of a duty,\u201d the State argues that it does not qualify as an affirmative defense. The State does not address the District Court\u2019s alternative rationale for striking the defense-fchat the State prejudiced the Weavers by asserting it at such a late date.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">\u00b634 M. R. Civ. P. 8(c)(1) provides that \u201c[i]n responding to a pleading, a party must affirmatively state any avoidance or affirmative defense ....\u201d We have explained the distinction between a denial under M. R. Civ. P. 8(b) and an affirmative defense under Rule 8(c): \u2018Rule 8(b), M.R.Civ.P., \u2018is concerned with negative defenses-those that controvert the adversary\u2019s claim. Rule 8(c), on the other hand, is concerned with affirmative defenses4he pleading of matter that is not within the claimant\u2019s prima facie case.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019 Burns v. Cash Constr. Lien Bond, </em>2000 MT 233, \u00b6 32, 301 Mont. 304, 8 P.3d 795 (quoting <em>Sterrett v. Milk River Prod. Credit Ass\u2019n, </em>234 Mont. 459, 463-64, 764 P.2d 467, 469 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"ASb\">\u00b635  The parties point out that this Court has not addressed whether the public duty doctrine is an affirmative defense that must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>affirmatively be pleaded under M. R. Civ. P. 8(c). Given the manner in which this case was pleaded and in which it proceeded, and in light of the District Court\u2019s ultimate basis for its ruling, we determine that this is not the appropriate case in which to decide that question. We have observed that Rule 8(c) concerns the underlying principles of\u2018fairness and notice.\u201d <em>Ammondson v. Northwestern Corp., </em>2009 MT 331, \u00b6 55, 353 Mont. 28, 220 P.3d 1. Likewise, under Rule 8(b), a defendant\u2019s pleading must \u201capprise the opponent of those allegations in the complaint that stand admitted and will not be in issue at trial and those that are contested and will require proof to be established to enable the plaintiff to prevail.\u201d Wright &amp; Miller, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 3d </em>\u00a71261, 526 (West 2004). Because the State raised the public duty doctrine so close to the date of trial, the District Court concluded that the Weavers would have no opportunity to explore applicability of the doctrine to their case, such as whether any special relationship exception applied (e.g. <em>Nelson v. State, </em>2008 MT 336, \u00b6 36, 346 Mont. 206, 195 P.3d 293); likewise, there was inadequate time for the issue to be briefed and considered by the court before trial. Given that the State\u2019s answer did not unequivocally deny the existence of a duty, and given further its failure to raise the issue of duty-an issue of law-at any time prior to filing its trial brief, the District Court was within its discretion to hold that the Weavers had not sufficiently been put on notice that the State intended to invoke the public duty doctrine and that it would unfairly prejudice them to allow the issue to be raised at that late stage in the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">\u00b636  \u2018In determining whether a trial court abused its discretion, the question is not whether the reviewing court agrees with the trial court, but rather whether the trial court acted arbitrarily without the employment of conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>State v. Price, </em>2006 MT 79, \u00b6 17, 331 Mont. 502, 134 P.3d 45. We do not decide in this case whether or not the public duty doctrine is an affirmative defense or whether or not it could apply to claims arising from government efforts to suppress wildfires. We hold only that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in striking the defense under the circumstances presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">\u00b637 <em>3.

Dept. of Revenue., </em>2012 MT 145, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>\u00b6 26, 365 Mont. 336, 281 P.3d 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">\u00b639 The State argues that the Weavers failed to establish through expert testimony the standard of care for wildfire suppression and, as a result, also failed to establish the elements of breach and causation in support of their negligence claim. On that basis, the State contends that the Weavers did not meet their burden of proof and \u201ctheir negligence claim failed as a matter of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">\u00b640 The Weavers argue that the State waived review of this issue by failing to raise it before the District Court. In particular, the Weavers point out that the State did not challenge the instructions provided to the jury regarding duty, breach and causation, nor did it move at any time for judgment as a matter of law. The State does not address the waiver argument in its reply brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">\u00b641 The trial court instructed the jury on the standard of care as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-8\">Every person or entity is responsible for injury to the property of another, caused by its negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-9\">Negligence is the failure to use reasonable care. Negligence may consist of action or inaction. A person or entity is negligent if they fail to act as an ordinarily prudent person would act under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">The State did not object to this instruction, and in fact proposed a virtually identical instruction. There was no discussion during settlement of instructions that expert testimony had not been offered sufficient to establish the standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-11\">\u00b642 \u201cUnder Montana law, expert testimony is required to establish the standard of care \u2018unless the conduct complained of is readily ascertainable by a lay[person].\u2019 <em>\u201dBrookins v. Mote, </em>2012 MT 283, \u00b6 63, 367 Mont. 193, 292 P.3d 347 <em>(quoting Deaconess Hosp. v. Gratton, 169 </em>Mont. 185, 189, 545 P.2d 670, 672 (1976)). Where the standard of care must be established by expert testimony, it is well-established that without such expert testimony, \u201cno genuine issue of material fact exists and the defendant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Estate of Willson v. Addison, </em>2011 MT 179, \u00b6 17, 361 Mont. 269, 258 P.3d 410 (citing cases). The State did not object to instructing the jury on the Weavers\u2019 claim of negligence on the basis that they had failed to prove an essential element of their cause of action. Although the State argues on appeal that Richard Mangan, the Weavers\u2019 expert on fire suppression efforts, failed to establish the standard of care for managing the fire, the State did not object to his testimony on that ground, nor did the State move for judgment as a matter of law for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>Weavers\u2019 failure to present evidence of breach of the applicable standard of care. Both cases the State cites in support of its position that expert testimony was required are cases in which this Court upheld summary judgment. <em>Dayberry v. City of E. Helena, </em>2003 MT 321, 318 Mont. 301, 80 P.3d 1218; <em>Dubiel v. Mont. Dept. of Transp., </em>2012 MT 35, 364 Mont. 175, 272 P.3d 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">\u00b643 We agree with the Weavers that the State \u201ccannot now claim that it was denied something that was never requested of, or actually denied by, the District Court.\u201d <em>Schwabe v. Custer\u2019s Inn Assocs., </em>2000 MT 325, \u00b6 57, 303 Mont. 15, 15 P.3d 903 (overruled on other grounds, <em>Giambra v. Kelsey, </em>2007 MT 158, \u00b6 58, 338 Mont. 19, 162 P.3d 134); <em>see Horn v. Bull River Country Store Props., </em>2012 MT 245, \u00b6 25, 366 Mont. 491, 288 P.3d 218 (\u2018We will not place the District Court in error \u2018for an action to which the appealing party acquiesced ....\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>In re A.A., </em>2005 MT 119, \u00b6 26, 327 Mont. 127, 112 P.3d 993)); \u00a71-3-207, MCA. The State does not cite any instance in the record where it objected to the Weavers\u2019 failure to present sufficient evidence on the standard of care. We conclude that the State has waived review of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">\u00b644 <em>4. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by denying the State\u2019s motion to change venue.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">\u00b645 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for change of venue for an abuse of discretion. <em>Eklund v. Wheatland Co., </em>2009 MT 231, \u00b6 15, 351 Mont. 370, 212 P.3d 297. \u2018The trial judge is uniquely positioned to assess whether a change of venue is called for due to prejudice in the community.\u201d <em>State v. Kingman, </em>2011 MT 269, \u00b6 40, 362 Mont. 330, 264 P.3d 1104.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">\u00b646 Section 25-2-201, MCA, provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he court or judge must, on motion, change the place of trial\u201d when \u2018there is reason to believe that an impartial trial cannot be had therein,\u201d or \u201cwhen the convenience of witnesses and the ends of justice would be promoted by the change.\u201d Section 25-2-201(2)-(3), MCA. We recently clarified that prejudice may be actual or presumed. Presumed prejudice occurs when \u201cprejudicial, inflammatory publicity about a case has so saturated the community as to warrant a presumption that an impartial jury cannot be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Kingman, </em>\u00b6 42. Actual prejudice is established when it is shown, \u2018through voir dire or other means[,] that the jury pool harbors actual partiality or hostility against the defendant that cannot be laid aside.\u201d <em>Kingman, </em>\u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">\u00b647 As noted, prior to trial, the State moved to change venue on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>basis of articles in the <em>Philipsburg Mail </em>that allegedly were \u201cclearly biased in favor of Plaintiffs.\u201d The State asserted that, within one month before trial, the <em>Philipsburg Mail </em>published \u201cthree (3) separate articles which indicted the Defendants for setting a fire that burned onto Plaintiffs\u2019 property and further reports that one of the supervisors on the fire apologized for having burned across the Plaintiffs\u2019 property.\u201d The State suggested that these articles were \u201cprejudicial and inflammatory information about the alleged cause of the fire\u201d and that, given the large readership of the newspaper, small population of Granite County, and small size of the jury pool, an impartial jury could not be obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">\u00b648 During its March 29, 2012 hearing, the District Court considered the parties\u2019 arguments and denied the State\u2019s motion to change venue. The court explained that the State had not demonstrated presumed prejudice on the basis of \u201cone edition of the Philipsburg Mail that discussed the trial,\u201d and also would not be able to demonstrate actual prejudice until voir dire had taken place. To address the State\u2019s concerns, the court proposed a process by which it would attempt expeditiously to add thirty-five jurors to the current pool. Both parties expressed agreement with that procedure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">[THE COURT:] So Plaintiff are you okay with that process for going back to fill in the jury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">MR. RHOADES: Yes, Your Honor, so stipulated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">THE COURT: Okay. And Mr. Sheridan?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-8\">MR. SHERIDAN: We would so stipulate, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">The District Court also stated that it would increase the amount of time permitted for jury selection.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">\u00b649 During voir dire, the State struck several prospective jurors for cause, but ultimately agreed to the twelve empanelled jurors, stating, Tw]e would pass these jurors for cause, Your Honor.\u201d The State does not reference on appeal, and the record does not reflect, any objection made by the State at trial that an impartial jury could not be selected. Nor did the State renew its motion for change of venue at the conclusion of voir dire. We made clear in <em>Kingman </em>the standards and procedures for analyzing presumed and actual prejudice. Though analyzed in the context of a criminal proceeding, both parties cite <em>Kingman </em>on this point and we agree that its analysis applies here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-11\">As the basis of a motion for change of venue, the defendant may allege presumed prejudice, actual prejudice, or both. Where presumed prejudice is alleged-meaning that the court is being asked to presume that jurors selected from the community cannot be impartial-the bar is extremely high. The defendant must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>demonstrate that an irrepressibly hostile attitude pervades the jury pool or that the complained-of publicity has effectively displaced the judicial process and dictated the community\u2019s opinion as to the defendant\u2019s [liability].... Where such extreme circumstances are not present, and actual prejudice is alleged, the defendant must show through voir dire or other means that the jury pool harbors actual partiality or hostility against the defendant that cannot be laid aside.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-4\"><em>Kingman, </em>\u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">\u00b650  The State does not argue presumed prejudice on appeal. It argues, rather, that the record shows actual prejudice demonstrated by the prospective jurors during voir dire. By its failure to renew the motion, however, the State did not give the District Court an opportunity to revisit the venue ruling on the basis of any \u201cactual partiality or hostility\u201d evidenced during voir dire. Under these circumstances, the State effectively acquiesced in the District Court\u2019s ruling denying the motion to change venue and failed to preserve the issue for appeal. Section 1-3-207, MCA; <em>Horn, </em>\u00b6 25; <em>In re A.A., </em>\u00b6 26. \u00b651 5. <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion by denying the Weavers\u2019 motion for sanctions against the State.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">\u00b652 This Court will reverse a trial court\u2019s refusal to invoke M. R. Civ. P. 37 sanctions \u201conly when the trial court\u2019s judgment materially affected the substantial rights of the parties or allowed a possible miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Rada, </em>263 Mont. 402, 406, 869 P.2d 254, 256 (1994). We review a trial court\u2019s rulings on post-trial motions for abuse of discretion. <em>State ex rel. State Compen. Mut. Ins. Fund v. Berg., </em>279 Mont. 161, 175, 927 P.2d 975, 983 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"ATl\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">\u00b653 The Weavers sought an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and prejudgment interest as a result of what they allege to be \u201cegregious\u201d discovery abuse by the State. The Weavers\u2019 motion arose from their realization during trial that some photographs of the fire taken by State witnesses had not been produced in discovery or bore incorrect dates, and their claim that a video of the fire was untimely produced and also had an incorrect date. The Weavers alleged that the State knowingly sponsored inaccurate trial exhibits and deliberately failed to produce requested photographs until after the trial had concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">\u00b654 While the State admitted that the videotape of the Ryan Gulch Fire, which was provided shortly before trial, should have been disclosed in a more timely manner, the District Court concluded that there was no indication that the State had acted in bad faith and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>the Weavers had not shown that the State had concealed, destroyed or altered any documents. The court observed, rather, that it became apparent immediately before and during the trial that some of dates captioned were inconsistent with metadata on the photographs, which one witness explained during his testimony. The court further observed that the incorrect date on the video was brought out during cross-examination of another witness. The District Court noted the importance of the evidence concerning the status and location of the fire on various dates and commented that, had the trial produced a different outcome, the dates on the photographs \u201cmight well be problematic.\u2019Tn light of the verdict, however, the court could \u201cconceive of no prejudice to the Plaintiffs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">\u00b655  On appeal, the Weavers have offered no additional reasons for concluding that the State acted willfully or in bad faith. While they posit that the verdict on their inverse condemnation claim \u201ccould well have\u201d been different had the Weavers received accurate and unedited photographs and video before trial, this claim is speculative. The Weavers have failed to demonstrate that the trial court\u2019s judgment \u201cmaterially affected the substantial rights of the parties or allowed a possible miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Marriage of Rada, </em>263 Mont. at 406, 869 P.2d at 256. The trial court was in the best position to evaluate the State\u2019s lack of bad faith and the absence of prejudice to the Weavers and did not abuse its discretion in denying their motion for sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">\u00b656 The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b510-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, McKINNON and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
