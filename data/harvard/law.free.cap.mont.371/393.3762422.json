W e affirm the class certification but modify the certified class relief on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by finding that the proposed class met the requirements of M. R. Civ. P. 23(a)?</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by certifying a M. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) class action lawsuit?</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">\u00b65 3. Whether the District Court erred by holding that the Montana Rules of Evidence do not apply to class action proceedings?</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">\u00b66 This interlocutory appeal arises from the District Court\u2019s order certifying a class in Jacobsen\u2019s class action against Allstate. Jacobsen\u2019s class action claim in turn arose out of our remand of his initial non-class third-party claim against Allstate in <em>Jacobsen v. Allstate Ins. </em>Co., 2009 MT 248, 351 Mont. 464, 215 P.3d 649 <em>(Jacobsen I). </em>As we recounted <em>in Jacobsen I, </em>Jacobsen suffered bodily injuries and property damage in an automobile accident caused by Allstate\u2019s insured in 2001. Allstate admitted liability and negotiated a settlement with Jacobsen while he was unrepresented by counsel. Allstate\u2019s adjuster, Chuck Conners (Conners) used Allstate\u2019s Claim Core Process Redesign (CCPR) program to process Jacobsen\u2019s claim. The CCPR is a system of claims adjusting guidelines that Allstate implemented in 1995 to fast track settlements and reduce the amount paid out on claims. Conners utilized the general outlines of the CCPR in settling Jacobsen\u2019s claim. The program facilitated a quick, unrepresented settlement six days after the accident for $3,500 and 45 days of \u201copen\u201d medical payment. As part of the settlement, Jacobsen signed a release.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">\u00b67 Roughly three weeks later, Jacobsen began experiencing significant pain. Jacobsen contacted Conners and asked him to reconsider the release and provide additional assistance. Conners refused because Jacobsen had signed a release. Jacobsen retained counsel, who successfully persuaded Allstate to rescind the release and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>re-open Jacobsen\u2019s claim. Due to the efforts of Jacobsen\u2019s newly-hired attorney, Allstate settled Jacobsen\u2019s claim for $200,000 on November 27,2002, roughly 18 months after his initial, unrepresented settlement for $3,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">\u00b68 Thereafter, Jacobsen retained new counsel and filed a complaint against Allstate seeking compensatory damages for various violations of the Montana Unfair Trade Practices Act (UTPA), common law bad faith, intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress (IIED and NIED respectively), and also seeking punitive damages pursuant to \u00a7 27-1-221, MCA. Jacobsen ultimately sought compensatory damages based on the attorney fees he incurred in pursuing his underlying claim and punitive damages based on Allstate\u2019s alleged malicious conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">\u00b69 The jury returned a verdict in favor of Jacobsen on October 19, 2006, finding Allstate liable for common law and statutory bad faith and awarding Jacobsen $68,372.38 in compensatory damages. The jury specifically found that Allstate violated the UTPA by misrepresenting pertinent facts regarding the claim and neglecting to attempt in good faith to promptly, fairly, and equitably settle a claim in which liability was reasonably clear. The jury also awarded Jacobsen $350,000 in punitive damages based on its finding that Allstate acted with actual malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">\u00b610 Following the verdict, both Jacobsen and Allstate appealed various rulings by the District Court. Our resolution of these appeals comprises <em>Jacobsen I. </em>One issue under consideration in <em>Jacobsen I </em>concerned the discovery of what were termed the \u2018McKinsey documents.\u201d The McKinsey documents consist of around 12,500 PowerPoint slides produced by McKinsey &amp; Company (McKinsey), a management consulting firm, for Allstate. The CCPR program is a distillation of the studies and recommendations contained in the McKinsey documents, and they consequently provide a more complete understanding of the program. However, Jacobsen was unaware of the existence of the McKinsey documents at the time of his initial discovery request or motion to compel production of the CCPR. When he became aware of them, Jacobsen sought leave of the court to assert new individual and class action claims against Allstate and to pursue additional discovery. The District Court denied these requests, finding that they would \u201ccause substantial prejudice and undue delay, burden, and expense^]\u201d <em>Jacobsen I, </em>\u00b6 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">\u00b6 11 In his pre-remand appeal, Jacobsen argued that the District Court erred by denying his request for further discovery. We found that because \u201cthe issue before the District Court was not whether to re-open <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>discovery, but whether to compel Allstate to produce documents that were within J acobsen\u2019s original discovery request,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\u201dit was \u201cunnecessary to determine whether Jacobsen demonstrated due diligence or excusable neglect[.]\u201d <em>Jacobsen 1, </em>\u00b6 57. We concluded \u201c[t]he McKinsey documents were indeed critical to Jacobsen\u2019s theory that Allstate\u2019s policies regarding unrepresented claimants constituted bad faith\u201d and reversed the District Court\u2019s decision. <em>Jacobsen I, </em>\u00b6 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">\u00b612 We ultimately remanded the case for a new trial, finding that the jury\u2019s award of compensatory damages could not be based solely on Jacobsen\u2019s incurred attorney costs and fees and that there could be no punitive damages following this reversal of the compensatory damages award. We also ordered the court to allow the jury to consider Jacobsen\u2019s emotional distress damages and directed the District Court to compel the production of the McKinsey documents. <em>Jacobsen I, </em>\u00b6 67.</p>\n<p id=\"AZI\">\u00b613 On remand, bolstered by the production of the McKinsey documents, J acobsen filed a motion for leave to file a Fourth Amended Complaint that added class action claims concerning Allstate\u2019s CCPR program. Count Four of Jacobsen\u2019s Fourth Amended Complaint, filed May 6, 2010, contained the newly-added class action claims. Jacobsen based the class claims on his prior individual theories asserting violations of the UTPA<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and common law bad faith. Specifically, Count Four alleged that Allstate\u2019s CCPR program violated the UTPA \u201cand/or common law bad faith laws\u201d by intentionally misrepresenting that unrepresented claimants generally received more compensation than represented claimants and by settling unrepresented claims via an inadequate \u2018fast track\u201d component of the CCPR that resulted in unfair settlements. Count Four asserted these claims on behalf of \u201call unrepresented individuals who had either third party claims or first party claims against Allstate whose claims were adjusted by Allstate in Montana using its CCPR program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">\u00b614 Count Five presented a claim for a common fund recovery of attorney fees incurred in pursuing the class action, and Count Six presented a claim for attorney fees as a \u2018Private Attorney General\u201d by asserting that the State of Montana had failed to enforce \u00a7\u00a7 33-18-201(1) and (6), MCA. Regarding class relief, Jacobsen requested class <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>certification, injunctive relief prohibiting Allstate from using the CCPR program in Montana, an injunction requiring Allstate to \u201cre-open all claims in which liability was reasonable [sic] clear in which the Defendant applied the CCPR paradigm in settling such cases,\u201d an injunction requiring Allstate to disgorge unlawful profits, the award of punitive damages, and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">\u00b615 Jacobsen filed a motion for class certification on May 7, 2010, proposing a class definition encompassing \u201call unrepresented individuals who had either third-party claims or first-party claims against Allstate whose claims were adjusted by Allstate in Montana using its CCPR program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">\u00b616 The District Court certified a Rule 23(b)(2) class in its methodical June 30, 2012 Order. In the course of its analysis, the Court noted the United States Supreme Court\u2019s admonition in <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, </em>131 S. Ct. 2541, 2551-52 (2011), to conduct a \u2018Vigorous\u201dRule 23 analysis. The Court also construed the substantive essence of Plaintiffs asserted class claim to be, irrespective of individual outcomes, that the CCPR\u2019s settlement practices \u201cconstitute a common pattern and practice in violation of \u00a7\u00a733-18-201(1) and (6), MCA, as generally applied to the class as a whole, thereby resulting in indivisible harm to the class as a whole ....\u201d The court accordingly certified the following class claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">(A) the Casualty CCPR\u2019s unrepresented segment adjusting practices are a common pattern and practice in violation of \u00a7\u00a733-18-201(1) and (6), MCA, as generally applied to the class of unrepresented claimants as a whole;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-7\">(B) Allstate\u2019s common, systematic use of this pattern and practice in Montana caused indivisible harm to the class as a whole by operation of its zero-sum economic theory and the resulting inversely proportional relationship between Allstate profit increases and corresponding decreases in the total amount of compensation paid to the class of unrepresented claimants as a whole; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">(C) Allstate acted with \u201cactual malice,\u201d as defined by \u00a7 27-1-221(2), MCA, by intentionally, deliberately, and consciously creating and disregarding a high probability that the net effect of its Casualty CCPR\u2019s unrepresented segment practices would result in net settlement payouts to the class as a whole less than the net amount previously sufficient to fully and fairly settle unrepresented claims under Montana law[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">As support, the Court found that Jacobsen had proffered \u201csubstantial credible evidence\u201d that Allstate systematically adjusted unrepresented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>first and third-party claims involving bodily injury or property damage \"in the same general manner\u201d under the CCPR program. The Court thus rejected Allstate\u2019s claim that Jacobsen could not establish that all unrepresented claimant\u2019s settlements were unfair by reasoning that Jacobsen\u2019s claims concerned the \"preliminary manner, means, and course of adjustment systematically applied to the class as a whole in the context of the insurer\u2019s duties under \u00a7\u00a7 33-18-201(1) and (6), MCA,\u201d and not the \"ultimate outcomes\u201d of individual claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">\u00b617 The Court restructured Jacobsen\u2019s class definition as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">(1) all unrepresented claimants who made first-party or third-party claims to Allstate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">(2) for an amount in excess of the applicable policy deductible;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-7\">(3) for bodily injury or property damage related to an underlying motor vehicle incident or occurrence; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-8\">(4) whose claims were adjusted by Allstate in Montana to an unrepresented settlement since deployment in Montana of the various versions of the Casualty CCPR <em>(CCPR Implementation Manual (Tort States)).</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">The Court considered this reformed definition to be \u201csufficiently precise and homogenous for purposes of Rule 23.\u201dUsing this reformed class definition the Court determined that Jacobsen\u2019s class claim satisfied Rule 23(a)\u2019s four prerequisites-numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy. The Court certified Jacobsen\u2019s claim as a Rule 23(b)(2) class action and certified the following class action remedies as available upon proof of the certified class claim:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-10\">(A) [a] declaratory judgment adjudicating the constituent assertions of the certified class claim [which we have recounted in \u00b6 16];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-11\">(B) [a] mandatory injunction requiring Allstate to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-12\">(1) give all class members court-appointed notice of the right and opportunity to obtain re-opening and re-adjustment of their individual claims by timely returning a proof of claim form; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-13\">(2) re-open and re-adjust each individual claim upon receipt of a timely filed proof of claim;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-14\">(C) class-wide punitive damages pursuant to \u00a7\u00a727-1-220 and 27-1-221(2), MCA (actual malice), predicated on the above-referenced class-wide conduct; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-15\">(D) common fund recovery of class action attorney fees and costs upon a class-wide punitive damages award[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-16\">Allstate appeals the court\u2019s certification of Jacobsen\u2019s class claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>pursuant to Rule 23<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as well as the court\u2019s consideration of what Allstate argues was inadmissible evidence during the certification proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">\n<em>Allstate\u2019s CCPR Program and the McKinsey Documents.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">\u00b618 Due to Jacobsen\u2019s contention that Allstate\u2019s application of the CCPR program to unrepresented claimants amounts to statutory and common law bad faith, a brief summary of the program, and the related McKinsey documents, is in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">\u00b619 Allstate hired McKinsey in the early 1990\u2019s to help redesign its claims process. This redesign was prompted by Allstate\u2019s recognition that while claims expenses were low, total payouts were increasing at a pace above the industry average. The McKinsey documents outlined a claim settlement process, like the CCPR program, to lower claims payouts by increasing claimant contact and reducing attorney involvement. McKinsey essentially advocated \u2018increasing the number of early unrepresented settlements\u201d while \u2018holding the line\u201d on represented claims. This focus flowed from research showing that represented claims settled for 2-3 times more than unrepresented claims, that Allstate claims adjusters were not effectively initiating early contact or communicating with claimants, and that this failure to promptly and effectively communicate with claimants made claimants more likely to hire lawyers. The McKinsey documents ultimately styled claims adjusting as a \u2018kero sum\u201d economic game where if Allstate gains by reducing settlements, others-including \u201cmedical providers, plaintiff attorneys, and claimants\u2019-inust lose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AIj\">\u00b620 Allstate\u2019s CCPR program consequently strives to reduce overall claims payouts by establishing a more centralized, regimented claims adjusting process focused on quick claimant contact, building rapport, reducing claimant representation rates, and shuttling certain claims into a \u2018fast track\u201d system. Allstate applies the CCPR to both third and first-party claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">\u00b621 Here, Allstate\u2019s adjuster, Conners, utilized the CCPR program to obtain a fast track, unrepresented, reduced payment settlement of Jacobsen\u2019s claim. Jacobsen alleges that the CCPR program systematically violates the rights of unrepresented claimants as provided to them by the UTPA. Jacobsen specifically takes issue with the application of the CCRP\u2019s \u2018fast track\u201d system, \u20189-step process,\u2019\u2019and \u201cattorney economics script\u201d to his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>\u00b622 First, the \u201cfast track\u201d system seeks to promote settlement with claimants within 12 days of the accident. Jacobsen alleges that the system promotes quick settlements at the expense of fair settlements. A \u2018Fast Track Evaluation Worksheet\u201d controls whether a claim is amenable to \u2018fast track\u201d processing and requires: the claimant is unrepresented, there are no coverage questions, there are only soft tissue injuries and a good prognosis, no residuals, no aggravation of preexisting conditions, and treatment for less than 60 days. In this case, after Jacobsen accepted the initial $3,500 settlement, Conners processed Jacobsen\u2019s claim under the CCPR\u2019s \u2018fast track\u201d guidelines for unrepresented claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">\u00b623 Second, Conners generally utilized the \u20189-step process\u201d for unrepresented claimant contact. The CCPR\u2019s Initial Claimant Contact Outline for unrepresented claimants directs adjusters to: (1) establish empathy and gather injury facts; (2) confirm Allstate\u2019s customer service pledge; (3) gather loss facts; (4) confirm Allstate\u2019s liability decision; (5) discuss payment of medical bills and lost wages; (6) assist with car repairs; (7) assist with alternate transportation; (8) explain the bodily injury settlement process and discuss attorney economics; and (9) close the claim and follow-up. Jacobsen alleges the 9-step process increases Allstate\u2019s profits at the expense of good faith settlements.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">\u00b624 Third, in accordance with the CCPR, Conners discussed attorney economics with Jacobsen. The CCPR process explicitly seeks to reduce the number of represented claims to reduce claims payouts. This goal was motivated by Allstate\u2019s determination that represented claimants typically settled for 2-3 times (and perhaps up to 5 times) the amount unrepresented claimants received. To reduce attorney involvement, the CCPR aims to build rapport with claimants though quick, empathetic contact, and directs adjusters to utilize an \u201cattorney economics script.\u201d The script states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-6\">[qjuite often our customers ask if an attorney is necessary to settle a claim. Some people choose to hire an attorney, but we would really like the opportunity to work directly with you to settle the claim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-7\">Attorneys commonly take between 25-40% of the total settlement you receive ... plus expenses incurred. If you settle directly with Allstate, however, the total amount of the settlement is yours.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-8\">At any time in the process you may choose to hire an attorney. I would, however, like to make an offer to you first. This way, should you go to an attorney, you would be able to negotiate with the attorney so his/her fees would only apply to amounts over my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>offer to you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">The script\u2019s instructions counsel against improperly dissuading claimants from seeking representation and instruct adjusters to remind claimants that they are free to hire an attorney at any time and discuss the relevant statute of limitations. However, the script does not contain information advising that Allstate found that represented claimants generally received higher settlements. Jacobsen alleges Allstate\u2019s portrayal of \u201cattorney economics\u201d induced him into believing unrepresented claimants generally received more compensation for injuries and resulted in an initially unfair settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">\u00b625 We afford trial courts the broadest discretion when reviewing a decision on class certification. <em>Sieglock v. Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Ry. </em>Co., 2003 MT 355, \u00b6 8, 319 Mont. 8, 81 P.3d 495. This is because the trial court \u2018is in the best position to consider the most fair and efficient procedure for conducting any given litigation.\u201d <em>Chipman v. Northwest Healthcare Corp., </em>2012 MT 242, \u00b6 17, 366 Mont. 450, 288 P.3d 193. We will therefore not upset the District Court\u2019s decision without finding an abuse of discretion. In conducting this review we do not ask whether we would have reached the same decision, but instead ask whether the district court acted arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason. <em>Newman v. Lichfield, </em>2012 MT 47, \u00b6 22, 364 Mont. 243, 272 P.3d 625. However, \u2018\u201c[t]o the extent that the ruling on a Rule 23 requirement is supported by a finding of fact, that finding, like any other finding of fact, is reviewed under the \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019 standard. And to the extent that the ruling involves an issue of law, review is <em>de novo.\u2019 </em>\u201d <em>Mattson v. Mont. Power Co., </em>2012 MT 318, \u00b6 17, 368 Mont. 1, 291 P.3d 1209 <em>(Mattson </em>III) (quoting <em>Miles v.

Whether the District Court abused its discretion by finding that the proposed class met the requirements ofM. R. Civ. P. 23(a)?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">A. Rule 23(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">\u00b627 Initially, a class action claim is \u201c\u2018an exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the individual named parties only.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mattson III, </em>\u00b6 18 (quoting <em>Califano v. Yamasaki, </em>442 U.S. 682, 700-01, 99 S. Ct. 2545 (1979)). Departure from the usual rule is justified if the class representative is part of the class and possesses the same interest and suffers the same injury as the class members. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number><em>East Tex. Motor Freight System, Inc. v. Rodriguez, </em>431 U.S. 395, 403, 97 S. Ct. 1891 (1977). In this way, class action suits save the resources of courts and parties \u201c \u2018by permitting an issue potentially affecting every [class member] to be litigated in an economical fashion under Rule 23.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gen. Tel. Co. of the Southwest v. Falcon, </em>457 U.S. 147, 155, 102 S. Ct. 2364 (1982) (quoting <em>Califano, </em>442 U.S. at 701).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">\u00b628 Rule 23 of the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure governs certification of a class action and ensures that the named plaintiffs are appropriate representatives of the class. Because the Montana version of Rule 23 is identical to the corresponding federal rule, federal authority is instructive, but Montana courts are not required to march lockstep with federal interpretations of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23. <em>Chipman, </em>\u00b6 43. The four requirements found in Rule 23(a) provide the threshold inquiry courts engage in when considering a putative class. Specifically, Rule 23(a) requires that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-5\">(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-7\">(3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-8\">(4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">These prerequisites are intended to protect the due process rights of absent class members, <em>Hansberry v.

Ct. 115 (1940), and failure to establish any element of Rule 23(a) is fatal to class certification. <em>Chipman, </em>\u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">\u00b629 Moreover, we have recently adopted the following guidelines in an attempt to provide further clarification of Rule 23\u2019s proper standard of review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-11\">(1) a district judge may certify a class only after making determinations that each of the Rule 23 requirements has been met; (2) such determinations can be made only if the judge resolves factual disputes relevant to each Rule 23 requirement and finds that whatever underlying facts are relevant to a particular Rule 23 requirement have been established and is persuaded to rule, based on the relevant facts and the applicable legal standard, that the requirement is met; (3) the obligation to make such determinations is not lessened by overlap between a Rule 23 requirement and a merits issue, even a merits issue that is identical with a Rule 23 requirement; (4) in making such determinations, a district judge should not assess any aspect of the merits unrelated to a Rule 23 requirement; and (5) a district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>judge has ample discretion to circumscribe both the extent of discovery concerning Rule 23 requirements and the extent of a hearing to determine whether such requirements are met in order to assure that a class certification motion does not become a pretext for a partial trial of the merits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-4\"><em>Mattson v. Mont. Power Co., </em>2009 MT 286, \u00b6 67, 352 Mont. 212, 215 P.3d 675 <em>(Matson II). </em>Our application of these guidelines to the District Court\u2019s certification order in this case leads us to the conclusion that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by certifying Jacobsen\u2019s proposed class. The District Court based its class certification on a meticulous review of the evidence behind the pleadings. As class certification requires that the plaintiff satisfy all four requirements of Rule 23(a), we will address each requirement in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">i. Numerosity-Rule 23(a)(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">\u00b630 As noted, Rule 23(a)(1) requires that the proposed class be \u201cso numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.\u201d Here, the Court found that Jacobsen, using the deposition of Allstate Agent Conners, \u201creasonably estimated the size of the first proposed class [in <em>Jacobsen I\\ </em>at around 600 members.\u201d Because Jacobsen had enlarged the class post-remand by adding first-party claimants and automobile-related property damage claims, the Court concluded that the post-remand class met Rule 23(a)(l)\u2019s numerosity requirement. Allstate does not challenge this conclusion on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">ii. Commonality-Rule 23(a)(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">\u00b631 Allstate does contest the Court\u2019s finding that the proposed class satisfied the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2). Rule 23(a)(2) requires \u201cquestions of law or fact common to the class.\u201d Because the requirements of the rule are disjunctive, a party seeking class certification must have either common questions of law or fact, and total commonality is not required. <em>Sieglock, </em>\u00b6 11. The commonality requirement has therefore generally been seen as a relatively low burden for plaintiffs. <em>See Diaz v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield, </em>2011 MT 322, \u00b6 32, 363 Mont. 151, 267 P.3d 756 <em>(quoting LaBauve v.

Co. of Am., </em>2009 MT 109, \u00b6 26, 342 Mont. 380, 180 P.3d 1164 (citing <em>LaBauve, </em>231 F.R.D. at 668) (commonality \u2018is not a stringent threshold and does not impose an unwieldy burden on plaintiffs.\u201d); <em>McDonald v. Washington, </em>261 Mont. 392, 401, 862 P.2d 1150 (quoting <em>Jordan v. County of Los Angeles, </em>669 F.2d 1311, 1320 (9th Cir. 1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">\u00b632 As these cases indicate, we have a \u2018long history of relying on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>federal jurisprudence when interpreting the class certification requirements of Rule 23.\u201d <em>Chipman, </em>\u00b6 52. Federal Rule 23(a)(2) jurisprudence was further developed in 2011 by the U.S. Supreme Court in <em>Wal-Mart v. Dukes. </em>The <em>Wal-Mart </em>decision has raised the dual questions of whether it plots a new course for \u201ccommonality\u201d analysis and if this course materially differs from our own. We first considered Wal-Mart\u2019s treatment of Rule 23(a)(2) <em>in Chipman. </em>There, we recognized that the <em>Wal-Mart </em>decision had departed from our heretofore \u201cminimal standard\u201d and had \u201csignificantly tightened the commonality requirement.\u201d <em>Chipman, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 47-48. We then applied the <em>Wal-Mart </em>decision\u2019s \u201creasoning\u201d concerning Rule 23(a)(2) and upheld the class certification order. <em>Chipman, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 47, 52. We next considered Rule 23(a)(2) and <em>Wal-Mart </em>two months later in our <em>Mattson III </em>decision. There, we again referenced the Supreme Court\u2019s apparent tightening of Federal Rule 23(a)(2)\u2019s requirements and noted \u201ca recent divergence between the federal approach and Montana\u2019s approach to the commonality requirement.\u201d <em>Mattson III, </em>\u00b6 35. However, despite our application of <em>Wal-Mart\u2019s </em>\u201creasoning\u201d in <em>Chipman, </em>the <em>Mattson III </em>decision portrayed our decision to follow <em>Wal-Mart\u2019s </em>interpretation of Rule 23(a)(2) as an open question best left for some \u201cfuture case.\u201d <em>Mattson III, </em>\u00b6 37. Despite disclaiming our adoption of <em>Wal-Mart\u2019s </em>commonality reasoning, <em>Mattson III </em>still analyzed, and upheld, the District Court\u2019s class certification pursuant to the supposedly \u201cmore stringent\u201d federal standard. <em>Mattson III, </em>\u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">\u00b633 As Justice Baker observed in her dissenting opinion in <em>Mattson III, </em>our varying embrace of <em>Wal-Mart </em>in <em>Chipman </em>and <em>Mattson III </em>perhaps \u2018introduced] confusion into our class certification standards <em>...\u201d Mattson III, </em>\u00b6 45 (J. Baker, dissenting). Our opinion in <em>Mattson III </em>recognized this, and we determined that \u201c[i]t may be necessary in a future case-where the issue is properly briefed and argued, and the choice of one standard over the other is dispositive of the commonality inquiry-to decide whether Montana w ill retain its more permissive approach or instead adopt the <em>Wal-Mart </em>majority\u2019s <em>approach.\u201dMattson III, </em>\u00b6 37. This, however, is not that future case. Neither Jacobsen\u2019s nor Allstate\u2019s arguments hinge on the potential differences between <em>WalMart\u2019s </em>and Montana\u2019s approaches to commonality. Moreover, the District Court applied <em>Wal-Mart </em>in its order certifying the class. Because we affirm the District Court\u2019s certification of the class decision under <em>Wal-Mart, </em>the choice of one standard over the other is not dispositive. We therefore need not decide whether Montana will retain its approach to commonality or how these approaches differ, and we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>will proceed with a discussion of Jacobsen\u2019s proposed class in the context of <em>Wal-Mart.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">a. <em>Wal-Mart </em>and F. R. Civ. P. 23(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">\u00b634 In <em>Wal-Mart, </em>the U.S. Supreme Court considered a proposed class of 1.5 million current and former female Wal-Mart employees \u201cwho [alleged] that the company discriminated against them on the basis of their sex by denying them equal pay or promotions ....\u201d <em>Wal-Mart, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2547.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There, as here, the Court dealt with the requirements of the identical Federal Rule 23(a)(2). To satisfy the commonality requirement, the plaintiffs had proffered statistical evidence about pay and promotion disparities between genders, anecdotal reports of discrimination from female employees, and the expert testimony of a sociologist. The District Court reviewed this evidence and certified the proposed class. <em>Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>222 F.R.D. 137, 145, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11297 (N.D. Cal. 2004). In the course of its Rule 23(a) analysis, the District Court noted that \u201cthe party seeking certification must provide certain facts sufficient to satisfy Rule 23(a),\u201d that \u201cthe court\u2019s analysis [of Rule 23] must be rigorous,\u201d and that\u2018\u201cthe class determination generally involves considerations that are enmeshed in the factual and legal issues comprising the plaintiff s cause of action.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Dukes, </em>222 F.R.D. at 143-44. Wal-Mart opposed the commonality finding largely by advancing the unique nature of individual stores and its practice of giving local managers substantial discretion in pay and promotion decisions. <em>Dukes, </em>222 F.R.D. at 151.</p>\n<p id=\"Aog\">\u00b635 Wal-Mart appealed the class certification, contesting, <em>inter alia, </em>the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the class met the commonality requirement. The Ninth Circuit affirmed after granting a re-hearing en banc. <em>See Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>603 F.3d 571 (9th Cir. 2010). Wal-Mart again appealed and the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari, issuing its opinion in 2011. The majority considered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>decision on commonality to be the \u201ccrux\u201d of the case and engaged in an analysis of Federal Rule 23(a)(2)\u2019s requirements. The Court attempted to clarify the application of Rule 23(a)(2)\u2019s language and establish the proper standard of Rule 23(a)(2) adjudication. For our purposes, this clarification produced two important holdings, the first concerning the sufficiency of a plaintiffs common contentions and the second regarding the proper, \u201crigorous\u201d level of Rule 23(a) analysis. We will examine these clarifications in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">\u00b636 First, the majority cautioned that the language of the commonality rule is \u201ceasy to misread, since \u2018[a]ny competently crafted class complaint literally raises common \u2018questions.\u2019 \u201dWal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2551 (citation omitted). Thus, the majority sought to clarify <em>what sort </em>of common questions of law or fact satisfy Rule 23(a)(2). The majority emphasized that plaintiffs may not merely raise droves of superficial common questions (providing \u2018Do all of us plaintiffs indeed work for Wal-Mart?\u201d as an example). Instead, the plaintiffs\u2019 common legal or factual contentions must \u201cdemonstrate that the class members \u2018have suffered the same injury\u2019 \u201dby asserting a common contention \u201cof such a nature that it is capable of classwide resolution-which means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.\u201d <em>Wal-Mart, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2551.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This emphasis logically flows from the Court\u2019s prior justification of the class-action device\u2019s departure from the usual rule of individual litigation: \u2018^permitting an issue potentially affecting every [class member] to be litigated in an economical fashion under Rule 23.\u201d <em>Falcon, </em>457 U.S. at 155 (quoting <em>Califano, </em>442 U.S. at 700-01).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">\u00b637 Second, the Supreme Court sought to clarify what it saw as an inconsistent, and inadequate, level of Rule 23(a) review in the lower federal courts. In doing so, the <em>Wal-Mart </em>decision embraced what has been termed a \u201crigorous\u201d form of Rule 23(a) analysis. A \u201crigorous\u201d level of Rule 23(a) analysis was previously adopted by a majority of the federal Circuit Courts, and the \u2018inore rigorous\u201d approach adopted by the Second, Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits requires district courts to make specific findings that each requirement of Rule 23(a) has <em>actually, </em>not presumably, been met. <em>Dukes, </em>603 F.3d at 583. The <em>Wal-Mart </em>decision adopted the \u2018inore rigorous\u201d approach, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>district courts may certify a class \u201conly if\u2019 they are satisfied that the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) have actually been satisfied. <em>Wal-Mart, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2551. Further, in the course of making the required determination that Rule 23(a) has actually been satisfied, \u201c\u2018sometimes it may be necessary for the court to probe behind the pleadings before coming to rest on the certification question.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wal-Mart, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2551 (quoting <em>Falcon, </em>457 U.S. at 160). Thus, to the <em>Wal-Mart </em>majority, a proper \u201crigorous\u201d Rule 23(a) analysis specifically requires that the district court determine each requirement of Rule 23(a) has been actually met and allows, <em>but does not require, </em>the district court to probe beyond the pleadings and touch aspects of the merits to make this determination. <em>See Wal-Mart, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2551.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">\u00b638 The <em>Wal-Mart </em>majority\u2019s application of the clarified commonality requirement provides some further insight into its Rule 23(a)(2) analysis. Because the plaintiffs\u2019 class \u00e1ction alleged a company-wide policy of gender discrimination in violation of Title VII, the Supreme Court recognized that \u201cproof of commonality necessarily overlaps with respondents\u2019 merits contentions that Wal-Mart engages in a <em>pattern or practice </em>of discrimination.\u201d <em>Wal-Mart, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2552. The majority viewed the size of the class and disparate nature of Wal-Mart\u2019s employment decisions as particular problems, and determined that \u2018Twjithout some glue holding the alleged <em>reasons </em>for all those decisions together, it will be impossible to say that examination of all the class members\u2019 claims for relief will produce a common answer to the crucial questions <em>why was I </em>disfavored.\u201d <em>Wal-Mart, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2552. To provide this glue, the majority required the plaintiffs to <em>prove </em>that a company-wide policy existed. The majority accordingly reviewed the plaintiffs\u2019 proffered evidence and concluded that it could not prove that a company-wide policy existed. <em>Wal-Mart, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2553-57. Thus, the Supreme Court probed beyond the pleadings to determine a merits issue^whether Wal-Mart even <em>had </em>a company-wide pay or promotion policy-to determine if the plaintiffs could present a common contention amenable to classwide resolution. Unlike the present case, because the plaintiffs could not prove a uniform plan or policy, they could not present the question of whether they, and the proposed class members, had suffered a common injury as a result.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b429-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>b. Jacobsen\u2019s Proposed Class and the District Court\u2019s Rule 23(a)(2) Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">\u00b639 Here, the District Court applied the <em>Wal-Mart </em>decision\u2019s reasoning that the asserted class claim must depend upon a common contention that will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each member\u2019s claim. In applying this standard, the District Court looked beyond the allegations of Jacobsen\u2019s pleadings to find: (1) that Jacobsen had produced \u201csignificant proof\u2019 that Allstate intentionally and systematically failed to disclose that represented claimants received settlements 2-3 times larger than unrepresented claimants; (2) that Allstate developed the CCPR with the intent that it would reduce the net sum of unrepresented settlements; (3) that Allstate hid this profit motive by developing the facially neutral CCPR; (4) that Allstate consciously disregarded a high probability that the net effect of the CCPR would result in less than a full and fair settlement; and (5) that the CCPR program had resulted in \u201ca substantial, objectively measurable reduction in the total amount of compensation paid to the class of unrepresented claimants as a whole ....\u2019\u2019The Court concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>that these factual showings united Jacobsen and the class member\u2019s claims and supported the following common questions of law and fact, asking whether:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-4\">(1) the Casualty CCPR\u2019s unrepresented segment adjusting practices are a common pattern and practice in violation of \u00a7\u00a733-18-201(1) and (6), MCA, as generally applied to the class of unrepresented claimants as a whole;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">(2) Allstate\u2019s common, systematic use of this pattern and practice in Montana caused indivisible harm to the class as a whole by operation of its zero-sum economic theory and the resulting inversely proportional relationship between</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">Allstate profit increases and corresponding decreases in the total amount of compensation paid to the class of [sic] as a whole; and<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-7\">(3) Allstate has consciously disregarded a high probability that the net effect of its Casualty CCPR\u2019s unrepresented segment practices would result in net settlement payouts to the class as a whole less than the net amount previously sufficient to fully and fair[ly] settle unrepresented claims under Montana law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">Despite potential factual disputes, the Court determined that Jacobsen\u2019s proposed class action would provide the sort of \u201ccommon answers\u201d concerning the CCPR program that <em>Wal-Mart </em>encouraged. <em>See Wal-Mart, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2551. Indeed, because the presence of a common pattern and practice is undisputed, Jacobsen\u2019s common contentions do not suffer from the same defect as did the plaintiffs\u2019 contentions in <em>Wal-Mart.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">\u00b640 On appeal, Allstate first argues that because Jacobsen\u2019s claim is not predicated upon an assertion that his third-party bodily injury or property damage claims were ultimately settled unfairly or underpaid, there is no commonality between his claim and the alleged class claims. However, this argument misses the thrust of Jacobsen\u2019s class claim on remand. While Jacobsen\u2019s requested relief and alleged bases for damages are not entirely clear, the District Court determined that his claim asserts, in part, that Allstate\u2019s application of the CCPR to unrepresented claims is a per se violation of the UTPA and results in actual harm in the form of an alleged zero-sum economic plan systematically reducing claims payments to increase profits. This contention does not merely allege that the proposed class members <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>suffered a violation of the same provision of law \u201cin many ways.\u201d <em>See Wal-Mart, </em>131S. Ct. at 2551. Here, the presence of a \u201cgeneral business practice,\u201d the CCPR, is undisputed. Whether this general practice, as applied to unrepresented claimants, violates \u00a7 33-18-201(1) or (6), MCA, is just the sort of question that may efficiently drive the resolution of the litigation. <em>See Wal-Mart, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2551 (commonality requires the plaintiff to demonstrate that the class members \u2018have suffered the same injury.\u201d). This determination would not turn on the countless discretionary decisions that troubled the <em>Wal-Mart </em>majority, and would not be hampered by a variety of unique defenses and circumstances. Jacobsen\u2019s assertion that the CCPR, as applied to the class members, represents a per se violation of the UTPA would resolve a necessary, central question applicable to all class members.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">\u00b641 Judge Richard Posner\u2019s treatment of the Rule 23(b)(2) class certification at issue in <em>McReynolds v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>672 F.3d 482 (7th Cir. 2012) supports this conclusion. There, plaintiffs filed a class action suit alleging that Merrill Lynch engaged in a system of racial discrimination by utilizing a company policy that allowed brokers to form teams and that then rewarded team performance with increased broker account distributions. <em>McReynolds, </em>672 F.3d at 483, 489-90.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plaintiffs asked that the class be certified to determine whether the defendant had engaged in discriminatory practices and to provide injunctive relief. The plaintiffs also wanted compensatory and punitive damages. <em>McReynolds, </em>672 F.3d at 483. The district court denied class certification and the plaintiffs appealed. On appeal, Judge Posner considered the denied certification in the context of <em>Wal-Mart. McReynolds, </em>672 F.3d at 488. Judge Posner found that, unlike the <em>Wal-Mart </em>plaintiffs, Merrill Lynch\u2019s policies were an employment decision by the top management <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>that was appropriate for a class-wide determination as to whether the challenged policies had a disparate racial impact. <em>McReynolds, </em>672 F.3d at 489.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">\u00b642 Judge Posner reversed the district court\u2019s denial of class certification despite his recognition that a final resolution of the class\u2019s claims would require hundreds of separate trials to determine compensatory and punitive damages. As Judge Posner noted,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-5\">[o]bviously a single proceeding, while it might result in an injunction, could not resolve class members\u2019 claims. Each class member would have to prove that his compensation had been adversely affected by the corporate policies, and by how much. So should the claim of disparate impact prevail in the class-wide proceeding, hundreds of separate trials may be necessary to determine which class members were actually adversely affected by one or both of the practices and if so what loss he sustained-and remember that the class has 700 members. <em>But at least it wouldn\u2019t be necessary in each of those trials to determine whether the challenged practices were unlawful.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-6\"><em>McReynolds, </em>672 F.3d at 490-91 (emphasis added). To Judge Posner, Tt]he kicker is whether \u2018the accuracy of the resolution\u2019 would be \u2018unlikely to be enhanced by repeated proceedings.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019McReynolds, </em>672 F.3d at 491. As the Seventh Circuit previously said in <em>Mejdrech v. Met-Coil Systems Corp., </em>319 F.3d 910 (7th Cir. 2003),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-7\">If there are genuinely common issues, issues identical across all the claimants, issues moreover the accuracy of the resolution of which is unlikely to be enhanced by repeated proceedings, then it makes good sense, especially when the class is large, to resolve those issues in one fell swoop while leaving the remaining, claimant-specific issues to individual follow-on proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Amg\"><em>Mejdrech, </em>319 F.3d at 911. A single class trial for injunctive relief that determines the legality of a commonly applied procedure or policy is not only economical and attractive, but, in the alternative, Ttjhere isn\u2019t any feasible method ... for withholding injunctive relief until a series of separate injunctive actions has yielded a consensus for or against the plaintiffs.\u201d <em>McReynolds, </em>672 F.3d at 491; <em>see also Wal-Mart, </em>131 S.Ct at 2557 (\u201c[T]he key to the (b)(2) class is the, indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy warranted-fehe notion that the conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the class members or as to none of them,\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">\u00b643 Regarding the class\u2019s requested monetary relief, Judge Posner recognized \u201cthere may be no common issues,\u201d and determined \u201cin that event the next stage of the litigation, should the class-wide issue be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>resolved in favor of the plaintiffs, will be hundreds of separate suits for backpay (or conceivably for compensatory damages and even punitive damages as well ....).\u201d <em>McReynolds, </em>672 F.3d at 492. The Court approved of this bifurcated approach, determining declaratory and injunctive relief in a class trial and individual monetary relief in later individual trials, because \u201cthe lawsuits will be more complex if, until issue or claim preclusion sets in, the question whether Merrill Lynch has violated the antidiscrimination statutes must be determined anew in each case.\u201d <em>McReynolds, </em>672 F.3d at 492. As the D.C. Circuit recently noted, \u201c[t]he pututative [sic] class in <em>McReynolds </em>was appropriate <em>post-Wal-Mart </em>because the economic harm alleged by each class member was the result of the same corporate-wide policies and if the policies were held unlawful then a question central to the validity of each class member\u2019s claim would be resolved in one stroke.\u201d <em>DL v. District of Columbia, </em>713 F.3d 120,_, 2013 U.S. App. LEXIS 7375, 22 (D.C. Cir. 2013). This recognition aligns with the <em>Wal-Mart </em>majority\u2019s interest in certifying classes that will drive the resolution of litigation and it supports affirming the certification of Jacobsen\u2019s class to determine the certified declaratory and injunctive relief. <em>See Ferguson, </em>\u00b6 28 (finding a common fact issue existed concerning whether Safeco programmatically breached insured\u2019s made whole rights); <em>McDonald, </em>261 Mont. at 401 (concluding that commonality was satisfied, despite class members living in different areas with different water sources, because the common theory was that the defendant breached a duty owed to all class members); M.

Ct. at 2551. Allstate specifically argues that the first proposed common question-whether the CCPR as applied to unrepresented claimants violates the UTPA-fis precisely the type of generalized question that <em>Wal-Mart </em>identified as insufficient.\u201d However, as discussed above, the determination of whether Allstate\u2019s common application of the CCPR to the proposed class violated the UTPA is the sort of \u201ccommon scheme of deceptive conduct\u201d that necessarily presents common questions of law and/or fact. <em>See Ferguson, </em>\u00b6 28; <em>McReynolds, </em>672 F.3d at 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">\u00b646 Allstate further contends that this question cannot be answered as a class question because an independent cause of action for a UTPA violation or common law bad faith requires a showing of actual damages. Because Allstate argues a showing of actual damages would require case-specific, individual inquiries, it asserts that the first common question cannot be answered for the class as \u00bf whole. However, as discussed above, individualized damage inquiries generally do not preclude class certification. <em>See Mattson III, </em>\u00b6 38 (citing <em>McDonald, </em>261 Mont. at 403-04). Damages claims may be determined in later individual trials after a class trial has determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>the availability of the requested injunctive and declaratory relief. <em>McReynolds, </em>672 F.3d at 491.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">\u00b647 Allstate argues the second proposed common question is deficient because whether Allstate\u2019s profit increased while total compensation paid to the class decreased does not provide a common answer demonstrating a violation of \u00a7\u00a733-18-201(1) or (6), MCA. Jacobsen responds that the second common question would answer whether the CCPR caused indivisible \u2018legal injury\u201d to the class as a whole \u2018through the use of a dishonest system, whether or not the monetary value of each settlement ultimately was unfair.\u201d We agree that the second certified class claim question is deficient, but only insofar as it conflicts with our conclusion that the Court\u2019s certification of a class-wide punitive damages award was improper. As framed by the District Court, the second class claim asks the class jury to determine whether Allstate\u2019s systematic use of the CCPR caused indivisible harm to the class as a whole by operation of a zero-sum economic theory and an inversely proportional relationship between Allstate profits and compensation paid to unrepresented claimants. The Court formulated this claim so as to justify the entry of a class-wide punitive damages award. We believe that the second certified class claim must be revised in light of our conclusion that punitive damages must be determined on an individualized basis, to be awarded only if the claimant can demonstrate compensatory loss. We consequently modify the second certified claim as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-5\">(B) Allstate\u2019s common, systematic use of this pattern and practice in Montana resulted in damages to the members of the class by operation of its zero-sum economic theory and the resulting inversely proportional relationship between Allstate profit increases and corresponding decreases in the total amount of compensation paid to the class of unrepresented claimants as a whole; and [...]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-6\"><em>See </em>Section 3-2-204, MCA (entitling us to \u201caffirm, reverse, or modify any judgment or order appealed from[.]\u201d). The District Court considered the second common contention as proposing whether the CCPR\u2019s alleged pursuit of profits at the expense of unrepresented claimants harmed the class by potentially violating the unrepresented claimants\u2019 rights to good faith adjusting of their claims under the UTPA. Answering this question, as revised, would presumably help determine whether the CCPR was an intentional, programmatic effort to produce unfair settlements in violation of the UTPA. While an increase in profits concurrent with a decrease in total payments to the class as a whole may not prove a violation of the UTPA by itself, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>District Court did determine that significant proof existed that Allstate developed the CCPR program \u201cwith the knowledge and intent\u201d that its implementation would reduce the net sum of unrepresented settlements. This revised inquiry would help advance the determination of the legality of the CCPR while avoiding our concerns with a class-wide award of punitive damages, as discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">\u00b648 The third common contention asks whether Allstate consciously disregarded a high probability that the net effect of the CCPR would result in decreased settlements to the 'class as whole. Thus, an affirmative answer to the second question, determining that the CCPR was an intentional effort to engage in unfair settlement practices to increase profits, would likely advance the resolution of the third question and could support a finding of actual malice pursuant to \u00a727-1-221(2), MCA. However, Allstate claims that the third common question is deficient because Jacobsen does not assert his claim was underpaid. Jacobsen responds that the harm at issue is insufficient class-wide settlement payouts due to the CCPR\u2019s zero-sum economic focus. Because Jacobsen argues that Allstate implemented the CCPR with the intention of implementing a zero-sum economic game to systematically produce unfair settlements and increase profits, this contention would resolve an issue central to each class member\u2019s claim: whether Allstate acted maliciously by applying the CCPR with the intent of lowering payouts to increase profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">\u00b649  It is important to note that district courts have \u201cbroad power and discretion vested in them by\u201d Rule 23 \u201cwith respect to matters involving the certification and management of potentially cumbersome or frivolous class actions.\u201d <em>Reiter v. Sonotone </em>Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 345, 99 S. Ct. 2326 (1979); <em>accord Sieglock, </em>\u00b6 8 (\u2018Trial courts have the broadest discretion when deciding whether to certify a class.\u201d). Here, class-wide resolution of the proposed common contentions \u201cwill drive the resolution of the litigation.\u201d <em>Chipman, </em>\u00b6 52. Such potentially illuminating questions are the focus of Rule 23(a)(2) and, as discussed above, resolving whether the CCPR violates the UTPA would set the stage for later individual trials. Moreover, as we require, the District Court examined the evidence behind the pleadings to determine that the proposed class <em>actually </em>satisfied the commonality prerequisite. We therefore conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by determining that Jacobsen\u2019s common contentions, as construed by this Court, satisfy the commonality requirements of Rule 23(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"AQn\">\u00b650 Again, both Jacobsen and Allstate have claimed that <em>Wal-Mart </em>presents a heightened commonality standard when compared with our previous conception of the rule, and both applied <em>Wal-Mart </em>to the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>on appeal. Because of this, and because we affirm the District Court\u2019s class certification (also based on <em>Wal-Mart), </em>we need not address whether <em>Wal-Mart </em>presents a different standard and if we intend to adopt it. <em>Mattson III, </em>\u00b6 37. Instead, as we did in <em>Chipman </em>and <em>Mattson III, </em>we simply conclude that Jacobsen satisfies the <em>Wal-Mart </em>commonality standard because the certified class claims depend upon a common contention concerning a programmatic course of conduct that is \u201cof such a nature that it is capable of classwide resolution,\u201d i.e., that \u201cdetermination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.\u201d <em>Wal-Mart, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2551.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">iii. Typicality-Rule 23(a)(3)</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">\u00b651 Regarding typicality, we have previously explained that this requirement \u2018is designed to ensure that the interests of the named representative are aligned with the interests of the class members, the rationale being that a named plaintiff who vigorously pursues his or her own interests will necessarily advance the interests of the class.\u201d <em>Mattson III, </em>\u00b6 21 (citing <em>Chipman, </em>\u00b6 53). Thus, \u201c\u2018[t]he premise of the typicality requirement is simply stated: as goes the claim of the named plaintiff, so go the claims of the class.\u2019 <em>\u201dArlington Video Prods. v. Fifth Third Bancorp, </em>2013 U.S. App. LEXIS 3355, 42 (6th Cir. 2013). The commonality and typicality requirements \u2018tends to merge,\u201d <em>Falcon, </em>457 U.S. 147, at 158 n. 13, and typicality generally \u201cprevents plaintiffs from bringing a class action against defendants with whom they have not had any dealings.\u201d <em>Diaz, </em>\u00b6 35. Typicality is not a demanding requirement, and it \u201cis met if the named plaintiffs claim \u2018stems from the same <em>event, practice, or course of conduct </em>that forms the basis of the class claims and is based upon the same legal or remedial theory.\u2019 \u201d <em>Diaz, </em>\u00b6 35 (quoting <em>McDonald, </em>261 Mont. at 402). The underlying event, practice, or course of conduct \u2018heed not be identical.\u201d <em>Diaz, </em>\u00b6 35. In addition, because <em>Wal-Mart\u2019s </em>discussion of Rule 23(a) hinged on an analysis of commonality, the opinion did not consider the requirements of typicality and did not purport to establish a heightened level of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">\u00b652 The District Court found that the nature of Jacobsen\u2019s claim was typical of those of the proposed class because \u201csignificant proof [exists] that Allstate subjected the class as a whole, including but not limited to Plaintiff, to the same systematic violation of \u00a733-18-201(1) and (6), MCA, through the pattern and practice of the Casualty CCPR\u2019s unrepresented segment adjusting practices.\u201d Specifically, the Court found that: Jacobsen and each proposed class member are members of the above-defined class; Jacobsen and each class member were at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>minimum subjected to the same allegedly unlawful conduct generally; and the allegedly unlawful conduct caused harm to the class as a whole by operation of the CCPR and its alleged zero-sum economic theory. Thus, as required by our opinion in <em>Mattson II, </em>the District Court probed behind the pleadings to actually determine whether Jacobsen met the typicality prerequisite.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">\u00b653 On appeal, Allstate argues that the District Court erred because \u201cJacobsen is not even a member of the class.\u201d Allstate supports this contention by claiming that Jacobsen lacks individual standing because his initial release, obtained after his claim was adjusted to an unrepresented settlement pursuant to the CCPR, was rescinded, citing <em>Hop v. Safeco Ins. Co., </em>2011 MT 215, 361 Mont. 510, 261 P.3d 981. Allstate further attempts to distinguish Jacobsen\u2019s claim from those of the class members by arguing that he does not contend his property damage claim was improperly handled and that he only seeks damages due to alleged emotional distress. Jacobsen in turn claims that the application of the CCPR is a per se violation of the UTPA, that the application of the CCPR to the class as a whole resulted in systemic economic injury, and that both he and the class suffered emotional distress from the application of the CCPR to their claims. Jacobsen essentially asserts that typicality isn\u2019t destroyed if class members display some uniqueness in the character of their individual injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"Agu\">\u00b654 First, our opinion in <em>Hop </em>can be distinguished. There, we declined to find typicality based on the named representative\u2019s lack of individual standing for failing to meet the procedural requirements of \u00a733-18-242(6), MCA. Hop, \u00b6 20. The named representative did not lack individual standing because of any factual differences in the substantive details of his claim, but for bringing a claim under \u00a733-18-201, MCA, despite the absence of any judgment in, or settlement of, his underlying claim as required by \u00a733-18-242(6), MCA. This holding is therefore inapplicable to Allstate\u2019s argument that Jacobsen\u2019s claim is not typical because of the specific facts of the application of the CCPR to his unrepresented claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">\u00b655 Second, Allstate\u2019s arguments miss the aim of the typicality requirement by raising issues with the specific facts of Jacobsen\u2019s claim and the specific relief he seeks. <em>See Hanon v. Dataproducts Corp., </em>976 F.2d 497, 508 (1992) (\u2018Typicality refers to the nature of the claim or defense of the class representative, and not to the specific facts from which it arose or the relief sought.\u201d). Jacobsen is a member of the class as defined by the District Court. He was an unrepresented third-party claimant bringing claims for property damage and bodily injury following a motor vehicle accident with an Allstate insured. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>Allstate applied the CCPR to Jacobsen while he was unrepresented, and, at base, Jacobsen\u2019s class claim alleges that Allstate systematically applies the CCPR to violate the rights of unrepresented claimants under the UTPA. Jacobsen\u2019s claim stems from the same course of conduct, the application of the CCPR to unrepresented claimants, as the proposed class members\u2019 claims and both Jacobsen\u2019s and the class members\u2019 claims are based on the same legal theory, that this application of the CCPR violates the UTPA. The injuries that allegedly resulted among class members, whether economic or emotional, are not sufficiently dissimilar to render Jacobsen\u2019s claim atypical of those of the class regarding this core allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">\u00b656 Indeed, we have previously determined that the common application of an insurance practice to a proposed class constitutes an event, practice, or course of conduct sufficient to satisfy the typicality requirement. <em>See Diaz, </em>\u00b6 36; <em>Ferguson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 26-28 (finding the related commonality requirement satisfied by an allegedly programmatic breach of a duty). In <em>Chipman, </em>we considered claims that the named plaintiffs\u2019 claims were atypical from those of the class in the context of a suit over the discontinuation of a sick leave buy-back program. <em>Chipman, </em>\u00b6 54. The defendant employers argued that the named plaintiffs\u2019 claims were atypical because they worked for the employers for a longer period and may or may not have attended a meeting with management. <em>Chipman, </em>\u00b6 54. The plaintiff employees argued that the class members\u2019 disputes were typical because they were triggered by the same underlying cancellation of the buy-back program. <em>Chipman, </em>\u00b6 54. We determined that because the claims of the named plaintiffs and class members all arose from the same event, the plaintiffs were able to establish \u201cthe necessary nexus between the injuries alleged by named Plaintiffs and class members.\u201d <em>Chipman, </em>\u00b6 56. We based this decision on an analysis of <em>Cates v. Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>253 F.R.D. 422 (N.D. Ohio 2008). There, the named plaintiffs sought class certification in a suit against their employer over the imposition of a cap on post-retirement health benefits. <em>Cates, </em>253 F.R.D. at 424. The district court determined that typicality was satisfied despite the fact that the benefit plans of the named plaintiffs varied from those of the class members because all of the claims arose from the same event or practice and the class members relied on the same legal theory. <em>Cates, </em>253 F.R.D. at 429. Jacobsen\u2019s and the class\u2019s claims arise from the CCPR and all are proceeding under the legal theory that the CCPR was implemented to lower claims payments to the class by violating the rights afforded claimants under the UTPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">\u00b657  In addition, as we discuss below, our reformation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>requested class relief will cause the specifics of Jacobsen\u2019s injuries to be aired in a later, individual suit for damages if the court awards the requested class injunctive and declaratory relief. Jacobsen\u2019s injunctive and declaratory claims arise from the same course of conduct as those of the putative class members, the application of the CCPR to his unrepresented claim for bodily injury and property damage following a motor vehicle incident. A class trial may efficiently, and appropriately, determine the legality of this program as applied to the class as a whole. <em>See McReynolds, </em>672 F.3d at 490-91. Allstate\u2019s concerns over Jacobsen\u2019s typicality, centered on the details of his injury and the availability of certain defenses, will be obviated if the specifics of Jacobsen\u2019s injuries will not be addressed in a class trial that considers only the proposed injunctive and declaratory relief. Thus, despite Allstate\u2019s contentions, the specifics of Jacobsen\u2019s alleged injuries do not render him atypical of the class because his claim \u201cstems from the same <em>event, </em>practice, <em>or course of conduct </em>that forms the basis of the class claims and is based upon the same legal or remedial theory,\u201d McDonald, 261 Mont. at 402 (quoting <em>Jordan v. County of Los Angeles, </em>669 F.2d 1311, 1321 (9th Cir. 1982) (emphasis in original). This satisfies the typicality requirement and we affirm the District Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">iv. Adequacy-Rule 23(a)(4)</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">\u00b658 The fourth prerequisite of Rule 23(a) allows certification only where the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. M. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4). \u201c \u2018This requires that the named representative\u2019s attorney be qualified, experienced, and generally capable to conduct the litigation, and that the named representative\u2019s interests not be antagonistic to the interests of the class.\u2019 \u201d McDonald, 261 Mont. at 403, 862 P.2d at 1156 (quoting <em>Jordan, </em>669 F.2d at 1323). Adequacy is therefore closely related to commonality and typicality. Regarding potential antagonistic interests, the District Court determined that because Jacobsen\u2019s asserted class claims satisfied the commonality and typicality requirements, Allstate had failed to show a compelling reason why Jacobsen\u2019s individual interests would conflict with the common interests of the class. The court also took notice that Jacobsen\u2019s class counsel are competent and experienced in complex class action litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">\u00b659  Allstate argues that Jacobsen\u2019s claims will be subject to unique defenses that are likely to become the focus of any trial. However, \u201cperfect symmetry of interest is not required and not every discrepancy among the interests of class members renders a putative class action untenable.\u201d <em>Matamoros v. Starbucks Corp, </em>699 F.3d 129, 138 (1st Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>2012). When we apply this recognition to the adequacy requirement of Rule 23(a)(4), it is clear that \u2018\u201c[o]nly conflicts that are fundamental to the suit and that go to the heart of the litigation prevent a plaintiff from meeting the Rule 23(a)(4) adequacy requirement.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Matamoros, </em>699 F.3d at 138 (quoting 1 William B. Rubenstein, Newberg on Class Actions \u00a73:58 (5th ed. 2012)). The potential intra-class conflicts that Allstate cites-which include Jacobsen\u2019s desire for an early settlement, that he may have initially decided to not hire an attorney, and the cause of his emotional distress-are not \u201cso substantial as to overbalance the common interests of the class members as a whole.\u201d <em>Matamoros, </em>699 F.3d at 138. As a third party claimant contesting the legality of the CCPR, Jacobsen has incentive to vigorously pursue the requested injunctive and declaratory relief. In view of this, the limited scope of the class trial on remand, and the District Court\u2019s considerable discretion in class certification decisions, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that Jacobsen\u2019s interests are not antagonistic to those of the proposed class.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">\u00b660 <em>2. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by certifying a M. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) class action lawsuit?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">\u00b661 Once the Rule 23(a) prerequisites are satisfied, the analysis shifts to Rule 23(b). <em>Mattson III, </em>\u00b6 18. To be certified, a class must fit within one of the three types described in Rule 23(b). <em>Wal-Mart, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2548-49. At the District Court, Jacobsen argued that his proposed class qualified under Rule 23(b)(2), or alternatively, as a \u2018hybrid-type class\u201d combining elements of Rule 23(b)(2) and Rule 23(b)(3). Rule 23(b)(2) allows a class action to be maintained if, having met the requirements of Rule 23(a), \u201cthe party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole[.]\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). As the <em>Wal-Mart </em>decision noted, \u201c[t]he key to the [Rule 23](b)(2) class is, the indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy warranted-the notion that the conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the class members or as to none of them,\u201d <em>Wal-Mart, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2557 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">\u00b662 Rule 23(b)(3) allows a class action if the court finds that the common questions of law or fact predominate over individual questions. The District Court declined to address Jacobsen\u2019s alternative claim for Rule 23(b)(3) relief because of the \u201ccursory\u201d briefing and \u2018logical inconsistency\u201d of a hybrid Rule 23(b)(2) and (b)(3) class. Jacobsen does not challenge this decision on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">\u00b663 The District Court specifically found that \u201csignificant proof\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>existed that Allstate, the party opposing the class, had acted on grounds that generally applied to the class through its use of the CCPR program.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Following this determination, the Court examined whether Jacobsen sought appropriate forms of injunctive and declaratory relief and whether Jacobsen\u2019s requested monetary relief was permissible under Rule 23(b)(2).

We accordingly remand with direction to determine the availability of the above declaratory and injunctive relief in a class trial. Further, instead of considering class-wide punitive damages, the class trial will determine whether Allstate\u2019s implementation of the CCPR involved either actual fraud or actual malice pursuant to \u00a727-1-221, MCA. <em>See </em>\u00a733-18-242(4), MCA; <em>Lorang v. Fortis Ins. Co., </em>2008 MT 252, \u00b6 91, 345 Mont. 12, 192 P.3d 186. Thus, the class trial will initially determine if the CCPR violates the UPTA according to the certified declaratory relief. If so, the Court will issue a mandatory injunction requiring Allstate to give all class members notice of the right to re-open and re-adjust their individual claims. Last, the class trial will determine if Allstate engaged in actual fraud or actual malice in implementing the CCPR. If so, the trier of fact in the later individual cases may determine the amount of individual punitive damages to be awarded if individual actual damages are also established. We will discuss the certified class remedies in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">A. The Declaratory and Injunctive Relief</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">i. Class Cohesiveness</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">\u00b665 Allstate first argues that a Rule 23(b)(2) class is inappropriate because the class lacks cohesiveness. This is essentially a restatement of Allstate\u2019s arguments against commonality and typicality. However, because a Rule 23(b)(2) class action is considered \"mandatory,\u201d <em>see Wal-Mart, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2558,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> a class that lacks homogeneity could unjustly bind absent class members to a negative decision. <em>See Barnes v. Am. Tobacco Co., </em>161 F.3d 127, 143 (3d Cir. 1998). Because the relief sought must be able to affect the entire class at once, we will examine the cohesiveness of the class in the context of a mandatory Rule 23(b)(2) class.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">\u00b666 Allstate claims the proposed class is inappropriate as a Rule 23(b)(2) class because it \u201cwould necessarily include many individuals who suffered no injury and thus could have no UTPA claim ....\u201d Allstate claims both that these dissimilar class members would be unjustly bound by the action and that the lack of homogeneity would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>involve the adjudication of significant individual issues. However, these arguments are premised on a misunderstanding of the nature of Jacobsen\u2019s asserted class claims and are precluded by the scope of the class trial on remand. The individual context of any one settlement is not relevant to the adjudication of the certified declaratory and injunctive relief and our reformation of the punitive damages portion of the certified relief removes the consideration of individual circumstances in the class trial. Thus, Allstate\u2019s claim that not all class members have suffered actual harm or an unfair adjustment misses the point. The certified class claims on remand are not intended to resolve individual cases of unfair settlement or payment. Instead, they are aimed at adjudicating the initial legality of the CCPR as applied to the class. The later individual trials would allow Allstate to present evidence that individual class members suffered no injury. But, the initial legality of the CCPR would not need to be re-litigated in each subsequent individual trial. <em>See DL, </em>2013 U.S. App. at <em>22; McReynolds, </em>672 F.3d at 491; <em>Mejdrech, </em>319 F.3d at 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">\u00b667 As the District Court noted, our decision in <em>Ferguson </em>supports certifying Jacobsen\u2019s requested declaratory and injunctive relief as part of a Rule 23(b)(2) class. There, as part of a Rule 23(b)(2) class, the plaintiff sought a declaration that the insurer, Safeco, had breached its adjustment duties through a \u201cprogrammatic assertion of subrogation without first investigating and determining whether insureds had received their \u2018made-whole\u2019 <em>rights.\u201dFerguson, </em>\u00b6 33. Facing a similar claim that the requested declaratory relief would require the adjudication of individual \u201cmade-whole\u201d entitlements, we determined that the plaintiffs claim did not raise issues with Safeco\u2019s application of the \u2018blade-whole\u201d rule to any one insured. <em>Ferguson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 34, 39. Instead, we concluded that the plaintiffs claim contested \u201cthe procedures of a program of subrogation which systematically deprives all class members of any consideration of their \u2018made-whole\u2019 rights.\u201d <em>Ferguson, </em>\u00b6 34. Thus, like Jacobsen, the plaintiff in <em>Ferguson </em>sought a declaration requiring Safeco to follow a statutory duty prior to any consideration of the actual harm the violation of this standard caused to any individual class member. These \u201cclass claims do not seek a determination of entitlements for each class member and the payment of damages; rather [both] class claims seek a declaratory ruling that will be enforced to compel [the insurer] to follow the legal standard....\u201d <em>Ferguson, </em>\u00b6 34; <em>see also Diaz, </em>\u00b6 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">\u00b668  Here, as in <em>Ferguson, </em>the plaintiff seeks \u201can order compelling [the insurer] to properly perform its statutory adjustment duties.\u201d <em>Ferguson, </em>\u00b6 36. Because Jacobsen presents a common question alleging <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>a common injury, an answer will determine whether the CCPR will be \u201cenjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the class members or as to none of them.\u201d <em>See Wal-Mart, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2557. The potential later individualized determinations of underpayment are not necessary to answer Jacobsen\u2019s class claims and do not render the class overbroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">ii. Class Injunctive and Declaratory Relief is \u2018Final\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\u00b669 Allstate contends that Rule 23(b)(2) requires \u2018final\u201d relief, and contends the certified relief is not final because \u2018It only serves as a basis to present damage claims later.\u201d Allstate largely cites federal precedent as support for this proposition. However, we have never construed M. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2)\u2019s use of\u2018final\u201dto impose a substantive obligation on plaintiffs, and it is not clear that Allstate\u2019s citations to authority recommend that we do so. <em>See Richards v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., </em>453 F.3d 525, 530 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (\u2018Subsection (b)(2) was not intended to \u2018extend to cases in which the appropriate final relief relates exclusively or predominantly to monetary damages.\u2019 \u201d). Moreover, Allstate\u2019s preferred citations are distinguishable from the present case. <em>See Kartman v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>634 F.3d 883 (7th Cir. 2011) (contesting the failure to implement a uniform program); <em>Jamie S. v. Milwaukee Public Schools, </em>668 F.3d 481 (7th Cir. 2012) (finding proof of an illegal policy was \u201centirely absent here.\u201d). We have not recognized a substantive \u2018finality\u201d requirement in Rule 23(b)(2) and we address Allstate\u2019s complaints concerning monetary relief below.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">iii. Injunctive and Declaratory Relief is not Amorphous</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">\u00b670 As noted, Jacobsen seeks declaratory relief declaring the application of the CCPR to the class to be a violation of the UTPA and a mandatory injunction requiring Allstate to re-open and re-adjust claims. Allstate complains that this relief \u201cis so amorphous and vague that it cannot support class certification,\u201d citing <em>Shook v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>543 F.3d 597, 605 (10th Cir. 2008) and <em>Kartman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">\u00b671 Allstate specifically argues that the requested declaratory relief would provide an inappropriately abstract or advisory opinion that failed to provide further direction on the process to be used if claims are to be re-adjusted. However, our rule against issuing advisory opinions is based in the concept of justiciability. <em>Plan Helena, Inc. v. Helena Reg\u2019l Airport Auth. Bd., </em>2010 MT 26, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9, 355 Mont. 142, 226 P.3d 567. The various doctrines of justiciability seek to ensure that courts provide specific relief in concrete, actual controversies instead of opinions advising what the law or rule <em>would be </em>based upon a hypothetical set of facts or abstract proposition. <em>Plan Helena, Inc., </em>\u00b6 9. This prohibition does not mean that the Court\u2019s potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>determination that the CCPR violates the law also needs to be accompanied by a judicial proposal for a legal claims adjusting program. Our statutory requirement that an order granting an injunction be specific in its terms, \u00a7 27-19-105(2), MCA, does not require this level of specificity either. <em>See Guthrie v. Hardy, </em>2001 MT 122, \u00b6\u00b6 61-62, 305 Mont. 367, 28 P.3d 467 (faulting an injunction which failed to indicate which named party carried the obligation of maintaining a road). Insurance adjusting is squarely within Allstate\u2019s area of expertise, not the judicial branch\u2019s, and where we have previously faulted injunctions for a lack of specificity, we have not required the level of detail Allstate now requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">\u00b672 Allstate\u2019s citations to authority do not support enlisting the judiciary to draft claims adjusting policies either. For example, in <em>Shook, </em>plaintiffs sought to certify a class containing all present and future mentally ill inmates in a Colorado jail. <em>Shook, 543 </em>F.3d at 600. The plaintiffs sought a Rule 23(b)(2) class with declaratory and injunctive relief addressing jail conditions. However, the plaintiffs suffered from a wide variety of mental illnesses and were subjected to a correspondingly wide range of treatments by the jail staff. <em>Shook, </em>543 F.3d at 601. The plaintiffs sought a broad injunction \u201cestablishing standards across a wide range of areas affecting mentally ill inmates,\u201d touching upon staffing, training, inmate housing, safety, psychiatric care, and the proper use of force. <em>Shook, </em>543 F.3d at 602. The district court denied Rule 23(b)(2) certification because plaintiffs could not show that the defendants acted on grounds generally applicable to the whole class and because the variety within the class precluded class-wide injunctive relief. <em>Shook, </em>543 F.3d at 603. The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision, noting that \u201cthe relief plaintiffs seek would require the district court to craft an injunction that distinguishes-based on individual characteristics and circumstances-beiiceen how prison officials may treat class members[.]\u201d <em>Shook, </em>543 F.3d at 605 (emphasis in original). Moreover, an injunction that took the opposite tack and merely required \u201cadequate\u201d services would fail to describe just what, in light of the variety of the inmates\u2019 needs, must be done. <em>Shook, </em>543 F.3d at 606. <em>Shook </em>therefore does not stand for the proposition that Rule 23(b)(2) requires a certain specificity of injunctive relief, but for the general recognition that Rule 23(b)(2) classes must be sufficiently cohesive so that the injunctive relief applies to the class as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">\u00b673 <em>In Kartman, </em>plaintiffs brought a class claim alleging, in part, that State Farm\u2019s failure to use a uniform, objective criteria while assessing their hail-damaged roofs amounted to breach of contract, bad faith, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>and unjust enrichment. <em>Kartman, </em>634 F.3d at 887. As relief, plaintiffs requested compensatory and punitive damages and an injunction requiring State Farm to reinspect all class members\u2019 roofs pursuant to a uniform and objective standard. The district court judge certified a Rule 23(b)(2) class to adjudicate the request for an injunction and to assess State Farm\u2019s <em>liability. Kartman, </em>634 F.3d at 888. The appellate court reversed, finding that plaintiffs\u2019 only cognizable injury was for underpayment of their claims and that the requested injunctive relief was not the proper remedy. <em>Kartman, </em>634 F.3d at 889-90. This finding was largely based on the court\u2019s conclusion that State Farm had no duty to use an objective, uniform standard to determine hail-damage. <em>Kartman, </em>634 F.3d at 890. Thus, the plaintiffs\u2019 failing was that the court determined State Farm had <em>no </em>duty to use a particular method to evaluate hail-damage claims, let alone a duty to use the method the plaintiffs sought to impose with an injunction. <em>Kartman, </em>634 F.3d at 890. This situation is distinct from the present case, where Jacobsen seeks a declaration that Allstate\u2019s CCPR violates the UTPA and an injunction requiring notice to the class of the right to reopen their claims. Jacobsen, unlike the plaintiffs in <em>Kartman, </em>is not contesting the lack of a program or seeking to outline the contours of a legal program to be imposed on Allstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">\u00b674 Unlike <em>Shook </em>and <em>Kartman, </em>the certified class at issue has been subjected to a common practice and has allegedly suffered a common injury to statutorily conferred rights. This common contention, as discussed, is amenable to class-wide relief. This does not mean, however, that the court must go beyond an injunction addressing tortious conduct to affirmatively dictate proper adjusting practices. <em>See Rodriguez v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. (In re Rodriguez), </em>695 F.3d 360, 368-69 (5th Cir. 2012) (holding that injunctions are problematic when they order a defendant to obey the law <em>and </em>do not indicate what law the defendant needs to obey).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">B. Punitive Damages in a Rule 23(b)(2) Claim</p>\n<p id=\"Abl\">\u00b675 The District Court certified the availability of class-wide punitive damages pursuant to \u00a727-1-220 and \u00a727-1-221(2), MCA. The District Court determined that monetary relief is available in a Rule 23(b)(2) class under <em>Wal-Mart </em>if it is incidental to the declaratory and injunctive relief, affords indivisible, non-individualized relief in a single stroke, and comports with due process by not prejudicing the rights of the class members and defendant to contest specific cases. The Court also noted that punitive damages are generally not available without a predicate award of compensatory damages, but reasoned that an award of punitive damages based on actual malice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>does not require an award of compensatory damages if the evidence shows that the predicate tort caused actual harm or damage. The Court then determined that Jacobsen\u2019s claim was capable of showing that Allstate\u2019s alleged zero-sum economic theory visited a form of indivisible, actual economic harm upon the entire class, which it reasoned \u201cwould constitute a sufficient predicate for a class-wide punitive damages award in this case.\u201d The Court further concluded that a class-wide punitive damages award did not implicate the due process concerns addressed in <em>Wal-Mart </em>because it was not an individualized monetary remedy and did not litigate any claim-specific issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">\u00b676 Allstate initially contests the basic appropriateness of monetary damages under Rule 23(b)(2), claiming that \u201cone possible reading\u201d of Rule 23(b)(2) is that it does not authorize certification of monetary claims at all. The majority opinion in <em>Wal-Mart </em>did not go so far as to foreclose the availability of monetary relief in Rule 23(b)(2) classes, however, and it left open the possibility that incidental monetary claims could be certified under Rule 23(b)(2). <em>Wal-Mart, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2557. However, we need not decide the matter in this case, because we reverse the District Court\u2019s certification of a class-wide punitive damages award based on our concerns over the award\u2019s potential effect on the due process rights of Allstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">i. The Class-Wide Punitive Damages and Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"Amo\">\u00b677 Allstate also claims that the District Court\u2019s certification of class-wide punitive damages violates Allstate\u2019s right to due process because Allstate would be precluded from raising case-specific defenses to an individual class member\u2019s entitlement to punitive damages (e.g. that individual class member\u2019s claims were handled appropriately or paid fairly). Conversely, Allstate argues that the potential class trial would \u2018inappropriately devolve into a series of mini-trials \u2018if the Court were to allow Allstate to present defenses to class member\u2019s entitlement to punitive damages. Jacobsen counters that our decision in <em>Gonzales </em>established that punitive damages class claims can be maintained for systematic wrongdoing without individualized proof of harm. Jacobsen also asserts that Allstate\u2019s proffered federal precedent does not apply in the class action context.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">\u00b678  Given the nature of the requested relief as part of a Rule 23(b)(2) class, we agree that Allstate should be able to establish defenses to individual claims to ensure that punitive damages are not awarded to claimants that were not actually damaged by the adjustment of their claims under the CCPR. <em>See Philip Morris USA v. Williams, </em>549 U.S. 346, 353, 127 S. Ct. 1057 (2007) (TT]he Due Process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Clause prohibits a State from punishing an individual without first providing that individual with \u2018an opportunity to present every available defense.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Seltzer v. Morton, </em>2007 MT 62, \u00b6 145, 336 Mont. 225, 154 P.3d 561. It is true that our <em>Gonzales </em>opinion considered the constitutionality of a class-wide punitive damages award. However, <em>Gonzales </em>did not consider a class-wide punitive damages award in the context of a Rule 23(b)(2) class and we did not consider the defendant\u2019s right to present a defense to each class member\u2019s entitlement to a punitive damages award. <em>Gonzales, </em>\u00b6 15. <em>Gonzales </em>instead approved class-wide punitive damages in a combination Rule 23(b)(1) and (3) class suit where the district court certified a Rule 23(b)(3) compensatory damages class. <em>Gonzales, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17-19. Thus, the <em>Gonzales </em>class members\u2019 entitlement to compensatory damages would be established during the class trial and would support an award of punitive damages. Here, adjudicating the requested injunctive and declaratory relief would not involve a similar determination of compensatory damages. Potentially granting class-wide punitive damages <em>before </em>determining whether individual class members suffered actual damages, as Jacobsen suggests, raises serious concerns about fairness. <em>See Jacobsen I, </em>\u00b6 67; <em>Stipe v. First Interstate Bank-Polson, </em>2008 MT 239, \u00b6 23, 344 Mont. 435, 188 P.3d 1063. \u2018Due process requires that there be an opportunity to present every available defense.\u201d <em>Lindsey v. Normet, </em>405 U.S. 56, 66, 92 S. Ct. 862 (1972). Permitting a class-wide recovery of punitive damages before sending notice to the class and determining the extent of the class members\u2019 actual harm would allow the punitive award to be potentially based on non-injured parties. Allstate should be allowed to contest class members\u2019 entitlement to punitive damages. <em>Philip Morris USA, </em>549 U.S. at 353-54. We accordingly conclude that the District Court abused its discretion by certifying the requested class-wide punitive monetary relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">ii. The Second Certified Class Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">\u00b679 Again, our conclusion that the Court abused its discretion by certifying a class-wide punitive damages award requires us to revise the second certified class claim. Our reformation of the second claim is discussed in paragraph 47, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">\u00b680 <em>3. Whether the District Court erred by holding that the Montana Rules of Evidence do not apply to class action proceedings?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">\u00b681 Last, Allstate entered several objections before the District Court concerning the Court\u2019s consideration of what Allstate argued was inadmissible evidence during the certification proceedings. In a footnote, the Court determined that the evidence Jacobsen presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>in the Rule 23 certification proceedings did not need to be fin a trial-admissible form,\u201d and denied Allstate\u2019s objections to \u201cthe ultimate trial-admissible evidentiary sufficiency of Plaintiff s preliminary Rule 23 factual showings in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">\u00b682 On appeal, Allstate maintains that the District Court erroneously based its class certification order on evidence that \u201cwas clearly inadmissible under the Rules of Evidence.\u201d Allstate argues this allegedly inadmissible evidence included opinions and statements in an expert report, an article written by the Consumer Federation of America, an affidavit by one of Jacobsen\u2019s attorneys, a power point presentation referred to as the \u201cLiddy slides,\u201d an incentive compensation plan, and affidavits and testimony from a New Mexico case that considered the CCPR. Jacobsen counters that his case \u201cwas grounded on dozens of McKinsey documents\u201dthat Allstate produced on remand and that all other evidence was properly considered. However, because the Court did not make a ruling on the admissibility of <em>any </em>of the evidence in question, the specific admissibility of a particular piece of evidence is not presented to this Court on appeal. Rather, we must consider the Court\u2019s contention that evidence need not be in a \u201ctrial admissible form\u201d for the purposes of class certification proceedings. \u00b683 Allstate specifically contends that the District Court\u2019s determination that \u201ca rigorous Rule 23 analysis\u201d does not necessarily require a preliminary factual showing in \u201ca trial-admissible form\u201d was error in light of our decision in <em>Mattson II </em>and the Montana Rules of Evidence. In <em>Mattson II, </em>the District Court refrained from engaging in an analysis of the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims and stated it was required to take the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations in support of the class action as true. <em>Mattson II, </em>\u00b6 61. The District Court thereafter certified the class. On appeal, the defendant argued that the court erred in its Rule 23 analysis by taking the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations as true and asserted that the court should have made its determination \u2018based upon the evidence.\u201d <em>Mattson II, </em>\u00b6 62. We held that the court erred by determining it must take the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations as true and noted a district court \u201ccertainly may look past the pleadings\u201d when determining if Rule 23\u2019s requirements have been met <em>.Mattson II, </em>\u00b6 65. Quoting the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Falcon, </em>we held \u201c\u2018sometimes it may be necessary for the court to probe behind the pleadings before coming to rest on the certification question\u2019 \u201d to determine actual conformance with Rule 23(a). <em>Mattson II, </em>\u00b6 65 (quoting <em>Falcon, </em>457 U.S. at 160, 102 S. Ct. at 2372). Therefore, while this \u201cprobe behind the pleadings\u201d <em>may </em>necessitate allowing discovery and hearing evidence, <em>Mattson II </em>also determined \u201cthere is no absolute requirement that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>hearing be held\u201d if \u2018the paper record before the court\u201d is adequate. <em>Mattson II, </em>\u00b6 66. The applicability of the Montana Rules of Evidence was not addressed by this Court and was not a basis of our decision. Thus, despite Allstate\u2019s argument to the contrary, <em>Mattson II </em>does not stand for the proposition that courts <em>must </em>apply the Rules of Evidence in Rule 23 proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">\u00b684 Allstate also argues that the Montana Rules of Evidence require their application to Rule 23 proceedings. In support, Allstate cites M. R. Evid. 101(a) and 104(a). Rule 101(a) states that \u201c[tjhese rules govern all proceedings in all courts in the state of Montana with the exceptions stated in this rule.\u201dRule 101(c) lists the situations in which the rules do not apply, including preliminary questions of fact, grand juries, miscellaneous proceedings like those for extradition or the issuance of warrants for arrest, \u201csummary\u201d proceedings, and other miscellaneous proceedings like ex parte matters. Allstate contends that because the exceptions listed under Rule 101(c) do not include class certification proceedings, the rules must apply. Rule 104 governs Tpjreliminary questions of admissibility\u201d and Rule 104(a) specifically covers Tqjuestions of admissibility generally.\u201d While Rule 104(a) notes further situations where the rules of evidence do not apply, it is not relevant to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">\u00b685 In response, Jacobsen cites federal authority stating that courts in Rule 23 proceedings \u201cmay consider evidence that may not be admissible at trial.\u201d <em>Alonzo v. Maximus, Inc., </em>275 F.R.D. 513, 519 (C.D. Cal. 2011); <em>see also Fisher v. Ciba Specialty Chemicals Corp, </em>238 F.R.D. 273, 279 n. 7 (S.D. Ala. 2006) (\u2018The Federal Rules of Evidence are not stringently applied at the class certification stage because of the preliminary nature of such proceedings.\u201d). Indeed, federal courts do not generally require the application of the rules of evidence in class certification proceedings. <em>See Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>603 F.3d 571, 603 n. 22 (9th Cir. 2010) (\u2018We are not convinced by the dissent\u2019s argument that <em>Daubert </em>has exactly the same application at the class certification stage as it does to expert testimony relevant at trial.\u201d) (reversed on other grounds by <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.

R. Civ. P. 23, and, as noted, we consider such federal precedent to be instructive. Specifically, these courts have determined that Rule 23 does not require specific proceedings or trial admissible evidence because of the preliminary nature of class certification and trial courts\u2019 broad discretion in certification decisions. <em>See e.g., Rhodes v.

Indeed, \u201cclass certification is not a dispositive motion [like Fed. R. Civ.

The <em>Wal-Mart </em>Court considered the plaintiffs\u2019 production of the testimony of Dr. William Bielby, a sociological expert, as the only proffered evidence ofWal-Mart\u2019s alleged \u201cgeneral policy of [gender] discrimination.\u201d <em>Wal-Mart, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2553-54. The expert testified that Wal-Mart\u2019s corporate culture was \u201cvulnerable\u201d to gender bias, but he could not specifically determine how regularly gender stereotypes played a meaningful role in employment decisions. <em>Wal-Mart, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2553. The parties disputed whether this testimony met the standards for the admission of expert testimony under Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786 (1993), and the District Court concluded <em>Daubert </em>didn\u2019t apply to class certification proceedings. The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion did not squarely address this contention, merely offering \u2018We doubt\u201d that <em>\u2018Daubert </em>did not apply to expert testimony at the certification stage\u201d in dicta while concluding \u201ceven if properly considered, Bielby\u2019s testimony does nothing to advance respondent\u2019s <em>case.\u201d Wal-Mart, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2554. Thus, the <em>Wal-Mart </em>majority failed to address the application of the Rules of Evidence to class action certification proceedings and the Court\u2019s doubt was aimed only at the application of <em>Daubert, </em>a question not presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">\u00b689  Because the District Court\u2019s inquiry into a motion for class certification is tentative, preliminary, and limited to a determination of only whether the litigation may be conducted on a class basis, \u201cthe court\u2019s analysis is necessarily prospective and subject to change ... and there is bound to be some evidentiary uncertainty.\u201d <em>Cox, </em>644 F.3d at 613. A decision on a motion to certify a class is not a conclusive judgment on the merits of the case, and is \u201cnot accompanied by the traditional rules and procedure applicable to civil trials.\u201d <em>Eisen, </em>417 U.S. at 178, 94 S.

We do, however, conclude that the certification of class-wide punitive damages was inappropriate in the context of a Rule 23(b)(2) class. According to our reformation of the requested relief, we remand for a class trial to determine whether the application of the CCPR to the class violated the UTPA, and, if so, to determine whether the District Court should enter an order requiring Allstate to provide notice to the class members of their right to re-open and re-adjust their claims. The trier of fact in the class trial will also make a determination as to whether Allstate\u2019s implementation of the CCPR program involved actual fraud or actual malice, such as could justify the entry of punitive damages following a finding of actual damages in the ensuing individual cases. If the trier of fact determines that Allstate did not engage in either actual fraud or actual malice, the class members would be entitled to only the compensatory damages they can prove in the individual cases. Following the class trial, the Court shall determine whether there should be a common fund recovery of class-action attorney fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">\u00b691 We also conclude that the District Court did not err in its determination that class certification proceedings do not require evidence to be in \u201ctrial admissible\u201d form.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">\u00b692 We affirm the class certification, but modify the class claim and the certified class relief as herein set forth.</p>\n<judges id=\"b454-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b417-6\"> Jacobsen specifically alleged Allstate\u2019s CCPR violated \u00a733-18-201(1) &amp; (6), MCA.

The case, <em>Amgen Inc., et al. v. Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds, </em>133 S. Ct. 1184, 185 L. Ed. 2d 308 (2013), involved a securities fraud Rule 23(b)(3) class action. To prove securities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>fraud and recover damages under \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, a plaintiff must prove, <em>inter alia, </em>a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant. <em>Matrixx Initiatives, Inc. v. Siracusano, </em>568 U.S._,_, 131 S. Ct. 1309, 1317 (2011). Materiality is key in a \u00a7 10(b) class action suit because it is an essential predicate for the fraud-on-the-market theory that supports the presumption of \u201cclasswide reliance on those misrepresentations and omissions through the information-processing mechanism of the market price.\u201d <em>Amgen, </em>568 U.S. at__, 133 S. Ct. at 1194. Without this presumption, the plaintiffs could not prove that the class as a whole relied on the misrepresentation and present a common question suitable for Rule 23(b)(3). However, the Supreme Court held that proof that a defendant\u2019s misrepresentations or omissions materially affected their stock price was not required at the Rule 23(b)(3) class certification stage. <em>Amgen, </em>563 U.S. at_, 2013 LEXIS at 8. While <em>Wal-Mart </em>recognized that courts may intrude on merits issues, like materiality, to certify a class, <em>the Amgen </em>majority held that Rule 23(b)(3) \u2018(requires a showing that questions common to the class predominate, not that those questions will be answered, on the merits, in favor of the class.\u201d <em>Amgen, </em>568 U.S. at_, 2013 LEXIS at 8. As the <em>Amgen </em>decision emphasized, \u201cthe office of a Rule 23(b)(3) certification ruling is not to adjudicate the case; rather, it is to select the \u2018methotdj best suited to adjudication of the controversy \u2018fairly and efficiently.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019 Amgen, </em>568 U.S. at_, 133 S.

Further, both <em>Amgen </em>and <em>Wal-Mart </em>dealt with questions concerning what sort of merits inquiry was appropriate. <em>Ihe Amgen </em>decision limited merits inquiries in the context of a Rule 23(b)(3) securities fraud claim, supporting the view that <em>Wal-Mart\u2019s </em>more-skeptical level of Rule 23 analysis is not universally applicable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b430-10\"> As discussed below, however, we believe it is necessary to revise the second certified class claim in light of our holding reversing the certification of a class-wide punitive damages award.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b431-5\"> Essentially, the plaintiffs contended that the teams were \u201clittle fraternities\u201d that, intentionally or not, chose members largely from similar racial groups. <em>McReynolds, </em>672 F.3d at 489.

The first certified class claim requires the District Court to declare whether the CCPR violates Montana\u2019s unfair claims settlement practices laws. Opinion, \u00b6 64. If the answer is \u2018yes,\u201d the District Court is to \u2018issue a mandatory injunction requiring Allstate to give all class members notice of the right to re-open and re-adjust their individual claims.\u201d Then, if the class trial determines that Allstate engaged in fraudulent or malicious conduct, \u201cthe trier of fact in the <em>later individual cases </em>may determine the amount of individual punitive damages to be awarded <em>if individual actual damages are also established.\u201d </em>Opinion, \u00b6 64 (emphases added). The Court expressly acknowledges, as a basis for its commonality holding, that \u201cresolving whether the CCPR violates the UTPA would set the stage for later individual trials.\u201dOpinion, \u00b6 49. Thus, the decision today makes clear that the class trial is to occur for the purpose of establishing a foundation for individualized damage awards. Simply stated, this is not a Rule 23(b)(2) class.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">\u00b6100 The difficulty here is that the District Court already considered and denied, as part of a comprehensive, sixty-page order prior to Jacobsen\u2019s first appeal, his motion to certify a class under M. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3). Jacobsen did not appeal that ruling following its issuance in 2005 and would be barred from now challenging the District Court\u2019s determination. <em>Bragg v.

Moose\u2019s Saloon, Inc., </em>2007 MT 202, \u00b6 16, 338 Mont. 423, 166 P.3d 451). Nor did Jacobsen cross-appeal the District Court\u2019s refusal, in its January 30, 2012, class certification order, to address his \u201cfall-back Rule 23(b)(3) theory\u201d because of the \u201ccursory nature of Plaintiffs briefing and logical inconsistency of this theory with his primary Rule 23(b)(2) theory.\u201d He similarly fails on appeal to develop his arguments or to address the separate Rule 23(b)(3) requirements of predominance and superiority.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">\u00b6101 In conclusion, because Jacobsen cannot establish all of the requirements of the rule, I dissent from the Court\u2019s decision to uphold Rule 23(b)(2) class certification.</p>\n<judges id=\"b458-7\">JUSTICE RICE joins in the dissenting Opinion of JUSTICE BAKER.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b455-5\"> Montana\u2019s Rule 23, unlike its federal counterpart, allows appeal of right from an order granting or denying class action certification or an order finally and definitively rejecting a proposed class settlement. <em>Compare </em>M.

As explained below, the case the Court decides today is not the case that was presented to us. This class action, as argued by Jacobsen and certified by the District Court, is one for declaratory relief under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (Title 27, chapter 8, MCA). The class remedies are a declaratory judgment, an injunction, punitive damages, and attorney\u2019s fees. The injunction gives class members the option of returning to the position they were in when they initially filed their claims, i.e., before Allstate applied the CCPR to them. This is <em>not </em>a class action to determine liability for damages under the Unfair Trade Practices Act (UTPA; Title 33, chapter 18, MCA). Jacobsen did not frame the class claim pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) as one that would lead to compensatory damages; to the contrary, he conceded from the outset that some of the putative class members may have suffered no individual harm from Allstate\u2019s use of the CCPR. All he requested was an injunction \u2018to prohibit Allstate from using its CCPR program, to reopen improperly settled claims, and for disgorgement of illicit profits from the unlawful program.\u201d The District Court, correspondingly, did not certify any claims or remedies under the UTPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">\u00b6103 This Court, however, proceeds to repackage this case as a UTPA action. One facet of Allstate\u2019s liability is to be decided in a class trial, after which further liability determinations and assessments of damages are to be made in ensuing individual trials. I disagree with this sua sponte reworking of the case. Aside from being improper appellate practice, the scheme the Court has devised here distorts the rules for certifying a class under Rule 23(b)(2) and infringes class members\u2019 due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">\u00b6104 The ensuing discussion relates primarily to my disagreement with the Court\u2019s remaking of the case and the Court\u2019s approach to Rule 23(b)(2) certification. However, like Justice Baker, I also harbor reservations about whether the threshold requirements of Rule 23(a) have been met. I address those concerns at the end of this Dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">I. The District Court\u2019s Construction of the Class Claim and Remedies</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">\u00b6105 Jacobsen\u2019s Fourth Amended Complaint is far from a model of clarity. In fact, the District Court noted in its class-certification Order that there is \u201cconsiderable pleading imprecision on [the] face\u201d of the complaint. This Court, likewise, acknowledges that \u201cJacobsen\u2019s requested relief and alleged bases for damages are not entirely clear.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">\u00b6106 Faced with this pleading imprecision, the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>liberally \u201cconstrued\u201d Jacobsen\u2019s Fourth Amended Complaint and his arguments supporting class certification so as to arrive at class claims and remedies that could \u201cminimally\u201d satisfy the criteria of Rule 23. Jacobsen certainly benefitted from the District Court\u2019s efforts in this regard, and it must be noted that, just as he has not contested other aspects of the District Court\u2019s decision (see <em>e.g. </em>Opinion, \u00b6 62, \u00b6 63 n. 9), Jacobsen also has not cross-appealed from the District Court\u2019s ultimate determination of the class claim and the class remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"AgA\">\u00b6107 The District Court perceived both individual and class claims in the Fourth Amended Complaint. In identifying the class claim, the District Court found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-4\">Separate and apart from the individual claims asserted in this case, the court construes the substantive essence of Plaintiff s asserted class claim to be that, irrespective of individual outcomes, the unrepresented segment adjustment practices specified in Allstate\u2019s <em>CCPR Implementation Manual (Tort States) </em>(hereinafter Casualty CCPR) constitute a common pattern and practice in violation of \u00a7\u00a733-18-201(1) and (6), MCA, as generally applied to the class as a whole, thereby resulting in indivisible harm to the class as a whole by operation of Allstate\u2019s own zero-sum economic theory and the resulting inversely proportional relationship between Allstate\u2019s profit increases and corresponding decreases in the total amount of compensation paid to the class of unrepresented claimants as a whole.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">A critical term in this construction of the class claim is Indivisible harm to the class as a whole.\u201d This language is important because, as explained below, it reflects the limited claim and remedies that the District Court had in mind, and because this Court\u2019s revision of the District Court\u2019s language dramatically alters the nature of this case. \u00b6108 Jacobsen requested class certification pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2). \u201c\u2018The key to the [Rule 231(b)(2) class is the indivisible nature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy warranted-fhe notion that the conduct is such that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the class members or as to none of them.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019 Diaz v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Mont., </em>2011 MT 322, \u00b6 42, 363 Mont. 151, 267 P.3d 756 (brackets in original) (quoting <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, </em>564 U.S. _, 131 S. Ct. 2541, 2557 (2011)). As the Supreme Court further explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-8\">In other words, Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a single injunction or declaratory judgment would provide relief to each member of the class. It does not authorize class certification when each individual class member would be entitled to a <em>different </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>injunction or declaratory judgment against the defendant. Similarly, it does not authorize class certification when each class member would be entitled to an individualized award of monetary damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-4\"><em>Wal-Mart, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2557 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">\u00b6109 The District Court construed Jacobsen\u2019s substantive arguments mindful of these principles, correctly recognizing that Rule 23(b)(2) requires an indivisible remedy and does not permit class certification for purposes of individualized awards of monetary damages. The court construed Jacobsen\u2019s requested class relief under Rule 23(b)(2) to consist of \u201ca claim for class-wide declaratory, injunctive, and incidental monetary relief (equitable disgorgement and punitive damages).\u201dThe District Court declined to certify the equitable disgorgement remedy on the ground that it was cumulative to the injunctive relief, but the court otherwise certified the class relief Jacobsen sought. Specifically, the District Court certified the following claim and remedies:</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">(2) Class Action Claim. The certified class claim is that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-7\">(A) the Casualty CCPR\u2019s unrepresented segment adjusting practices are a common pattern and practice in violation of \u00a7\u00a733-18-201(1) and (6), MCA, as generally applied to the class of unrepresented claimants as a whole;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-8\">(B) Allstate\u2019s common, systematic use of this pattern and practice in Montana caused indivisible harm to the class as a whole by operation of its zero-sum economic theory and the resulting inversely proportional relationship between Allstate profit increases and corresponding decreases in the total amount of compensation paid to the class of unrepresented claimants as a whole; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-9\">(C) Allstate acted with \u201cactual malice,\u201d as defined by \u00a727-1-221(2), MCA, by intentionally, deliberately, and consciously creating and disregarding a high probability that the net effect of its Casualty CCPR\u2019s unrepresented segment practices would result in net settlement payouts to the class as a whole less than the net amount previously sufficient to fully and fair[ly] settle unrepresented claims under Montana law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-10\">(3) Class Action Remedies. The certified class remedies available as a matter of law on proof of the certified class claim are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-11\">(A) declaratory judgment adjudicating the constituent assertions of the certified class claim;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-12\">(B) mandatory injunction requiring Allstate to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>(1) give all class members court-approved notice of the right and opportunity to obtain re-opening and re-adjustment of their individual claims by timely returning a proof of claim form; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-4\">(2) re-open and re-adjust each individual claim upon receipt of a timely filed proof of claim;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-5\">(C) class-wide punitive damages pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 27-1-220 and 27-1-221(2), MCA (actual malice), predicated on the above-referenced class-wide conduct; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-6\">(D) common fund recovery of class action attorney fees and costs upon a class-wide punitive damages award[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">\u00b6110 With respect to establishing the \u201cindivisible harm\u201d asserted in the Class Action Claim, the District Court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-8\">the occurrence and extent of the actual harm common to the class as a whole is ascertainable and at least generally measurable on an indivisible class-wide basis without consideration of individual outcomes by comparative analysis of relevant industry performance data and internal Allstate performance data.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABV\">Jacobsen\u2019s theory is that if Allstate outperformed industry norms (in terms of profits and reduced payouts) due to the CCPR, then the class members were indivisibly harmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">\u00b6111 Accordingly, setting aside the punitive damages and the common fund recovery,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the District Court certified only two class remedies. The first remedy is a declaration that the CCPR constitutes a per se prohibited claim settlement practice under \u00a733-18-201(1) and (6), MCA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The class trial must determine, therefore, that applying the CCPR was unlawful as to all class members or, conversely, to no class <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>members. In a sense, this is analogous to deciding a facial challenge to a statute: to prevail on such a challenge, the plaintiff must show that \u201cno set of circumstances exists under which the [statute] would be valid, i.e., that the law is unconstitutional in all of its applications.\u201d <em>Wash. State Grange v. Wash. State Republican Party, 552 </em>U.S. 442, 449, 128 S. Ct. 1184, 1190 (2008) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Caldwell v. MACo Workers\u2019 Comp. Trust, </em>2011 MT 162, \u00b6 69, 361 Mont. 140, 256 P.3d 923 (Baker &amp; Rice, JJ., dissenting). That is, in essence, what the certified class claim asserts regarding the CCPR: that no set of circumstances exists under which the CCPR would be valid. The CCPR is unlawful in all of its applications-as the theory goes-because the \u201cattorney economics script\u201d misrepresents facts and because the \u2018fast track\u201d system and the \u20189-step process\u201d are inherently incompatible with good-faith effectuation of fair and equitable settlements. If the class prevails on this claim, then the second remedy the District Court certified is an injunction requiring Allstate to allow each class member to return to square one, i.e., go back to the point when his or her claim was first filed, before Allstate applied the CCPR.</p>\n<p id=\"Aty\">\u00b6112 Importantly, the District Court did not certify any class claim or remedies under the UTPA itself. The UTPA recognizes \u201can independent cause of action [by an insured or a third-party claimant] against an insurer for actual damages caused by the insurer\u2019s violation of subsection (1), (4), (5), (6), (9), or (13) of 33-18-201.\u201d Section 33-18-242(1), MCA. In such action, \u2018the court or jury may award such damages as were proximately caused by the violation of subsection (1), (4), (5), (6), (9), or (13) of33-18-201,\u201d as well as \u201c[e]xemplary damages.\u201d Section 33-18-242(4), MCA. That is not the nature of the class action certified by the District Court here. The parties\u2019 arguments in the District Court, and the District Court\u2019s ensuing analysis in its Order, confirm this conclusion. They also provide insight into the precise nature of the class claim, as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">\u00b6113 First, in his briefs supporting class certification, Jacobsen asserted that this case is \u201csquarely governed\u201d by <em>Ferguson v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Am., </em>2008 MT 109, 342 Mont. 380, 180 P.3d 1164. Of relevance, he quoted the following passage from that decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-5\">The challenge here is not to an error in Safeco\u2019s application of the \u201cmade-whole\u201d rule to any given insured. Rather, this case challenges the procedures of a program of subrogation which systematically deprives all class members of any consideration of their \u201cmade-whole\u201d rights. Thus, as Ferguson points out in her brief on appeal, her class claims do not seek a determination of entitlements for each class member and the payment of damages; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>rather, her class claims seek a declaratory ruling that will be enforced to compel Safeco to follow the legal standard in its subrogation program.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-4\"><em>Ferguson, </em>\u00b6 34. Jacobsen indicated that he was seeking the same sort of relief: a declaratory ruling that will be enforced to compel Allstate to stop using the CCPR. He further asserted that the \u201cvehicle for class relief\u2019 under his Rule 23(b)(2) theory is an injunction requiring Allstate either to re-open and re-adjust the claims, or to disgorge the profits it made as a result of the CCPR. (As noted, the District Court chose the former.) Jacobsen did not assert any entitlement to compensatory damages for class members.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">\u00b6114 Second, in its brief seeking dismissal of the class claim, Allstate argued that Jacobsen had compromised the interests of class members by not seeking compensatory damages on their behalf. In response, Jacobsen argued that he was not required to assert claims for compensatory damages. He cited <em>Lebrilla v. Farmers Group, Inc., </em>16 Cal.Rptr. 3d 25 (Cal. App. 4th Dist. 2004), for the proposition that there is no rule requiring a class representative to seek certification of all causes of action available to every member of the class. <em>See Lebrilla, </em>16 Cal. Rptr. 3d at 40 (\u2018Farmers is essentially asking us to hold a class cannot be certified anytime the class representative fails to seek certification of fewer than all causes of action. Of course there is currently no such rule.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">\u00b6 115 Third, in its Order, the District Court recognized that there are \u201ccase-specific issues peculiar to individual claims\u201d here. The court noted, for example, that whether liability for a given claim had become \u201creasonably clear,\u201d <em>see </em>\u00a733-18-201(6), MCA, is \u201ca highly individualized, case-specific criterion].\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court noted the same thing with regard to \u2018Whether and to what extent individual class members ultimately received fair settlements.\u201d The existence of such factual variations among claimants subjected to the CCPR would preclude classwide adjudication of Allstate\u2019s liability for damages under \u00a733-18-242(1), MCA. But the District Court did not construe this case as such an action. The court instead construed Jacobsen\u2019s class claim to be that Allstate\u2019s use of the CCPR violated \u00a7 33-18-201(1) and (6), MCA, \u2018irrespective of outcomes in individual cases.\u201d The court observed that \u201cthe class-wide matter at issue is the indivisible net effect of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Casualty CCPR unrepresented segment practices on the class as a whole, irrespective of individual outcomes.\u201d Accordingly, setting aside the statute\u2019s case-specific criteria, the District Court reasoned that \u201c\u00a733-18-201(1) and (6), MCA, essentially require Allstate to promptly, accurately, truthfully, fairly, and in good faith adjust bodily injury and property damage claims.\u201d The court construed the class claim to be that Allstate\u2019s use of the CCPR violates these general principles of \u00a733-18-201(1) and (6), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">\u00b6116 Fourth, the District Court recognized that Rule 23(b)(2) does not authorize class certification when each class member would be entitled to an individualized award of monetary damages. The court thus framed \u201cthe dispositive Rule 23(b)(2) issues\u201d as \u201c(1) whether the asserted class claim seeks permissible forms of injunctive relief that will benefit the class as a whole and (2) whether as a matter of law the requested forms of monetary relief, however characterized, are permissible forms of Rule 23(b)(2) relief incidental to the predicate declaratory and injunctive relief from which they flow.\u201d I discuss the meaning of \u2018incidental\u201d monetary relief below. <em>See </em>\u00b6 134, <em>infra. </em>For present purposes, it suffices to note that it does not include individual claims for compensatory damages. The District Court expressly rejected Allstate\u2019s contention that the class action here would \u201cserve only to facilitate the award of damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">\u00b6117 Finally, consistent with the foregoing points, the District Court cited Title 27, chapter 8, MCA (the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act), as authority for the first certified class remedy and Title 27, chapter 19, MCA (authorizing injunctions), as authority for the second certified class remedy. The court did not rely on \u00a733-18-242, MCA, as authority for the class claim or the class remedy. In fact, the District Court rejected the proposition that Jacobsen\u2019s class action is one that seeks \u201cdamages\u201d under the UTPA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">Here, as construed by the court, Plaintiffs asserted UTPA-based class claim neither constitutes nor is tantamount to a claim for compensatory damagesJt merely encompasses first and third-party ... claims for declaratory relief and related equitable and punitive relief predicated on asserted class-wide violations of \u00a733-18-201(1) and (6), MCA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">Allstate had pointed out in its brief opposing class certification that \u00a733-18-242, MCA, specifically authorizes damages-eompensatory and punitive-for an insurer\u2019s violation of the UTPA, not the <em>equitable remedies </em>that Jacobsen sought. <em>See </em>\u00a7 33-18-242(4), MCA. Allstate argued, therefore, that injunctive relief was not available to remedy the asserted classwide violations of \u00a733-18-201(1) and (6), MCA. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>District Court, however, interpreted our decision in <em>Ferguson </em>as approving a class action \u201cdistinct from an independent UTPA claim for damages under \u00a733-18-242(1) and (3), MCA.\u201d The court concluded that this case was such an action, i.e., \u201ca UTPA-based Rule 23(b)(2) class action claim for declaratory and derivative non-compensatory injunctive relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">\u00b6118 In sum, the District Court attempted to construe Jacobsen\u2019s filings to assert a class claim and class remedies that \u201cminimally\u201d satisfy the criteria of Rule 23(b)(2). The court recognized that Rule 23(b)(2) applies only when a single injunction or declaratory judgment would provide relief to each member of the class, and that Rule 23(b)(2) does not authorize class certification when each class member would be entitled to an individualized award of monetary damages. <em>Diaz, </em>\u00b6 42; <em>Wal-Mart, </em>131 S.

Construing Jacobsen\u2019s filings, the District Court found that his \u201casserted UTPAbased class claim neither constitutes nor is tantamount to a claim for compensatory damages\u201d; rather, what Jacobsen was asserting was \u201ca UTPA-based Rule 23(b)(2) class action claim for declaratory and derivative non-compensatory injunctive relief.\u201d The District Court observed that this claim is \u201cdistinct from an independent UTPA claim for damages under \u00a733-18-242(1) and (3), MCA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">\u00b6119 The class claim asserts what is in essence a facial challenge to the CCPR, alleging that the CCPR is per se unlawful as to all unrepresented claimants and that Allstate\u2019s use of the CCPR caused \u2018indivisible harm to the class as a whole\u201d as shown \u201cby comparative analysis of relevant industry performance data and internal Allstate performance data.\u201d Jacobsen explained in the District Court that the claim \u201cchallenges Allstate\u2019s systematic attempt to settle claims below fair value.\u201d In his view, \u201cAllstate systematically promoted bad-faith adjusting and sought to undervalue claims.\u201d Whether class members\u2019 claims were, in fact, undervalued or settled unfairly is not the issue; the challenge is to Allstate\u2019s alleged \u201csystematic attempt\u201d to settle claims below fair value. As Jacobsen further explains this theory in his brief on appeal, Allstate used \u201csettlement guidelines below the level needed to fairly compensate claimants\u201d which caused class members \u201cindivisible legal injury\u201d; i.e., \u2018Ta]ll members suffered legal injury through the use of a dishonest system, whether or not the monetary value of each settlement ultimately was unfair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">\u00b6120 Jacobsen and the District Court employ \u00a733-18-201(1) and (6), MCA, as the legal standard for judging the CCPR\u2019s validity, but without consideration of the case-specific criteria contained in the statute (such as whether liability in a particular class member\u2019s claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>was \u201creasonably clear\u201d). Under this approach, the issues to be determined at the class trial are: whether the \u201cattorney economics script\u201dmisrepresents facts; whether the \u2018fast track\u201dsystem and the \u201c9-step process\u201d are inherently incompatible with good-faith effectuation of prompt, fair, and equitable settlements; and whether use of these programs caused indivisible harm to the class as a whole. If using the CCPR enabled Allstate to outperform the industry, and if the CCPR is facially unlawful, then class members suffered an indivisible legal injury. The proper remedy for this injury, the District Court determined, is injunctive relief \u201crestoring interested class members and Allstate to the pre-settlement status quo.\u201d This is the class action that the District Court certified and that Allstate appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">II. This Court\u2019s Remaking of the Class Claim and Remedies</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">\u00b6121 The Court, on its own initiative, fundamentally revises this framework. The Court begins with the erroneous premise that the District Court formulated the class claim using the \u2018indivisible harm to the class as a whole\u201d language \u201cso as to justify the entry of a class-wide punitive damages award.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 47. That is simply incorrect. The District Court used this language because indivisibility is what is needed to certify a class under Rule 23(b)(2), <em>Diaz, </em>\u00b6 42; <em>Wal-Mart, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2557, and because that is what Jacobsen had asserted in his pleadings and arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">\u00b6122 Nevertheless, based on its mistaken assumption about the District Court\u2019s intent, the Court proceeds to revise the class claim as follows (underlining added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-7\">As originally certified: \u201c(B) Allstate\u2019s common, systematic use of this pattern and practice in Montana caused indivisible harm to the class as a whole by operation of its zero-sum economic theory and the resulting inversely proportional relationship between Allstate profit increases and corresponding decreases in the total amount of compensation paid to the class of unrepresented claimants as a whole.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-8\">As revised by the Court: \u2018(B) Allstate\u2019s common, systematic use of this pattern and practice in Montana resulted in damages to the members of the class by operation of its zero-sum economic theory and the resulting inversely proportional relationship between Allstate profit increases and corresponding decreases in the total amount of compensation paid to the class of unrepresented claimants as a whole.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 47.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">The Court then, on its own initiative, augments the relief available to the class members. In addition to the declaratory and injunctive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>remedies certified by the District Court, the Court announces that the class trial will \u201cset the stage\u201d for \u201cindividual monetary relief\u2019 in \u201clater individual trials.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 43, 46, 49, 90. The Court explains that the class trial will determine Allstate\u2019s liability for a UTPA violation, and the later individual trials will determine class members\u2019 \u201ccompensatory damages.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 49, 57, 66, 90. The Court also announces that class members may seek relief for both \u201ceconomic\u201d and \u201cemotional\u201d injury, Opinion, \u00b6 55-something that Jacobsen never asserted, and that the District Court never certified, in the Rule 23(b)(2) class claim and remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">\u00b6123 This gratuitous reworking of the case is in direct contradiction to the District Court\u2019s certification of this case as a class action \u201cdistinct from an independent UTPA claim for damages under \u00a7\u00a733-18-242(1) and (3), MCA.\u201dIt also contradicts the District Court\u2019s statement that, \u201cas construed by the court, Plaintiffs asserted UTPAbased class claim neither constitutes nor is tantamount to a claim for compensatory damages.\u201d In fact, the only monetary relief that Jacobsen discussed in his argument supporting class certification was \u201cdisgorgement of illicit profits from the unlawful [CCPR] program.\u201d Acknowledging the limitations of Rule 23(b)(2) certification, Jacobsen did not propose that the class action would result in monetary damages under \u00a7 33-18-242, MCA. His theory, rather, was unjust enrichment-that Allstate had unjustly enriched itself at the expense of class members by using patently unlawful claim settlement practices, as evidenced by Allstate\u2019s ability to outperform the industry. The District Court accepted this theory, but found that an injunction allowing class members to return to square one, rather than an injunction requiring Allstate to \u201cdisgorge illicit profits,\u201d would be the proper remedy. The Court thus errs in reframing Jacobsen\u2019s class claim as a springboard for future individual trials on damages. The class claim, as construed and certified by the District Court, does not determine whether Allstate is liable for actual damages under the UTPA. The District Court did not certify a class action under \u00a733-18-242, MCA; it certified a class action under Title 27, chapters 8 and 19, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">\u00b6124 \u201c[Alppellate courts do not sit as self-directed boards of legal inquiry and research, but essentially as arbiters of legal questions presented and argued by the parties before them.\u201d <em>NASA v. Nelson, </em>562 U.S._, 131 S. Ct. 746, 756 n. 10 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court\u2019s choice to remake this class action disregards this fundamental premise of our adversarial system. The Court\u2019s citation to \u00a73-2-204(1), MCA-see Opinion, \u00b6 47-is clearly misplaced. That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>provision simply grants this Court authority to \u201caffirm, reverse, or modify any judgment or order appealed from.\u201d Section 3-2-204(1), MCA. It does not give this Court authority to fundamentally remake the case to state claims and remedies that the appellee neither asserted in the district court nor raised in a cross-appeal before this Court. Ironically, the Court uses the arguments of the <em>appellant </em>(Allstate) opposing class certification as justification to revise the class claim and remedies in a way that exposes the appellant to significantly greater liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">III. Flaws in the Court\u2019s Remade Class Claim and Remedies</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">\u00b6125 Besides the questionable procedural aspect of the Court\u2019s action, the remade class claim and class remedies are flawed for additional reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">\u00b6126 First, as an initial matter, the Court\u2019s Opinion is internally inconsistent. Pursuant to the District Court\u2019s Order, the class is seeking a declaratory judgment as to three issues: (A) that the CCPR violates \u00a7 33-18-201(1) and (6), MCA, as applied to the class of unrepresented claimants as a whole; (B) that Allstate\u2019s systematic use of the CCPR \u201ccaused indivisible harm to the class as a whole\u201d; and (C) that Allstate acted with actual malice. <em>See </em>\u00b6 109, <em>supra. </em>Now, under the Court\u2019s rewording of issue (B), the class is seeking a declaratory judgment that Allstate\u2019s systematic use of the CCPR \u201cresulted in damages to the members of the class.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 47. At the same time, however, the Court states repeatedly that whether class members suffered damages is to be determined in later individual trials. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6 46 (\u2018Damages claims may be determined in later individual trials after [the] class trial....\u201d), \u00b6 57 (the specifics of a class member\u2019s injuries will \u2018be aired in a later, individual suit for damages\u201d), \u00b6 66 (\u2018The later individual trials would allow Allstate to present evidence that individual class members suffered no injury.\u2019), \u00b6 78 (\u201cHere, adjudicating the requested injunctive and declaratory relief would not involve a ... determination of compensatory damages.\u2019), \u00b6 90 (\u201cthe class members would be entitled to only the compensatory damages they can prove in the individual cases\u2019). Our Opinion leaves the District Court and the parties guessing as to how the fact-finder in the class trial is to determine whether Allstate\u2019s use of the CCPR \u201cresulted in damages to the members of the class\u201d when, under this Court\u2019s decision, damages to the members of the class are to be determined in \u201clater individual trials\u201d at which Allstate may \u201cpresent evidence that individual class members suffered no injury.\u201d The Court offers no explanation for this incongruity-an incongruity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>that arose out of the Court\u2019s decision to insert \u201cdamages\u201d into the class claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">\u00b6127 Second, the question whether Allstate\u2019s use of the CCPR \u201cresulted in damages to the members of the class\u201d cannot be answered on a classwide basis in any event. A claimant is not damaged under \u00a733-18-201(6), MCA, unless the insurer\u2019s liability for the claim was \"reasonably clear.\u201d A claimant is not damaged under \u00a733-18-201(1), MCA, unless the misrepresented facts were \u201cpertinent\u201d to coverages \u201cat issue.\u201d A claimant is not entitled to damages under the UTPA unless the alleged damages were \u201cproximately caused\u201d by the UTPA violation. Section 33-18-242(4), MCA. A claimant is not entitled to damages under the UTPA \u2018if the insurer had a reasonable basis in law or in fact for contesting the claim or the amount of the claim.\u201d Section 33-18-242(5), MCA. These are all highly individualized, case-specific criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">\u00b6128 Third, under the legal authority discussed above and in Justice Baker\u2019s Dissent, class certification under Rule 23(b)(2) is improper where the requested injunctive or declaratory relief would simply serve as a basis for eventually providing monetary relief. Dissent, \u00b6\u00b6 97-99; <em>Wal-Mart, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2557 (\u2018[Rule 23(b)(2)] does not authorize class certification when each class member would be entitled to an individualized award of monetary damages.\u2019). I agree with Justice Baker\u2019s analysis and conclusion that the Rule 23(b)(2) class trial which the Court conceives in today\u2019s Opinion is for the purpose of laying a foundation for individualized awards of monetary damages. Dissent, \u00b6 99. This approach is wholly inconsistent with Rule 23(b)(2)\u2019s history and purpose.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Because Rule 23 \u201cstems from equity practice\u201d that predated its codification, <em>Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, </em>521 U.S. 591, 613 (1997), in determining its meaning we have previously looked to the historical models on which the Rule was based, <em>Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp., </em>527 U.S. 815, 841-845 (1999). As we observed in <em>Amchem, </em>Tcjivil rights cases against parties charged with unlawful, class-based discrimination are prime examples\u201d of what (b)(2) is meant to capture. 521 U.S., at 614. In particular, the Rule reflects a series of decisions involving challenges to racial segregation-conduct that was remedied by a single classwide order. In none of the cases cited by the Advisory Committee as examples of (b)(2)\u2019s antecedents did the plaintiffs combine any claim for individualized relief with their classwide injunction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_y\"><em>Wal-Mart, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2557-58 (brackets in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">\u00b6129 Fourth, using class certification under Rule 23(b)(2) to \u201cset the stage\u201d for later individual trials on compensatory damages, Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 46, 49, 90, presents due process problems. Classes certified under Rule 23(b)(1) and (b)(2) are \u201cmandatory classes: The Rule provides no opportunity for (b)(1) or (b)(2) class members to opt out, and does not even oblige the District Court to afford them notice of the action.\u201d <em>Wal-Mart, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2558; <em>see also </em>M. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2). Rule 23(b)(3), on the other hand,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\">allows class certification in a much wider set of circumstances but with greater procedural protections. Its only prerequisites are that \u201cthe questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.\u201d Rule 23(b)(3). And unlike (b)(1) and (b)(2) classes, the (b)(3) class is not mandatory; class members are entitled to receive \u201cthe best notice that is practicable under the circumstances\u201d and to withdraw from the class at their option. See Rule 23(c)(2)(B).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1u\"><em>Wal-Mart, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2558; <em>see also </em>M. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3), (c)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>\u00b6130 The absence of such procedural protections in a class action predominantly for monetary damages violates due process. <em>Ellis v. Costco Wholesale Corp., </em>657 F.3d 970, 987 (9th Cir. 2011) (citing <em>Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, </em>472 U.S. 797, 812 (1985)).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> According to the Supreme Court,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-4\">[t]he procedural protections attending the (b)(3) class-predominance, superiority, mandatory notice, and the right to opt out-are missing from (b)(2) not because the Rule considers them unnecessary, but because it considers them unnecessary <em>to a (b)(2) class. </em>When a class seeks an indivisible injunction benefitting all its members at once, there is no reason to undertake a case-specific inquiry into whether class issues predominate or whether class action is a superior method of adjudicating the dispute. Predominance and superiority are self-evident. But with respect to each class member\u2019s individualized claim for money, that is not so-which is precisely why (b)(3) requires the judge to make findings about predominance and superiority before allowing the class. Similarly, (b)(2) does not require that class members be given notice and opt-out rights, presumably because it is thought (rightly or wrongly) that notice has no purpose when the class is mandatory, and that depriving people of their right to sue in this manner complies with the Due Process Clause. In the context of a class action predominantly for money damages we have held that absence of notice and opt-out violates due process. See <em>Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, </em>472 U.S. 797, 812 (1985). While we have never held that to be so where the monetary claims do not predominate, the serious possibility that it may be so provides an additional reason not to read Rule 23(b)(2) to include the monetary claims here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXp\"><em>Wal-Mart, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2558-59 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">\u00b6131 That is precisely the problem the Court has created by transforming this case into a class action under \u00a7 33-18-242, MCA. Apparently, Allstate\u2019s liability to class members under \u00a733-18-242(1), MCA, will be determined in a class trial, which will \u201cset the stage\u201d for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>later individual trials on damages under \u00a7 33-18-242(4), MCA. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 49, 90. Because this class action is certified under Rule 23(b)(2), the class is mandatory and the predominance, superiority, notice, and opt-out protections of Rule 23(b)(3) do not apply. If Jacobsen loses on the merits, then the class members\u2019 individual claims for damages will be seriously compromised, if not totally barred. <em>See Randall v. Rolls-Royce Corp., </em>637 F.3d 818, 820 (7th Cir. 2011). This approach of \u201cdepriving people of their right to sue\u201d by approving a mandatory class absent notice and opt-out rights violates the Due Process Clause. Wal-Mart, 131 S. Ct. at 2559.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">\u00b6132 The fact that the class trial may also result in injunctive relief (in addition to the compensatory damages the Court envisions in later individualized trials), Opinion, \u00b6 90, does not alter this conclusion. Even if injunctive relief is the \u201cpredominant\u201d remedy,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\">[t]he mere predominance\u201d of a proper (b)(2) injunctive claim does nothing to justify elimination of Rule 23(b)(3)\u2019s procedural protections: It neither establishes the superiority of <em>class </em>adjudication over <em>individual </em>adjudication nor cures the notice and opt-out problems. We fail to see why the Rule should be read to nullify these protections whenever a plaintiff class, at its option, combines its monetary claims with a request-even a predominating request\u201d-for an injunction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-7\"><em>Wal-Mart, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2559 (emphases in original); <em>see also Ellis, </em>657 F.3d at 986-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">\u00b6133 For all of the foregoing reasons, the Court errs in remaking this class action into one that determines liability for damages under \u00a733-18-242, MCA. Before concluding this discussion, it is necessary to address <em>McReynolds v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>672 F.3d 482 (7th Cir. 2012), upon which the Court relies heavily. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 41,42,43,45,46,57, 66. The plaintiffs in that case sought certification, under Rule 23(b)(2), to determine whether Merrill Lynch was engaged in practices that had a disparate impact on members of the class in violation of federal antidiscrimination law, and to provide corresponding injunctive relief. <em>McReynolds, </em>672 F.3d at 483. The plaintiffs also sought certification, under Rule 23(b)(3), for compensatory and punitive damages; however, such certification was not at issue on appeal. <em>McReynolds, </em>672 F.3d at 483. The issues were whether the plaintiffs could obtain interlocutory review of the district court\u2019s certification decision and whether, under <em>Wal-Mart, </em>Merrill Lynch\u2019s delegation of decision-making authority to local managers precluded certification of a classwide claim for injunctive relief. <em>McReynolds, </em>672 F.3d at 484-91. The Court of Appeals (speaking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>through <em>Judge </em>Posner) noted that \u201cthe only issue of relief at present is whether to allow the plaintiffs to seek class-wide injunctive relief\u2019 under Rule 23(b)(2). McReynolds, 672 F.3d at 491. He concluded that certification for this purpose was appropriate. <em>McReynolds, </em>672 F.3d at 491-92. Then, near the end of the opinion, Judge Posner opined that if the classwide issue were ultimately resolved in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor (i.e., with a finding that Merrill Lynch\u2019s policies cause racial discrimination and are not justified by business necessity), then there could be hundreds of separate suits for back pay. McReynolds, 672 F.3d at 492. He did not hold, however, as the Court implies, that Rule 23(b)(2) may be used as an integral component of a larger damages action. Indeed, such a holding would have been inconsistent with Seventh Circuit precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">\u00b6134 In <em>Randall, </em>the Court of Appeals (again speaking through Judge Posner) rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to cloak a damages action in a Rule 23(b)(2) certification. Judge Posner observed that Tcjlass action lawyers like to sue under [Rule 23(b)(2)] because it is less demanding, in a variety of ways, than Rule 23(b)(3) suits, which usually are the only available alternative. Of particular significance, plaintiffs may attempt to shoehorn damages actions into the Rule 23(b)(2) framework, depriving class members of notice and opt-out protections.\u201d <em>Randall, </em>637 F.3d at 825 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Judge Posner noted that it may be permissible in a Rule 23(b)(2) action to grant monetary relief that is <em>incidental </em>to the injunctive or declaratory relief, but he cautioned that \u201cincidental\u201dhere means \u201crequiring only a mechanical computation,\u201d <em>Randall, </em>637 F.3d at 825; in other words, \u2018the calculation of monetary relief will be mechanical, formulaic, a task not for a trier of fact but for a computer program,\u201d <em>Johnson v. Meriter Health Servs. Employee Ret. Plan, </em>702 F.3d 364, 372 (7th Cir. 2012).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See also Lemon v. Intl. Union, </em>216 F.3d 577, 581 (7th Cir. 2000) (incidental damages do not depend in any significant way on the intangible, subjective differences of each class member\u2019s circumstances and do not require additional hearings to resolve the disparate merits of each individual\u2019s case). Judge Posner explained in <em>Randall </em>that the plaintiffs\u2019 monetary claims for back pay were not \u2018incidental\u201d under this definition because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>calculating the amount of back pay to which the members of the class would be entitled if the plaintiffs prevailed would require 500 separate hearings. The monetary tail would be wagging the injunction dog. An injunction thus \u201cwould not provide \u2018final\u2019 relief as required by Rule 23(b)(2). An injunction is not a final remedy if it would merely lay an evidentiary foundation for subsequent determinations of liability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">637 F.3d at 826 (quoting <em>Kartman v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>634 F.3d 883, 893 (7th Cir. 2011)).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">\u00b6135 <em>Kartman </em>likewise undercuts this Court\u2019s reliance on <em>McReynolds. </em>In the remade class action devised by the Court, the class trial is to determine whether Allstate violated the UTPA, and if a violation is found, then \u201ccompensatory damages\u201d for \u201ceconomic\u201d and \u201cemotional\u201d injuries and \u201cunderpayment\u201d of benefits is to be adjudicated in later individual trials. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 49, 55, 68,90. In the later individual trials, Allstate may present evidence that individual class members suffered no injury. Opinion, \u00b6 66. Thus, it may turn out that Allstate is liable in damages to some class members and not others. Under this scheme, \u201c[Allstate\u2019s] liability cannot be determined on a class-wide basis, but instead requires individualized factual inquiries into the merits of each [class member\u2019s] <em>claim.\u201d Kartman, </em>634 F.3d at 893. That is not a proper use of Rule 23(b)(2). Reviewing a similar scheme, the <em>Kartman </em>court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-6\">The [district court] judge said he would use the Rule 23(b)(2) proceeding to assess State Farm\u2019s liability\u201d on the damages claims. Perhaps by this the judge meant that he intended to use the Rule 23(b)(2) class proceeding to adjudicate only those common issues pertaining to State Farm\u2019s liability for breach of contract and bad faith, while reserving the more claimant-specific issues-such as the calculation of damages-for subsequent individual adjudication. However, as we have explained, Rule 23(b)(2) governs class claims for final injunctive or declaratory relief and is not appropriately invoked for adjudicating common issues in an action for <em>damages. A </em>damages class may be certified under Rule 23(b)(3) and particular issues identified for resolution on a class-wide basis pursuant to Rule 23(c)(4). Or, in an appropriate case, a Rule 23(b)(2) class <em>and </em>a Rule 23(b)(3) class may be certified where there is a real basis for both damages and an equitable remedy. As we have explained, that is not the case here; neither Rule 23(b)(3) nor Rule 23(c)(4) is implicated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AB9\"><em>Kartman, </em>634 F.3d at 895 (emphases in original, citations omitted); <em>see also e.g. Jamie S. v. Milwaukee Pub. Schs., </em>668 F.3d 481, 499 (7th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>2012) (\u201ca claim for class-wide injunctive and declaratory relief does not satisfy Rule 23(b)(2) if as a substantive matter the relief sought would merely initiate a process through which highly individualized determinations of liability and remedy are made\u201d). <em>McReynolds </em>did not overrule these precedents, and this Court misreads the <em>McReynolds </em>opinion in suggesting otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">\u00b6136 For the reasons noted by the Court and Justice Baker, Rule 23(b)(3) is unavailable to Jacobsen as a basis for certifying a class action. Opinion, \u00b6 62; Dissent, \u00b6 100. His class claim is valid, if at all, under Rule 23(b)(2) only. In this regard, setting aside my concerns about commonality, typicality, and adequacy (discussed below), the District Court construed Jacobsen\u2019s filings to assert a plausible Rule 23(b)(2) class action-one that determines whether the program at issue (the CCPR) is per se invalid as to all class members, and that provides a single injunction allowing all class members (in the event the CCPR is found unlawful) to have their claims re-opened and re-adjusted. Jacobsen\u2019s class claim, the District Court found, is \u201ca UTPA-based Rule 23(b)(2) class action claim for declaratory and derivative non-compensatory injunctive relief\u2019; it \u201cneither constitutes nor is tantamount to a claim for compensatory damages.\u201d Seventh Circuit precedent, including McReynolds, does not support our converting this Rule 23(b)(2) action for narrow injunctive relief into a broad Rule 23(b)(3) action for compensatory damages-particularly without the procedural protections that attend a Rule 23(b)(3) certification. If anything, the cases cited above repudiate this approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">\u00b6137 In sum, the Court\u2019s remade class claim and class remedies are, in my view: contrary to the District Court\u2019s construction of Jacobsen\u2019s claim; internally inconsistent; incapable of being determined on a classwide basis; not proper for certification under Rule 23(b)(2); and violative of class members\u2019 due process rights. For all of these reasons, I cannot join the Court\u2019s Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">IV. Rule 23(a) Requirements</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">\u00b6138 As a final matter, I briefly discuss my concerns relating to the requirements of Rule 23(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">\u00b6139 First, I believe the Court should definitively state what standard is to be applied when assessing commonality under Rule 23(a)(2). Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 33, 50 (declining to resolve this question). The Court, and Justice Baker in her Dissent, acknowledge confusion in our caselaw regarding this issue. Despite \u201cthis Court\u2019s long history of relying on federal jurisprudence when interpreting the class certification requirements of Rule 23,\u201d <em>Chipman v. N.W. Healthcare Corp., </em>2012 MT 242, \u00b6 52, 366 Mont. 450, 288 P.3d 193, we stated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number><em>Mattson v. Mont. Power Co. (Mattson III), </em>2012 MT 318, \u00b6 37, 368 Mont. 1, 291 P.3d 1209, that \u201c[t]he question arises as to whether Montana... should abandon its \u2018permissive\u2019 approach to Rule 23(a)(2)\u2019s commonality requirement in favor of the <em>Wal-Mart </em>majority\u2019s more stringent standard.\u201d We have not yet answered that question. We have avoided the issue here, as we did in <em>Mattson III, </em>by indicating that the more stringent <em>Wal-Mart </em>standard was satisfied in any event. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 33, 50; <em>Mattson III, </em>\u00b6 37. Yet, evaluating the propriety of the District Court\u2019s decision pursuant to <em>Wal-Mart, </em>and conducting our own exhaustive analysis under the <em>Wal-Mart </em>standard, without definitively setting forth our standard of review, emphasizes the need for us to provide direction in this area of law. Without guidance, this issue will likely be raised repeatedly in the district courts. And, absent our directive to the contrary, it is likely that district courts will continue to assess commonality under the more stringent <em>Wal-Mart </em>standard, as fewer issues are left to be raised on appeal. The District Court here analyzed the facts and law pursuant to <em>Wal-Mart. </em>The Court today has similarly conducted its analysis pursuant to <em>WalMart. </em>The question still remains, however, as to whether the <em>Wal-Mart </em>standard is the controlling standard in Montana. While I understand the necessity for robust adversarial argument and briefing, as well as an appropriate factual scenario, I think litigants and the trial courts need a definitive statement from this Court as to what standard is to be used. I believe the Court does the bench and bar a disservice in neglecting to address the appropriate standard to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">\u00b6140 Second, I do not believe that the class claim heremeither the one certified by the District Court nor the one remade by this Court-satisfies the commonality requirement of Rule 23(a)(2). In my view, there are no questions of law or fact common to the class. Jacobsen\u2019s class claim is that the CCPR is per se invalid under subsections (1) and (6) of \u00a733-18-201, MCA. These two subsections, however, demand consideration of highly individualized, case-specific criteria. The District Court recognized this, but concluded that a common question of law or fact could be formulated for the class by essentially setting aside the case-specific criteria of subsections (1) and (6) and evaluating the CCPR\u2019s validity based on the general principles embodied in these two provisions. As discussed, the District Court reasoned that \u201c\u00a7\u00a7 33-18-201(1) and (6), MCA, essentially require Allstate to promptly, accurately, truthfully, fairly, and in good faith adjust bodily injury and property damage claims.\u201d The District Court construed the class claim to be that Allstate\u2019s use of the CCPR violates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>these general principles, \u2018irrespective of individual outcomes.\u201d This Court apparently adopts the same analysis. Opinion, \u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">\u00b6141 I question this approach of evaluating the validity of the CCPR-er any other settlement practice, for that matter-under \u00a7 33-18- 201, MCA, based on certain criteria that are selectively plucked from the statute, while ignoring other criteria in the statute. It strikes me that this approach violates the cardinal rule that, \u201c[i]n the construction of a statute, the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. The Legislature crafted the various subsections of \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA, to address specific settlement practices. Subsection (1) states that an insurer may not \u201cmisrepresent pertinent facts or insurance policy provisions relating to coverages at issue.\u201d Subsection (6) states that an insurer may not \u201cneglect to attempt in good faith to effectuate prompt, fair, and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear.\u201d I do not subscribe to the view that the fact-finder in a class trial can determine whether the CCPR is per se invalid under subsections (1) and (6)-as to all class members-by simply disregarding the individualized inquiry plainly required by the statute as to such questions as whether liability had become reasonably clear, whether the allegedly misrepresented facts were pertinent to coverages at issue, and whether Allstate had a reasonable basis in law or in fact for contesting the claim or the amount of the claim (see \u00a733-18-242(5), MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">\u00b6142 I do not mean to suggest that no class action is possible under \u00a733-18-201, MCA. I do believe, however, that the supposed common question herewvhether Allstate\u2019s use of the CCPR violates \u00a733-18-201(1) and (6), MCA-eannot be answered for an entire class of claimants. Whether Allstate deliberately crafted the CCPR in such a way as to avoid review on a classwide basis (an allegation that surfaced in the District Court proceedings) is beside the point. Our duty here is to ascertain whether, under the criteria of \u00a733-18-201(1) and (6), MCA, there is a question of law or fact that \u201cis capable of classwide resohitionwphich means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.\u201d <em>Wal-Mart, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2551. In my view, there is no such common question, and I thus would hold that commonality, under Rule 23(a)(2), is not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">\u00b6143 Third, I also share Justice Baker\u2019s concerns about whether Jacobsen meets the typicality and adequacy requirements of Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>23(a)(3) and (4). Dissent, \u00b6 96 n. 2. The named plaintiffs claim will be typical of the class where there is a nexus between the injury suffered by the plaintiff and the injury suffered by the class. <em>McDonald v. Washington, </em>261 Mont. 392, 402, 862 P.2d 1150, 1156 (1993). Such nexus normally exists where proving the named plaintiffs claim will necessarily prove all class members\u2019 claims. <em>McDonald, </em>261 Mont. at 402, 862 P.2d at 1156.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">\u00b6144 Here, Jacobsen does not contend that the amount of his settlement was unfair or inequitable or that his claim was not promptly resolved. Section 33-18-201(6), MCA. Moreover, he cannot claim that Allstate, through the CCPR\u2019s \u201cattorney economics script,\u201d misrepresented pertinent facts or insurance policy provisions relating to coverages at issue to Jacobsen\u2019s detriment, \u00a733-18-201(1), MCA, given that he actually consulted and retained counsel who assisted him with settling his claim. Jacobsen\u2019s claim was adjusted to a represented settlement. He therefore is not a member of the class, which is defined as all unrepresented claimants \u201cwhose claims were adjusted by Allstate in Montana to an unrepresented settlement since deployment\u201d of the CCPR. Jacobsen has already had his claim re-opened and readjusted for payment of additional settlement amounts for his bodily injury claim. Consequently, he cannot have his claim re-opened. Further, Jacobsen no longer pursues a property damage claim, which is included in the class definition, and he is a third-party claimant seeking emotional distress damages. He thus would not be representative of first-party claimants or those claimants with property damage. Lastly, Jacobsen\u2019s claims will be subject to unique defenses, not the least of which are: different statutes of limitations for first- and third-party claims; his admission that he spoke to an attorney but chose not to hire one; the basis of his emotional distress; and his desire to have an early settlement. I thus would hold that Jacobsen\u2019s claims are not typical and that he is not an adequate representative of the class under Rule 23(a)(3) and (4), respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">\u00b6145 In conclusion, I believe the Court has wrongly remade this case into an action for damages under the UTPA (\u00a733-18-242, MCA) and, in so doing, has distorted the rules for certifying a class under Rule 23(b)(2) and jeopardized class members\u2019 due process rights. I further believe that the Rule 23(a) requirements of commonality, typicality, and adequacy are not met here. For all of the reasons set forth above, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b462-10\"> Jacobsen proffered several studies of Allstate\u2019s performance. One such study-a 2007 report from the Consumer Federation of America-asserts that Allstate has been able \u201cto outperform the industry by 20 percent\u201d due to the CCPR.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b462-11\">I agree with the Court that the certification of classwide punitive damages was inappropriate. Not only would such an award implicate due process, Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 77-78, but the District Court did not certify compensatory damages as a class remedy and, thus, there can be no award of class wide punitive damages, <em>see Jacobsen v.

This statute, originally enacted by the first territorial Legislature in 1864 as part of the Bannack Statutes, simply provided that \u201cwhen the question is one of a common or general interest, of many persons, or when the parties are numerous, and it is impracticable to bring them all before the court, one or more may sue or defend for the benefit of all.\u2019Tn 1961, the Legislature repealed \u00a793-2821, RCM, and various other statutes and replaced them with the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure, which took effect on January 1,1962. <em>See </em>Laws of Montana, 1961, ch. 13. Montana\u2019s Rule 23 was identical in all material respects to then-existing Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In 1966, several of the federal rules were amended, including Rule 23. <em>See </em>39 F.R.D. 69, 94-98 (1966). Correspondingly, this Court issued an order in 1967 adopting amendments to the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>In re Montana Rules of Civil Procedure, </em>No. 10750-7 (Sep. 29, 1967, filed Oct. 10, 1967). As noted in our order, the amendments to the Montana Rules were \u201cpatterned after either the 1963 or the 1966 amendments to the Federal Rules,\u201d the rationale being that it \u201cwould be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>desirable to maintain uniformity with the Federal Rules insofar as they are suitable to Montana practice.\u201d In this regard, we adopted Federal Rule 23 in its entirety. In light of this background, the history of Federal Rule 23 is directly applicable and relevant to Montana Rule 23. <em>See also Sieglock v. Burlington N. Santa Fe Ry.
