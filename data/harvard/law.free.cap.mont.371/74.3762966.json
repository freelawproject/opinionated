We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">\u00b62 The parties raise the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by excluding Jim\u2019s interest in his mother\u2019s trust from the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">\u00b64 2. Whether the parties entered into a post-nuptial agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">\u00b65 3. Whether the District Court equitably distributed the marital estate pursuant to \u00a740-4-202, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">\u00b66 4. Whether Jim is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees and costs on appeal in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b95-12\">\u00b67 The parties were legally married on June 18,1999. At the time of the parties\u2019 marriage, Beth owned her own home and lived there with her two minor children from a previous marriage. Beth contends that the parties were actually married by common law one year earlier, on or about July 1,1998, when she claims Jim moved into her home. Jim claims, however, that he did not move into Beth\u2019s home until after their June 1999 marriage. No children were born to the parties during their marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-13\">\u00b68 In December 2001, the parties decided to move into a home that Jim had purchased in the Rattlesnake area of Missoula, and to sell Beth\u2019s home. The proceeds from the sale of Beth\u2019s home were used to pay bills and for other expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-14\">\u00b69 Both Beth and Jim worked throughout their marriage. Beth originally worked at Mountain Press Publishing, but she left that position and returned to school. She obtained a graduate degree that allowed her to provide professional counseling services. Beth is now a counselor in private practice. Jim owns his own company, Westridge Creative, LLC. He also worked part-time for the nonprofit organization Tamarack Grief Resource Center. Both parties testified that they contributed to Jim\u2019s business over the course of their marriage. And, both parties testified that they used their credit cards to take various trips and to pay for marital expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-15\">\u00b610 Jim received an inheritance from his godfather during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>marriage. Jim testified that some of this money was used to pay off part of the parties\u2019 credit card debt, and the remainder was used for \u201chousehold needs and goods.\u201d In addition, Jim\u2019s mother gifted him money at regular intervals. Jim testified that this money went toward \u2018household uses and expenses.\u201d Also, Jim\u2019s mother had a trust entitled the Elizabeth G. Parker Trust which originally provided that after her death, any remaining trust property should go to her husband, or, if he did not survive her, then to her issue-i.e., Jim and his brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">\u00b611 The parties lived together in the Rattlesnake home until the date of their separation, January 2010, when Beth moved out. Beth filed a Petition for Dissolution of Marriage on January 7, 2011, and the matter was referred to Standing Master Susan Leaphart on February 17, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">\u00b612 Jim continued to live in the Rattlesnake home paying the mortgage, maintenance and all other expenses related to the home until September 2011. Jim testified that at that time, he and Beth agreed that neither party would live in the home, that they would share the cost of the mortgage, and that they would sell the home. Beth and Jim listed the home with a realtor for $325,000. They reduced the listing price several times until it was finally listed at $275,000. Jim testified that there was a mortgage on the home in the amount of $130,000. In November 2011, Beth decided to move back into the Rattlesnake home, and advised the realtor to take the home off the market.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">\u00b613 On December 14, 2011, the District Court issued an Order denying Beth\u2019s motion for inclusion of Jim\u2019s mother\u2019s trust in the marital estate. The court determined that any interest Jim might receive from the trust did not impact the marital estate because Jim\u2019s interest had not vested. Instead, the court determined that Jim\u2019s interest in the trust was contingent because the trust could be modified by his mother at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">\u00b614 An evidentiary hearing was held before the Standing Master on April 27, 2012. Thereafter, the Standing Master filed her Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on June 5,2012, wherein she determined that the Rattlesnake home should be sold, and that the parties pay from the proceeds of the sale the underlying note, the realtor\u2019s fees, the parties\u2019 credit card debt and the back taxes. After payment of all of these items, the parties would split the remainder. The Standing Master also determined that each party should be responsible for their own student loan debt and business loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">\u00b615 Beth filed her objections to the Standing Master\u2019s findings and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>conclusions on June 18, 2012. She specifically objected to the conclusion that the marital home should be sold and the proceeds split between the parties. She argued that she has no ability to acquire future income and assets, and that pursuant to \u00a740-4-202, MCA, the home should be awarded to her. Beth also argued that the findings and conclusions favored Jim at her expense because the back taxes owing were Jim\u2019s share of the parties\u2019 tax obligation, and that Jim stopped paying for his share of the credit card debt several months prior to the hearing in this matter leaving Beth to make all of the payments. Thus, Beth complained that under the Standing Master\u2019s findings and conclusions, Beth would be assuming a larger portion of the parties\u2019 debt than Jim.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">\u00b616 Jim responded to Beth\u2019s objections arguing that the Standing Master, after considering all of the evidence, equitably distributed all assets and liabilities of both parties and chose not to award the marital home to Beth. In addition, Jim pointed out that Beth did not provide any evidence to indicate that the back taxes were Jim\u2019s obligation exclusively.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">\u00b617 A hearing on Beth\u2019s objections was held on September 10, 2012. On September 17,2012, Beth moved to reopen the evidentiary hearing to permit discovery and presentation of evidence regarding Jim\u2019s interest in his mother\u2019s trust. Beth argued that because there had already been some distribution of the trust to Jim, at least some part of the trust had vested in Jim. Thus, according to Beth, the District Court must consider all information about the trust to insure an equitable distribution of the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">\u00b618 On September 26, 2012, the District Court issued an Order denying Beth\u2019s request to include Jim\u2019s mother\u2019s trust in the marital estate. In addition, the court denied Beth\u2019s objections and upheld the Standing Master\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">\u00b619 Beth appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">\u00b620 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact in a dissolution proceeding to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>In re Marriage of Crilly, </em>2009 MT 187, \u00b6 9, 351 Mont. 71, 209 P.3d 249. A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if our review of the record convinces us that the district court made a mistake. Crilly, \u00b6 9 (citing <em>Bock v. Smith, </em>2005 MT 40, \u00b6 14, 326 Mont. 123, 107 P.3d 488).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>\u00b621 Absent clearly erroneous findings, we will affirm a district court\u2019s division of property unless we identify an abuse of discretion. <em>Crilly, </em>\u00b6 9 <em>(In re Marriage of Payer, </em>2005 MT 89, \u00b6 9, 326 Mont. 459, 110 P.3d 460).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-4\"><em>\u201cA </em>district court would necessarily abuse its discretion if it based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.\u201d <em>Cooter &amp; Gell v.

City of Missoula, </em>2013 MT 46, \u00b6 28, 369 Mont. 108, 300 P.3d 1119.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\u00b622 In addition, we review conclusions of law de novo, to determine whether a district court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Schwartz v. Harris, </em>2013 MT 145, \u00b6 15, 370 Mont. 294, 308 P.3d 949 (citing In <em>re Marriage of Williams, </em>2009 MT 282, \u00b6 14, 352 Mont. 198, 217 P.3d 67).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Issue 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">\u00b623 <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion by excluding Jim\u2019s interest in his mother\u2019s trust from the marital estate.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">\u00b624 On December 14, 2011, the District Court issued an Order denying Beth\u2019s motion to include Jim\u2019s mother\u2019s trust in the marital estate. The court determined that any interest Jim might receive from the trust was contingent because the terms of the trust could be modified by Jim\u2019s mother at any time. Consequently, the court concluded that Jim\u2019s interest in the trust had not vested.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">\u00b625 Beth argues that the District Court abused its discretion by excluding Jim\u2019s mother\u2019s trust from the parties\u2019 marital estate. Beth maintains that by doing so, the court refused to enforce the parties\u2019 post-nuptial agreement regarding the parties\u2019 credit card debt, skewed the final financial disclosures, and failed to consider Beth\u2019s opportunity to acquire future capital assets and income. Thus, Beth contends that the resulting marital distribution was inequitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">\u00b626 Jim argues on the other hand that the expectation of an inheritance, such as his potential inheritance of a portion of his mother\u2019s trust, is not to be included in the marital estate. Jim maintains that his interest in his mother\u2019s trust is contingent upon future events such as Jim surviving his mother, and his mother not exercising her power to revoke or amend the trust to delete Jim\u2019s interest. Thus, contrary to Beth\u2019s assertions, Jim contends that his interest in the trust is merely an <em>expectation </em>of an inheritance, nothing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>more.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">\u00b627 Beth relies on \u00a740-4-202, MCA, in support of her contention that the trust must be included in the marital estate. This statute provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-5\">Division of property. (1) In a proceeding for dissolution of a marriage... the court, without regard to marital misconduct, shall ... finally equitably apportion between the parties the property and assets <em>belonging to </em>either or both, however and whenever <em>acquired </em>and <em>whether the title thereto is in the name of the husband or wife or both. </em>In making apportionment, the court shall consider the duration of the marriage and prior marriage of either party; the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate, liabilities, and needs of each of the parties; custodial provisions; whether the apportionment is in lieu of or in addition to maintenance; and the opportunity of each for future acquisition of capital assets and income. The court shall also consider the contribution or dissipation of value of the respective estates and the contribution of a spouse as a homemaker or to the family unit. In dividing property <em>acquired ... </em>by gift, bequest, devise, or descent ... the court shall consider those contributions of the other spouse to the marriage, including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\">(a) the nonmonetary contribution of a homemaker;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-7\">(b) the extent to which such contributions have facilitated the maintenance of this property; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-8\">(c) whether or not the property division serves as an alternative to maintenance arrangements. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">\u00b628 When interpreting the language of a statute, we first look to the plain meaning of the words it contains. <em>In re D.B.J., </em>2012 MT 220, \u00b6 40, 366 Mont. 320, 286 P.3d 1201 (citing <em>In re L.M.A.T., </em>2002 MT 163, \u00b6 18, 310 Mont. 422, 51 P.3d 504; <em>City of Great Falls v. DPHHS, </em>2002 MT 108, \u00b6 16, 309 Mont. 467, 47 P.3d 836). When the language is clear and unambiguous, the statute speaks for itself and we will go no further. <em>D.B.J., </em>\u00b6 40 (citing <em>Clarke v. Massey, </em>271 Mont. 412, 416, 897 P.2d 1085, 1088 (1995)). Determining plain meaning requires that courts logically and reasonably interpret language by giving words their usual and ordinary meaning. D.B.J., \u00b6 40 (citing <em>Werre v. David, </em>275 Mont. 376, 385, 913 P.2d 625, 631 (1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">\u00b629 Contrary to Beth\u2019s assertions, a plain reading of this statute clearly indicates that it refers to property <em>already acquired </em>by the parties that is titled in the name of either or both spouses. It does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>contemplate the consideration of a <em>possible </em>future inheritance.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">\u00b630 In <em>In re Marriage of Beadle, </em>we held that \u201ca spouse\u2019s <em>possible </em>inheritance is never properly included in the marital estate nor considered in dividing the marital estate ....\u201d <em>Beadle, </em>1998 MT 225, \u00b6 43, 291 Mont. 1, 968 P.2d 698 (emphasis added). In <em>Beadle, </em>this Court excluded the revocable living trusts of the husband\u2019s parents from the marital estate noting that the husband\u2019s interest in the trusts was contingent and could not be ascertained until the deaths of his parents. <em>Beadle, </em>\u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">\u00b631 In the case before us on appeal, Jim\u2019s parents created the Henry M. Parker Trust and the Elizabeth G. Parker Trust in 1994. These trusts provided for the distribution of the trust assets to the surviving spouse upon the death of the first spouse. Jim\u2019s mother received the trust assets from the Henry M. Parker Trust when Jim\u2019s father passed away. Article I of the Elizabeth G. Parker Trust provided that Elizabeth, Jim\u2019s mother, reserved the right \u201cto revoke or amend this trust or to withdraw, mortgage, pledge or assign the assets of the trust at any time during my life by written instrument signed by me and delivered to the Trustees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">\u00b632 In September 2009, Jim\u2019s mother resigned as Trustee of the Elizabeth G. Parker Trust, and her sons, Jim and David, became the successor Trustees of the trust. Beth argues that because Jim became a Trustee of the trust in 2009, his mother no longer has any power of appointment. Instead, Beth claims that that power passed to Jim and his brother before this action commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">\u00b633 As Donor of the trust, Jim\u2019s mother may make amendments to the instrument and remove its beneficiaries despite relinquishing her role as Trustee. Furthermore, if Jim\u2019s mother should use up the corpus of the trust during her lifetime, Jim will not receive anything from the trust. In fact, in March 2011, Jim\u2019s mother exercised her right to amend the trust and executed a \u2018First Amendment to the Elizabeth G. Parker Trust.\u201d The amended trust, like the original trust before it, provided that Elizabeth \u201cmay at any time revoke, alter or amend this instrument in whole or in part by a written notice addressed to the Trustee ....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">\u00b634 In the original trust, Elizabeth named her husband as the beneficiary, and if he died before her or disclaimed any interest in the trust, the property was to be distributed to \u2018bay issue who survive me.\u201d In addition, Elizabeth provided in her original trust document that if no issue survived her, the Trustee was to distribute her remaining property to certain charitable organizations. In the amended trust, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Elizabeth named her two sons as the principal beneficiaries of the trust, but if either or both of her sons did not survive her, Elizabeth named several other individuals as beneficiaries under the trust. Elizabeth also changed the charitable organizations that would benefit under the trust if any property remained undistributed to her other named beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">\u00b635 Thus, even though Jim is a Trustee of his mother\u2019s trust, Jim\u2019s interest under the trust may be revoked or amended by his mother at any time. Consequently, Jim\u2019s interest is not a vested remainder<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as Beth claims. Not until Jim\u2019s mother dies-assuming she had not removed Jim as a beneficiary under the trust prior to her death-will the trust become irrevocable and Jim\u2019s interest will be vested. Jim will not know the extent of his inheritance, if any, until his mother\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"AE1\">\u00b636 Beth relies on this Court\u2019s decision in <em>In re Marriage of Foreman, </em>1999 MT 89, 294 Mont. 181, 979 P.2d 193, to support her contention that Jim\u2019s interest in his mother\u2019s trust must be included in the marital estate. However, <em>Foreman </em>is distinguishable from the instant case because the inherited interest at issue in <em>Foreman </em>was already fixed and certain. In that case, Ronald Foreman\u2019s father passed away leaving a one-third interest in the family farm to each of his children subject to a life estate granted to Ronald\u2019s mother. Unlike the instant case where Jim\u2019s interest in his mother\u2019s trust could be amended or revoked at any time, Ronald\u2019s one-third interest in the family farm could not be amended or revoked. As we indicated in \u00b6 30 of this Opinion, \u201ca spouse\u2019s <em>possible </em>inheritance is never properly included in the marital estate nor considered in dividing the marital estate ....\u201d <em>Beadle, </em>\u00b6 43 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">\u00b637  Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by excluding Jim\u2019s interest in his mother\u2019s trust from the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Issue 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">\u00b638 <em>Whether the parties entered into a post-nuptial agreement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">\u00b639 Beth contends that the parties entered into a post-nuptial agreement, the terms of which were that if Beth would assume the parties\u2019 credit card debt in her name for everyday expenses, Jim would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>repay her from the proceeds of his mother\u2019s trust. On the other hand, Jim contends that Beth failed to present any evidence establishing the existence of a post-nuptial agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">\u00b640 Beth cites \u00a740-2-301, MCA, in support of her contention that a post-nuptial agreement existed between the parties. Section 40-2-301, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-5\">Husband and wife may contract. Either husband or wife may enter into any engagement or transaction with the other or with any other person respecting property which either might, if unmarried, subject in transactions between themselves to the general rules which control the actions of persons occupying confidential relations with each other, as defined by the provisions of this code relative to trusts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">\u00b641 The Standing Master took into consideration the varying viewpoints of the parties regarding the existence of any post-nuptial agreement when she pointed out in her Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law that \u201cJim cannot have participated in the accumulation of credit card debt over the years, consistently assured Beth the debt could be paid, and then, unilaterally, stop contributing to any payment on that credit card debt.\u201d The Standing Master also stated: \u2018Beth cannot claim to have been a part of this marriage since 1998 and then ask, almost fourteen years later to be reimbursed for all of the financial effort she put into the marriage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">\u00b642 It is unnecessary, however, for this Court to determine whether a post-nuptial agreement existed between the parties because any such agreement was contingent upon Jim inheriting under his mother\u2019s trust. Jim testified that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-8\">[w]e couldn\u2019t make a promise as [Beth] alleges that it would be paid off through money I\u2019m going to get from my mother because we had both read these documents, we both understood that there\u2019s no guarantee that anybody, myself, my brother will ever receive any money from that. If my mother ... dies without spending it down, then maybe there\u2019s money, maybe there\u2019s not, but it has-there\u2019s no guarantee that there\u2019s ever going to be any money.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">\u00b643 Had the parties remained married, the alleged statements by Jim to the effect that the credit card debt would be paid out of his inheritance from his mother\u2019s trust may have come to pass. However, as we set forth in the previous issue, Jim has only a possibility of inheriting under the trust. Any such future inheritance is not fixed or certain since Jim\u2019s interest under the trust may be revoked or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>amended by his mother at any time. And, as testified to by Jim, if Jim\u2019s mother should use up the corpus of the trust during her lifetime, Jim will not receive anything from the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">Issue 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\u00b644 <em>Whether the District Court equitably distributed the marital estate pursuant to \u00a740-4-202, MCA .</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">\u00b645 Beth contends that the factors listed in \u00a740-4-202, MCA, must be considered and referred to in the District Court\u2019s findings and conclusions. She maintains that the District Court abused its discretion when it failed to make any findings or conclusions to the effect that Beth would never have any opportunity for future acquisition of capital assets and income unless she was allowed to retain the Rattlesnake house.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">\u00b646 A district court is vested with broad discretion to apportion a marital estate in a manner equitable to each party under the circumstances. <em>In re Marriage of </em>Tummarello, 2012 MT 18, \u00b6 23, 363 Mont. 387, 270 P.3d 28 (citing <em>In re Marriage of Bartsch, </em>2007 MT 136, \u00b6 9, 337 Mont. 386, 162 P.3d 72; <em>In re Marriage of Clark, </em>2003 MT 168, \u00b6 20, 316 Mont. 327, 71 P.3d 1228). The specific factors the court must consider are set forth in \u00a740-4-202(1), MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-8\">In making apportionment, the court shall consider the duration of the marriage and prior marriage of either party; the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skill, employability, estate, liabilities, and needs of each of the parties; custodial provisions; whether the apportionment is in lieu of or in addition to maintenance; and the opportunity of each for future acquisition of capital assets and income.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">\u00b647 Based upon these factors, the statute directs the district court to \u2018finally equitably apportion between the parties the property and assets belonging to either or both, however and whenever acquired and whether the title thereto is in the name of the husband or wife or both.\u201d <em>Tummarello, </em>\u00b6 23 (quoting \u00a740-4-202(1), MCA). However, an equitable division does not require that every marital asset or liability be split evenly. <em>In re C. W., </em>2012 MT 212, \u00b6 18, 366 Mont. 278, 291 P.3d 1092.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">\u00b648 In this case, we conclude that the Standing Master\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law did set forth all of the pertinent factors enumerated in \u00a740-4-202(1), MCA. The Standing Master discussed the duration of the parties\u2019 marriage, including the discrepancy regarding the actual date of their marriage; the age, station, occupation, amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>and sources of income, vocational skills and employability of both Beth and Jim; Jim\u2019s health problems; each parties\u2019 liabilities; and each parties\u2019 needs. As to the factor regarding \u2018future acquisition of capital assets and income,\u2019\u2019Beth fails to note that the statute requires that the court consider the opportunity of <em>each </em>party for said future acquisition.</p>\n<p id=\"AbD\">\u00b649 The Standing Master noted at Finding of Fact No. 28 that \u2018Beth now does not wish the house to be sold and argues that it is her last chance to acquire a home. She wishes to be awarded the home in the distribution of the marital estate ....\u2019\u2019In addition, the District Court pointed out in its September 26, 2012 Order that Beth objected to the Standing Master\u2019s Conclusion of Law No. 10 regarding the sale of the home. The court stated in its Order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-4\">According to [Beth], \u2018the Court rejected evidence given by Beth that the only way she has any chance of accumulating future income and assets is if the house is not sold but awarded to her [and that she] has no chance of future acquisition of income and assets unless she is awarded the Rattlesnake house.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AN\">Nevertheless, the court denied Beth\u2019s objections to the Standing Master\u2019s findings and conclusions, stating that it had reviewed the tape of the April 27, 2012 hearing before the Standing Master and concluded that \u2018the Standing Master carefully considered the evidence and testimony and arrived at a fair and equitable distribution of the debts and assets of the marriage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">\u00b650 It is clear from both the Standing Master\u2019s findings and conclusions and the District Court\u2019s Order that the factor enumerated in \u00a7 40-4-202(1), MCA, regarding the \u2018future acquisition of capital assets and income,\u201d was carefully considered by both the Standing Master and the District Court. \u201cWhen a trial court\u2019s findings reflect that it properly considered the various factors enumerated in the statute, it will not be held in error.\u201d <em>Tummarello, </em>\u00b6 25 (citing <em>In re Petition of Fenzau, </em>2002 MT 197, \u00b6 36, 311 Mont. 163, 54 P.3d 43).</p>\n<p id=\"ARE\">\u00b651  Accordingly, we hold that the District Court equitably distributed the marital estate pursuant to \u00a740-4-202, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Issue 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">\u00b652 <em>Whether Jim is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees and costs on appeal in this matter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">\u00b653 Jim contends that he is entitled to his attorney\u2019s fees and costs on appeal because Beth\u2019s arguments \u2018lack merit, and are frivolous and lacking in good faith.\u201d Jim argues that the issues Beth raises on appeal are \u201cgroundless\u201d since they \u201cwere fully analyzed and addressed in the detailed, complete and accurate\u201d findings of the District Court. Beth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>argues on the other hand that Jim\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees and costs is without merit because he does not consider the possibility of \u201ca good faith disagreement on the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">\u00b654  This Court may award sanctions on appeal, including attorney\u2019s fees and costs, \u201cwhere the claim for relief is \u2018frivolous, vexatious, filed for purposes of harassment or delay, or taken without substantial or reasonable grounds.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Tummarello, </em>\u00b6 42 (quoting M. R. App. P. 19(5)). Although we have determined that Beth\u2019s claims lack merit, we cannot conclude that they were entirely frivolous or lacking in good faith. <em>See Tummarello, </em>\u00b6 42 (citing <em>In re Marriage of Chamberlin, </em>2011 MT 253, \u00b6 26, 362 Mont. 226, 262 P.3d 1097).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u00b655 Accordingly, we decline to award Jim his attorney\u2019s fees and costs on appeal in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">\u00b656 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b105-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES MORRIS, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b101-9\">A vested remainder is a remainder \u201cwhich is limited to an ascertained person in being, whose right to the estate is fixed and certain, and which does not depend upon the happening of any future event, but whose enjoyment of the estate is postponed to some future time.\u201d Steven H.
