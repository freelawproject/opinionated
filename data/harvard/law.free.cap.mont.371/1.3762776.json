We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-13\">\u00b62 We consider the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b22-14\">\u00b63 <em>1. Did the District Court err in granting the State Fund\u2019s motion to dismiss White\u2019s claims under Montana\u2019s Insurance Code ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b23-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>\u00b64 <em>2. Did the District Court err in granting the State Fund\u2019s motion for summary judgment regarding White\u2019s common law claims ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b23-4\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">\u00b65 Kirk White injured his shoulder when he fell through a deck while working at a construction site. White\u2019s employer, Trademark Construction, was insured by the Montana State Fund (State Fund). In October 2006, White reported his injury to the State Fund, which processed his workers\u2019 compensation claim and assigned it to Ann Boland, a claims examiner. Three days later, the State Fund sent White a letter stating, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b23-6\">If you receive benefits, you must notify Montana State Fund immediately if you return to any gainful employment. Any receipt of benefits or an attempt to obtain benefits you are not entitled to for this claim, may result in legal action or criminal prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1\">\u00b66 In February 2008, the State Fund accepted liability for White\u2019s claim after he sought medical treatment. Boland notified White by sending him a letter, which also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b23-7\">It\u2019s important to keep me updated with your plans for returning to work. If you return to gainful employment without Montana State Fund\u2019s knowledge and continue to receive temporary total disability, permanent total disability, or rehab benefits, you may be subject to legal action or criminal prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b23-8\">The State Fund ultimately paid for White\u2019s two shoulder surgeries and made bi-weekly payments of $981.08 in temporary total disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-9\">\u00b67 In August of2008, Boland received an anonymous tip on the State Fund\u2019s hotline that White was building and selling furniture out of his home, even though he still was receiving temporary total disability benefits. Boland forwarded the tip to the State Fund\u2019s Fraud Detection and Prevention Unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-10\">\u00b68 Tom Disburg, a fraud coordinator for the State Fund, previously had received a tip that White was selling furniture out of his home. After Disburg learned that Boland had received a similar tip, he hired Day &amp; Associates, a private investigative firm, to determine whether White was receiving remuneration in addition to the benefits provided by the State Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-11\">\u00b69 Bob Harris, a private investigator for Day &amp; Associates, visited with White outside of White\u2019s home and introduced himself under the pseudonym \u2018Dan Snyder.\u201d Harris asked how much it would cost for White to make a yard swing similar to the one in White\u2019s front yard. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>White replied he was unsure of the cost; he also showed Harris dressers he was constructing in his garage and various items in his house he had made. Before Harris left, he asked White to write down his number so that he could get in touch about the yard swing. About a month later, Harris called White and asked him to build him a cedar chest. White told Harris he could build the chest for $650, with half of that amount due up front, and that it would take at least a month to complete because he had other projects to finish. Harris agreed, paid White, and White gave him a hand-written receipt reflecting the terms of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">\u00b610 After Harris placed his order, Disburg referred the investigation to the Montana Department of Justice, pursuant to \u00a739-71-211(1), MCA, and asked that agency to Tpjlease complete the investigation and prepare for possible prosecution.\u201d One month later, Harris traveled to White\u2019s house to pay for and pick up the cedar chest. Harris was accompanied by Gaylen Buchanan, a State Fund fraud investigator. When they arrived, White showed Harris and Buchanan three cedar chests he had completed, as well as three chests not yet finished; he invited Harris to choose a completed chest. Harris gave White the outstanding $325 and White provided Harris with a formal receipt from a receipt book. After they left with the chest, Buchanan wrote a report that detailed what had happened, which concluded the State Fund\u2019s portion of the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">\u00b611 Based on information provided by the State Fund, the Department of Justice Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI) applied for a warrant to search White\u2019s home. Montana First Judicial District Court Judge Dorothy McCarter signed the warrant and three DCI agents, as well as local law enforcement, searched White\u2019s home in December 2008. The DCI agents seized a receipt book that reflected sales White had made and other paperwork. These documents established that, while receiving temporary total disability benefits, White sold the chest to Harris for $650, he sold a bench to his physical therapist for $350, and he received a vacuum cleaner worth $899.99 in exchange for working at a vacuum cleaner store.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">\u00b612 The DCI agents provided the fruits of the search to Assistant Attorney General Deborah Butler. Butler determined that, based on her review of the materials seized by DCI and those provided by the State Fund, probable cause existed to file charges. First Judicial District Court Judge Kathy Seeley granted Butler\u2019s motion to file an information and, on March 3, 2009, Butler filed an information charging White with theft, a felony, in violation of \u00a745-6-301(5)(b), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>MCA. The information stated that White \u2018failed to disclose to the State Fund that while on temporary work restriction, he built and sold furniture and worked in a retail store in exchange for remuneration, while also receiving approximately $2,242 in temporary total disability benefits from [the] State Fund.\u201d White was tried on charges of theft in Lewis and Clark County and a jury found him not guilty in January 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\">\u00b613 The State Fund terminated White\u2019s temporary total disability benefits shortly after the DCI searched his home. In March 2010, two months after he was acquitted, White and the State Fund settled White\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim for a lump sum payment of $32,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">\u00b614 White filed suit against the State Fund and its private investigators, Day &amp; Associates, in May 2010. In his amended complaint, White alleged that the defendants violated eight sections of Montana\u2019s Insurance Code regarding unfair claim settlement practices. He also pleaded a variety of common law causes of action, including bad faith, malicious prosecution, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The District Court granted the State Fund\u2019s motion to dismiss Counts One through Eight of White\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), as well as the State Fund\u2019s and Day and Associates\u2019 motions for summary judgment on the remaining counts in the complaint. White appeals only the District Court\u2019s rulings in favor of the State Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">\u00b615 We review de novo a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). <em>Ming Da Situ v. Smole, </em>2013 MT 33, \u00b6 11, 369 Mont. 1, 303 P.3d 747. We accept as true the complaint\u2019s factual allegations and, when evaluating the motion, we consider the complaint in the \u201clight most favorable\u201d to the plaintiff. <em>Tally Bissell Neighbors, Inc. v. Eyrie Shotgun Ranch, LLC, </em>2010 MT 63, \u00b6 15, 355 Mont. 387, 228 P.3d 1134. A district court should not dismiss a complaint for failure to state a claim \u201cunless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>McKinnon v. Western Sugar Coop. </em>Corp., 2010 MT 24, \u00b6 12, 355 Mont. 120, 225 P.3d 1221. The district court\u2019s determination that a complaint failed to state a claim presents a conclusion of law, which we review for correctness. <em>McKinnon, </em>\u00b6 12. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>\u00b616 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on motions for summary judgment de novo, applying the same M. R. Civ. P. 56(c) criteria as applied by the district court. <em>Turner v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., </em>2012 MT 213, \u00b6 11, 366 Mont. 285, 291 P.3d 1082 (citing <em>Ternes v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>2011 MT 156, \u00b6 18, 361 Mont. 129, 257 P.3d 352). Summary judgment is appropriate only when the moving party demonstrates both the absence of any genuine issue of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Turner, </em>\u00b6 11. A district court\u2019s conclusion that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law is a legal conclusion we review for correctness. <em>Turner, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">\u00b617 <em>Issue One: Did the District Court err in granting the State Fund\u2019s motion to dismiss White\u2019s claims under Montana\u2019s Insurance Code?</em></p>\n<p id=\"AEO\">\u00b618 Counts One through Eight of White\u2019s complaint were based on provisions of Montana\u2019s Insurance Code contained in \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA. The State Fund, in its motion to dismiss, argued that those eight counts failed as a matter of law because Title 33 of the Montana Code Annotated \u201cexplicitly does not apply to the State Fund,\u201d as stated in \u00a733-1-102(5), MCA. In his response, White conceded that although \u201ca plain reading of the statute would lead one to believe that [Title 33] does not apply to the Montana State Fund,\u201d the legislative history of the statute indicates the Legislature did not intend for that result.</p>\n<p id=\"A2I\">\u00b619 The District Court rejected White\u2019s argument. It concluded that the statutes invoked in White\u2019s complaint do not apply to the State Fund because the plain language of \u00a7 33-1-102(5), MCA, \u201cclearly excludes the State Fund from application of the Insurance Code[.]\u201d Section 33-1-102(5), MCA, states that \u2018tt]his [Insurance Code] does not apply to workers\u2019 compensation insurance programs provided for in Title 39, chapter 71, parts 21 and 23, and related sections,\u201d i.e., the Montana State Fund. The District Court noted this Court\u2019s holding that \u201cthe only interpretation possible given the plain language of\u2019this statute is that \u201cthe provisions of Title 33 [do] not apply to workers\u2019 compensation cases involving coverage provided by the State Fund.\u201d <em>Heisler v. Hines Motor Co., </em>282 Mont. 270, 278, 937 P.2d 45, 49 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"AYf\">\u00b620  On appeal, White argues that the District Court erred by failing to consider the first eight counts of his complaint because \u201cregardless of whether the Montana State Fund was required to comply with Title 33, it still had a duty to comply with the standards set out in 33-18-201, MCA,\u201d and failure to do so constituted bad faith. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>White\u2019s argument conflicts with the plain language of \u00a733-1-102(5), MCA, and with our holding in <em>Heisler. </em>White cannot graft the provisions of \u00a733-18-201, MCA, onto a common-law bad faith claim, which is \u201can actionable tort <em>independent of the insurance code.\u201d Birkenbuel v. Mont. St. Compen. Ins. Fund, </em>212 Mont. 139, 143, 687 P.2d 700, 702 (1984) (emphasis added). The Legislature has determined that Montana\u2019s Insurance Code should not apply to the State Fund. <em>See </em>\u00a733-1-102(5), MCA; <em>Heisler, </em>282 Mont. at 278, 937 P.2d at 49. The District Court correctly concluded that White\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim because there are no facts that White could prove in support of his complaint against the State Fund that would entitle him to relief under \u00a733-18-201, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">\u00b621 <em>Issue Two: Did the District Court err in granting the State Fund\u2019s motion for summary judgment regarding White\u2019s common law claims?</em></p>\n<p id=\"AX\">\u00b622 White also appeals the District Court\u2019s decision to grant the State Fund\u2019s motion for summary judgment regarding his remaining common law claims, including (1) bad faith, (2) malicious prosecution, and (3) negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">\n<em>1. Bad Faith</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">\u00b623 The District Court determined that the State Fund did not act in bad faith when it terminated White\u2019s benefits because the \u2018State Fund had a \u2018reasonable basis for contesting [White\u2019s] claim\u2019 based on the evidence it had that White had sold at least two products for money and had worked for \u2018in kind\u2019 pay.\u201d For that reason, the court determined that the State Fund was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">\u00b624 \u201cUnder Montana common law, an insurer cannot be held liable for bad faith in denying a claim if the insurer had a reasonable basis for contesting the claim or the amount of the claim.\u201d <em>Palmer by Diacon v. Farmers Ins. Exch., </em>261 Mont. 91, 102, 861 P.2d 895, 901 (1993). We have applied the same principles to the State Fund, ruling that it too may be subject to a common-law bad faith claim if it engages in \u201ctortious conduct occurring outside the employment relationship and during the processing and settlement of a workers\u2019 compensation claim.\u201d <em>Birkenbuel, </em>212 Mont. at 146, 687 P.2d at 704. An insurance company\u2019s \u201cduty to act in good faith with [its] insureds ... exists independent of the insurance contract and independent of the statute.\u201d <em>Birkenbuel, </em>212 Mont. at 143-44, 687 P.2d at 702. White contends that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment because evaluating the reasonableness of an insurer\u2019s conduct is a task best left to the jury. He cites <em>Dean v. Austin Mutual Insurance Company </em>for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>proposition that \u201creasonableness is generally a question of fact; therefore, it is for the trier of fact to weigh the evidence and judge the credibility of the witnesses in determining whether the insurer had a \u2018reasonable basis\u2019 for denying a claim <em>.\u2019\u2019Dean v. Austin Mut. Ins. Co., </em>263 Mont. 386, 389, 869 P.2d 256, 258 (1994). As the State Fund points out, however, <em>Dean </em>does not preclude summary judgment in every insurance bad faith case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-4\">[Wjhile the assessment of reasonableness generally is within the province of the jury (or the court acting as fact-finder), <em>Dean, </em>263 Mont. at 389, 869 P.2d at 258, <em>reasonableness is a question of law </em>for the court to determine when it depends entirely on interpreting relevant legal precedents and evaluating the insurer\u2019s proffered defense under those precedents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-5\"><em>Redies v. Attys. Liab. Prot. Soc\u2019y, 2007 </em>MT 9, \u00b6 35, 335 Mont. 233, 150 P.3d 930 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">\u00b625 White acknowledges that the Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act is a codification of the common law on bad faith. The common law imposed a duty on an insurer not to deny coverage or benefits without a reasonable basis for doing so. <em>Palmer; Tynes v. Bankers Life Co., </em>224 Mont. 350, 364, 730 P.2d 1115, 1124 (1986). We restated in <em>Palmer </em>that \u201c \u2018[i]t is generally held that an insurer is entitled to challenge a claim on the basis of debatable law or facts and will not be liable for bad faith or punitive damages for denying coverage if its position is not wholly unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Palmer, </em>261 Mont. at 102, 861 P.2d at 902 (quoting <em>Safeco Ins. Co. v. Ellinghouse, 223 </em>Mont. 239, 248, 725 P.2d 217, 223 (1986)). White\u2019s allegation of unfair practices against the State Fund arose from (1) its termination of White\u2019s benefits and (2) its prosecution of him for workers\u2019 compensation fraud. The latter allegation was cast in the form of common law claims for malicious prosecution and abuse of process.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">\u00b626 White argues that the District Court erred by ignoring his allegations of deception and entrapment by the State Fund in evaluating his common law bad faith claim. The \u201cessence\u201d of an insurance bad faith claim is \u2018failure to deal fairly and in good faith with an insured.\u201d <em>Ellinghouse, </em>223 Mont. at 251, 725 P.2d at 225. White does not contend, however, that he would have a common law bad faith claim if the State Fund had not terminated his benefits. Nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>does the Dissent identify authority for the position that White\u2019s allegations establish a common law claim for bad faith independent of the denial of benefits. Dissent, \u00b6\u00b6 4-5. Thus, as the District Court properly recognized, a reasonable basis for terminating White\u2019s benefits is fatal to his common law bad faith claim. In this regard, the District Court correctly observed that the material facts were undisputed: White has never disputed that he sold a cedar chest to Harris, that he sold a bench to his physical therapist, and that he received a vacuum cleaner in exchange for his labor-all while receiving temporary total disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">\u00b627 The State Fund\u2019s decision to terminate White\u2019s benefits was based on its conclusion that White was violating Montana law by receiving wages and disability benefits at the same time. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a739-71-701(7), MCA (a worker \u201cmay not receive both wages and temporary total disability benefits without the written consent of the insurer\u201d); 39-71-123(1), MCA (Twjages include the cash value of all remuneration paid in any medium other than cash\u201d); and 39-71-123(l)(d), MCA (wages include all \u2018income or payment... taken by a sole proprietor\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">\u00b628  Given the \u2018basis in law\u201d upon which the State Fund terminated White\u2019s benefits and the undisputed facts of the case, it was appropriate for the District Court to determine whether the State Fund\u2019s termination of White\u2019s benefits was reasonable as a matter of law. <em>Watters v. Guaranty Nat\u2019l Ins. </em>Co., 2000 MT 150, \u00b6\u00b6 69-72, 300 Mont. 91, 3 P.3d 626 (holding that the reasonableness of an insurer\u2019s conduct is appropriate for resolution on summary judgment when the \u2018basis in law\u201d for the insurer\u2019s decision to terminate benefits is \u201cgrounded on a legal conclusion, and no issues of fact remain in dispute\u201d) (overruled on other grounds by <em>Shilhanek v. D-2 Trucking, </em>2003 MT 122, \u00b6 21, 315 Mont. 519, 70 P.3d 721). The court correctly concluded that the State Fund could not \u2018be held liable for bad faith in denying a claim if [it] had a reasonable basis for contesting the claim[.]\u201d <em>Palmer, </em>261 Mont. at 102, 861 P.2d at 901.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">\u00b629  We agree with the District Court that the State Fund had a reasonable basis in law to terminate White\u2019s benefits after learning that he also received wages for services rendered, in violation of \u00a739-71-701(7), MCA. The statutory language plainly proscribes receipt of \u2018both wages and temporary total disability benefits\u201d and defines \u201cwages\u201d broadly, with no exceptions for minimal or occasional payments. It is not the province of this Court to determine that White\u2019s remuneration was not substantial enough to trigger termination of benefits. Section 1-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"A1i\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>\u00b630 White also alleges that, because a jury heard similar evidence during his criminal trial and found him not guilty of theft, the District Court erred in granting the State Fund\u2019s summary judgment motion on his bad faith claim. He especially objects to the fact that the court cited Harris\u2019s and Disburg\u2019s testimony from the criminal trial, which White argues is \u201csuspect\u201d in light of his acquittal. Before the District Court, however, White did not dispute that he had received cash and \u2018In kind\u201d payments in exchange for services rendered. Consequently, he failed to satisfy his burden of \u201cset[ting] out specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 56(e)(2); <em>see also Ternes, </em>\u00b6 18 (once the moving party establishes both the absence of genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law, the party opposing summary judgment \u201cmust present substantial evidence, as opposed to mere denial, speculation, or conclusory statements, raising a genuine issue of material fact\u201d). That White was found not guilty of theft is irrelevant to his civil case; the jury in the criminal trial was not asked to determine whether the State Fund\u2019s decision to terminate White\u2019s benefits had a reasonable basis in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">\n<em>2. Malicious Prosecution</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">\u00b631 In his amended complaint, White alleged that the State Fund engaged in malicious prosecution when its fraud detection unit referred White\u2019s caseto the Department of Justice for possible criminal prosecution. In a civil action for malicious prosecution, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving each of the following elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-6\">(1) a judicial proceeding was commenced and prosecuted against the plaintiff;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-8\">(2) the defendant was responsible for instigating, prosecuting or continuing such proceeding;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-10\">(3) there was a lack of probable cause for the defendant\u2019s acts;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-11\">(4) the defendant was actuated by malice;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-12\">(5) the judicial proceeding terminated favorably for the plaintiff; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-14\">(6) the plaintiff suffered damage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-15\"><em>Hughes v. Lynch, </em>2007 MT 177, \u00b6 12, 338 Mont. 214, 164 P.3d 913. \u00b632 Malicious prosecution claims are \u201cnot favored by the law and the burden on the plaintiff is heavy.\u201d <em>Reece v. Pierce Flooring, </em>194 Mont. 91, 100, 634 P.2d 640, 645-46 (1981). If the plaintiff cannot prove each of the required elements by prima facie evidence, \u2018judgment as a matter of law may be entered for the defendant.\u201d <em>Plouffe v. Mont.

The fraud prevention and detection unit also is required to \u201crefer all cases of suspected fraudulent conduct to the workers\u2019 compensation fraud investigation and prosecution office\u201d in the Department of Justice. Section 39-71-211, MCA; <em>see also </em>\u00a72-15-2015, MCA. When the State Fund referred White\u2019s case to the Department of Justice for possible prosecution, it was acting pursuant to statutory duty. When a defendant acts upon a statutory duty and provides information to the proper authorities, who then file criminal charges, that defendant is not liable for \u2018instigating\u201dcriminal proceedings. <em>Vehrs v. Piquette, </em>210 Mont. 386, 391, 684 P.2d 476, 478 (1984) (holding that \u201cdefendants cannot be held accountable in civil liability for carrying out [their] official duty within the authority and means prescribed by law\u201d); <em>see also Sherner v.

The act of \u201cproviding information to authorities without more is not actionable\u201d in a malicious prosecution claim. <em>Vehrs, </em>210 Mont. at 391, 684 P.2d at 478. For those reasons, the District Court correctly concluded that the State Fund did not \u2018instigate\u201d the criminal proceedings against White.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">\u00b636 Similarly, the District Court correctly concluded that White had not shown lack of probable cause for the State Fund\u2019s acts. We have defined probable cause for prosecution as \u201creasonable grounds for suspicion, supported by circumstances reasonably strong in themselves to warrant a reasonably prudent and cautious [person] to believe that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>the accused is guilty of the offense charged.\u201d <em>Plouffe, </em>\u00b6 18 (quoting <em>Reece, </em>194 Mont. at 98, 634 P.2d at 643). Although generally a jury question, \u201cthe determination of probable cause becomes a question of law for a court to decide when there is no conflict of evidence and the evidence \u2018admits only one <em>conclusion.\u2019\u201dBlacktail Mtn.

A judicial determination of probable cause to hold a party answerable to criminal charges \u2018is considered prima facie or presumptive evidence of the existence of probable cause\u201d and a plaintiff in a malicious prosecution action can overcome this presumption only \u201cby showing by a preponderance of the evidence that there was no probable cause for filing the original criminal action.\u201d <em>Watkins v. Spring Creek Colony, </em>188 Mont. 467, 469-71, 614 P.2d 508, 510-11 (1980). A preponderance of the evidence is evidence showing that a claim is \u2018inore probably true than not.\u201d <em>Bostwick Props. v. Mont.

This undisputed evidence admits only one conclusion-that White was receiving both wages and temporary total disability benefits in violation of \u00a7 39-71-701(7), MCA. As a matter of law, this constituted probable cause for the State Fund\u2019s actions. <em>See Blacktail Mtn. Ranch Co., </em>\u00b6 12. White has not overcome the presumption that there was probable cause for the criminal charges filed against him. As the District Court observed, the State Fund acted lawfully when it reported White\u2019s suspected fraud to the Department of Justice; its actions were supported by probable cause. \u00b639  Because White could not satisfy the second or third elements of a malicious prosecution claim, the District Court correctly concluded that the State Fund was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">3. <em>Emotional Distress</em></p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">\u00b640 In his first amended complaint, White alleged that the State Fund <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>negligently and intentionally inflicted emotional distress on him when it terminated his temporary total disability benefits. In his response to the State Fund\u2019s motion for summary judgment, White alleged that he suffered severe emotional distress when he Vas forced to go through the indignity of being called a thief and plead his case before a jury of his peers.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The District Court granted the State Fund\u2019s summary judgment motion because it concluded that White had neither alleged nor established the severe emotional distress required by <em>Sacco v. High Country Independent Press, </em>271 Mont. 209, 233-34, 896 P.2d 411, 425-26 (1995). On appeal, White contends that \u201c[o]nce again, the District Court made a finding better left to a jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">\u00b641 Under Montana law, a plaintiffs independent claim for either negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress can be maintained \u201conly upon a showing that the plaintiff suffered \u2018serious\u2019 or \u2018severe\u2019 emotional distress as the reasonably foreseeable consequence of the defendant\u2019s act or omission.\u201d <em>Feller v. First Interstate Bancsystem, Inc., </em>2013 MT 90, \u00b6 34, 369 Mont. 444, 299 P.3d 338 (citing <em>Sacco, </em>271 Mont. at 237, 896 P.2d at 428). For emotional distress to be considered serious or severe, it must be \u201cso severe [that] no reasonable person could be expected to endure it.\u201d <em>Feller, </em>\u00b6 34 (quoting <em>Sacco, </em>271 Mont. at 234, 896 P.2d at 426).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">\u00b642 White\u2019s contention that a jury must be allowed to determine whether or not he suffered serious or severe emotional distress is an incomplete legal statement. \u2018It is for the <em>court </em>to determine whether on the evidence severe or serious emotional distress can be found;\u201d it is for the jury to determine whether the plaintiff has in fact established serious or severe emotional distress. <em>Sacco, </em>271 Mont. at 239, 896 P.2d at 429 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">\u00b643 We have agreed that summary judgment is appropriate for disposing of an emotional distress claim that lacks sufficient evidentiary support. <em>Renville v. Fredrickson, </em>2004 MT 324, \u00b6\u00b6 4-7, 16, 324 Mont. 86, 101 P.3d 773. We noted in <em>Renville </em>that the plaintiff, whose son was killed as a result of the defendant\u2019s conduct, presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>\u201cno indication of any physical manifestation of grief; no counseling [had] been sought or recommended; [she] chose not to take antidepressants;\u201d and countless parents grieve their child\u2019s death every year. <em>Renville, </em>\u00b6 15. Similarly, when a plaintiff alleged that she \u201cagonized over her credit reputation, she had anxiety attacks, severe headaches, shoulder pain, bathroom difficulties, sleeplessness, overeating from stress,\u201d but did not present any evidence supporting her claims, we agreed that her emotional distress claim should be dismissed on summary judgment. <em>Feller, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 39-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">\u00b644  The District Court correctly concluded that severe or serious emotional distress could not be found on the facts White alleged. White has not supported his emotional distress claims with any evidence. Although he was compelled to defend himself against criminal charges, every year many Montanans are forced to mount a criminal defense. We decline White\u2019s invitation to hold that a criminal trial, standing alone, causes emotional distress \u201cso severe [that] no reasonable person could be expected to endure <em>it.\u201dFeller, </em>\u00b6 34 <em>(quoting Sacco, </em>271 Mont. at 234, 896 P.2d at 426). Furthermore, White admitted that he had not sought mental health counseling for emotional distress, he had not taken any medication to treat emotional distress, and he was able to pursue his hobbies while his criminal charges were pending. These facts indicate a \u201cphilosophical strength that would likely be absent in a case of severe emotional distress.\u201d <em>Renville, </em>\u00b6 15. Based on our review of the record, we agree with the District Court that serious or severe emotional distress could not be found on the facts White presented and it was appropriate for the court to dismiss these claims on summary judgment. <em>See Renville, </em>\u00b6 16; <em>see also Sacco, </em>271 Mont. at 239, 896 P.2d at 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">\u00b645 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s entry of judgment in favor of the State Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">\u00b646 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b34-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b28-8\"> White does not contest the District\u2019s dismissal of his abuse of process claim.

I would reverse and remand for trial White\u2019s claim of common-law bad faith and his request for parasitic emotional distress damages arising out of that tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">\u00b648 I begin my analysis with a review of the District Court\u2019s order of summary judgment in favor of State Fund on White\u2019s claim for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>common-law bad faith. In its order, the District Court states that White has failed to set forth what actions he claims constitute common-law bad faith, and concludes that his claim must be premised upon State Fund\u2019s decision to terminate benefits. I respectfully disagree with this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"Ae\">\u00b649 White\u2019s First Amended Complaint was comprised of fifteen counts. The complaint contained preliminary allegations with respect to jurisdiction, venue, and \u2018Facts Common to All Counts.\u201d The latter portion of the complaint described in detail the surveillance conducted by State Fund, the request by the undercover investigator that White build him a cedar chest, and the fact that White was ultimately prosecuted criminally but acquitted of the charges against him. The complaint then proceeded with the first eight counts of the complaint, which were premised upon claims that State Fund violated varying provisions of Montana\u2019s Insurance Code. In those counts, White alleged that State Fund bullied him and engaged in fraud, deception, and entrapment when terminating his benefits and subjecting him to prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">\u00b650 Count Nine of the First Amended Complaint is entitled \u2018Common Law Bad Faith.\u201d The first sentence of that count states: \u2018Plaintiff re-pleads all paragraphs set forth in this Complaint as if fully set forth herein.\u201d White alleges in Count Nine that the defendant engaged in common-law bad faith by failing to act in good faith and fair dealing, and asserts that the defendant\u2019s actions which constitute bad faith \u201care more fully set forth in the preceding allegations.\u201d He argues that as a direct and proximate cause of the defendant\u2019s behavior, he has suffered and continues to suffer emotional and financial loss. White\u2019s complaint put State Fund on clear notice that he was challenging the good faith of State Fund\u2019s program of surveillance and ostensible entrapment. The District Court ignored these allegations set forth in the complaint when it held that White had failed to specify what acts on the part of State Fund constituted bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">\u00b651 This Court likewise errs when it concludes that White\u2019s common-law bad faith claims must fail because State Fund had a reasonable basis in law for terminating White\u2019s benefits. The Court infers that the termination of White\u2019s benefits is the <em>sine qua non </em>of his common law bad faith action. Opinion, \u00b6 26. However, this contention is belied by the very authorities set forth in \u00b6 24 of the Court\u2019s Opinion, where the Court concedes that \u2018Ia]n insurance company\u2019s \u2018duty to act in good faith with [its] insureds... exists independent of the insurance contract and independent of statute;\u2019 \u201d and that a claim for bad faith may arise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>if the insurer engages in \u2018tortious conduct... during the processing and settlement of a workers\u2019 compensation claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">\u00b652 As the Court further correctly notes, whether an insurer\u2019s conduct is reasonable is a task best left to the jury. Opinion, \u00b6 24. The Court errs, however, when it concludes that it was appropriate for the District Court to determine whether State Fund\u2019s actions were reasonable as a matter of law. Opinion, \u00b6 26. To the contrary, White set forth specific facts in support of his claim of bad faith, and raises a genuine issue as to whether State Fund\u2019s conduct was tortious. <em>Birkenbuel v. Mont. St. Compen. Ins. Fund, 212 </em>Mont. 139, 143-44, 687 P.2d 700, 702 (1984). I would therefore conclude that the question of whether an insurer\u2019s program of surveillance and ostensible entrapment is reasonable is a question of fact best left to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">\u00b653 Because I would remand with instructions that White be permitted to proceed to trial on his common-law bad faith claim, I address the issue of damages. White alleged throughout his complaint that he has suffered and will continue to suffer emotional distress as a result of the actions of State Fund. In entering summary judgment against White on his claims for emotional distress, the District Court acknowledged White\u2019s argument that emotional distress need not be \u201csevere\u201d in order to qualify as an element of damages for a tort such as bad faith. The court stated in its order of summary judgment: \u2018That may be true, but that is not the State Fund\u2019s motion. State Fund moved to dismiss the \u2018stand alone\u2019 torts of negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress.\u201d The District Court was correct in this regard. State Fund moved only to dismiss the stand-alone claims; it did not seek to dismiss a claim of parasitic damages for emotional distress arising out of a tort. Likely, the District Court did not further address White\u2019s claims for parasitic emotional distress because it concluded that none of White\u2019s tort claims could survive dismissal or summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">\u00b654 This Court upholds the dismissal of plaintiff s stand-alone claims for negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress. I agree with this decision. However, because I would remand the common-law bad faith claim for trial, I would also allow White to press his claim for parasitic emotional distress arising out of the tort. As we stated in <em>Jacobsen v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>2009 MT 248, \u00b6 66, 351 Mont. 464, 215 P.3d 649, \u201cthe \u2018serious or severe\u2019 standard announced in <em>Sacco </em>applies only to independent claims of negligent or intentional infliction of emotional distress.... As for emotional distress that is claimed as an element of damage for an underlying tort claim,... we hereby explicitly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>adopt the standard set forth in the Montana Pattern Jury Instruction,\u201d which states that Ttjhe law does not set a definite standard by which to calculate compensation for mental and emotional suffering and distress.\u201d White\u2019s claims for parasitic emotional distress arising from his common law bad faith claim should be considered by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">\u00b655 I therefore would reverse and remand for trial White\u2019s claim for common-law bad faith and his request for damages for mental and emotional distress arising from the tort. I dissent from our refusal to do so. I otherwise concur in the Court\u2019s Opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
