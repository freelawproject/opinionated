We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">\u00b62 Jeremiah Bennett died intestate in September 2012, the victim of a motor vehicle accident caused by another driver. His two minor children survived the accident but sustained injuries. The children reside with their mother, J eremiah\u2019s ex-spouse Sabrina. J eremiah and Sabrina were divorced in 2010. The District Court appointed Jeremiah\u2019s ex-spouse Sabrina conservator and guardian for the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">\u00b63 Jeremiah\u2019s father Abel opened an informal probate of Jeremiah\u2019s estate (\u00a772-3-201, MCA) and on October 19, 2012, the Clerk of the Court appointed him personal representative (PR), \u00a772-3-225 , MCA. On November 14,2012, Sabrina, through her attorney, filed a 'Petition for Formal Adjudication of Intestacy, Determination of Heirs, Appointment of Personal Representative and For Supervised Administration.\u201d She objected to the appointment of Abel as PR and nominated herself as PR of the estate in her capacity as guardian and conservator of the children. The District Court held a hearing on Sabrina\u2019s motion on December 11, 2012, receiving testimony, exhibits and proposed findings from both sides. The District Court issued an order on December 19,2012, granting Sabrina\u2019s petition for supervised administration, removing Jeremiah\u2019s father Abel as PR of the estate, and appointing Sabrina as PR.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">\u00b64 Abel petitioned for a writ of supervisory control, and this Court denied the petition by an order on February 6,2013. A second petition for supervisory control by Abel is pending as of the time of this Opinion. Abel now appeals pursuant to M. R. App. P. 6(4), and the issue on appeal is whether the District Court properly ordered that Abel be removed and replaced by Sabrina as PR. Other matters concerning the Estate of Jeremiah Bennett are still pending before the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">\u00b65 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s decision regarding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>removal of a personal representative to determine whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>In re Estate of Zempel, </em>2000 MT 283, \u00b6 12, 302 Mont. 183, 14 P.3d 441. A district court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily without employing conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice. <em>Zempel, </em>\u00b6 12. A personal representative may be removed for cause under \u00a772-3-526, MCA, and \u201ccause\u201d includes anything that is in the best interests of the estate. <em>In re Estate of Greenheck, </em>2001 MT 114, \u00b6 19, 305 Mont. 308, 27 P.3d 42.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">\u00b66 A district court\u2019s appointment of a personal representative is reviewed to determine whether the district court correctly applied the law. <em>In re Estate of Kuralt, </em>2001 MT 153, \u00b6 11, 306 Mont. 73, 30 P.3d 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">\u00b67 It is clear that the District Court had wide discretion as to the appointment of a PR for Jeremiah\u2019s estate. <em>Zempel-, Greenheck-, </em>\u00a772-3-526, MCA. The District Court determined that it was in the best interests of the estate to remove Abel and to appoint Sabrina. Upon consideration of the District Court\u2019s Order Granting Formal Probate, and the facts and applicable law, Abel has not demonstrated that the District Court failed to follow the law, or that it abused its discretion. Abel has not demonstrated that he has any claim of entitlement to the position of PR of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">\u00b68 The principal point of contention between Abel and Sabrina concerns the proceeds of legal claims that have or may arise from Jeremiah\u2019s death. Abel contends that Sabrina intends to exclude him from any monetary recovery for Jeremiah\u2019s death. Under Montana law there can be only a single action to recover for a person\u2019s death, and that action must be maintained by the PR of the estate. The PR does so on behalf of those who may have a claim to a share of the proceeds of any action, under the supervision of the district court. <em>See Hern v. Safeco, </em>2005 MT 301, \u00b6\u00b6 35-36, 329 Mont. 347, 125 P.3d 597. Issues as to the claims or causes of action Sabrina pursues as PR, or the disposition of the proceeds, are not before this Court in this limited appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">\u00b69 Section 72-3-502, MCA, governs the priority of appointment of a PR for Jeremiah\u2019s estate as among those persons who are not disqualified by \u00a772-3-501, MCA. The District Court determined that the first five priorities for appointment as PR under \u00a772-3-502, MCA, were inapplicable, and that the first applicable category was \u201cother heirs of the decedent.\u201d The District Court determined that Jeremiah\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>two minor children are the sole heirs of his intestate estate under \u00a772-2-113(a), MCA. That statute provides that when, as here, there is no surviving spouse, the entire estate passes \u201cto the decedent\u2019s descendants.\u201d Those descendants are Jeremiah\u2019s children.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">\u00b610 Section 72-3-501(1), MCA, disqualifies the children themselves from serving as PRs of Jeremiah\u2019s estate because they are under the age of 18. However, \u00a772-3-505, MCA, provides that a guardian \u201cmay exercise the same right to nominate, to object to another\u2019s appointment ... that the protected person or ward would have if qualified for appointment.\u201d The District Court therefore concluded that Sabrina, in her capacity as guardian and conservator of the children, was entitled to act for the children to object to Abel\u2019s appointment and to nominate herself as PR.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">\u00b611 Abel argues that he is an \u201cother heir\u201d entitled to preference under \u00a772-3-502(6), MCA, because he claims to have a cause of action for wrongful death arising from Jeremiah\u2019s death. However, we need not decide whether Abel is an \u201cother heir\u201d under the priority provided by \u00a772-3-502(6), MCA. There is no doubt that Jeremiah\u2019s children are heirs entitled to object to Abel\u2019s appointment. Section 72-3-526(2)(a), MCA, provides the District Court with the authority to remove a PR if it determines that doing so would be in the \u2018best interests of the estate.\u201dHere the District Court made that determination and was well within its discretion to remove Abel. <em>Greenheck, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">\u00b612  In this case, it is both efficient and logical that Sabrina be the PR of Jeremiah\u2019s estate. She is the natural mother of Jeremiah\u2019s children, as well as their custodial parent and appointed guardian and conservator. Sabrina and the children are residents of Montana where the estate is being probated and where any claims or lawsuits arising from Jeremiah\u2019s death will be resolved. Because of her representative status on behalf of her children, the heirs of the decedent, she is not precluded in that capacity for appointment as PR.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">\u00b613 Abel argues that under \u00a772-2-812 and -814, MCA, Sabrina is disqualified from serving as PR of Jeremiah\u2019s estate because she and Jeremiah were divorced. Abel contends that she is therefore not a \u201csurviving spouse\u201d entitled to the priority of \u00a772-3-502(2), MCA, and that a divorced spouse is disqualified from any consideration for appointment as PR. The District Court held that at most \u00a772-2-812 and -814, MCA, would prohibit an ex-spouse from being appointed PR if nominated by a prior will. Nothing in either statute conflicts with the provisions of \u00a7 72-3-505, MCA, allowing guardians and conservators to nominate or object to the appointment of a PR, even if that guardian is an ex-spouse. Under our general rules of statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>construction, statutes should be read together and when possible giving meaning to both acts. Section 1-2-101, MCA; <em>Spoklie v. Montana DFWP, </em>2002 MT 228, \u00b6 24, 311 Mont. 427, 56 P.3d 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">\u00b614 The District Court properly concluded that the cited statutes \u201ccontain no prohibition of a duly appointed guardian and conservator of minor heirs from serving as a personal representative of an intestate estate even though such conservator may also be an ex-spouse of the decedent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">\u00b615  Since \u00a7 72-3-501(1), MCA, did not disqualify Sabrina from serving, once Abel had been removed as PR, the District Court had discretion under \u00a7 72-3-507, MCA, to appoint Sabrina as PR in this formal proceeding, whether or not she had priority. No party contends that any other person with priority should have been appointed. Under the facts and circumstances of this case, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion by deciding that the best interests of the estate supported removing Abel and appointing Sabrina as PR of Jeremiah\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">\u00b616 The District Court is affirmed. This Court declines to entertain Abel\u2019s request for sanctions.</p>\n<judges id=\"b294-7\">JUSTICES RICE, COTTER, WHEAT, BAKER, McKINNON and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b294-8\">JUSTICE RICE,</author>\n<p id=\"A9Pq\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">\u00b617 The appointment of a former spouse as personal representative seems to clearly contravene the general effort made in the probate code to ensure that a former spouse cannot take property from the decedent or his estate. To me, it is incongruent to prohibit a former spouse from taking property, yet permit her to administer the estate and presumably pay herself for doing so. Nonetheless, a former spouse is not expressly prohibited from serving under \u00a772-3-501, MCA, nor from serving on behalf of the children, who are heirs with priority under \u00a772-3-502, MCA, as their guardian and conservator. Section 72-3-505, MCA, grants guardians and conservators the right to \u201cnominate,\u201d \u201cobject,\u201d and \u201cparticipate\u201din determining the heirs\u2019 preferences, which ostensibly includes the right to nominate herself, although says nothing about <em>serving </em>as personal representative on behalf of the protected person. After assessing these provisions, I cannot disagree with the Court\u2019s decision. If the result here is contrary to the intended objective of the probate code, that objective has not been obtained by the language of these provisions, and legislative revision may be necessary.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
