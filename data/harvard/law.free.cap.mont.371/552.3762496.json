We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">\u00b63 <em>Whether the District Court correctly determined that the Board\u2019s actions at the August 8, 2011, meeting rescinded the actions taken at the improper July 20,2011, meeting and thereby defeated Zunksi\u2019s open meeting and public participation claims ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">\u00b64 <em>Whether the District Court correctly determined that the Board had responded to Zunski\u2019s document request in a reasonably timely manner?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b573-12\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b573-13\">\u00b65 The Board is a subdivision of the State of Montana. The Board\u2019s duties include providing personnel for the Frenchtown Rural Fire District (FRFD). The FRFD chief resigned amidst controversy in February 2009. The Board initiated a search to hire a new FRFD fire chief. The Board later considered whether to hire an interim fire chief after a permanent chief applicant declined an offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-14\">\u00b66 Mitchell Hicks (Hicks), a trustee on the Board, expressed interest in serving as interim FRFD chief. The Board requested on June 30, 2011, an opinion from a private law firm to address \u201cwhether a [tjrustee of the Frenchtown Rural Fire District [sic] be hired as an interim [fjire [cjhief while the search for a full time [c]hief continues.\u201d The Board received the opinion letter on July 1, 2011. The opinion letter concluded that \u201cthere is no statute, by-law or policy that prohibits a [tjrustee from acting as a [tjemporary [f|ire [cjhief.\u201d The opinion letter further advised that \u201cas long as the [tjrustee is hired as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>a [temporary [e]mployee, exception to policies regarding selection of the employees based on merit and qualifications need not be met.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">\u00b67 The Board held a special session on July 20, 2011. At the special session, the Board voted to enter into a closed door \u201cexecutive session.\u201d The Board voted to create an interim fire chief position during the executive session. The Board then voted during the executive session to hire Hicks for the interim position and to set Hicks\u2019s compensation at $5,000 per month. Hicks became interim fire chief on August 1, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">\u00b68 Zunski challenged the propriety of the July 20,2011, meeting and the actions taken at the meeting. Zunski filed a request for documents with the Board on August 3, 2011. Zunksi also requested that the Board allow public comment before it hired an interim fire chief. The Board accommodated Zunski\u2019s request to revisit its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">\u00b69 The Board held a properly noticed meeting on August 8, 2011, with a pre-published agenda that included \u2018Hire Interim Chief - Action.\u201dThe Board accepted public comment regarding the interim fire chief position. Zunski and others commented during the meeting. The Board again voted to hire Hicks as the interim fire chief. Hicks served as the interim fire chief from August 1, 2011, until March 31, 2012. The Board hired a permanent fire chief who began serving on March 26, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">\u00b610 The Board had not complied fully with Zunski\u2019s document request by the August 8, 2011, meeting. Zunski had made her formal request on August 3,2011. The Board had begun to compile Zunski\u2019s requested information on August 5,2011. The Board partially had complied with Zunski\u2019s document request by the August 8,2011, meeting. The Board made another partial production on August 16, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">\u00b611 Zunski filed a complaint on August 19,2011, in which she alleged that the Board\u2019s actions at the July 20, 2011, meeting contravened Montana\u2019s open meeting law and her rights to know and to participate. Zunski further alleged that the August 8, 2011, meeting failed to comply with her rights to know and to participate. Zunski sought the production of both the documents that she had formally requested on August 3, 2011, and additional documents. Zunski asked the court to set aside Hicks\u2019s hiring. Zunski also sought an award for attorney fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">\u00b612 The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. The District Court determined that the Board\u2019s August 8, 2011, meeting complied with the open meeting and right to participate laws. The proceedings and decision made at the August 8,2011, meeting \u201cserved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>to rescind the prior decisions made on July 20, 2011.\u201d The Board had begun to compile the requested information for Zunski on August 5, 2011, and it had delivered partial responses on August 8, 2011, and August 16, 2011. The court therefore concluded that the filing of Zunski\u2019s complaint on August 19, 2011, \u201cdid not affect the timing or substance\u201d of the Board\u2019s responses. Zunski appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-3\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">\u00b613 We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment. <em>Sayers v. Choteau Co., </em>2013 MT 45, \u00b6 21, 369 Mont. 98, 297 P.3d 312. We apply the same standards the district court uses under M. R. Civ. P. 56(c). <em>Sayers, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">\u00b614 <em>Whether the District Court correctly determined that the Board\u2019s actions at the August 8, 2011, meeting rescinded the actions taken at the improper July 20,2011, meeting and thereby defeated Zunksi\u2019s open meeting and public participation claims ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">\u00b615 Montana\u2019s open meeting and public participation laws apply to the Board and its activities . Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a78; Section 2-3-203, MCA. Nothing in \u00a72-3-203, MCA, exempts a public body\u2019s committee and subcommittee meetings from Montana\u2019s open meeting laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">\u00b616 A district court may void a final decision made in a meeting that violates Montana\u2019s open meeting law. <em>Goyen v. City of Troy, </em>276 Mont. 213, 219-20, 915 P.2d 824, 828-29 (1996); Section 2-3-213, MCA. The governing body can remedy the illegality of the meeting without judicial involvement by making a new decision that is not based on anything from the illegal meeting. <em>Goyen, </em>276 Mont. at 219-20, 915 P.2d at 828-29. This remedy requires at a minimum the re-adoption of the challenged action in a manner that comports with the law. A successful remedy generally cures the previous violation and thereby renders moot potential controversies about the illegality. <em>Havre Daily News, LLC v. City of Havre, </em>2006 MT 215, \u00b6\u00b6 30-31, 333 Mont. 331, 142 P.3d 864.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">\u00b617  The District Court determined that the Board\u2019s August 8, 2011, meeting complied with the open meeting and right to participate laws. The actions that the Board took at its August 8, 2011, meeting correspondingly complied with the opening meeting and right to participate laws. <em>Havre Daily News, </em>\u00b6 30. The August 8, 2011, meeting\u2019s compliance with the open meeting and public participation laws remedied any earlier violations of those laws. <em>Havre Daily News, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>\u00b6 30. The Board\u2019s remedy rendered moot any actual controversies about the actions taken at the July 20, 2011, meeting. <em>Bryan v. Yellowstone Co. Elementary Sch. Dist. No. 2, </em>2002 MT 264, 312 Mont. 257, 60 P.3d 381. The Board neither denied Zunski access to any \u201chard data that was critical to the decision,\u201d nor did it keep the public in the dark about an imminent decision. <em>Allen v. Lakeside Neighborhood Planning Committee, </em>2013 MT 237, \u00b6 24, 371 Mont. 310, 308 P.3d 956.</p>\n<p id=\"AvK\">\u00b618 Zunski nevertheless argues that the Court should analyze the merits of the Board\u2019s decision to hire Hicks at the July 20, 2011, meeting. Zunski contends that the Board\u2019s illegal action \u2018is capable of repetition\u201d despite the fact that the Board evaded review in this instance. Zunski argues, in the alternative, that the Board\u2019s \u201cvoluntary cessation\u201d of its illegal decision to hire Hicks at the July 20, 2011, meeting should not prevent judicial scrutiny. The \u2018Voluntary cessation\u201d and \u201ccapable of repetition yet evading review\u201d doctrines may resuscitate a claim otherwise mooted. <em>Havre Daily News, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 31-34.</p>\n<p id=\"ATD\">\u00b619 The voluntary cessation doctrine applies when a defendant\u2019s challenged conduct \u2018is of indefinite duration, but is voluntarily terminated by the defendant prior to completion of appellate review.\u201d <em>Havre Daily News, </em>\u00b6 34. The doctrine provides that voluntary cessation of a challenged action will moot a case only when it is \u201cabsolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.\u201d <em>Havre Daily News, </em>\u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">\u00b620 Zunski suggests that the Board\u2019s conduct will recur because the Board contravened controlling legal doctrines. Zunski argues that by hiring Hicks, a board member, to serve as interim fire chief that the Board violated the incompatible offices doctrine. <em>State ex rel. Klick v. Wittmer, </em>50 Mont. 22, 144 P. 648, 649-50 (1914). The doctrine provides that a person cannot hold an office over which the person exercises supervisory control. <em>Klick, </em>50 Mont. at 22, 144 P. at 649. Hicks\u2019s employment for FRFD from August 1, 2011, until March 31, 2012, violated the incompatible offices doctrine in that Hicks, as a member of the Board, exercised supervisory control over the interim fire chief. <em>Klick, </em>50 Mont. at 22, 144 P. at 649. Zunski\u2019s claim nevertheless remains moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">\u00b621 Zunski did not raise the issue of the incompatible offices doctrine until after the Board already had eliminated the interim fire chief position. The Board insists that it would be \u201cdoubly speculative to guess\u201d that it would act in the future without considering the incompatible offices doctrine. We agree. We have no reasonable expectation that the Board again would attempt to hire a trustee in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>violation of the incompatible offices doctrine. We expect the Board will adhere strictly to the doctrine, and to all other laws. We decline to presume the Board\u2019s bad faith. The Board has met its burden of persuasion that it will not violate the incompatible offices doctrine again in the future. <em>Havre Daily News, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-3\">\u00b622 The capable of repetition yet evading review exception only applies \u201cwhere the challenged conduct <em>invariably </em>ceases before courts fully can adjudicate the matter <em>.\u2019\u2019Havre Daily News, </em>\u00b6 33. A party can avail itself of this exception only when the time between the challenged wrong and the occurrence rendering the case moot \u2018is always so short as to evade <em>reviewHavre Daily News, </em>\u00b6 33. The party that invokes the exception also must establish that \u201cthere is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the same action again.\u201d <em>Havre Daily News, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">\u00b623 A party who asserts this exception must establish both that the challenged conduct inherently is of limited duration and that there is a reasonable expectation that \u201cthe same complaining party will be subject to the same action again.\u201d <em>Havre Daily News, </em>\u00b6 34. Zunski has failed to establish a reasonable expectation that the Board will again appoint a trustee to an illegal interim position. The \u2018incompatible offices\u201d doctrine would bar the Board from hiring a trustee as an interim fire chief. <em>Klick, </em>50 Mont. at 22, 144 P. at 649. The Board has given no indication that it would not follow the incompatible offices doctrine or other applicable law. Zunski counters with general statements that \u201cthe offending conduct will likely be repeated.\u201d The absence of more concrete evidence prevents the Court from forming a reasonable expectation that the Board again would hire an employee in violation of the incompatible offices doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">\u00b624 Zunski lastly argues that the District Court failed to address the legality of Hicks\u2019s appointment. Section 2-3-213, MCA, provides that a district court may void any decision made at a noncompliant meeting. The Board\u2019s decision to hire Hicks at the July 20, 2011, noncompliant meeting no longer was in effect by the time that Zunski commenced this action on August 19, 2011. The Board\u2019s August 8, 2011, meeting\u2019s compliance with the open meeting law had abrogated the challenged hiring of Hicks at the July 20, 2011, meeting. The Board already had performed Zunski\u2019s requested remedy of re-visiting its decision from the noncompliant July 20,2011, meeting. <em>Havre Daily News, </em>\u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>\u00b625 <em>Whether the District Court correctly determined that the Board had responded to Zunski\u2019s document request in a reasonably timely manner?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">\u00b626 Montana\u2019s constitutional right to know gives citizens the right to examine documents of \u201cstate government and its subdivisions, except in cases in which the demand of individual privacy clearly exceeds the merits of public disclosure.\u201d Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 9. The District Court determined that the Board had delivered to Zunski all documents responsive to Zunski\u2019s August 3, 2011, right to know request by the time that the parties had filed motions for summary judgment. The District Court further determined that Zunski\u2019s lawsuit had not affected the timing or substance of the Board\u2019s responses to Zunski\u2019s request. The District Court concluded that Zunski \u201cdoes not dispute that partial responses were made to her requests prior to the filing of the complaint, that FRFD\u2019s responses were reasonably timely, and that all document requests described in the [c]omplaint have been responded to in full.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">\u00b627 Zunski filed her right to know request on August 3, 2011. The Board partially fulfilled the request on August 5, 2011. The Board made further partial deliveries on August 5, 2011, and August 16, 2011. The Board also provided documents to Zunski after she commenced this action on August 19, 2011. The District Court determined that Zunski\u2019s requests have \u2018been very extensive\u201d and were amended and broadened \u201cnumerous times.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">\u00b628 Zunksi argues that material facts exist as to whether the Board produced all requested documents in a reasonable and timely manner. Zunski claims that Tt]he Board did not disclose the Frank Stanley documents, the sub-committee minutes, or the undisclosed meeting prior to the [sic] August 8,2011.\u201dZunski further argues that the Board withheld and failed to identify documents until Zunski conducted depositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">\u00b629 The District Court determined that no dispute existed regarding the delivery of responsive documents to Zunski based on Zunski\u2019s own admission. Zunski qualifiedly admitted before the Board had filed its motion for summary judgment that no outstanding requests for public documents remained. Zunski qualified her admission on the basis that the Board \u201ccertify that all agendas, emergency sessions, &amp; budgets have been produced.\u201d The Board responded, that to the best of its knowledge, \u201call documents responsive ... have been delivered to Plaintiff.\u201d Zunski\u2019s admission removed from dispute any remaining right to know claim that she may have possessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>\u00b630 Zunski unsuccessfully attempts on appeal to refute her admission. To substantiate her assertions, Zunski offers only vague directions such as \u201cdocuments, including committee minutes were not produced until the depositions of Sayler.\u201d Upon inspection of the directed documents we cannot locate any basis for Zunski\u2019s claims. Zunski fails to inform the Court when and through what means she had requested or obtained these documents. For others, Zunski offers no evidence as to what specifically she had requested. Zunski asks that we assume that the Board provided these documents only through means enabled by this action. The undisputed facts and Zunski\u2019s own admission foreclose that assumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">\u00b631  We will not fault the District Court for relying on Zunski\u2019s admission. <em>See </em>M. R. Civ. P. 36(b). Zunski admitted that the Board had provided all documents responsive to her right to know request. The District Court determined that the Board had provided all responses in a reasonable and timely manner. The District Court properly found that no further controversy existed regarding Zunski\u2019s right to know claims. <em>Havre Daily News, </em>\u00b6 31. We are left with no reasonable expectation that the Board would fail to comply with any future right to know requests made by Zunski. The District Court correctly resolved Zunski\u2019s right to know claims. <em>Sayers, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">\u00b632 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b579-6\">JUSTICES RICE, BAKER, COTTER and McKINNON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
