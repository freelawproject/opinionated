We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">\u00b62 We restate the sole issue on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court err by ordering Brothers to pay restitution to the State?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">\u00b64 Brothers was charged with sexual assault, incest, and indecent exposure by information on September 1, 2010. The District Court issued a warrant and Brothers was arrested in New Mexico on January 10, 2011. Brothers pled guilty to one count of sexual assault on February 24, 2012, as part of a plea agreement. The agreement recommended a 15-year prison sentence with 10 years suspended. The agreement allowed Brothers to withdraw his plea if the District Court imposed a different sentence. The Court accepted Brothers\u2019 plea and conducted a sentencing hearing on July 5, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">\u00b65 At the sentencing hearing, the State requested that Brothers pay $1,069.02 in restitution to reimburse the State for the cost of extraditing Brothers from New Mexico. The State did not provide an affidavit or any testimony in support of this request. Brothers objected, claiming that the restitution was \u2018just brought up.\u201d The Court eventually ordered $1,069.02 in restitution without either receiving an affidavit or testimony from the State to determine the proper amount. The Court also deviated from the plea agreement\u2019s sentencing recommendation, imposing a term of 20 years in Montana State Prison with 10 years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">\u00b66 Brothers subsequently withdrew his guilty plea due to the Court\u2019s imposition of a sentence longer than that recommended by the plea agreement. Brothers and the State thereafter filed a motion stipulating to an amendment of the judgment and sentence. The parties recommended the Court reconsider the July 5, 2012 sentence and impose the plea\u2019s recommended 15-year sentence with 10 suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-13\">\u00b67 The District Court held a hearing on the parties\u2019 stipulation to amend the judgment and sentence on July 11, 2012. The Court noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>that the parties requested that Brothers be re-sentenced to Montana State Prison for a term of 15 years, 10 suspended \u201cpursuant to the same conditions as previously were imposed last week[.]\u201d The Court then re-sentenced Brothers to the requested term and noted that it was also imposing \u201cthe restitution that was previously ordered for your return-your extradition costs[.]\u201d Brothers appeals the imposition of restitution without the State producing either an affidavit or testimony describing the costs of his extradition.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">\u00b68 Pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-201(5), MCA, if a person has been found guilty of an offense, whether by a verdict of guilty or by a plea of guilty or nolo contendr\u00e9, and the sentencing judge finds that a \u201cvictim\u201d has sustained a \u201cpecuniary loss,\u201d as the terms are defined in \u00a746-18-243, MCA, then the sentencing judge shall, as part of the sentence, require payment of full restitution to the \u201cvictim,\u201d as provided in \u00a746-18-241 through -249, MCA. <em>State v. Jent, </em>2013 MT 93, \u00b6 9, 369 Mont. 468, 299 P.3d 332. Such analysis requires the sentencing judge to apply the statutory definition of\u2018Victim\u201d to the factual circumstances of the case. <em>Jent, </em>\u00b6 9. This constitutes a mixed question of law and fact. <em>Jent, </em>\u00b6 9 (citing <em>State v. Warclub, </em>2005 MT 149, \u00b6 21, 327 Mont. 352, 114 P.3d 254).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">\u00b69 In our review on appeal, we will not disturb factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous, and whether those facts satisfy the legal standard is reviewed de novo. <em>Jent, </em>\u00b6 10 (citing <em>Warclub, </em>\u00b6 23). We also review de novo whether a district court had statutory authority to impose the sentence, whether the sentence falls within the applicable sentencing parameters, and whether the court adhered to mandates of the applicable sentencing statutes. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>2011 MT 116, \u00b6 12, 360 Mont. 443, 254 P.3d 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">\u00b610 Both the State and Brothers agree that the District Court lacked the authority to impose restitution because it failed to follow the statutory mandate that a victim\u2019s pecuniary loss be substantiated in an affidavit or through live testimony. However, while neither party has raised the specific argument on appeal, we conclude that the District Court lacked the authority to impose restitution because the State is not a \u2018Victim\u201d as required by \u00a746-18-201(5), MCA, and defined in \u00a746-18-243(2)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">\u00b6 11 Sentencing courts are required to impose a sentence that includes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>payment of full restitution whenever the court finds the \u201cvictim\u201d of an offense has sustained a pecuniary loss. Section 46-18-201(5), MCA; Johnson, \u00b6 16; <em>State v. Hunt, </em>2009 MT 265, \u00b6 16, 352 Mont. 70, 214 P.3d 1234. A \u201cvictim\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-4\">(i) a person who suffers loss of property, bodily injury, or death as a result of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">(A) the commission of an offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">(B) the good faith effort to prevent the commission of an offense; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">(C) the good faith effort to apprehend a person reasonably suspected of committing an offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">(ii) the estate of a deceased or incapacitated victim or a member of the immediate family of a homicide victim;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">(iii) a governmental entity that suffers loss of property as a result of the commission of an offense in this state or that incurs costs or losses <em>during the commission or investigation of an escape, </em>as defined in 45-7-306, <em>or during the apprehension or attempted apprehension of the escapee',</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-10\">(iv) an insurer or surety with a right of subrogation to the extent it has reimbursed the victim of the offense for pecuniary loss;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-11\">(v) the crime victims compensation and assistance program established under Title 53, chapter 9, part 1, to the extent that it has reimbursed a victim for pecuniary loss; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-12\">(vi) any person or entity whom the offender has voluntarily agreed to reimburse as part of a voluntary plea bargain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-13\">Section 46-18-243(2)(a), MCA (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-14\">\u00b612 We recently considered when the State can be a \u201cvictim\u201d for the purposes of the restitution statutes in <em>State v. Jay, </em>2013 MT 79, 369 Mont. 332, 298 P.3d 396. There, the district court ordered the defendant to pay $600 in restitution to the State for expenses incurred in interviewing an expert defense witness. <em>Jay, </em>\u00b6 14. We concluded that a \u201cvictim\u201dunder \u00a746-18-243(2)(a), MCA, included a governmental entity \u201conly when that entity suffers property damage in the commission of a crime, or incurs costs in the investigation or apprehension of an escaped person.\u201d <em>Jay, </em>\u00b6 48. We then found neither situation to be present, as the State had incurred expenses only by interviewing a defense witness. <em>Jay, </em>\u00b6 48. Thus, we concluded that the State was not a \u2018Victim\u201d entitled to restitution under \u00a746-18- 201(5), MCA. <em>Jay, </em>\u00b6 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-15\">\u00b613  The same reasoning applies here. The State sought restitution for expenses incurred extraditing Brothers from New Mexico. Like <em>Jay, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>the expenses were not the result of property damage suffered during the commission of a crime or of the investigation or apprehension of an escapee. According to \u00a746-18-243(2)(a), MCA, and <em>Jay, </em>the State is therefore not a \u201cvictim\u201d and is not entitled to seek restitution from Brothers. We accordingly vacate the $1,069.02 in restitution awarded to the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">\u00b614 Because we conclude that the State was not a \u2018Victim\u201d for the purposes of the restitution statutes, we conclude that the District Court lacked the authority to award restitution to the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">\u00b615 Reversed and remanded for entry of an amended judgment consistent herewith.</p>\n<judges id=\"b278-7\">JUSTICES COTTER, MORRIS, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
