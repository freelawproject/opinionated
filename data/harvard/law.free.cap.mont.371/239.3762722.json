Rogers of eight criminal counts, including sexual intercourse without consent, partner or family member assault, unlawful restraint, and violation of a no contact order. The Montana Fourth Judicial District Court subsequently sentenced Rogers to forty years at the Montana State Prison, with twenty years suspended. Rogers appeals his conviction. We reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">\u00b62 Rogers raises two issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">\u00b63 <em>1. Did the District Court violate Rogers\u2019s constitutional rights by precluding him from cross-examining the victim about her prior acts of violence against him unless he first testified to his defense of justifiable use of force?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">\u00b64 <em>2. Did the District Court err by allowing the State to question Rogers about his prior criminal history once he testified about the victim\u2019s prior acts of violence against him?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b260-12\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b260-13\">\u00b65 Over the course of a four-year period, Rogers and the alleged victim, S.M., engaged in an \u201con again, off again\u201dromantic relationship that \u201chad some good times and bad times\u201d; it abruptly ended in mid-April 2011. Rogers agreed to meet with S.M. at 1:00 p.m. on April 15 to discuss their relationship as well as money Rogers owed S.M. When Rogers failed to arrive as agreed, S.M. called him and texted him numerous times. Eventually, Rogers told S.M. that he and his brother would have a drink with her at a bar in Missoula. S.M. testified that both Rogers and his brother had been drinking \u201cquite a lot\u201d and they were asked to leave the bar after Rogers\u2019s brother made a scene. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Rogers told S.M. to go back to her home in Arlee and he \u201cwould be there later\u201d after he finished \u201changing out with [his] brother.\u201d S.M. continued to call and text Rogers throughout the evening of April 15 and into the early-morning hours of April 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">\u00b66 S.M. testified that at approximately 3:00 that morning, she heard someone \u2018banging\u201d on her back door. Rogers then called S.M. and asked her to let him into the house. When she refused, Rogers broke into her home and \u201cmade it clear that he wanted to have ... sexual relations[.]\u201d S.M. described Rogers as being \u201cvery intoxicated\u201d and testified that he was \u201cslurring his words.\u201d S.M. later stated that after she asked Rogers to leave, he \u2018bit [her] in the jaw ... very hard\u201d and prevented her from calling 911. At that point, S.M. stopped resisting Rogers\u2019s advances because she was afraid he would kill her unless she complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">\u00b67 Rogers \u2018basically held [S.M.] hostage from 3:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m.\u201d He pinned S.M. down on her bed and, after he was unable to obtain an erection, he penetrated her with his fingers and tongue; later that morning he \u201cmasturbated over [her] head and chest.\u201d Rogers also choked S.M. \u201cseveral times\u201dduring the ordeal and, when he needed to use the bathroom, he \u201cgrabbed the back of [her] hair\u201d and \u201cmade [her] go into the restroom with him.\u201d S.M. tried to get Rogers to stop assaulting her by telling him that her daughter was picking up her dog at the house that morning; instead of stopping, Rogers stated he should stay so he could have sex with S.M.\u2019s daughter as well and then \u2018hurt both of [them].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">\u00b68 At approximately 7:00 a.m., Rogers left S.M.\u2019s house. Even though S.M. had not reported Rogers for prior instances of abuse, she immediately called 911-in part because Rogers had threatened her daughter. Missoula County Sheriffs Deputies responded to the call and arrested Rogers outside of S.M.\u2019s residence. Deputy Scott King later recalled that S.M. was coherent, but she \u2018bad a split lip, and a bruising on her face.\u201d She told Deputy King that Rogers had sexually and physically assaulted her that morning; she also reported that Rogers had physically assaulted her in November 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">\u00b69 After his arrest, Rogers was transported to the Missoula County Sheriff s Office, where Deputy William Burt interviewed him. Rogers \u201cadamantly\u201d denied breaking into S.M.\u2019s house and told the deputy that S.M. had consented to having sex with him. Although he initially denied striking S.M., when Burt noticed Rogers had blood on his hand Rogers began to cry and admitted slapping S.M. in the face. Rogers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>explained that he struck S.M. after she made \u201ccomments about his brother\u2019s sexual offender status.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">\u00b610 Deputy King then filled out a seventy-two-hour no-contact order and gave it to Rogers at the county jail. Rogers admitted at trial that, even though he understood he was prohibited from contacting S.M., he violated that order several times by calling S.M. from the jail. S.M. testified that he called her five times on the day he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">\u00b611 On May 3, 2011, the Missoula County Attorney filed an information with the District Court charging Rogers with sexual intercourse without consent, a felony, in violation of \u00a745-5-503, MCA; two counts of partner or family member assault, third or subsequent offense, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-206(3)(a)(iv), MCA; unlawful restraint, a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a745-5-301, MCA; and four counts of violating a no-contact order by a person charged with partner or family member assault, a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a745-5-209, MCA. Rogers pled not guilty before the District Court, which set his trial for the week of November 28, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">\u00b612 Several months before trial, Rogers gave notice that he would assert a justifiable use of force defense by establishing that S.M. had a violent character. He planned to introduce evidence that the State had charged S.M. with criminal endangerment and partner or family member assault after she allegedly bit Rogers while he was driving. The State subsequently filed a motion in limine requesting that the District Court prohibit Rogers from introducing \u2018testimony or physical evidence related to any alleged prior acts of violence of [S.M.] absent proper foundation.\u201d In the motion, the State contended that, pursuant to <em>State v. Daniels, </em>2011 MT 278, 362 Mont. 426, 265 P.3d 623, Rogers was required to testify about his personal knowledge of S.M.\u2019s past acts of violence prior to any testimony regarding S.M.\u2019s character for violence. Rogers responded that he understood the ruling of <em>Daniels </em>and was confident he could lay the necessary foundation to permit introduction of the victim\u2019s violent history with Rogers. Rogers\u2019s counsel indicated that he proposed to make an offer of proof outside the presence of the jury Tt]o facilitate the resolution of this issue.\u201dThe response did not identify any constitutional issues for the court\u2019s consideration or offer other legal argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">\u00b613 Immediately prior to trial, Rogers\u2019s attorney, Chris Daly, presented a proposal for how he intended to satisfy <em>Daniels </em>prior to cross-examining S.M. about her allegedly violent character:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-8\">[A]t some point before the alleged victim testifies, we would-eut of the presence of the jury-4 would put on an offer of proof for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Court to hear what evidence we would, in fact, intend to put forward, and, then, the Court [could] see if that satisfies the requirements of <em>Daniels. </em>And, then, we would be able to proceed with cross-examination of [S.M.].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">\u00b614 The State objected to the proposal, asserting that pursuant to <em>Daniels, </em>Rogers could not cross-examine S.M. about her violent character until he testified before the jury and established that his knowledge of S.M.\u2019s prior acts of violence served as the basis for his decision to defend himself by striking S.M. Daly offered that it would be \u201cmore efficient\u201d to proceed with the offer first, \u201cso the Court would know what we[\u2019]re going to say,... and then do the cross-examination of [S.M.], knowing that Mr. Rogers has already said what he was going to say.\u201dThe District Court took the issue under advisement and stated it would not issue a ruling until it had read <em>Daniels.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">\u00b6 15 After the State made its opening statement, the prosecution again requested that the court rule on its outstanding motion in limine. Rogers\u2019 s attorney reiterated his position: \u201c[W]hat I\u2019d actually like to do with that is to do an offer of proof, so the Court could hear exactly what Mr. Rogers intends to testify, with regard to that, so that there\u2019s no surprises or objections at the time of his testimony.\u201d The District Court granted the State\u2019s motion in limine; it reasoned that the only way Rogers could satisfy the requirements in <em>Daniels </em>was to testify and lay the appropriate foundation in front of the jury. Daly attempted to persuade the court one last time, stating that for the sake of \u2018judicial economy,\u201d he preferred to make an offer of proof establishing what Rogers would later testify to because \u201cotherwise, if we have to wait until Mr. Rogers takes the stand, as part of our case-in-chief, then I would ... have to recall [S.M.].\u201d The District Court stated it \u201c[didn\u2019t] think judicial economy [was] going to carry the day\u201d and agreed that, pursuant to <em>Daniels, </em>the proper procedure was to raise the issue of justifiable use of force through Rogers\u2019s testimony, and then to recall S.M. during Rogers\u2019s case-in-chief. Daly did not object to the District Court\u2019s decision on the ground that Rogers may choose not to testify. S.M. testified during the State\u2019s case-in-chief, and Daly cross-examined her, but not about the actions that led the State to charge her with partner or family member assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">\u00b616 The next day, during a recess taken just prior to the close of the State\u2019s case-in-chief, Daly made an offer of proof to the court detailing what Rogers\u2019s testimony would be so that the court could establish what the \u201cground rules\u201d would be for his self-defense testimony. Daly explained that Rogers \u201cwill testify that knowing this [violent] history <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>of [S.M.], that\u2019s why he felt he needed to use the force he did.\u201d The court then asked whether S.M.\u2019s \u2018Violent acts\u201d Rogers would testify about were directed toward Rogers. After learning that they were, the Court ruled it would \u201callow any evidence of prior violence between the parties by the Defendant, or by the State.\u201d The court informed the prosecution that \u201conce the defendant opens the door, you\u2019re free to go where you want.\u201d The District Court then allowed Daly to confer with Rogers for the remaining four minutes of the recess.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">\u00b617 At the end of the recess, the court stated that it wanted to further clarify its ruling: T just want to be certain that Mr. Rogers knows that once he [testifies about S.M.\u2019s prior violent acts towards him], his prior criminal history comes into play.\u201d Daly asked the court whether that meant his criminal history involving S.M., or his entire criminal history. The District Court responded that it meant any violent acts committed by Rogers: \u201cIf you talk about violence, any act of violence that you committed against another person is relevant and admissible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">\u00b618 Rogers then voiced his objection to this ruling, telling the court that it was \u201cLeaving [him] no choice-with no defenseds what [it\u2019s] leaving me\u201dbecause he had an extensive criminal history, even though he asserted that he had been \u201cclean for ten [or] twelve years.\u201d Daly then asked Rogers whether, in light of the court\u2019s decision, he still wanted to proceed with his justifiable use of force defense and testify about S.M.\u2019s past acts of violence. Rogers responded: \u201cWell, you better stand up, and tell them I\u2019m a piece of shit, and I\u2019ve been in a lot of trouble in my life because I\u2019m going to tell them the truth. I\u2019m going to tell them how crazy [S.M.] is, and how violent she is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">\u00b619 Rogers took the stand in his own defense. He explained that S.M. let him into her house and they proceeded to have consensual sexual relations. Rogers denied ever restraining S.M., choking her, or grabbing her by the hair. Rogers also testified that S.M. woke him up in the morning and asked him to leave because her daughter, who \u201cdespised\u201d Rogers, was coming to the house. When he refused to leave, Rogers explained, she \u2018blew a gasket\u201d and became \u2018Violently upset\u201d and started hitting him and clawing at him. Rogers then stated that he defended himself by slapping S.M. and pushing her away, and that he then ran out of the house in his boxer shorts to escape S.M. Daly then asked Rogers if he ever had experienced this sort of reaction from S.M. Rogers replied by acknowledging that if he answered the question, he would \u2018have to tell you people all about me and my past\u201d; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>he then discussed previous times that S.M. physically had attacked him.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">\u00b620 On cross-examination, the prosecutor-Jason Marks-asked Rogers a series of questions about his criminal history. Marks began his cross-examination by asking, \u201cwhen you said you have kind of a checkered past, that didn\u2019t quite cover the whole story, did it?\u201d Rogers then asked, \u2018Do you want to prosecute me on my past or this charge?\u201d Marks stated: \u2018You\u2019ve got two prior partner assaults that you were convicted of?\u201d Rogers admitted that was true, and volunteered a detailed account of the factual circumstances that gave rise to the convictions. Marks proceeded, stating: Tm assuming those [bar fights] are the misdemeanor assaults on your record?\u201d Rogers answered that was correct. Marks then asked whether Rogers had been convicted of \u2018felony assault and use of a weapon\u201d and Rogers answered that those charges were \u201cdismissed in court, eventually.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Marks also questioned Rogers about a 2008 partner or family member assault conviction, but Rogers replied that he had no recollection of such a conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">\u00b621 Marks then asked Rogers: \u201c[A]nd how many women is it you\u2019ve been charged with raping?\u201d Rogers answered: \u201cOh, five, ten, twenty-J don\u2019t know. You tell me-actually, two-years ago. Fifteen years ago, I was accused of it. I was acquitted of it, and charges were dismissed, and [S.M.\u2019s] ....\u2019\u2019At that point, Marks interrupted Rogers and stated: \u2018You were convicted at trial, and it went up [and was reversed] on appeal. Let\u2019s be clear.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">\u00b622 The jury returned a verdict convicting Rogers of all eight counts charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">\u00b623 For questions regarding constitutional law, our review is plenary. <em>Daniels, </em>\u00b6 11. A district court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary matters generally is reviewed for an abuse of discretion; however, \u2018to the extent the [district] court\u2019s ruling is based on an interpretation of an evidentiary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>rule or statute, the ruling is reviewed de novo.\u201d <em>State v. Stewart, </em>2012 MT 317, \u00b6 23, 367 Mont. 503, 291 P.3d 1187; <em>see also Daniels, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">\u00b624 <em>1. Did the District Court violate Rogers\u2019s constitutional rights by precluding him from cross-examining the victim about her prior acts of violence against him unless he first testified to his defense of justifiable use of force?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\u00b625 Rogers contends that the District Court \u201cerred and violated [his] constitutional rights by precluding him from questioning [S.M.] about her past violence against him unless and until he testified.\u201dHe argues that the District Court\u2019s ruling forced him \u2018into the intolerable position of choosing between his right to present a defense ... [by cross-examining] the State\u2019s principal witness against him, and his right not to testify.\u201d This error violated his rights guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution, Rogers argues, as well as his right to cross-examine adverse witnesses found in the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">\u00b626 The State asserts that Rogers waived his constitutional claim that the District Court\u2019s ruling impermissibly required him to testify before cross-examining S.M. about her prior acts of violence. Instead of objecting that he was being forced to choose between competing constitutional rights, the State argues, \u2018Rogers asserted that as a matter of <em>judicial economy, </em>it simply made more sense for Rogers to make an offer of proof about his intended testimony\u201d so that he could cross-examine S.M. about those acts, rather than recalling her during his case in chief. (Emphasis in original.) The State maintains that Rogers always \u201cexpressed to the district court a firm intention to testify, and indicated that his offer of proof to lay the proper foundation to introduce character evidence of S.M. would constitute his intended testimony.\u201d We agree with the State that Rogers failed to preserve this issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">\u00b627 Generally, a \u201c\u2018defendant must make a timely objection to properly preserve an issue for appeal.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Daniels, </em>\u00b6 31 (quoting <em>State v. Paoni, </em>2006 MT 26, \u00b6 35, 331 Mont. 86, 128 P.3d 1040); <em>see also </em>$46-20-104(2) and -701, MCA. To be timely, the objection \u201cmust be made as soon as the grounds for the objection are apparent.\u201d <em>Schuff v. Jackson, </em>2002 MT 215, \u00b6 30, 311 Mont. 312, 55 P.3d 387. \u2018Failure to lodge a timely objection constitutes a waiver of the objection and precludes raising the issue on appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Sittner, </em>1999 MT 103, \u00b6 13, 294 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Mont. 302, 980 P.2d 1053. Our consistent application of the timely-objection rule has been motivated by concerns of judicial economy and fundamental fairness, both of which require alleged errors to be brought to the attention of the district court \u201cso that actual error can be prevented or corrected at the first opportunity.\u201d <em>State v. West, </em>2008 MT 338, \u00b6 17, 346 Mont. 244, 194 P.3d 683 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">\u00b628  The District Court determined on the first day of trial that Rogers would have to testify and establish a foundation for his justifiable use of force defense before he could cross-examine S.M. about her prior violent acts. Rogers did not alert the court to any constitutional concerns in his response to the State\u2019s motion in limine, nor did he object on that basis to the court\u2019s ruling during trial. The District Court asked Daly if he disagreed with the ruling. Daly stated: \u201cWell I just think, as a matter of-like I say-ef judicial economy, we could do it the way I suggested.\u201d The court disagreed, stating that \u2018judicial economy [was not] going to carry the day.\u201d Furthermore, Daly repeatedly stated that Rogers intended to testify and offered no objection to his doing so, undermining Rogers\u2019s argument on appeal that the District Court forced him to choose between exercising his constitutional right to not testify and his right to cross-examine S.M. <em>See Daniels, </em>\u00b6 35. Because Rogers failed to timely object to the District Court\u2019s ruling and because he did not argue that he could not be compelled to testify prior to asserting a justifiable use of force defense, we decline to consider his constitutional arguments on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">\u00b629 <em>2. Did the District Court err by allowing the State to question Rogers about his prior criminal history once he testified about S.M.\u2019s prior acts of violence against him </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\u00b630 Rogers asserts that the District Court \u201cerred and prejudiced [him] by allowing the State to inquire into his past criminal history, including matters that were reversed on appeal.\u201d He contends that, in doing so, the District Court violated M. R. Evid. 404(b), which generally prohibits the admission of an individual\u2019s criminal history into evidence without justification. Rogers claims that the District Court \u201cerred by going beyond\u201d an examination of his relationship with S.M. and \u201copening up [his] criminal history to cross-examination.\u201d Rogers argues that the error prejudiced his right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">\u00b631 Rule 404(b) does not bar evidence, but prohibits a \u201ctheory of admissibility.\u201d <em>Stewart, </em>\u00b6 61. Evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts may not be admitted to prove the defendant\u2019s character, disposition or propensity in order to show that he acted in conformity with that character at the time of the offense in question. <em>Stewart, </em>\u00b6 61. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>\u201c \u2018if the necessary logical steps [in the prosecutor\u2019s theory of admissibility] include an inference of general character or propensity, or if it seems likely that the proof will be used to support such an inference,\u2019 then the principle of exclusion applies.\u201d <em>Stewart, </em>\u00b6 61 (quoting Christopher B. Mueller &amp; Laird C. Kirkpatrick, Federal Evidence vol. 1, \u00a74:28, 746-47 (3d ed., Thomson/West 2007)). As a general rule, evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts must be excluded because \u201c \u2018prior acts or crimes are highly prejudicial to the defendant, and usually irrelevant for purposes of the charged crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Derbyshire, </em>2009 MT 27, \u00b6 51, 349 Mont. 114, 201 P.3d 811 (quoting <em>State v. Croteau, </em>248 Mont. 403, 407, 812 P.2d 1251, 1253 (1991), and citing <em>State v.

We have applied this rule to ensure that a defendant is not convicted \u201c \u2018merely because he is an unsavory person\u2019 or on the rationale that because he committed a crime in the past, he has a defect of character that makes him more likely than people generally to have committed the charged offense.\u201d <em>Derbyshire, </em>\u00b6 22 (quoting <em>Gowan, </em>\u00b6 19). \u2018Essentially, Rule 404(b) disallows the inference from bad act to bad person to guilty person.\u201d <em>State v. Dist. Ct. of the Eighteenth Jud. Dist, </em>2010 MT 263, \u00b6 47, 358 Mont. 325, 246 P.3d 415.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">\u00b633 The State does not argue in this case that evidence of Rogers\u2019s prior crimes properly was admissible for any of the other purposes identified in the rule, \u201csuch as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>accident.\u201d M. R. Evid. 404(b). Rather, it argues that Rogers did not make a specific objection on 404(b) grounds, that Rogers has not specifically identified which of the prosecutor\u2019s questions were objectionable, and that the evidence was admissible for impeachment because Rogers testified that he had not been in trouble for the last twelve years. Finally, the State argues that any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"Axc\">\u00b634 Initially, we reject the State\u2019s impeachment argument, since Rogers only testified about his prior record after the District Court had ruled that the State could offer that evidence once he raised justifiable use of force. We also disagree with the State that Rogers did not object to the court\u2019s ruling. As soon as he learned that the prosecution would be allowed to introduce his criminal history if he presented a justifiable use of force defense, he protested, stating: \u2018The Court is leaving me no choice-with no defense-is what they\u2019re leaving me.\u201d When the State began to question Rogers about his criminal history, Rogers objected once more, asking the prosecutor: \u2018Do you want to prosecute me on my past, or this charge?\u201d These statements were sufficient to put the State and the court on notice that Rogers was objecting to the introduction of his criminal history and to preserve his objection for appeal. <em>See Pumphrey v. Empire Lath &amp; </em>Plaster, 2006 MT 99, \u00b6 30, 332 Mont. 116, 135 P.3d 797. Likewise, Rogers\u2019s brief on appeal makes clear the basis for his claimed error.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">\u00b635 Neither the District Court in its ruling nor the State, either at trial or on appeal, offered any basis for admissibility of Rogers\u2019s entire violent criminal history once he asked S.M. about her past acts of violence. Our review of the record reveals none. We agree with Rogers that the evidence was not admissible under Rule 404(b) as it was likely to be used to support an inference of character or propensity and was not shown to be admissible for another purpose. <em>See Stewart, </em>\u00b6 61, <em>Derbyshire, </em>\u00b6 55. A cause may not be reversed by reason of any error committed by the trial court, however, \u201cunless the record shows that the error was prejudicial.\u201d Section 46-20-701(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">\u00b636 We have adopted a two-step analysis to determine whether an error \u201cprejudiced the criminal defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial and is therefore reversible.\u201d <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, \u00b6 37, 306 Mont. 215, 32 P.3d 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">\u00b637 The first step in this analysis is determining whether the claimed error is categorized as \u201cstructural error\u201d or \u201ctrial error.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 37. Structural error \u201caffects the framework within which the trial proceeds, rather than simply an error in the trial process itself.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 38 (citation omitted). Structural error is \u2018typically of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>constitutional dimensions, precedes the trial, and undermines the fairness of the entire trial proceeding.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 38. Trial error, on the other hand, \u2018typically occurs during the presentation of a case to the jury.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 40. If an error was structural, it is presumptively prejudicial and we automatically reverse the verdict. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 38, 41. If, however, the error is \u2018the more \u2018typical\u2019 trial error,\u201d we do not automatically reverse the conviction; instead, we proceed to the second step of our analysis-determining whether the error was harmless under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 41. The error Rogers identifies on appeal took place during the presentation of evidence to the jury. As such, it \u201cis amenable to qualitative assessment by a reviewing court for prejudicial impact relative to the other evidence introduced at trial\u201dand is trial error. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 40; <em>Stewart, </em>\u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">\u00b638 When determining whether an error in the admission of evidence was harmless, we apply the \u201ccumulative evidence test.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 43. This test requires a qualitative analysis of the evidence; thus, it \u2018looks not to the quantitative effect of other admissible evidence, but rather to whether the fact-finder was presented with admissible evidence that proved the same facts as the tainted evidence proved.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 43 (emphasis omitted). If there was no other admissible evidence proving the same facts that the tainted evidence proved, the analysis turns on whether the tainted evidence went to the proof of an element of the crime charged or, by contrast, to some fact not involving an element of the crime. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 47. \u201cIf there was no cumulative evidence presented as to a fact proving an element of the crime charged, then the error in admitting the tainted evidence which proved that element cannot be considered harmless, the qualitative assessment is never reached, and the court\u2019s decision will be reversed.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 47. Conversely, \u201c[i]f the evidence in question did not prove an element of the crime, then the State must demonstrate that, qualitatively, there is no reasonable possibility that the tainted evidence might have contributed to the defendant\u2019s conviction.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 47; <em>see also State v. McComber, </em>2007 MT 340, \u00b6 26, 340 Mont. 262, 173 P.3d 690 (citing <em>State v. Peplow, </em>2001 MT 253, \u00b6\u00b6 49, 51, 307 Mont. 172, 36 P.3d 922).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">\u00b639 The State contends, and we agree, that its cross-examination of Rogers about his criminal history \u201cclearly was not for the purpose of proving an element of the offense.\u201d Nonetheless, the State cites to <em>State v. Stewart </em>in support of its position that the erroneous admission of this evidence was qualitatively harmless. There, we applied the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>cumulative evidence test where the prosecution had erred by admitting evidence for the purpose of proving an element of the charged offense, \u201cthat Stewart knowingly had sexual intercourse or sexual contact with [the victim].\u201d <em>Stewart, </em>\u00b6 47. Importantly, we were able to evaluate the tainted evidence against \u201cadmissible evidence that proved the same facts.\u201d <em>Stewart, </em>\u00b6 48. Doing so, we concluded that, qualitatively, \u201cnothing [in the tainted evidence] is any more inflammatory or prejudicial than the other, admissible evidence at trial.\u201d <em>Stewart, </em>\u00b6 50. That is not the situation here. There was no admissible evidence proving Rogers\u2019s entire history of violence; his criminal history was not an admissible fact for the jury\u2019s consideration. For this reason, <em>Stewart </em>is not on point.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">\u00b640 <em>Stewart </em>aside, the State stresses-in support of its argument that there is no reasonable possibility that introducing Rogers\u2019s criminal history may have contributed to his conviction-that it did not introduce Rogers\u2019s criminal history during its case-in-chief, it did not dwell on his criminal history during the cross-examination, and it did not mention his past violent acts in its closing argument. The State also points out that, when the prosecution asked Rogers about his criminal history, it encouraged Rogers to provide \u2018yes\u201d or \u2018ho\u201d answers and that Rogers \u201cchose to portray himself in a negative light to the jury by using offensive language\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and by offering facts that led to some of his past convictions. These observations do not satisfy the State\u2019s burden under <em>Van Kirk.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\u00b641 When discussing how the State might demonstrate that no reasonable possibility exists that the admission of tainted evidence might have contributed to the defendant\u2019s conviction in <em>Van Kirk, </em>we presented two hypothetical scenarios. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 46. In the first scenario, the State offered evidence during a DUI trial that the defendant was a convicted child molester. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 46. On appeal, the State would have to demonstrate that there was no reasonable possibility that introducing this evidence led to the defendant\u2019s conviction, \u201ca virtually impossible burden to carry, given the highly inflammatory nature of child molestation evidence.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 46. Conversely, in the second hypothetical, the State erred by offering evidence that the same defendant previously had declared bankruptcy. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 46. We speculated that, in such a scenario, the State would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>be able to carry its burden because it is unlikely that an allegation of bankruptcy is the sort of defect in character that would lead a jury to believe that the defendant likely committed the charged offense. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">\u00b642 We consistently have applied this framework in subsequent cases. In <em>State v. Derbyshire, </em>the State elicited testimony from its witnesses that they were \u2018probation officers\u201d and that the defendant \u201cwas on probation\u201d when he was arrested. <em>Derbyshire, </em>\u00b6 55. We held that these statements were \u201cnot admissible under Rule 404(b).\u201d <em>Derbyshire, </em>\u00b6 55. The defendant\u2019s status as a probationer was not an element of the charges against him. We concluded that the State failed to satisfy its burden under <em>Van Kirk </em>because \u2018in terms of quality, the tainted evidence here was highly prejudicial\u201d and there was a reasonable possibility that the jury\u2019s knowledge that the defendant had committed past crimes contributed to a guilty verdict. <em>Derbyshire, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 51, 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\u00b643 In <em>State v. Peplow, </em>the district court erred by allowing the State to introduce evidence that the defendant had been driving with a suspended license and had no insurance when he was arrested for driving under the influence. <em>Peplow, </em>\u00b6 48. The tainted evidence suggested that the defendant had been convicted of similar past crimes and did not prove an element of the charged crime. <em>Peplow, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 51, 55. We reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction and remanded the case for a new trial because the State was unable to satisfy its burden under <em>Van Kirk. Peplow, </em>\u00b6 56. Similarly, in <em>State v. Nolan, </em>the district court erred by allowing the State to introduce evidence that the defendant-who had been charged with bail-jumping-had fathered five children with four different women, none of whom he had married; the State also introduced evidence that the defendant had worked as a pimp. <em>State v. Nolan, </em>2003 MT 55, \u00b6\u00b6 19-20, 314 Mont. 371, 66 P.3d 269. We held that this evidence was \u2018highly inflammatory and prejudicial\u201d and that the State had failed to carry its burden pursuant to <em>Van Kirk. Nolan, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 25-26. Consequently, we reversed Nolan\u2019s conviction and remanded the case for a new trial. <em>Nolan, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">\u00b644  In this case, the State introduced \u2018highly inflammatory\u201d evidence that Rogers had a prior rape conviction, which had been reversed on appeal, as well as evidence that he had been convicted of other crimes, in violation of M. R. Evid. 404(b). <em>See Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 46; <em>see also Derbyshire, </em>\u00b6 55. Upon our review of the record, we conclude that there is a reasonable possibility the tainted evidence influenced Rogers\u2019s conviction. The prosecutor questioned Rogers about two serious felony convictions that later were reversed. In the course of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>that questioning, the State informed the jury that Rogers previously had been convicted of rape and felony assault with a weapon, and had gotten both convictions set aside. This invited an opportunity for the jury to make sure Rogers would be punished when it deliberated on crimes charged. The law prohibits the State from introducing evidence of past crimes because doing so denies individuals a fair opportunity to defend against the charged crimes. <em>Gowan, </em>\u00b6 19. In light of the nature of the evidence presented, the error was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">\u00b645  In <em>Van Kirk, </em>we rejected our previous standard that \u201coverwhelming evidence of a defendant\u2019s guilt can render harmless a district court\u2019s error\u201d because it hnvit[es] the State to offer inadmissible yet damaging evidence in a strong case... since the worst that can happen is that the error is noted but deemed harmless.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 33-35. Our review of the record in this case \u201cshows [that] the jury was presented with ample admissible evidence\u201d that Rogers had committed the charged crimes. <em>Peplow, </em>\u00b6 57. Nonetheless, the State\u2019s introduction of Rogers\u2019s criminal history, including convictions overturned by an appellate court for legal error, violated Rogers\u2019 s right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">\u00b646 The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the District Court for a new trial on all charges.</p>\n<judges id=\"b273-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, COTTER, RICE, WHEAT and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b265-9\"> We reversed Rogers\u2019s felony assault with a weapon conviction and remanded the case for a new trial because Rogers \u201cestablished both error and prejudice under the <em>Strickland </em>test for ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>State v.
