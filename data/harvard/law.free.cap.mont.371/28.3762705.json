Adams (Adams) received a suspended sentence for the offense of felony theft in 2007 that was ordered to run consecutively \u201cto Defendant\u2019s revocation\u201d in another proceeding, wherein Adams was serving probation after being transferred from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>juvenile to adult supervision. Adams appeals the denial by the Fourth Judicial District Court, Missoula County, of his motion to dismiss the State\u2019s 2012 petition to revoke his 2007 suspended sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">\u00b62 We address the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court err by denying Adams\u2019 motion to dismiss the State\u2019s petition to revoke?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">\u00b64 In 2005, while Adams was a juvenile, he committed numerous offenses that would have constituted criminal offenses if committed by an adult, including burglaries, thefts, criminal mischief, unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, possession of drug paraphernalia, and obstructing a police officer. These offenses were the subject of multiple delinquency petitions filed in Youth Court by the State and were ultimately adjudicated under cause number DJ 04-88. Judge Harkin found Adams to be a delinquent youth on October 25, 2005, and committed him to the Department of Corrections (DOC) until age 18, with a recommendation for placement at the Pine Hills Youth Correctional Facility (2005 Disposition or D J 04-88). Adams was placed at Pine Hills until he was released to juvenile probation in September 2006. In the two months following his release, Adams committed several probationary violations. On November 28,2006, Judge Harkin ordered a transfer of jurisdiction of Adams\u2019 case to the district court and transfer of supervisory responsibility to adult probation services pursuant to \u00a741-5-208, MCA (2005).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Adams, then age 18, was placed on adult probation supervision until his 21st birthday.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">\u00b65 The same day, November 28,2006, Adams stole a vehicle from the Safeway parking lot in Missoula. Several new DVDs were in the backseat of the car, which Adams sold for cash. Two days later, when the stolen car ran out of gas, Adams stole a second vehicle from a residential area in Missoula. Adams was apprehended and charged by information with one count of felony theft and two counts of misdemeanor theft in cause number DC 06-509, presided over by District Court Judge McLean. The State also filed a petition to revoke Adams\u2019 probation in DJ 04-88 based upon the new charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>\u00b66 Adams and the State entered a plea bargain agreement to resolve the charges. In exchange for Adams\u2019 plea of guilty to felony theft, the State agreed to dismiss the two misdemeanor charges. Pursuant to \u00a7 46-12-211(l)(b), MCA, the plea bargain included the parties\u2019 agreement that a three-year commitment to DOC, all suspended, would be an \u201cappropriate disposition\u201d for the offense. The parties further agreed that this sentence would not commence until Adams discharged his disposition in DJ 04-88 or, in the words of the plea agreement, Ttjhis case shall run consecutive to Defendant\u2019s revocation in DJ-04-88.\u201d In his interview with the author of the presentence investigation report, Adams said, \u20181 believe I should be sentenced to what is recommended in the plea-agreement.\u201d Adams thereafter entered a guilty plea to the felony theft charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">\u00b67 At the sentencing hearing on March 26, 2007, Judge McLean accepted the terms of the plea agreement and committed Adams to the DOC for three years, all suspended, for the felony theft offense (2007 Sentence). Pursuant to the plea bargain agreement, the District Court ordered the 2007 Sentence to run consecutively to the disposition to be imposed in the revocation proceeding pending in DJ 04-88. Consistent with his negotiation of the plea agreement, Adams offered no objection to the sentence, and did not appeal or otherwise challenge the 2007 Sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">\u00b68 On April 10, 2007, Judge Harkin presided over the revocation hearing in DJ 04-88. Judge Harkin revoked the disposition and committed Adams to the DOC until his 21st birthday, with no time suspended. Adams did not object to the commitment and did not appeal. Adams entered the Treasure State Correctional Training Center, or \u2018boot camp,\u201d on August 15, 2007. Adams failed to successfully complete boot camp and he was transferred by the DOC to Montana State Prison on October 5, 2007. Adams remained at the prison until he completed the commitment and was released on his 21st birthday in November 2009 to begin serving his 2007 Sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"AzF\">\u00b69 Adams\u2019 supervision was transferred to Washington state pursuant to the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision to permit Adams to reside there. He violated the terms of his supervision and was returned to Montana for his failure to abide by conditions. In January 2012, less than three years after he discharged his commitment in DJ 04-88, the State filed a petition to revoke Adams\u2019 2007 Sentence. Adams filed a motion to dismiss the petition to revoke, arguing the District Court did not have authority in 2007 to order his adult criminal sentence to run consecutively to the disposition in DJ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>04-88. The District Court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">\u00b610 Adams entered admissions to the petition to revoke, requesting inpatient chemical dependency treatment and reserving his right to appeal. The District Court revoked Adams\u2019 2007 Sentence and committed him to the DOC for three years with credit for 170 days served (2012 Revocation Sentence). Adams appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">\u00b611 \u2018We review a district court\u2019s revocation of a suspended sentence for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Tirey, </em>2010 MT 283, \u00b6 19, 358 Mont. 510, 247 P.3d 701. We review a criminal sentence for legality to determine whether the sentence is within statutory parameters. <em>State v. Seals, </em>2007 MT 71, \u00b6 7, 336 Mont. 416, 156 P.3d 15. Such a determination of legality is a question of law, which is reviewed de novo. <em>Seals, </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">\u00b612 <em>Did the District Court err by denying Adams\u2019 motion to dismiss the State\u2019s petition to revoke?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">\u00b613 Adams argues that an adult sentence cannot be ordered to run consecutively to a juvenile disposition, which is civil in nature. Adams asserts that Tbjecause a youth court\u2019s disposition is not a sentence, it does not fall within the statutory requirement that \u2018 separate sentences for two or more offenses must run consecutively unless the court otherwise orders,\u2019 \u201d citing \u00a7 46-18-401(4), MCA. Adams essentially argues that an adult sentence can never run consecutively to a juvenile disposition and, therefore, as a matter of law, his 2007 Sentence ran concurrently with the 2005 Disposition. Thus, his 2007 Sentence expired prior to the State\u2019s filing of the revocation petition and the petition was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">\u00b614 The State responds that Adams waived his right to challenge his sentence because he affirmatively asked the District Court to impose this sentence and thus acquiesced in it, citing <em>State v. Micklon, </em>2003 MT 45, 314 Mont. 291, 65 P.3d 559, and he also failed to appeal. The State alternatively argues that \u00a746-18-401(l)(b), MCA, \u201coperated as a matter of law to require the suspended sentence in this case to run consecutively to the period still to be served on the probationary term that was imposed as a result of the \u00a7 208 transfer order.\u201d Consequently, the petition to revoke was timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-11\">\u00b615 We must first consider Adams\u2019 ability to challenge his sentence given his failure to appeal its imposition. A defendant has 60 days from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>the entry of the judgment to file an appeal challenging a sentence. M. R. App. P. 4(5)(b)(i).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If a defendant does not appeal, he is generally precluded from later challenging the legality of the sentence. <em>State v. Muhammad, </em>2002 MT 47, \u00b6 22, 309 Mont. 1, 43 P.3d 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">\u00b616 Muhammad was sentenced in May 1999 for sexual intercourse without consent, pursuant to a plea bargain agreement. <em>Muhammad, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 8, 11. He received a six-year deferred imposition of sentence, subject to probationary conditions. He did not appeal. <em>Muhammad, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11, 22. In January 2000, the State filed a petition to revoke Muhammad\u2019s sentence for violating conditions. <em>Muhammad, </em>\u00b6 14. After a hearing, the District Court revoked the sentence and imposed a 20-year commitment to the DOC, with 15 years suspended, and imposed conditions. <em>Muhammad, </em>\u00b6 15. Muhammad then appealed, challenging both his 1999 sentence and his 2000 revocation sentence. <em>Muhammad, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15-16, 23. We held that, because Muhammad had failed to timely appeal from his 1999 sentence, we were \u201cwithout jurisdiction to review\u201d it,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> although we were able to review Muhammad\u2019s timely appeal of his 2000 revocation sentence. <em>Muhammad, </em>\u00b6 22. <em>See also State v. White, </em>2008 MT 464, \u00b6 20, 348 Mont. 196, 199 P.3d 274 (overruled on other grounds) (citing <em>Muhammad, </em>\u00b6 22, \u2018White may not, within the context of the [2007] revocation proceeding, challenge the legality of the conditions imposed on her 1997 suspended sentence, as such a challenge is untimely.\u201d); <em>In re M.W., </em>2012 MT 44, \u00b6 12, 364 Mont. 211, 272 P.3d 112 (citing <em>Muhammad, </em>\u00b6 22, \u2018M.W. did not appeal from the order imposing the registration requirement entered by the Youth Court in July 2009.... the challenge he now attempts to make to the original imposition of the requirement has been forfeited.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\u00b617 As he did in his motion to dismiss before the District Court, Adams is here challenging his 2007 Sentence as illegal, arguing that \u201cthe sentence contained in the [2007] plea agreement was not authorized by law.\u201d However, Adams did not challenge the 2007 Sentence until the State filed a petition to revoke in 2012, and his challenge is untimely. He is now limited to challenging the 2012 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Revocation Sentence. <em>Muhammad, </em>\u00b6 22; <em>White, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">\u00b618 In <em>Seals, </em>we held that a previously imposed illegal sentence may be corrected during a revocation proceeding under certain circumstances. <em>Seals, </em>\u00b6 15. As relevant to this case, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-5\">[A] sentencing court\u2019s authority to re-sentence a criminal defendant based upon an illegal sentence depends upon <em>when </em>the illegal sentence is discovered and challenged. If the illegal sentence is challenged while the defendant is serving the sentence, the court has the authority to correct the sentence by imposing a sentence that was statutorily authorized ... <em>If, however, the illegal sentence is challenged during a revocation proceeding held while the defendant is serving the suspended portion of the illegal sentence, the court, upon sentencing in the revocation proceeding, is constrained by the particulars of \u00a746-18-203(7), MCA.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-6\"><em>Seals, </em>\u00b6 15 (emphasis added). Thus, for a sentencedike Adams\u2019dhat is challenged as illegal while the defendant is serving the suspended portion, the revocation court cannot resentence the defendant under the general sentencing statutes, but is \u201cconstrained by the particulars\u201d of the revocation sentencing provisions when correcting any illegality. <em>Seals, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">\u00b619 Application of these principles demonstrates that Adams\u2019 revocation challenge to the consecutive nature of his 2007 Sentence is unavailing. As we explained in <em>Seals, </em>\u00a7 46-18-401, MCA, which governs the designation of a sentence as consecutive or concurrent, is not part of the revocation sentencing provisions. <em>Seals, </em>\u00b6 15 (\u201c\u00a746-18-401, MCA, is not applicable to the revocation matter before us because sentencing upon the revocation of a suspended or deferred sentence is particularly and expressly governed by \u00a746-18-203, MCA, and not \u00a7 46-18-401, MCA, which is a general provision governing sentencing.\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The general authority to designate a sentence to run concurrently is not within \u201cthe particulars\u201d of the revocation statutes and is not an issue that could be addressed or \u201ccorrected\u201d during the 2012 revocation proceeding. <em>Seals, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">\u00b620 Further, by the time of the 2012 revocation proceeding, Adams\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>2005 Disposition had already been served and discharged, and thus there was no earlier disposition with which the 2012 Revocation Sentence could be coordinated. Adams\u2019 2012 Revocation Sentence does not address the issue of its concurrent or consecutive nature. Because the 2012 Revocation Sentence is the only sentence Adams can now challenge, <em>Muhammad, </em>\u00b6 22, the consecutive designation of the 2007 Sentence is not properly raised here.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">\u00b621  As the State notes, we generally \u201cwill not put a district court in error for an action in which the appealing party acquiesced or actively participated.\u201d <em>Micklon, </em>\u00b6 10 (citations omitted); <em>see also State v. Walker, </em>2007 MT 205, \u00b6 14, 338 Mont. 529, 167 P.3d 879. The wisdom of that principle is well illustrated here. In 2007, after a run of criminal behavior, Adams actively sought and bargained for a probationary sentence that would avoid his commitment to a correctional facility. He asked to be sentenced to, and he received, a probationary sentence that would run consecutively to his 2005 Disposition. Years later, after obtaining the benefit of that bargain, including probation and dismissal of other charges, Adams now seeks to overturn the bargain because he once again faces prison for failing to follow the terms of his probationary sentence. Further, had Adams timely objected to the consecutive nature of the 2007 Sentence, the District Court would have had the opportunity to fashion a sentence to run concurrently with the 2005 Disposition. However, Adams did not raise the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">\u00b622 The District Court properly denied Adams\u2019 motion to dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">\u00b623 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b54-7\">JUSTICES WHEAT, MORRIS, McKINNON and COTTER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b49-9\"> Unless otherwise noted, all references to Titles 45 and 46, Montana Code Annotated, are to the 2005 version.
