We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\u00b62 We restate and consider the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">\u00b63 <em>1. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to the Crystal Bar on the negligence claims?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">\u00b64 <em>2. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to the Crystal Bar on the dram shop claim?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">\u00b65 The facts are presented as developed in discovery. During the late evening and early morning of October 6-7, 2007, Dennis Harrington (Harrington) visited the Crystal Bar in Bozeman with a group of friends. Harrington initiated an abrasive conversation with the front door bouncer Duane Aun\u00e9 (Aune), concerning the qualifications required to be a bouncer. To some extent, this conversation also involved Jason Howard (Howard), who was an acquaintance of Aune\u2019s and employed as a bouncer at another local bar. Harrington used profanities and admits to the potentially offensive nature of this conversation. The exchange between these individuals escalated, bar manager John Saunders (Saunders) was advised, and Harrington was asked to leave the bar multiple times. Harrington then voluntarily left the bar through the open front door, followed by Howard about 15 or 20 seconds later, followed by Saunders closing the door. An altercation ensued, with Howard hitting Harrington on the head and causing him to fall and strike his head on a car parked in front of the Crystal Bar. Harrington sustained a serious head injury, was rendered unconscious, and was hospitalized. Howard initially began to run, but upon seeing his girlfriend, walked with her around the end of the block and reentered the Crystal Bar through the back door. A criminal investigation surrounding this incident was conducted. Further factual assertions are set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">\u00b66 Harrington filed a complaint organized into various sections that set forth overlapping claims of negligence, liquor liability, spoliation of evidence, and punitive damages.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The negligence counts generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>alleged that the Crystal Bar failed to exercise proper care by adequately screening and training employees, promoted \u201cthe risk of conflicfi\u2019between Harrington and Howard, failed to protect Harrington from Howard, and failed to contact law enforcement, damaging Harrington as a result. The liquor liability, or \u201cdram shop\u201d claim, alleged that the Crystal Bar had served alcohol \u201cto visibly intoxicated patrons\u201d on the night of the incident, increasing the risk of physical violence that ultimately caused harm to Harrington.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">\u00b67 The Crystal Bar moved for summary judgment on the negligence and dram shop claims, relying on the deposition testimony of Howard and Saunders. Harrington filed a response in opposition with supporting affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\u00b68 On the negligence claims, the District Court concluded that there were no conflicts in material facts and the Crystal Bar was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The District Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">While Harrington and Howard present differing accounts of what might have been said between them, those statements are not material to disposition of the Motion. Harrington states Ttjhere was no fight between me and Howard\u201d and that he left when asked by Saunders. ... Therefore by Harrington\u2019s own account, there was no interaction between Harrington and Howard that should have alerted or warned the Crystal Bar employees that Howard posed any danger to Harrington.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">On the dram shop claim, the District Court determined it was uncontested that Howard was not intoxicated and had not been served at the Crystal Bar, concluding that the statutory requirements for the claim had not been established and the Crystal Bar was entitled to summary judgment. After receiving confirmation from the parties that all claims had been resolved by its order, the District Court entered final judgment. Harrington appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">\u00b69 A district court\u2019s grant or denial of summary judgment is reviewed de novo. <em>Steadele v. Colony Ins. </em>Co., 2011 MT 208, \u00b6 14, 361 Mont. 459, 260 P.3d 145 (citations omitted). \u201cUnder M. R. Civ. P. 56(c), summary judgment is proper only when no genuine issues of material fact exist and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Steadele, </em>\u00b6 14. The evidence must be analyzed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and all reasonable inferences must be drawn in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Shattuck v. Kalispell Regl. Med. Ctr., </em>2011 MT 229, \u00b6 8, 362 Mont. 100, 261 P.3d 1021 (citation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>omitted). \u2018The party moving for summary judgment has the initial burden of establishing both the absence of genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. If this burden is met, the burden then shifts to the nonmoving party to establish that a genuine issue of material fact does exist. If the district court determines that no genuine issue of material fact exists, the court then determines whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Corporate Air v. Edwards Jet Ctr. Mont. </em>Inc., 2008 MT 283, \u00b6 25, 345 Mont. 336, 190 P.3d 1111 (internal citations omitted). We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law for correctness. <em>Shattuck, </em>\u00b6 8 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">\u00b610 Summary judgment should be granted \u2018if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(3) (2011). \u201cA material fact is a fact that involves the elements of the cause of action or defenses at issue to an extent that necessitates resolution of the issue by a trier of fact.\u201d <em>Corporate Air, </em>\u00b6 24 (citing <em>Arnold v. Yellowstone Mountain Club, LLC, </em>2004 MT 284, \u00b6 15, 323 Mont. 295, 100 P.3d 137). \u201cSummary judgment is an extreme remedy that should never be a substitute for a trial on the merits if a controversy exists over a material fact.\u201d <em>Corporate Air, </em>\u00b6 24 (citing <em>Mary J. Baker Revoc. Trust v. Cenex Harvest, </em>2007 MT 159, \u00b6 17, 338 Mont. 41, 164 P.3d 851). \u2018Ordinarily, questions of negligence are poorly suited to adjudication by summary judgment and are better left for jury determination at trial.\u201d <em>LaTray v. City of Havre, </em>2000 MT 119, \u00b6 15, 299 Mont. 449, 999 P.2d 1010; <em>see also i.e. Scott v. Henrich, </em>1998 MT 118, \u00b6 13, 288 Mont. 489, 958 P.2d 709; <em>Brown v. Demaree, </em>272 Mont. 479, 483, 901 P.2d 567, 570 (1995); <em>Hendrickson v. Neiman, </em>204 Mont. 367, 371, 665 P.2d 219, 222 (1983) (overruled on other grounds). A cause of action in negligence consists of four elements: duty, breach of duty, causation, and damages. <em>Brown, </em>272 Mont. at 482, 901 P.2d at 569, <em>see also Cusenbary v. Mortenson, </em>1999 MT 221, \u00b6 21, 296 Mont. 25, 987 P.2d 351. \u201c[T]he <em>existence </em>of a duty is a question of law for determination by the court, whether that duty has been <em>breached, </em>is a question of fact to be decided by the finder of fact-in this case, the jury.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>272 Mont. at 482, 901 P.2d at 569 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">\u00b611 <em>1. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to the Crystal Bar on the negligence claims?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>\u00b612 Harrington argues that the District Court erred by concluding there were no genuine issues of material fact because the District Court \u2018brakes numerous assertions which are either inaccurate or directly contradicted by evidence in the record.\u201d Harrington asserts there are conflicts within the record regarding the arrival and departure of Howard and Harrington at the Crystal Bar, Harrington\u2019s conversation with Aun\u00e9 and Howard, and the Crystal Bar\u2019s knowledge of the conflict between Harrington and Howard.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In response, the Crystal Bar states that the factual issues raised by Harrington \u201care either speculative or do not involve the elements of the cause of action.\u201dThe Crystal Bar asserts that \u201c[t]he evidence clearly established that the Crystal Bar never had any reason to suspect that Howard posed any danger to others\u201d and \u201c[t]he evidence is undisputed that the fight between Howard and Harrington occurred outside the Bar and that the Bar did not know about the fight until after it was over.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">\u00b613 <em>In Kipp v. Wong, </em>163 Mont. 476, 480-81, 517 P.2d 897, 900 (1974), we held that the proprietor of an establishment that serves alcoholic beverages owes patrons \u201cthe duty of exercising reasonable care to protect them from injury at the hands of a fellow patron, and of seeing to it that a patron is not injured either by those in his employ or by drunken or vicious men whom he may choose to harbor.\u201d <em>Kipp, </em>163 Mont. at 481, 517 P.2d at 900 (citing Nevin <em>v. Carlasco, </em>139 Mont. 512, 514, 365 P.2d 637, 638 (1961)). Continuing to quote from <em>Nevin, </em>the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\">Reviewing leading cases from other jurisdictions, [citing cases], we find the general rule to be that the duty of a tavern keeper to protect a patron from injury by another arises only when one or more of the following circumstances exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">(1) A tavern keeper allowed a person on the premises who has a known propensity for fighting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-7\">(2) The tavern keeper allowed a person to remain on the premises whose conduct had become obstreperous and aggressive to such a degree the tavern keeper knew or ought to have known he endangered others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-8\">(3) The tavern keeper had been warned of danger from an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>obstreperous patron and failed to take suitable measures for the protection of others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-4\">(4) The tavern keeper failed to stop a fight as soon as possible after it started.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-5\">(5) The tavern keeper failed to provide a staff adequate to police the premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-6\">(6) The tavern keeper tolerated disorderly conditions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-7\"><em>Kipp, </em>163 Mont. at 481, 517 P.2d at 900. These circumstances are assessed to determine whether a tavern keeper has breached the duty of reasonable care. <em>See Kipp, </em>163 Mont. at 481-82, 517 P.2d at 900.</p>\n<p id=\"AWM\">\u00b614 <em>CitingKipp, </em>the District Court ruled that the Crystal Bar owed Harrington the duty of reasonable care to protect him from injury at the hands of a fellow patron. However, the court concluded that this duty would not extend to \u201cacts of Howard after the parties left the Crystal Bar,\u201d effectively limiting the duty to the interior of the building. While the care of patrons will normally be exercised within the bar, the <em>Kipp </em>duties are not stated as exclusively attached to the bar\u2019s interior such that closing the bar door upon a potentially violent situation that has moved beyond the threshold cannot implicate the duty of care. Whether the Crystal Bar\u2019s duty was breached under the circumstances surrounding Howard\u2019s striking of Harrington in front of the bar is a question to be resolved by the jury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">\u00b615 Further, after review of the record, we cannot conclude that material facts are not in dispute. Harrington has marshaled evidence that, for purposes of summary judgment, could support a jury\u2019s finding that one or more of the duties in <em>Kipp </em>have been violated, establishing negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">\n<em>a. Conversation among Harrington, Aun\u00e9, and Howard</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AjL\">\u00b616 The District Court stated that \u201c[u]pon entering the Crystal, Harrington was provocative.\u201d However, the complaint states that Harrington \u201cengaged in good natured, but arguably offensive, banter with employees of the Crystal Bar concerning \u2018what qualifications it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>takes to be a bouncer,\u2019 or words to that effect.\u201d In his affidavit, Harrington adds that \u2018I was never at any point aggressive or challenging to any employee of the Crystal Bar.\u201dHoward\u2019s recollection conflicts with Harrington\u2019s:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-4\">[Harrington] walked into the bar and the only reason that I remember him is because he kind of started talking to Duane [Aun\u00e9] and I was there and I heard exactly what was going on. He kind of challenged Duane and asked him if he had to be a tough guy to work there and said if he could -see, I couldn\u2019t tell you exactly what the words that were said, but I know that he was being -he was being provocative and he was being rude and he was challenging Duane, sort of.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Howard also described Harrington as confrontational and responded affirmatively when asked, \u2018fd]o you think he was trying to actually challenge Duane [Aune] to a fight?\u201d Howard added, \u2018Tw'Jell, he had challenged me after he challenged Duane. I kind of butted into the conversation, asked him what his problem was, and then he kind of focussed [sic] on me.\u201d Saunders did not observe this encounter first hand, but offered that he observed Harrington using profanities.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">\n<em>b. The Crystal Bar\u2019s knowledge of the potential conflict</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ag\">\u00b617 The District Court stated that because Harrington\u2019s affidavit indicated that there \u201cwas no fight between me and Howard,\u201d the Crystal Bar was not aware of a conflict between Howard and Harrington. However, Saunders admitted in his deposition that there might be a \u201cpotential situation\u201d and was questioned about it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-7\">[Harrington\u2019s counsel]: [D]id you think there was any confrontation between Mr. Harrington and Mr. Howard in your bar?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-8\">[Saunders]: There had-when [the other bouncer] came up to me, he said that-initially, the first thing he said was that [Harrington] had come and challenged the bouncers and then he had been aggressive or challenged or inappropriate to several customers, and I think he said that [Howard] was one of them. But it was-he had said names, not a name, but he said he was a problem with several people and primarily there was a problem with the bouncer at the front door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-9\">[Harrington\u2019s counsel]: So did he reference Mr. Howard specifically?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-10\">[Saunders]: Yes, I believe he did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">Later, Harrington\u2019s counsel asked \u201c[b]ut you knew before Harrington left the bar that there had been some sort of difficulty between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Harrington and Howard,\u201d to which Saunders replied \u2018Yeah.\u201d The Crystal Bar\u2019s counsel then asked additional questions on this point during cross examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-4\">[Counsel for the Crystal Bar]: When he says, what do I need to do to get your job, beat you up? Is that something that you generally hear from somebody who comes into the Crystal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">[Saunders]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">[Counsel for the Crystal Bar]: Would somebody making that statement to you or one of your bouncers cause you concern?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">[Saunders]: Certainly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-8\">[Counsel for the Crystal Bar]: And he was intoxicated?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-9\">[Saunders]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-10\">[Counsel for the Crystal Bar]: You have been trained to diffuse situations and see problems brewing before they ever start.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-11\">[Saunders]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-12\">[Counsel for the Crystal Bar]: Would that be a clear indication of a problem for you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-13\">[Saunders]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-14\">c. <em>Harrington\u2019s and Howard\u2019s departure from the bar</em></p>\n<p id=\"A4W\">\u00b618 Saunders testified that he asked Harrington to leave the bar, and after being asked several times, Harrington left voluntarily through the bar\u2019s open door. Howard followed Harrington out 15 to 20 seconds later, as estimated by Saunders. Saunders testified after \u201cwatching [Howard] walk out to the right of the door and Mr. Harrington walk out to the left of the door,\u201d that he \u201cclosed the door,\u201d adding T remember saying to the bouncer, You know, hey, look, make sure something, you know, that\u2019s okay/okay, all right.\u201d In response to Harrington\u2019s counsel\u2019s question, \u2018Ts]o you thought there might be a potential situation between the two of them as they were leaving the bar,\u201d Saunders responded, \u2018[a]fter I saw them depart different ways, I did not.\u201dHowever, Harrington\u2019s affidavit states that, upon exitingthe Crystal Bar, \u2018Howard [took] a slight step to the right and then turn[ed] 180 degrees and come right after me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-15\">\u00b619 The District Court\u2019s statement that the Crystal Bar was not aware of the friction between Harrington and Howard seems at least partially inconsistent with its statement that \u2018Saunders had been advised Harrington was a problem and Saunders witnessed him being disrespectful to the staff and saying profanities.\u201d It is also directly contrary to Saunders\u2019 deposition, in which Saunders acknowledged he suspected there was a problem between Harrington and Howard, at least before seeing them leave in opposite directions. Even then, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Saunders told a bouncer to \u201cmake sure ... that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">\u00b620 Analyzing the evidence in the light most favorable to Harrington, <em>Shattuck, </em>\u00b6 8, we believe there are genuine issues as to material facts about which reasonable minds could differ. According to Harrington, he and Howard did not actually leave in opposite directions-Howard made only a \u201cslight step\u201d in the opposite direction, and \u201cturn[ed] 180 degrees and come right after me.\u201d And despite Saunders\u2019 request to a bouncer, no one apparently acted to \u2018brake sure ... that\u2019s okay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">\u00b621  The record ultimately contains conflicting accounts regarding the events leading up to the assault and whether the Crystal Bar had knowledge of the conflict between Harrington and Howard. Whether the Crystal Bar satisfied its duty of reasonable care under the circumstances should be resolved by a jury that is presented this evidence at trial. The Crystal Bar did not establish there were no genuine issues of material fact, <em>Corporate Air, </em>\u00b6 25, and the District Court erred in granting the motion for summary judgment on Harrington\u2019s negligence claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">\u00b622 <em>2. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to the Crystal Bar on the dram shop </em>claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">\u00b623 Harrington\u2019s arguments that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment on his dram shop claim parallel his negligence arguments. He argues there are genuine issues of material fact regarding how much Howard had to drink and whether the Crystal Bar served Howard. The Crystal Bar responds that the District Court correctly granted summary judgment because it is uncontested that Howard was of legal drinking age, was not visibly intoxicated, and was not served at the Crystal Bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">\u00b624 Section 27-1-710, MCA, commonly referred to as Montana\u2019s Dram Shop Act, sets \u201cstatutory criteria governing the liability of a person or entity that furnishes an alcoholic beverage for injury or damage arising from an event involving the person who consumed the beverage.\u201d Section 27-1-710(1), MCA; <em>see also Rohlfs v. Klemenhagen, LLC, </em>2009 MT 440, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 25, 354 Mont. 133, 227 P.3d 42. The Act reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-9\">(3) Furnishing a person with an alcoholic beverage is not a cause of, or grounds for finding the furnishing person or entity liable for, injury or damage wholly or partly arising from an event involving the person who consumed the beverage unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-10\">(a) the consumer was under the legal drinking age and the furnishing person knew that the consumer was underage or did not make a reasonable attempt to determine the consumer\u2019s age;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>(b) the consumer was visibly intoxicated; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-4\">(c) the furnishing person forced or coerced the consumption or told the consumer that the beverage contained no alcohol.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Section 27-1-710(3), MCA. As we have stated, \u201ca tavern owner is liable for foreseeable injury-producing accidents of a patron if the tavern owner provided alcohol to a \u2018visibly intoxicated\u2019 patron.\u201d <em>Cusenbary, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">\u00b625 However, there is no evidence that Howard was served alcohol by the Crystal Bar prior to the altercation. Saunders\u2019 deposition affirmatively states that Howard had not been served alcohol at that point. Howard testified at one point in his deposition that he \u2018hadn\u2019t even got [sic] a drink there when this whole thing happened,\u201d but later stated that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t be positive\u201d if he had gotten a drink at the Crystal Bar. Howard\u2019s uncertain memory cannot affirmatively establish the point. <em>See Weaver v. Advanced Refrigeration, </em>2011 MT 174, \u00b6 13, 361 Mont. 233, 257 P.3d 378 (internal citation omitted) (\u2018To raise a genuine issue of material fact, the proffered evidence must be \u2018material and of a substantial nature, not fanciful, frivolous, gauzy or merely suspicious.\u2019 \u201d). The record contains no affirmative statements that Howard was served by the Crystal Bar prior to the altercation. Even analyzing the evidence in a light most favorable to Harrington, the Crystal Bar has demonstrated \u201cthe absence of genuine issues of material fact\u201d on a key point-Howard had not been served. <em>Corporate Air, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">\u00b626  The District Court correctly granted summary judgment to the Crystal Bar on Harrington\u2019s dram shop claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">\u00b627 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded to the District Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b194-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, McKINNON and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b186-11\"> Harrington also sought declaratory judgment regarding insurance coverage in a claim against Capital Insurance Companies.

Thus, to the extent that Harrington intended to state such a claim, it is not properly raised.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b190-10\"> \u201c[Jjudges sometimes say that as danger increases, so does the duty. But judges do not mean by this that a duty of reasonable care suddenly becomes a duty of excessive care. Instead, they are using \u2018duty\u2019 in the sense of specific conduct and mean only that the duty remains the same-reasonable care under the circumstances-while circumstances of special danger show that reasonable care may be deemed by the trier of fact to require more precautions. In many such cases the words may be the words of duty, but the process of good decisionmaking requires a determination about what counts as ordinary care under the eircumstances-fehe question of breach, not duty.\u201dDan B.
