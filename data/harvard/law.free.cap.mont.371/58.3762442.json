We affirm. On appeal, we consider whether the District Court erred when it upheld the denial of Case\u2019s motion to dismiss the charges against him for lack of speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b79-10\">\u00b62 Upon responding to a domestic assault call on the evening of July 23, 2011, Ravalli County Sheriff s deputies found Case\u2019s wife, Sherri, waiting outside of the couple\u2019s home. Sherri told the deputies that she and Case began arguing after she returned home and found her belongings dumped on their living room floor. When Sherri walked into their kitchen during the argument, Case shoved her in the chest and knocked her into the edge of a kitchen counter, injuring her.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">\u00b63 Two days later, the State charged Case with Partner or Family Member Assault (PFMA) in violation of \u00a745-5-206(3)(iv), MCA. The State alleged that, because Case had twice been convicted of PFMA, the pending charge against Case was a felony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On August 18, 2011, Case appeared before the District Court and entered a not guilty plea. Then, on October 26, 2011, the District Court dismissed the felony charge after the State conceded that one of Case\u2019s prior PFMA charges had been dismissed. Later that day, the State filed with the Ravalli County Justice Court a misdemeanor PFMA charge against Case.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>\u00b64 On November 15, 2011, Case appeared before the Justice Court and pled not guilty to the misdemeanor charge. The court set a trial date for May 5,2012. Case filed a motion to dismiss on March 23,2012 for failure to provide a speedy trial. He alleged that the State had failed to bring his case to trial within six months of his initial plea on the dismissed felony PFMA charge, as required by \u00a7 46-13-401(2), MCA. After the Justice Court denied his motion to dismiss, Case pled guilty to the reduced charge of disorderly conduct, a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a745-8-101(l)(a), MCA. Case reserved the right to appeal the denial of his motion to dismiss to the District Court. The District Court affirmed the denial of Case\u2019s motion to dismiss on July 26,2012. Case appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">\u00b65 \u2018When a district court acts in an appellate capacity, we review to determine whether the district court reached the correct conclusions under the appropriate standards of review.\u201d <em>State v. Finley, </em>2011 MT 89, \u00b6 17, 360 Mont. 173, 252 P.3d 199. We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial \u201cto determine whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact were clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>State v. Steigelman, </em>2013 MT 153, \u00b6 10, 370 Mont. 352, 302 P.3d 396 (citing <em>State v. Ariegwe, </em>2007 MT 204, \u00b6 119, 338 Mont. 442, 167 P.3d 815). Whether a misdemeanor charge must be dismissed under the speedy trial statute requires an interpretation and application of \u00a746-13-401(2), MCA, a question of law reviewed for correctness. <em>Martz, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">\n<em>Whether the District Court erred when it upheld the Justice Court\u2019s rejection of Case\u2019s speedy trial claim.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">\u00b66 A criminal defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial is guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and by Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution. <em>Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 20. In felony cases, we apply a four-part balancing test to determine whether a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a speedy trial has been violated. <em>See Ariegwe, </em>\u00b6 113. We do not apply this balancing test to misdemeanors, however, because Montana\u2019s statutory speedy-trial protections regarding misdemeanors are \u201cmore strict than [our] constitutional analysis[.]\u201d <em>State v. Ronnigen, </em>213 Mont. 358, 362, 691 P.2d 1348, 1350 (1984); <em>see also State v. Belgarde, </em>244 Mont. 500, 507, 798 P.2d 539, 544 (1990). The Legislature has directed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>After the entry of a plea upon a misdemeanor charge, the court, unless good cause to the contrary is shown, shall order the prosecution to be dismissed, with prejudice, if a defendant whose trial has not been postponed upon the defendant's motion is not brought to trial within 6 months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">Section 46-13-401(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">\u00b67 The District Court concluded that Case had a right to be brought to trial \u201cwithin 6 months after he first entered a not guilty plea to the misdemeanor PFMA\u201dcharge, which \u201coccurred on November 15,2011.\u201d The court determined that the filing of the felony PFMA charge and the subsequent filing of the misdemeanor PFMA charge were \u201cdistinct and unrelated event[s].\u201d It therefore concluded that \u201cthe timing of Case\u2019s entry of a not guilty plea to the felony charge filed in the District Court appears to be irrelevant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">\u00b68 Before the District Court, the parties agreed that Case pled not guilty to a felony PFMA charge on August 18, 2011. On appeal, Case contends that although \u201cthe charge was a felony on paper,\u201d it actually was a \u201cmisdemeanor under the law and therefore a misdemeanor for purposes of the speedy trial statute\u201d because he had been convicted of PFMA only once prior. Consequently, he argues that the State was required to try him within six months of August 18,2011. He proposes a logical corollary\u201d to our reasoning in <em>State v. </em>Martz: that \u00a746-13-401(2), MCA, \u201capplies to a charge if the charge could result only in a misdemeanor conviction, even if the State labeled the charge a felony.\u201d \u00b69 The State points out that it requested the District Court to dismiss Case\u2019s felony charge promptly upon learning that Case only had one prior PFMA conviction. The State then filed a new misdemeanor PFMA charge with the Justice Court. The State argues that after the District Court dismissed the felony charge against Case, the filing of a new misdemeanor charge began Case\u2019s prosecution and started his \u201cspeedy trial clock ... anew[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">\u00b610 Case\u2019s reliance on <em>Martz </em>is misplaced. The \u201csomewhat bizarre circumstances\u201din that case <em>(Martz, </em>\u00b6 37) resulted in the defendant\u2019s \u2018fourth\u201d PFMA charge proceeding to trial prior to trial on or conviction of his \u201csecond\u201d and \u201cthird\u201dPFMA offenses. <em>Martz, </em>\u00b6 6. We held that the speedy trial statute could have applied because Martz was charged \u201cwith an offense that had the potential, depending on the outcome of the [second] trial,\u201d of being reduced to a misdemeanor. <em>Martz, </em>\u00b6 39. That is far from the factual scenario Case presents on appeal here. \u00b611 We agree with the State that our holding in <em>State v. Topp, </em>2003 MT 209, 317 Mont. 59, 75 P.3d 330, instead disposes of Case\u2019s appeal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>In <em>Topp, </em>the defendant was charged with two misdemeanor offenses and later pled not guilty to both of them injustice court. <em>Topp, </em>\u00b6 3. The prosecution later moved to dismiss the charges \u2018because it intended to file charges in the District Court\u201d; the justice court granted the motion. <em>Topp, </em>\u00b6 3. The State then charged Topp with a felony, as well as the two previously-dismissed misdemeanor charges, in district court. <em>Topp, </em>\u00b6 4. Topp pled not guilty on all counts before the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">\u00b612 On appeal, Topp argued that his motion to dismiss the misdemeanor charges filed against him in the district court should have been granted because he had not been tried within six months of pleading not guilty to the misdemeanors injustice court, as he argued was required by \u00a746-13-401(2), MCA. <em>Topp, </em>\u00b6 10. We rejected that argument as being \u201ctotally without merit\u201d because the misdemeanors charged in the justice court had been dismissed. <em>Topp, </em>\u00b6 10. We reasoned that, because no charges were pending against Topp after the misdemeanor charges were dismissed in the justice court and before they were re-filed in district court, \u201cno speedy trial \u2018clock\u2019 was running\u201d during that time. <em>Topp, </em>\u00b6 10. We held that the filing of new charges constituted the beginning of \u201can entirely new matter, in essence a case <em>de novo, </em>in the District Court\u201d and thus concluded that the district court did not err when it denied Topp\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial. <em>Topp, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">\u00b613  The facts of this case present the other side of the <em>Topp </em>coin-the charges against Case were dismissed by the District Court and re-filed in Justice Court-and the principles underlying <em>Topp </em>are \u201cequally applicable here.\u201d <em>Topp, </em>\u00b6 20. When the District Court dismissed Case\u2019s felony PFMA charge, there were no charges pending against Case and thus, no speedy trial clock was running. <em>See Topp, </em>\u00b6 10. Then, when the State filed a new misdemeanor PFMA charge against Case in the Justice Court, it marked the beginning of a new criminal proceeding and the beginning of a new \u201cspeedy trial clock\u201d for that charge. <em>Topp, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">\u00b614  The District Court correctly concluded that, under the circumstances of this case, Case\u2019s not guilty plea to the felony PFMA charge, which the court subsequently dismissed, was \u201cirrelevant\u201d in determining whether Case\u2019s right to a speedy trial had been violated. Pursuant to the plain language of \u00a746-13-401(2), MCA, the State was required to bring Case to trial within six months after he entered a plea to the misdemeanor PFMA charge. Case entered a not guilty plea to that charge on November 15, 2011. The District Court correctly concluded that Case\u2019s right to a speedy trial had not been violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>when he filed his motion to dismiss less than six months after pleading not guilty to the misdemeanor PFMA charge. The court properly upheld the Justice Court\u2019s denial of Case\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">\u00b615 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b83-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES MORRIS, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b79-12\"> Under Montana law, a \u201cfirst or second conviction of PFMA is considered a misdemeanor, while a third or subsequent conviction is considered a felony.\u201d <em>State v.
