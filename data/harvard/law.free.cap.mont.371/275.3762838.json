We grant the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">\u00b62 The underlying action is a dispute regarding the administration of the estate of Jeremiah Bennett (Jeremiah). Jeremiah died as a result of injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident on September 8, 2012. Jeremiah is survived by two minor children he had with his former wife, Sabrina Bennett (Sabrina), and his parents, Abel Robert Bennett and Judy Bennett (Bennetts). Sabrina is the court-appointed guardian and conservator for the two minor children. Jeremiah\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, Christina Jackson, was also killed in the accident, and his two minor children suffered serious injuries. Jeremiah died intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">\u00b63 The District Court informally appointed Abel Robert Bennett (Abel Robert) personal representative of the Estate of Jeremiah Bennett (Estate) on October 19,2012. On November 14,2012, Sabrina petitioned the District Court to remove Abel Robert and appoint her as personal representative. After hearing, the District Court granted Sabrina\u2019s requests. The District Court\u2019s granting of Sabrina\u2019s petition for formal probate and for removal of Abel Robert as personal representative was the subject of an interlocutory appeal. <em>In re the Estate of Bennett, </em>2013 MT 228, 371 Mont. 270, 312 P.3d 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">\u00b64 On March 4, 2013, Sabrina petitioned the District Court for a declaration that the Bennetts had no standing to claim wrongful death damages as a result of Jeremiah\u2019s death. The same day, Bennetts filed a motion to intervene, arguing that their wrongful death claims were not being recognized or pursued by Sabrina in her role as personal representative. Bennetts conceded that they did not have a viable claim for loss of consortium under this Court\u2019s precedent, <em>see Hern v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Ill., </em>2005 MT 301, \u00b6 58, 329 Mont. 347, 125 P.3d 597, but maintained they could claim damages for grief, sorrow, and mental anguish that Sabrina, as personal representative of Jeremiah\u2019s estate, had a fiduciary duty to advance on their behalf. After a hearing, the District Court entered its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order on April 18, 2013 (Order), holding that \u201cthe minor children of the decedent are the sole heirs of the estate under the laws of intestate succession and therefore have priority over any wrongful death and survivorship claims.\u201d The Order continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-7\">... [T]he Court does not accept Abel Robert and Judy\u2019s argument that because the parents in <em>Hern </em>recovered grief, sorrow and mental anguish, through the personal representative, that Abel Robert and Judy may also personally recover those damages. Becky Hern\u2019s parents were her \u2018heirs.\u201d In this case, Jeremiah\u2019s [minor children] are his only heirs under the Montana laws in intestate succession and therefore have the exclusive right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>recover wrongful death damages for grief, sorrow and mental anguish.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-4\">That because Abel Robert and Judy are neither intestate heirs nor statutory heirs ... any claims to wrongful death damages for grief, sorrow and mental anguish are subordinate to those of decedent\u2019s minor children. They lack standing to participate, object or intervene in any estate proceedings or wrongful death claims arising out of Jeremiah\u2019s death.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The Order granted Sabrina\u2019s petition for declaratory relief, and denied Bennetts\u2019 motion to intervene, concluding \u201c[Bennetts] are not entitled to wrongful death benefits arising out of Jeremiah\u2019s death as they concede they lack the relationship requirement for loss of consortium and they are not entitled to grief, sorrow, and mental anguish benefits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">\u00b65 Bennetts petitioned this Court for supervisory control, and we ordered that a response be filed by Sabrina and, if it desired, the District Court. Sabrina has filed a response. On Bennetts\u2019 motion, we imposed a stay preventing Sabrina from releasing any of Bennetts\u2019 claims and from entering agreements for allocation of insurance proceeds, until the matters pending before this Court were resolved. \u00b66 The subject of this petition is whether the District Court erred as a matter of law by concluding the Bennetts are not entitled to claim wrongful death damages for grief, sorrow, and mental anguish under \u00a727-1-513, MCA, for the death of Jeremiah, their adult child.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">\u00b67 This Court \u2018has general supervisory control over all other courts.\u201d Mont. Const, art. VII, \u00a72(2). \u2018Supervisory control is an extraordinary remedy, reserved for extraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>Stokes v. Mont. Thirteenth Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>2011 MT 182, \u00b6 5, 361 Mont. 279, 259 P.3d 754 <em>(citing Hegwood v. Mont. Fourth Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>2003 MT 200, \u00b6 6, 317 Mont. 30, 75 P.3d 308). Acceptance of supervisory control is decided on a case-by-case basis and is \u2018limited to cases involving purely legal questions, in which the district court is proceeding under a mistake of law causing a gross injustice or constitutional issues of statewide importance are involved.\u201d <em>Stokes, </em>\u00b6 5 (citing M. R. App. P. 14(3)). We may assume supervisory control to direct the course of litigation if the district court \u2018Is proceeding based on a mistake of law, which if uncorrected, would cause significant injustice for which appeal is an inadequate remedy.\u201d <em>Stokes, </em>\u00b6 5 (citing <em>Simms v. Mont. Eighteenth Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>2003 MT 89, \u00b6 18, 315 Mont. 135, 68 P.3d 678).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>\u00b68 We conclude that the circumstances warrant exercise of supervisory control. Bennetts may not initiate an interlocutory appeal from the denial of their motion to intervene. M. R. App. P. 6; <em>Continental Ins. Co. v. Bottomly, </em>233 Mont. 277, 279, 760 P.2d 73, 75 (1988) (citing former M. R. App. P. 1). An appeal from a final judgment could potentially invalidate a complex settlement now being negotiated among multiple claimants and insurers, a process from which Bennetts have been excluded. Bennetts present a purely legal question: whether the District Court erred by concluding the Bennetts may not receive wrongful death damages for grief, sorrow, and mental anguish as a matter of law under \u00a727-1-513, MCA, for the death of their adult son. We have determined that clarification is necessary regarding who is entitled to claim wrongful death damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">\u00b69 Bennetts argue that Montana law recognizes a claim for grief, sorrow, and mental anguish by parents for the wrongful death of an adult child because there is no requirement that a claimant for wrongful death damages be a probate heir or \u2018heir in law.\u201d Sabrina responds that Bennetts are not \u2018heirs\u201d as defined by the intestacy statutes, that Jeremiah\u2019s minor children are the only such heirs, and that allowing Bennetts to claim wrongful death damages contradicts Montana law, citing <em>Hern, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 46, 47, 62. We begin with a general review of wrongful death actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">\u00b610 In an action for wrongful death under \u00a727-1-513, MCA, \u201cdamages may be given as under all the circumstances of the case may be just.\u201d Section 27-1-323, MCA. \u201cWhen injuries to and the death of one person are caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another, the personal representative of the decedent\u2019s estate may maintain an action for damages against the person causing the death ...\u201d Section 27-1-513, MCA. Montana\u2019s wrongful death statute is considered a \u201cgeneral loss\u201d statute. <em>See </em>James L. Isham, <em>Recovery of Damages for Grief or Mental Anguish Resulting from Death of Child-Modern Cases, </em>45 A.L.R.4th 234, 241 (1986) (explaining the three major categories of statutory damages for wrongful death: \u201call-inclusive,\u201d which specifically enumerates the types of available wrongful death damages; \u201cgeneral loss,\u201d which provides for awards of \u201csuch damages that are just\u201d; and \u201cpecuniary loss,\u201d which limits recovery to economic losses of beneficiaries).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">\u00b611 Some jurisdictions statutorily identify the particular survivors who may recover under the wrongful death statutes and further classify available benefits to each class of survivor. <em>See </em>Jacob A. Stein, <em>Stein on Personal Injury Damages </em>\u00a7\u00a73:2-3:3 (Gerald W. Boston, ed., 3d ed., West 1997) (citing statutes and cases). Montana does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>statutorily define wrongful death claimants, but through the common law has identified survivors who may claim wrongful death damages, as well as the parameters of recovery. <em>See i.e. Batchoff v. Butte Pacific Copper Co., </em>60 Mont. 179, 198 P. 132 (1921); <em>State ex rel. Carroll v. First Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>139 Mont. 367, 364 P.2d 739 (1961); <em>Swanson v. Champion Intl. Corp., </em>197 Mont. 509, 646 P.2d 1166 (1982); <em>Dawson v. Hill &amp; Hill Truck Lines, </em>206 Mont. 325; 671 P.2d 589 (1983); <em>Johnson v. Marias River Elec. Coop., Inc., </em>211 Mont. 518, 687 P.2d 668 (1984); <em>Renville v. Fredrickson, </em>2004 MT 324, 324 Mont. 86, 101 P.3d 773; and <em>Hern v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Ill., </em>2005 MT 301, 329 Mont. 347, 125 P.3d 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">\u00b6 12 In <em>Swanson, </em>this Court distinguished wrongful death and survival actions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We explained that a survival action is personal to the decedent for damages suffered by the decedent between the wrongful act and his death. Any recovery for such damage belongs to the decedent\u2019s estate and is administered as an estate asset. <em>Swanson, </em>197 Mont. at 515-16, 646 P.2d at 1169. In contrast, a wrongful death action seeks damages that \u201cpertain to the <em>personal </em>loss of the <em>survivors.\u201d Swanson, </em>197 Mont. at 517, 646 P.2d at 1170 (emphasis in original). We explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-5\">Such damages do not belong to the decedent\u2019s estate. They are not subject to the claims of decedent\u2019s creditors. They are not part of the estate for the determination of inheritance taxes ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">... The distribution of the [wrongful death] damages to the heirs is not controlled by the decedent\u2019s will or by the laws of intestate succession.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-7\"><em>Swanson, </em>197 Mont. at 517-18, 646 P.2d at 1170-71. Although occasionally using the term \u2018heirs\u201d in <em>Swanson, </em>it is clear from the context of the entire discussion that we were not limiting those \u201csurvivors\u201d who could bring a wrongful death claim to only intestate heirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">\u00b613 Several decisions prior to <em>Hern </em>addressed the issue of which survivors were permitted to claim wrongful death damages. In <em>Carroll, </em>the decedent\u2019s widow and his four children, three of which were from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>a previous marriage, were allowed to pursue wrongful death damages. <em>Carroll, </em>139 Mont. at 372, 364 P.2d at 741-42. In <em>Versland v. Caron Transport, </em>206 Mont. 313, 671 P.2d 583 (1983), the nonadopted minor stepchildren of the decedent were not permitted to claim loss of consortium and support. <em>Versland, </em>206 Mont. at 324, 671 P.2d at 589. In so concluding, we noted that \u201cnonadopted stepchildren of a decedent are not heirs as defined by the intestacy statutes.\u201d <em>Versland, </em>206 Mont. at 323, 671 P.2d at 588. In <em>Johnson, </em>we again recognized that the minor children of the decedent and the decedent\u2019s surviving spouse were all \u201cproper parties\u201d in the wrongful death action. <em>Johnson, </em>211 Mont. at 525, 687 P.2d at 671. In <em>Dawson, </em>we held that wrongful death damages, including sorrow, mental distress, or grief, could be recovered by parents of deceased minor children. <em>Dawson, </em>206 Mont. at 333, 671 P.2d at 594. In <em>Bear Medicine v. U.S., </em>192 F. Supp. 2d 1053, 1070 (D. Mont. 2002), the U.S. District Court concluded that parents could recover wrongful death damages for the death of their adult son, in addition to the decedent\u2019s spouse and children.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">\u00b614 In 1987, the Montana Legislature enacted legislation requiring survival actions under \u00a727-1-501, MCA, and wrongful death actions under \u00a727-1-513, MCA, to be \u201ccombined in one legal action, and any element of damages may be recovered only once.\u201d Section 27-1-501, MCA. We addressed this statutory \u201cone action rule\u201d in <em>Renville, </em>wherein the adult decedent\u2019s personal representative filed and settled a wrongful death action but did not advance a claim on behalf of the decedent\u2019s mother. <em>Renville, </em>\u00b6 22. The decedent\u2019s mother attempted to bring a subsequent wrongful death action, seeking damages for negligent infliction of emotional distress and loss of consortium. <em>Renville, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-17. We affirmed the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, stating Tajllowing a separate loss of consortium action by someone other than a personal representative would create a multiplicity of lawsuits arising from the same wrongful death. Such multiple actions are in contravention of legislative intent.\u201d <em>Renville, </em>\u00b6 24. We also noted that, because the mother was not Sorenson\u2019s heir, she lacked standing to bring a wrongful death claim for her adult son\u2019s death. <em>Renville, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">\u00b615 The common law developed further in <em>Hern, </em>where this Court recognized that parents of an adult decedent may recover wrongful death damages for loss of consortium when there was \u201csignificant evidence of an extraordinarily close and interdependent relationship,\u201d adopting the test applied in <em>Bear Medicine. Hern, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 58, 68. Although not expressly discussed, our decision in <em>Hern </em>also implicitly approved of recovery of wrongful death damages for grief, sorrow, and mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>anguish by parents of a deceased adult child. Ardell Hern, the mother of adult decedent Becky Hern, brought a wrongful death claim as the personal representative of Becky\u2019s estate, on behalf of Becky\u2019s survivors. <em>Hern, </em>\u00b6 9. Becky\u2019s father, Robert, also submitted his own claim and was listed separately on the special verdict form. <em>Hern, </em>\u00b6 15. The jury awarded $300,000 to Ardell for loss of consortium, $200,000 to Robert for loss of consortium, $450,000 to Ardell for grief, sorrow, and mental anguish, and $300,000 to Robert for grief, sorrow, and mental anguish. <em>Hern, </em>\u00b6 15. We vacated Robert\u2019s awards for loss of consortium and for grief, sorrow, and mental anguish because it was impermissible for him to be awarded personal damages separate from those claimed by the personal representative. <em>Hern, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 47, 64-65.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We concluded that the wrongful death claims brought by Ardell, as personal representative of Becky\u2019s estate, were proper <em>.Hern, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 48-62. The loss of consortium award to Ardell was vacated because we concluded that evidence of the relationship between Becky and her parents did not satisfy the \u2018high level of proof\u2019 that there was \u201csignificant evidence of an extraordinarily close and interdependent relationship.\u201d <em>Hem, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 58, 61. However, we upheld Ardell\u2019s $450,000 award for grief, sorrow, and mental anguish, reasoning that Ta]s personal representative of Becky* s estate, Ardell was entitled to pursue such damages on behalf of herself and Becky\u2019s heirs.\u201d <em>Hern, </em>\u00b6 62. Pursuant to our precedent, this award was not Ardell\u2019s personal award, but was to be allocated by the trial court among Becky\u2019s survivors. <em>See Swanson, </em>197 Mont. at 517-18, 646 P.2d at 1170 (\u201cany recovery made by the personal representative in the wrongful death claim is not in his capacity as personal representative. He is a <em>trustee </em>of the moneys for the person entitled.\u201d(Emphasis in original.)); <em>see also Renville, </em>\u00b6 21 (\u2018The personal representative holds the proceeds of any damage award for the heirs of the decedent and the award does not become part of the decedent\u2019s estate.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">\u00b616 In 2009, the United States District Court for the District of Montana reviewed our precedent in deciding <em>Adams v. U.S., </em>669 F. Supp. 2d 1203 (D. Mont. 2009). In <em>Adams, </em>the decedent, Jay Allen, was survived by his spouse, Kathleen Adams, three children, his parents, and several siblings. Kathleen was named the personal representative and brought a survival claim and wrongful death claims on behalf of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>herself and Jay\u2019s children, parents, and siblings for loss of consortium. <em>Adams, </em>669 F. Supp. 2d at 1205-06. The defendant moved for partial summary judgment and dismissal of the loss of consortium claims of Jay\u2019s parents and siblings, because Tajpplying intestacy statutes to determine Jay\u2019s \u2018heirs\u2019, Jay\u2019s surviving spouse Kathleen should receive the entire estate.\u201d <em>Adams, </em>669 F. Supp. 2d at 1208 n. 1. In denying this argument, the U.S. District Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-4\">[T]he [defendant] contends, because Kathleen would receive all proceeds from the wrongful death claim, Jay\u2019s parents and siblings may not recover any damages in this action. While the [defendant] correctly identified Jay Allen\u2019s intestate heirs, these statutes would apply, if at all, to survival damages awarded to Jay\u2019s estate. In light of the Montana Supreme Court\u2019s recognition that parents may be compensated for loss of consortium of their adult children, <em>the intestacy laws seem inapplicable to this motion. Wrongful death claims belong to the survivors while survival claims belong to the estate.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-5\"><em>Adams, </em>669 F. Supp. 2d at 1208 n. 1 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ajd\">\u00b617  We conclude that the U.S. District Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Adams </em>is appropriate. As Jeremiah\u2019s personal representative, Sabrina is advancing claims for survival damages and wrongful death damages. Under the survival claim, Jeremiah\u2019s minor children are his only intestate heirs and they will receive any survival damages that are recovered, upon administration of the Estate. However, wrongful death damages are personal to the survivors. Such damages, when recovered, are paid without regard to the intestate succession statutes, and are not controlled by the intestate succession statutes. <em>Swanson, </em>197 Mont. at 518, 646 P.2d at 1171. There is no statutory prohibition of parental claims. We have approved wrongful death claims by survivors other than the decedent\u2019s intestate heirs. See <em>Johnson, </em>211 Mont. at 525, 687 P.2d at 671; \u00a772-2-202, MCA (1981). In <em>Hern, </em>our analysis did not limit loss of consortium claims for deceased adult children to parents who were intestate heirs. We implicitly approved in <em>Hern </em>parental recovery of damages for grief, sorrow, and mental anguish.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>\u00b618  Therefore, we conclude that Bennetts, as Jeremiah\u2019s parents, are entitled to recover wrongful death damages, including damages for grief, sorrow, and mental anguish. Such damages are personal to them as Jeremiah\u2019s parents and survivors, but would be pursued by the personal representative of the Estate on the Bennetts\u2019 behalf in one action, along with all other claims. Section 27-1-501, MCA; <em>Renville, </em>\u00b6 24. If the action proceeds to trial, and damages are awarded, the District Court will apportion the wrongful death damages among the claimants. <em>Swanson, </em>197 Mont. at 518, 646 P.2d at 1171 (\u2018When a wrongful death action is prosecuted, the damages are returned by general verdict, covering all the heirs involved. The jury is not given the duty of ascribing so much to one heir and so much to another. Rather, the trial court, after the verdict, is given the task of allocating the money damages ....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">\u00b619 In conclusion, the portion of the District Court\u2019s Order denying the Bennetts the opportunity to recover wrongful death damages for grief, sorrow, and mental anguish was in error. We acknowledge, in defense of the District Court, that in the past we have been neither consistent in our analyses and holdings, nor precise in the use of the term \u2018heirs.\u201d We thus accept the petition and issue the writ to provide clarification on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">\u00b620 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Petition for Writ of Supervisory Control is GRANTED in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">\u00b621 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the portion of the District Court Order of April 18,2013, holding that Bennetts cannot recover wrongful death claims as a matter of law is VACATED.
