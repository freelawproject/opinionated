On December 24, 2012, the District Court terminated Mother\u2019s parental rights to J.W. because it determined that Mother\u2019s unfit parenting behavior had not changed since a Colorado court had terminated her rights to two other children. Mother argues that her previously unfit parenting in Colorado should not provide a basis for terminating her parental rights to J.W. because she has changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-13\">Termination of Mother\u2019s Parental Rights to A.K.M.H. and Q.D.J.W.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-14\">\u00b66 Mother is the biological mother of four children born from 1996 to 2008: Aus. L. (1996), A.K.M.H. (2002), Q.D.J.W. (2005), and J.W. (2008). In 2005, Mother and Father were living together in Colorado. Following a domestic violence incident between Mother and Father, the Clear Creek County Department of Human Services (CCDHS) instituted a child-abuse investigation regarding Mother\u2019s three children (J.W. was not yet born). The investigation determined that Mother had a history of violence with her domestic partners, used dangerous drugs, and had prior involvement with child protective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>services in Washington and Idaho. In an attempt to remedy her parenting problems, CCDHS instituted a treatment plan to which Mother agreed. The plan required Mother to, among other things, maintain a clean and sober lifestyle, complete a drug and alcohol evaluation, attend to the medical and mental health needs of her children, stay violence free, and generally be able to parent her children. <em>People ex rel. A.J.L., </em>243 P.3d 244, 247 (Colo. 2010). Mother failed to comply with the treatment plan: she continued to use drugs and tested positive for methamphetamine several times between October 2006 and March 2007. In May 2007, against the advice of the CCDHS treatment team, Mother moved to Montana, leaving A.K.M.H. and Q.D. J.W. behind. Mother told CCDHS that she was moving \u201cto get away from [Father] and because she did not trust the CCDHS treatment team.\u201d <em>People ex rel. A.J.L., </em>243 P.3d at 247. Truth be told, however, Mother and Father were living together in Livingston, Montana. Mother continued to lie to CCDHS caseworkers about not living with Father because their violent relationship was a primary reason CCDHS was seeking removal of A.K.D.H. and Q.D.J.W.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">\u00b67 In January and February 2009, a Colorado trial court held a three-day trial, which Mother attended, on CCDHS\u2019s petition to terminate Mother\u2019s parental rights to A.K.M.H. and Q.D.J.W. (Aus. L. was not subject to this proceeding). Based on the testimony, the court terminated Mother\u2019s rights because she was \u201cunfit as a parent and unlikely to change within a reasonable period of time\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-5\">At trial, the People produced substantial evidence and elicited testimony from witnesses supporting its contention that mother continues to deny the severity of abuse she inflicted on [A.K.M.H. and Q.D.J.W.]. They also produced evidence and elicited testimony from witnesses showing that mother\u2019s inability or unwillingness to acknowledge the abuse and its impact on her children placed a substantial roadblock between mother and her ability to safely and effectively parent [A.K.M.H. and Q.D.J.W.]. While on the stand, at trial, mother admitted to abusing her oldest son [Aus. L.], but denied that she ever physically abused [A.K.M.H. and Q.D.J.W.] or withheld food from them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Atv\">Contrary to mother\u2019s testimony, ... the trial court found that mother left the children without supervision and food; mother and [Father] physically disciplined the children with belts, spoons, and hands; mother confined the children to a dark closet for long periods of time; and the children witnessed domestic violence between mother and [Father].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number><em>People ex rel. A.J.L., </em>243 P.3d at 248-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">Termination of Mother\u2019s Parental Rights to J.W.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">\u00b68 Mother gave birth to J.W. in 2008. She continued to be involved in violent domestic relationships. In January 2011, the Department received a report that Mother was intoxicated and fighting with an ex-boyfriend. When Aus. L. tried to stop the fight, the ex-boyfriend began hitting him and the ex-boyfriend\u2019s father pulled a gun on Aus. L.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">\u00b69 Mother also continued to abuse drugs and alcohol. On February 9,2012, the Department received a report that Mother had left Aus. L. and J.W. with another ex-boyfriend and had been missing for three days. When the ex-boyfriend went to Mother\u2019s house, she refused to open the door because she \u201cwas too drunk.\u201d Later that afternoon, Mother came to the ex-boyfriend\u2019s house to pick up her children, but told Aus. L. that he had to move out. Aus. L. subsequently moved in with Father.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">\u00b610 Over the next few days, Christopher Bly (Bly), a Child Protection Specialist for the Department made unannounced visits to Mother\u2019s home but no one answered the door. Bly was subsequently informed by Aus. L.\u2019s juvenile probation officer that Aus. L. was residing in a youth home in Bozeman because Mother had kicked him out of Father\u2019s residence. Bly visited Aus. L., who stated that he was sad that his mother had \u201cabandoned him\u201d but was more concerned that there was no one to take care of J.W. in his absence. Aus. L. usually took care of J.W. when Mother was drinking.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">\u00b611 On February 29, 2012, the Department filed a Petition for Emergency Protective Services and Temporary Investigative Authority, seeking leave to investigate J.W.\u2019s well-being and to temporarily place J.W. in a home out of Mother\u2019s custody if the circumstances required. The District Court granted the request, and ordered that David Stanley serve as J.W.\u2019s Court Appointed Special Advocate and Guardian Ad Litem (CASA Stanley). The Department and CASA Stanley immediately tried to make contact with Mother to assess J.W.\u2019s well-being. However, Mother did not answer or return their phone calls. On March 2,2012, Father, with Mother\u2019s permission, absconded with J.W. to Washington State, where he left J.W. with her maternal grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">\u00b6 12 CASA Stanley visited the grandmother\u2019s home in Washington and described the living situation as \u201cwholly inappropriate\u201d for J.W. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>grandmother had neither the resources nor the personal strength to care for J.W. She struggled with alcohol abuse and had been the subject of prior child neglect findings in that state. CASA Stanley described Mother\u2019s placement of J.W. with the grandmother as \u201cdesperate and neglectful.\u201d After it was determined the maternal grandmother was not an appropriate placement, J.W. was returned to Montana and placed in a foster home.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">\u00b613 On August 20,2012, the District Court conducted a hearing on the Department\u2019s petition to adjudicate J.W. a youth in need of care. At the conclusion of the testimony, the court ruled that J.W. was a youth in need of care, based on Mother\u2019s past history, her action of sending J.W. to Washington, her general instability, and her ongoing drug use.</p>\n<p id=\"AJH\">\u00b614 Throughout the Montana proceedings, Mother failed to cooperate with the Department. She repeatedly failed to meet with social workers who were trying to assess her parental fitness, and refused to participate in drug testing. Ultimately, the Department was forced to seek a court order to obtain a hair sample, which tested positive for methamphetamine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During the fall, when the Department asked Mother to undergo urinalysis testing, Mother agreed to the testing but then failed to show up.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">\u00b615 On October 11,2012, the Department filed a petition (1) to forego reasonable efforts to reunify Mother and J.W. and (2) to terminate Mother\u2019s parental rights. On December 6,2012, the District Court held a hearing to address both issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">December <em>6, </em>2012 Termination Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"AYP\">\u00b616 Colorado child-protection worker Sarah Cassano (Cassano) testified that CCDHS first become involved with Mother in 2005, when it received reports that Aus. L. was outside in the cold because his mother would not let him in the home. Cassano said that CCDHS\u2019s investigation revealed that Mother had a drug problem and could not adequately parent her children. Cassano also noted that Mother failed to take responsibility for her actions and their impact on her children, and that she had been dishonest throughout the CCDHS\u2019s case. Mother\u2019s significant problems and her inability to take responsibility led Cassano to believe that Mother would not be able to correct her parenting problems within a reasonable period of time. The District Court found Cassano\u2019s testimony \u201ccredible\u201d and \u201cconsistent with the other witnesses and documents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>\u00b617 Barbara Maddren-Broughton (Maddren-Broughton), the child protective services supervisor for Park County Child and Family Services, testified that her department first dealt with Mother in 2011, but had received the most recent reports of neglect on February 9, 2012. This was when the Department was notified that Mother was \u2018intoxicated while parenting\u201d and leaving her children with ex-boyfriends for days without returning. Maddren-Broughton also confirmed the details of Father taking J.W. to Washington with Mother\u2019s permission. On cross-examination, Maddren-Broughton admitted that the Department had decided to seek termination of Mother\u2019s parental rights without a current psychological evaluation or chemical dependency evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">\u00b618 Prior to the hearing, the Department retained Dr. Michael Butz (Dr. Butz), a clinical psychologist, to perform a \u201cdesk review\u201d of various records pertaining to Mother\u2019s parenting. Dr. Butz concluded that several factors indicated that Mother would not change her unfit behavior in the foreseeable future. First, Dr. Butz noted that psychological evaluations of Mother from 2007 and 2012 indicated that she \u201csuffers from Personality Disorder and Cyclothymia.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These disorders, Dr. Butz explained, have an \u201cenduring and lasting effect\u201d on Mother\u2019s behavior, which explained why her parenting had been \u201cinsufficient, neglectful and abusive even without the presence of verifiable substance abuse.\u201d Second, Dr. Butz noted that the documentation indicated that Mother felt that she had done nothing wrong and, thus, had no reason to change her behavior. Dr. Butz pointed out that according to the prevailing psychology literature Mother\u2019s failure to acknowledge her problems indicated she was unlikely to make substantial changes in the \u2018foreseeable future.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Third, Dr. Butz testified that Mother\u2019s pattern of abuse and neglect of children, across three states, supported the conclusion that her unfit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>behavior would not change. Fourth, Dr. Butz noted that it was significant that Mother had not shown, over all of her years of parenting trouble, a motivation to change her behavior. Dr. Butz concluded that, without such motivation, all treatments were likely to fail to prompt change in her behavior: \u201cAll therapies for the personality disorders, the more recent updates on treating Cyclothymia could be reviewed and the latest on Polysubstance Dependence with regard to methamphetamine could be analyzed but none of this would have any impact so long as [Mother] remains unmotivated for change.\u201d The District Court found Dr. Butz\u2019s testimony persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">\u00b619 Mother called Joseph Scalia (Scalia), the therapist who treated Aus. L., to counter Dr. Butz\u2019s testimony. Scalia observed Mother with her children \u201capproximately\u201d eight times. Although he had not reviewed any of the Colorado records pertaining to Mother\u2019s previous terminations, Scalia concluded the \u201codds\u201d of Mother psychologically prevailing over her \u201cdemons sufficiently to mother a child in the near future\u201d were \u201csubstantial.\u201d The District Court rejected Scalia\u2019s testimony because the court found \u201cno basis for the conclusion that [Mother\u2019s] conduct will change in a reasonable amount of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">\u00b620 The Livingston Assistant Chief of Police testified as to Mother\u2019s contacts with law enforcement between 2009 and 2012. He stated that Mother was involved in several domestic violence situations where the police were called, as well as numerous traffic violations and arrest warrants. The District Court concluded: \u2018While not all of the[se] contacts are serious, they show a general disregard for the law and continuation of the pattern of irresponsibility which carries over to her parenting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">\u00b621 Donna Delich (Delich), a clinical social worker and licensed addition counselor, testified about Mother\u2019s substance-abuse treatment. Delich stated that Mother had only come to see her during two time periods: (1) after Colorado instituted its proceeding to terminate Mother\u2019s rights to A.K.M.H. and Q.D. J.W. and (2) after the Department instituted the abuse and neglect proceedings as to J.W. Delich further testified that Mother had recently taken steps to address her drug and alcohol problems; however, it would take two years before Mother was functioning near her normal levels. The District Court found that Delich\u2019s testimony exemplified Mother\u2019s behavior of only taking corrective action at the 11th hour of termination proceedings: \u2018[Mother\u2019s] history with Ms. Delich is typical. [Mother] would seek and attend counseling when something like a hearing was hanging over her head, but otherwise shows little <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>motivation to change.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">\u00b622 Mother also called Annie Fry (Fry), a child mentor who had supervised Mother\u2019s thirty-three visits while J.W. was in foster care. Fry stated that she saw \u201ca strong bond between mother and daughter\u201d and only positive interactions during these visits. However, on cross-examination, Fry admitted that a positive interaction during visits was \u201ctypical.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\u00b623 Mother had Linden Kacick (Kacick), a licensed addiction counselor, testify as to Mother\u2019s recent participation in a drug and alcohol treatment program. Kacick described Mother\u2019s participation in the treatment as \u2018Very cooperative,\u2019\u2019and noted that she was \u201cmotivated to make and seek changes in her life.\u201d However, Kacick was surprised to learn that Mother had gone through a similar treatment program during the Colorado proceedings that had ultimately been unsuccessful in correcting her parenting problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">\u00b624 Post-hearing, the District Court issued its order concluding that the Department need not make reasonable efforts to reunite Mother and J.W., and terminating Mother\u2019s parental rights to J.W. The District Court reasoned that reunification efforts were unnecessary because Mother had her parental rights to A.K.M.H. and Q.D.J.W. previously terminated and the circumstances pertaining to those terminations were \u2018Identical\u201d to Mother\u2019s unfit parenting of J.W. The court further found that it was in the best interests of J.W. to terminate Mother\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">\u00b625 \u2018We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s termination of parental rights.\u201d <em>In re C.J., </em>2010 MT 179, \u00b6 20, 357 Mont. 219, 237 P.3d 1282. This Court reviews a district court\u2019s conclusions of law for correctness and its findings of fact to determine if they are clearly erroneous. <em>In re D.B.J., </em>2012 MT 220, \u00b6 23, 366 Mont. 320, 286 P.3d 1021. Whether a district court violated a parent\u2019s constitutional right to \u201cfundamentally fair procedures\u201d in termination proceedings, is \u201ca question of constitutional law, for which our review is plenary.\u201d <em>In re T.S.B., </em>2008 MT 23, \u00b6 20, 341 Mont. 204, 177 P.3d 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">\u00b626 Sections 41-3-601 through 612, MCA provide the \u201cprocedures and criteria by which the parent-child legal relationship may be terminated by a court if the relationship is not in the best interest of the child.\u201d Section 41-3-602, MCA. These provisions are only operative when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>\u201cthere has been a determination that a child is abused or neglected, as defined in 41-3-102.\u201d Section 41-3-602, MCA. \u201cAbused and neglected\u201d is defined as: \u201c(i) actual physical or psychological harm to the child; (ii) substantial risk of physical or psychological harm to a child; or (iii) abandonment.\u201d Section 41-3-102(7), MCA. If a child is \u201cabused or neglected,\u201d the court is authorized to terminate the parent-child relationship if it finds that any of the criteria enumerated in \u00a741-3-609(1), MCA, exist. <em>In re A.H.D., </em>2008 MT 57, \u00b6 17, 341 Mont. 494, 178 P.3d 131; <em>In re K.J.B., </em>2007 MT 216, \u00b6 25, 339 Mont. 28, 168 P.3d 629. Section 41-3-609(l)(d), MCA, permits the termination of the parent-child relationship when \u201cthe parent has subjected a child to any of the circumstances listed in 41-3-423(2)(a) through 2(e)[.]\u201d Section 41-3-423(2)(e), MCA, in turn permits termination when the parent has \u201chad parental rights to the child\u2019s sibling or other child of the parent involuntarily terminated and the circumstances related to the termination of parental rights are relevant to the parent\u2019s ability to adequately care for the child at issue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">\u00b627 In addition to providing grounds for termination, \u00a741-3-423(2)(e), MCA, relieves the Department of typical requirements under certain circumstances. Typically, before seeking termination of parental rights, the Department must make \u201creasonable efforts\u201d to remedy the parenting problems that prompted its intervention-by providing, for example, drug treatment programs-so as to preserve and reunify the family. Section 41-3-423(1), MCA (\u2018The department shall make reasonable efforts to prevent the necessity of removal of a child from the child\u2019s home and to reunify families.\u2019!). However, \u00a741-3-423(2)(e), MCA, exempts the Department from providing these services if a court determines that \u201cpreservation and reunification services need not be provided[.]\u201d <em>See In re </em>A.H.D., \u00b6 18 (\u2018Section 41-3~423(2)(a)-(e) frees DPHHS from making further efforts to reunify the family once the statutory elements are met.\u201d); <em>In re Custody and Parental Rights of A.P., </em>2007 MT 297, \u00b6 17, 340 Mont. 39, 172 P.3d 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">\u00b628 <em>1. Did the District Court err by failing to conduct a stand-alone hearing on whether the Department should be required to make reasonable efforts to reunify Mother and J.W. ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">\u00b629 Mother alleges the District Court failed to employ fundamentally fair procedures because it did not hold a separate \u201cpre-hearing\u201d to determine whether reunification of J.W. with Mother was possible. The Department argues that Mother\u2019s claim is without merit because she was given the chance at the December 6, 2012 hearing to \u201cpresent evidence and cross examine all of the Department\u2019s witnesses[.]\u201dThus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>the Department argues, Mother was provided with fundamentally fair procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">\u00b630 A parent\u2019s right to the care and custody of their child is a fundamental liberty interest, which can be terminated only through \u2018fundamentally fair procedures.\u201d <em>In re A.H.D., </em>\u00b6 12. In In, <em>re C.J., </em>2010 MT 179, 357 Mont. 219, 237 P.3d 1282, we analyzed what constitutes \u2018fundamentally fair procedures\u201d when the Department seeks to terminate parental rights based on a prior termination. There, the Department filed a petition to terminate the parental rights of a mother who had her parental rights to two other children previously terminated. <em>In re C.J., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9, 13. The mother had significant mental-health issues, learning disabilities, and abused drugs and alcohol. <em>In re C.J., </em>\u00b6 5. Because of these problems, the mother was unable to provide a safe and nurturing environment for her first two children. <em>In </em>re C.J., \u00b6 6. Five years later, the mother gave birth to C.J., and the Department placed C.J. in protective custody because mother had induced her own premature labor, her mental health issues, her lack of stable housing, her criminal propensities, and the involuntary termination of her parental rights to her two other children. <em>In re </em>C.J., \u00b6 11. Shortly after, the Department filed a petition requesting the district court to (1) find that reasonable efforts to reunify C.J. and her mother were not required and (2) terminate the mother\u2019s parental rights. <em>In re C.J., </em>\u00b6 13. The district court held a combined hearing to take evidence relevant to both requests. <em>In re C. </em>J., \u00b6 12. On appeal, the mother argued that the district court should have held a separate hearing on the Department\u2019s request for an exemption from the \u201creasonable efforts\u201d requirement. <em>In re C.J., </em>\u00b6 25. We held that the combined hearing constituted \u2018fundamentally fair procedures\u201d that adequately protected the mother\u2019s rights because she had notice and an opportunity to be heard: she was on notice because the Department stated its intent to forego reasonable efforts in its petition and she was given \u201cample opportunity\u2019 to be heard during the combined hearing through the presentation of evidence and witnesses. <em>In re </em>C.J., \u00b6\u00b6 14, 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\u00b631  Likewise, here, Mother was on notice that the Department was seeking to forgo the typical \u201creasonable efforts\u201d requirement and was given \u201cample opportunity\u201d to be heard. The Department put Mother on notice that it was seeking exemption from the \u201creasonable efforts\u201d requirement in its October 11, 2012 petition: \u2018ft is ... requested that the court make a judicial finding that preservation or reunification services are not necessary pursuant to \u00a741-3-423(2)(e) and (5).\u201d And, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>Mother had an opportunity to be heard during the December 6, 2012 hearing. At the hearing, Mother had several witnesses testify on her behalf: her chemical dependency counselor, the woman who had supervised Mother\u2019s visits while J.W. was in foster care, and Aus. L.\u2019s therapist. She also elicited helpful testimony from the Department\u2019s witnesses through cross-examination. By giving notice to Mother and allowing her to be properly heard, the District Court employed \u2018fundamentally fair procedures,\u201d and was not required to hold a separate, stand-alone hearing. <em>In re </em>A.H.D., \u00b6 12; <em>In re </em>C.J., \u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">\u00b632 <em>2. Did the District Court commit reversible error by failing to conduct a permanency plan hearing?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">\u00b633 Mother claims that the District Court\u2019s order must be reversed because it failed to conduct the necessary permanency plan hearing. The Department counters that although the court failed to conduct the permanency plan hearing, the purpose of the hearing was fulfilled because the Department was actively working with Father so J.W. could permanently live with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">\u00b634 Section 41-3-423(5) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-7\">If the court finds that preservation or reunification services are not necessary pursuant to subsection (2) or (3), <em>a permanency hearing must be held within 30 days of that determination </em>and reasonable efforts, including consideration of both in-state and out-of-state permanent placement options for the child, must be made to place the child in a timely manner in accordance with the permanency plan and to complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">(Emphasis added.) We have explained that the \u201cpurpose of a permanency plan hearing is to assure that children taken into protective custody by the [Department] do not languish in foster care or fall through the proverbial administrative crack.\u201d <em>In re A.R., </em>2004 MT 22, \u00b6 21, 319 Mont. 340, 83 P.3d 1287. While we do not condone the failure to hold a permanency plan hearing, we have recognized that such failure is not a <em>per se </em>violation of a parent\u2019s rights. <em>See e.g. In re A.R., </em>\u00b6 21; <em>In re B.B., </em>2006 MT 66, \u00b6 27, 331 Mont. 407, 133 P.3d 215. So long as the Department\u2019s actions are consistent with ensuring the child does not languish in foster-care or administrative limbo, the district court\u2019s failure to hold a permanency plan does not violate the terminated parent\u2019s right to fundamentally fair procedures. <em>In </em>re A.R., \u00b6\u00b6 15, 21-22 (mother\u2019s rights not violated by court\u2019s failure to conduct hearing within 30 days because DPHHS was working with biological father on treatment plan in hopes to reunify the children with him); <em>In </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>re <em>B.B., </em>\u00b6 27 (parents\u2019 rights not violated by court\u2019s failure to hold hearing because the \u201cDepartment\u2019s repeated efforts to reunite the children with their parents, clearly demonstrate^] the Department\u2019s reunification goal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">\u00b635  Here, although the District Court failed to hold a permanency hearing, the Department\u2019s actions were consistent with the purposes of such a hearing. During the same time it was seeking a judicial determination that reunification and preservation services were not needed as to Mother, the Department had entered into a treatment plan with J.W.\u2019s father. One of the treatment plan\u2019s explicit goals was to assess Father\u2019s ability to provide a \u201csafe, appropriate, and stable home environment\u201d for J.W. This plan demonstrated that the purposes of a permanency hearing-4o ensure that the Department is moving forward with a permanent placement for the child-was being fulfilled. The District Court\u2019s failure to hold a permanency plan hearing did not violate Mother\u2019s right to fundamentally fair procedures. <em>In re A.R., </em>\u00b6 21; In <em>re B.B., </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">\u00b636 <em>3. Did the District Court err by concluding that the circumstances surrounding Mother\u2019s prior terminations in Colorado were relevant to her parenting ofJ. W. ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">\u00b637 Mother argues that the problems giving rise to the Colorado termination of her parental rights-she had moved to Montana, was involved in violent domestic relationships, and her unwillingness to acknowledge harm caused to her childrenwrere not present in her parenting of J.W., and, therefore the Colorado terminations are not relevant to this proceeding. The State counters that the Colorado proceedings are relevant because the circumstances that led to the prior terminations have remained unchanged: Mother continues to use dangerous drugs, is resistant to treatment, and continues to be involved in relationships with domestic violence. These issues, the State argues, have created a dangerous environment for J.W. just as it did for Mother\u2019s previous children.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">\u00b638  At \u201cany time during an abuse and neglect proceeding,\u201d the Department may seek a judicial determination that \u201cpreservation or reunification services need not be provided.\u201dSection 41-3-423(2), MCA. The court has the authority to make such a determination, if the parent: \u2018had parental rights to the child\u2019s sibling or other child of the parent involuntarily terminated and the circumstances related to the termination of parental rights are relevant to the parent\u2019s ability to adequately care for the child at issue.\u201d Section 41-3-423(2)(e), MCA. The court\u2019s finding that (1) the parent\u2019s parental rights have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>previously been terminated and (2) that the circumstances surrounding the prior termination are \u201crelevant\u201d to the current termination proceeding \u201cmust be supported by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d Section 41-3-423(4), MCA; <em>In re A.P., </em>\u00b6 23 (the Department must show by clear and convincing evidence these two statutory requirements have been met). Because it is undisputed that Mother has been subject to previous involuntary terminations, we need only determine whether the District Court correctly concluded that the circumstances surrounding those terminations are \u201crelevant\u201d to the current termination proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">\u00b639 Circumstances surrounding previous involuntary terminations remain \u201crelevant,\u2019\u2019\u201cunless the circumstances have changed.\u201d <em>In </em>re A.P., \u00b6 30; <em>In re K.</em>J.B., \u00b6 36. This construction of \u201crelevant\u201d recognizes that a parent is not to be afforded multiple chances to remedy the same problems at the expense of an abused or neglected child\u2019s welfare: \u201cA prior termination, followed by a parent\u2019s demonstration of continuing unfitness, indicates that decisive termination of parental rights is the best way to protect a child\u2019s welfare.\u201d Kathleen Haggard, <em>Treating Prior Terminations of Parental Rights as Grounds for Present Terminations, </em>73 Wash. L. Rev. 1051, 1053 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">\u00b640 <em>In re K.J.B., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 3, 7, 9-10, dealt with termination of the parental rights of a mother and father who had had their rights to four previous children terminated for being \u201cunable or unwilling to provide the children] with the special care\u201d they needed. The previous children were all born with a \u201cchromosomal abnormality\u201d that left them needing specialized care. <em>In re K.J.B., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 4, 9-10. The parents repeatedly failed to actively participate with their treatment plans designed to teach them how to provide that care and their parental rights were terminated. <em>In re K.J.B., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 5, 7. Later, K.J.B. was born with the same chromosomal abnormality. <em>In re K.J.B., </em>\u00b6 11. The Department petitioned to terminate the parents\u2019 rights and asked the court to find that reasonable efforts to reunify the parents with K.J.B. were not required because of the previous terminations. <em>In re K.J.B., </em>\u00b6 13. The District Court heard the testimony of several witnesses before concluding that reasonable efforts were not necessary because the circumstances present in four previous terminations were relevant to their parenting of K.J.B. <em>In re K.J.B., </em>\u00b6 21. The parents appealed and we affirmed, reasoning the circumstances (the parents\u2019 unfit behavior) remained unchanged since the prior terminations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">Our review of the record convinces us that DPHHS met its burden of establishing that [the parents] remain unable to safely and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>adequately address KJ.B.\u2019s special needs and provide for her necessary care .... In this respect, their circumstances are unchanged from the circumstances surrounding and underlying their previous parental terminations. The District Court heard extensive testimony from numerous professionals who have worked with, observed or evaluated the parents .... Under these circumstances, it is apparent that the two critical circumstances-the parents\u2019 limitations and the special needs of the child-hhat were relevant to the parents\u2019 inability to care for their previous children had not changed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-4\"><em>In re K.J.B., </em>\u00b6 36; <em>accord In re A.P., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 29-30 (circumstances of prior termination relevant because mother continued to make decisions detrimental to A.P.\u2019s well-being).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">\u00b641 Here, substantial evidence supported the District Court\u2019s determination that Mother\u2019s unfit behavior remained unchanged since Colorado terminated her rights to A.K.M.H. and Q.D.J.W. The testimony established that Mother continued to suffer from the same mental health problems she did during the Colorado proceedings. Dr. Butz reviewed psychological examinations of Mother from 2007 and 2012; both concluded that Mother suffered from a personality disorder and \u201ccyclothymia.\u201d Testimony also established that Mother continued to use dangerous drugs and abuse alcohol during her parenting of J.W. A hair sample obtained from Mother by court order tested positive for methamphetamine. The Department first began investigating Mother when it received reports that she had left J.W. at an ex-boyfriend\u2019s house and would not take her back because she \u201cwas too drunk.\u201d Finally, the testimony established that Mother continues to be involved in violent relationships that put her children in danger. On December 7, 2011, the Department received a report that Mother was intoxicated and fighting with an ex-boyfriend. When Aus. L. stepped in to help, the ex-boyfriend\u2019s father pointed a gun at him. In addition, law enforcement testimony established that Mother had been involved in several domestic violence situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">\u00b642  These conditions once again contributed to Mother\u2019s unacceptable parenting. Just as she left A.K.M.H and Q.D.J.W. behind in Colorado when she moved to Montana, Mother left J.W. with an ex-boyfriend for three days while she drank alcohol.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Further, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>approved of Father\u2019s absconding of J.W. to Washington, where the environment was \u201cwholly inappropriate\u201d for a child; the grandmother was intoxicated while taking care of J.W. and there was little food in the residence. The competent testimony further established that Mother is unlikely to change her unfit behavior in the \u2018foreseeable future.\u201d Dr. Butz testified that Mother\u2019s psychological state and her track record demonstrate that Mother did not have the necessary motivation to make the substantial changes needed. To be sure, Mother did make what appear to be small steps in the right direction just prior to the termination hearing-for example, she sought out substance-abuse treatment. However, Mother\u2019s past demonstrates that she only participates in treatment programs when a termination proceeding is pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">\u00b643 The evidence that the circumstances surrounding Mother\u2019s termination in Colorado remained relevant to her parenting of J.W. was \u201cdefinite, clear, and convincing[.]\u201d <em>In re </em>J.L., 277 Mont. at 289, 922 P.2d at 462.
