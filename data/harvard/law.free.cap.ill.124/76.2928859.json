Contract\u2014to procure homestead right\u2014construed, as to character of right intended. One party to a written contract agreed to procure for the other \u201ca good right to the north-east quarter of section 26, town 13, range 23, in Trego county, Kansas, as a homestead.\u201d The proof showed that the parties had in view government lands, and that the right of homestead in contemplation was that secured by the United States laws to set--tiers: Held, that the covenant was only to procure for the covenantee the Tight to become an occupant of the tract as the claimant of a homestead, \u2022and not to procure the title.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b77-5\" pgmap=\"77\">2. Specific performance\u2014refusal to perform, rendering an offer to perform by the other parly a useless act. A agreed in writing to convey to B twenty acres of land in this State, in consideration that the latter should procure for the former a good right to a certain quarter section of land in the State of Kansas, as a homestead, under the United States law. A wholly abandoned the contract and refused to perform it before the date at which B was required to or could have procured the homestead right: Held, \u25a0on bill by B for a specific performance of the contract to convey the twenty acres, that no tender of the homestead right was necessary to the relief \u25a0sought.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b77-6\" pgmap=\"77\">3. And in such case, the fact that the homestead right was forever lost -through the non-compliance of A with the contract, and had ceased to exist, furnished no ground for the court to refuse to decree a specific performance \u25a0of the contract by A.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b77-7\" pgmap=\"77\">4. Practice\u2014time to object\u2014for va/ria/iice. An objection that there is .a variance between the allegations in a bill and the proofs, comes too late on appeal or writ of error.

It is now too late to make that objection, \u201cfor when a purchaser announces his intention to the vendor not to comply with his contract before bill for specific performance is filed against him, no tender of a deed will be necessary.\u201d Lyman v.

There are some cases where a court will justly refuse the specific performance of a legal contract, but we are told \u201cit is as much a matter of course for courts of equity to grant specific performance of a contract for the conveyance of land, when it is valid and unobjectionable in any of its features which address themselves to the judicial discretion of the chancellor, as it is for courts of law to award damage for a breach of a like contract.\u201d McClure v. Otrich, 118 Ill. 320; Cohn v. Mitchell, 115 id. 124; Towner v.

The contract was reduced to writing, and the consideration for the conveyance of the twenty-acre tract was, that \u201csaid Prince agrees to procure for said Dulin a good right to the north-east quarter of section 26, township 13, range 23, in Trego county, Kansas, as a homestead.\u201d It is contended, on behalf of plaintiffs in error, that the defendant in error never was in a condition to comply with his part of the contract, because he never had title to the land, and never had any right of homestead in himself.</p> <p id=\"b79-8\" pgmap=\"79(53) 80(92)\">The evidence shows that the parties, when they made this contract, had in view government lands, and that the right of homestead in contemplation was that secured by the United States statute to settlers, as a means of becoming owners. In that light we think the covenant was only to procure for plaintiffs in error the right to become occupants of the particular tract, as claimants of a homestead. It was not necessary that the defendant in error should have made any formal tender of performance, because the evidence clearly shows that plaintiffs in error wholly abandoned the contract and refused to perform it before the date at which defendant in error was required to or could have procured for plaintiffs in error the stipulated right. Mathison v. Wilson, 87 Ill. 51; Towner v. Tickner, 112 id. 217; Lyman v. Gedney, 114 id. 390.</p> <p id=\"b80-4\" pgmap=\"80\">But it is objected that plaintiffs in error are not awarded the homestead right by this decree. That was impossible, since it is shown by the evidence that by reason of their noncompliance with the contract the right is wholly lost. When the decree was rendered the right had ceased to exist in the defendant in error, through no fault of his.</p> <p id=\"b80-5\" pgmap=\"80\">It is finally objected, that there is a variance between the allegations and the proofs, in this: It is alleged in the bill that the defendant in error had fully performed all the covenants and agreements, but the proofs only show a waiver of performance by the plaintiffs in error. This objection comes too late. It should have been made in the lower court, before the case had passed beyond its control. Muttoon v. Fallin, 113 Ill. 249.</p> <p id=\"b80-7\" pgmap=\"80\">We perceive no sufficient reason for disturbing the decree. It is therefore affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b80-8\" pgmap=\"80\">Decree affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b80-9\" pgmap=\"80\">Mr. Justice Scott : I do not concur in this opinion.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
