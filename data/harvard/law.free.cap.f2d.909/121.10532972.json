The district court analyzed the facts of Hurtado's case and held that, viewed under a preponderance of the evidence standard, Hurtado had consented to the police search of her home. We reversed and remanded this part of the district court\u2019s judgment because the precedent of this circuit required the government to prove the voluntariness of Hurtado\u2019s consent by clear and convincing evidence. On rehearing en banc, the court reversed our precedent which required clear and convincing evidence and stated that \u201cthe controlling burden of proof at suppression hearings should impose no greater burden than proof by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d 905 F.2d at 76, <em>quoting United States v. Matlock, </em>415 U.S. 164, 177 n. 14, 94 S.Ct. 988, 996 n. 14, 39 L.Ed.2d 242 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-18\">The district court evaluated the volun-tariness of Hurtado\u2019s consent under the proper standard. We stated in our prior panel opinion that \u201c[i]f the preponderance standard were applied to this case, we would readily conclude that the district court\u2019s finding of voluntariness was not clearly erroneous,\u201d 899 F.2d at 375. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b217-19\">Therefore, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b217-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
