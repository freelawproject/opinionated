That same day, it also made an ex parte application for a right to attach order against the funds held in escrow from the pending sale of the business between RRNS and Golden West Pancakes. The day before, the attorney for Perko\u2019s, Thomas Nast, had notified the office of the attorney for RRNS, Lawrence Haun, of his intention to seek the ex parte attachment order. Haun appeared at the hearing to oppose the motion, which the court denied. At that time, Nast asked Haun to accept service of the complaint on behalf of RRNS. Haun declined. Haun then filed a notice of opposition to application for right to attach order, together with a memorandum of points and authorities and assorted declarations and exhibits. He paid a filing fee of $415.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">On August 6, Perko\u2019s complaint was dismissed at its request. RRNS thereupon filed a memorandum of costs to recover the $415 filing fee. In response, Perko\u2019s moved to tax costs. RRNS opposed the motion and requested the court impose sanctions against Perko\u2019s pursuant to section 128.5. By order filed December 4, the court denied the motion to tax costs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>It awarded costs of $415 to RRNS and imposed sanctions in the amount of $500. Perko\u2019s filed a notice of appeal on November 8 and an amended notice on December 11. The court entered judgment on January 16, 1991.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">\n<em>Denial of Motion to Tax Costs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Perko\u2019s contends the disputed filing fee is not recoverable as a cost because RRNS\u2019s pleadings were filed after the issue which was the subject of the pleadings had been decided. Therefore, it argues, the fee was not a necessary cost. RRNS contraposes recovery of filing fees as costs is such an \u201caccepted and automatic\u201d right it is beyond question. Thus the issue is whether a trial court has the power to disallow those costs which it determines to be unnecessary or unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">The right to recover costs is purely statutory. <em>(McIntosh </em>v. <em>Crandall </em>(1941) 47 Cal.App.2d 126, 127-128 [117 P.2d 380].) In 1986, the law governing the recovery of costs was substantially revised to create a more detailed and specific statutory framework and to codify existing case law. (7 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1991 pocket supp.) Judgment, \u00a7 84, pp. 98-99.)</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">Prior to the 1986 amendments, section 1032 provided costs were allowed \u201cof course\u201d to a plaintiff or defendant upon a judgment in his favor in certain specified types of actions, and to a defendant as to whom the action was dismissed. In actions other than those expressly mentioned, costs were allowable in the discretion of the court. Under this earlier scheme, filing fees were recoverable as a matter of course.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>(International Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Olen </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 218, 221 [145 Cal.Rptr. 691, 577 P.2d 1031].)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>In 1986, section 1032 was rewritten to provide that a \u201cprevailing party\u201d is entitled \u201cas a matter of right\u201d to recover costs in any action or proceeding. (\u00a7 1032, subd. (b).) A \u201cprevailing party\u201d was defined to include \u201ca defendant in whose favor a dismissal is entered, . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1032, subd. (a)(4).)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, section 1033.5<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was added to the code to identify specific types of costs which are allowable and others which are not, and to provide that costs not expressly mentioned are allowable at the court\u2019s discretion. Under this revised scheme, recovery is now based on the type of cost rather than on the type of action in which it is incurred. Filing fees are among those costs which are expressly allowable. (\u00a7 1033.5, subd. (a)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Under both the former and the present statutory schemes, costs are one of two types: those recoverable as a matter of right and those recoverable at the discretion of the court. The question is what, if any, conditions may be imposed on recovery of costs allowable \u201cas a matter of right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Under the former scheme the statutes did not identify allowable costs specifically, but limited costs recoverable as a matter of right to those incurred in certain types of actions, or by a defendant as to whom an action was dismissed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A party claiming costs was required to file a verified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>memorandum of costs with the court stating the claimed costs and disbursements were \u201cnecessarily incurred.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The memorandum was prima facie evidence the items were necessary, but when a cost bill was properly challenged the burden shifted to the party claiming costs to prove their necessity. <em>(Rappenecker </em>v. <em>Sea-Land Service, Inc. </em>(1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 256, 266 [155 Cal.Rptr. 516]; <em>Oak Grove School Dist. </em>v. <em>City Title Ins. Co. </em>(1963) 217 Cal.App.2d 678, 698 [32 Cal.Rptr. 288]; <em>Stenzor </em>v. <em>Leon </em>(1955) 130 Cal.App.2d 729, 735-736 [279 P.2d 802].) The determination of the necessity and reasonableness of a particular expense was within the broad discretion of the court. <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Atchison etc. Ry. Co. </em>(1909) 156 Cal. 140, 141 [103 P. 885] [only costs necessarily incurred may be recovered]; <em>Estate of Bauer </em>(1943) 59 Cal.App.2d 161, 164 [138 P.2d 721] [determination of whether items are necessary and reasonable is within the discretion of the trial court]; <em>Balfour, Guthrie &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Gourmet Farms </em>(1980) 108 Cal.App.3d 181, 191-192 [166 Cal.Rptr. 422] [determination of items allowable as costs largely within discretion of trial court].) The court, however, could not award costs that were not authorized by statute. <em>(Wilson </em>v. <em>Board of Retirement </em>(1959) 176 Cal.App.2d 320, 322-323 [1 Cal.Rptr. 373]; <em>Agnew </em>v. <em>Cronin </em>(1959) 167 Cal.App.2d 154, 156-157 [334 P.2d 256]; <em>People </em>v. <em>One 1950 Ford Sedan </em>(1956) 140 Cal.App.2d 647, 650 [295 P.2d 486, 60 A.L.R.2d 809].)</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">In reviewing the necessity of challenged costs, the courts made no distinction between those allowable as a matter of course and those allowable in the discretion of the court. For example, although filing fees were ordinarily allowable as a matter of course <em>(.International Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Olen, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d at p. 221), <em>Gaffey </em>v. <em>Mann </em>(1906) 3 Cal.App. 124, 127 [84 P. 424] held it was not an abuse of discretion to disallow recovery of a filing fee incurred after the underlying action was dismissed, on the theory the fee was incurred unnecessarily. In <em>Teichner </em>v. <em>Klassman </em>(1966) 240 Cal.App.2d 514, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>524-525 [49 Cal.Rptr. 742], the court noted while a party receiving a favorable judgment is entitled to costs \u201cas of course,\u201d the trial court has broad discretion to disallow unnecessary costs upon a motion to tax. <em>Teichner </em>involved installment payments due under a loan contract. The court ruled the appellant could not recover his costs of filing a separate action for each successive installment if he could obtain the desired relief in a single action.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">RRNS cites <em>International Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Olen, supra, </em>21 Cal.3d 218 in support of its position that filing fees are recoverable as costs without qualification. The court in <em>International Industries </em>interpreted section 1032 to say a defendant as to whom an action is dismissed is entitled \u201cas a matter of right\u201d (at p. 221) to recover filing fees. The issue in that case, however, was not whether the fees were necessarily incurred, but whether the claimant was the prevailing party. Likewise, other decisions which declare an unqualified right to recover costs allowable as a matter of course do not involve a challenge to the need for the costs. (See, e.g., <em>McMahan\u2019s </em>v. <em>McMahan Serv. Corp. </em>(1956) 145 Cal.App.2d 607, 611 [302 P.2d 847] [no need for defendant to expressly ask for costs or for court to expressly award costs]; <em>Schmidt </em>v. <em>Klotz </em>(1900) 130 Cal. 223, 224 [62 P. 470] [court may not routinely require prevailing party to bear own costs]; <em>Stoddard </em>v. <em>Treadwell </em>(1865) 29 Cal. 281, 282 [prevailing party in second trial entitled to recover costs of first trial].)</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Therefore, the prevailing view in the case law prior to 1986 held a trial court may disallow costs, including filing fees, which it determines were incurred unnecessarily. That view was codified by the 1986 amendments to the code. Under the present scheme, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover filing fees \u201c[ejxcept as otherwise expressly provided by statute, . . .\u201d (\u00a7 1032, subd. (b).) Section 1033.5, subdivision (c)(2), added by the 1986 amendments, expressly provides that \u201c[allowable costs shall be reasonably necessary to the conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation.\u201d (See fn. 5, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">It is a fundamental premise of statutory interpretation that the objective is to \u201cascertain and effectuate legislative intent.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Woodhead </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1002, 1007 [239 Cal.Rptr. 656, 741 P.2d 154].) In determining intent, we look first to the words themselves. \u201cWhen the language is clear and unambiguous, there is no need for construction.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1007-1008.)  The plain language of section 1033.5, subdivision (c)(2) reflects a clear intent to limit the recovery of costs to those which are \u201creasonably necessary.\u201d There is nothing in the language which would limit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>its application only to costs allowable at the discretion of the court; it applies equally to costs otherwise allowable as a matter of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">RRNS makes no argument to the contrary; it does not argue section 1033.5, subdivision (c)(2) has any other meaning or its meaning is ambiguous. In fact, it does not even discuss the statute. It relies instead on the unsubstantiated assertion that allowance of filing fees as a matter of right precludes any inquiry into their necessity. Even if it were well established by case law prior to 1986 that the right to recover filing fees as costs was absolute, a court may infer that the Legislature was aware of that construction and intended to alter the law in that regard when it enacted section 1033.5, subdivision (c)(2). <em>(Palos Verdes Faculty Assn. </em>v. <em>Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified Sch. Dist. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 650, 659 [147 Cal.Rptr. 359, 580 P.2d 1155].) Therefore, the intent and effect of section 1033.5, subdivision (c)(2) is to authorize a trial court to disallow recovery of costs, including filing fees, when it determines the costs were incurred unnecessarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">When a trial court is mistaken about the scope of its discretion, even if the mistake is reasonable, an action taken in accord with that mistaken view is error. <em>(City of Sacramento </em>v. <em>Drew </em>(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 1287, 1297-1298 [255 Cal.Rptr. 704].)  The trial court\u2019s order denying Perko\u2019s motion to tax costs provides no explanation of the basis for its decision. It appears the court incorrectly believed it had no authority to disallow the filing fee as a cost. We will, therefore, remand the issue of costs in order to allow the trial court to determine the reasonableness of the filing fee and to exercise its discretion in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">\n<em>Imposition of Sanctions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b199-10\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b199-11\">The judgment and the trial court\u2019s order denying appellant\u2019s motion to tax costs and awarding respondents\u2019 filing fee as a cost and sanctions are reversed and the matter remanded to the trial court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Respondents\u2019 request for sanctions on appeal is denied.
