J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ats\">Plaintiffs George and Tom Massie (Massie) appeal a judgment favoring defendant AAR Western Skyways, Inc. (AAR), on Massie\u2019s complaint for negligence, products liability, fraud, breach of contract, and common counts after Massie declared inability to proceed to trial because of the superior court\u2019s rulings on various pretrial motions. Massie contends the court erred in granting AAR\u2019s motion to strike Massie\u2019s designation of expert witnesses and denying Massie\u2019s motion to submit a tardy designation of expert witnesses; excluding the testimony of asserted percipient witness Dick Davy; and granting AAR\u2019s motion to strike Massie\u2019s demand for jury trial and denying Massie\u2019s motion for jury trial after waiver. Concluding the court should have relieved Massie from the jury waiver and permitted Davy to testify as a percipient witness, we reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Superior Court Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">In February 1989 Massie sued AAR for personal injuries and property damage allegedly incurred in April 1988 when Massie\u2019s aircraft suffered an in-flight engine failure and made a forced emergency landing because of AAR\u2019s errors in overhauling the aircraft\u2019s engine in April 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">In June 1989 AAR answered Massie\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">In July 1989 the parties filed a joint at issue memorandum noting Massie requested a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">On May 11,1990, at a trial setting conference, the court set the matter for trial on September 4, 1990. The court ordered the parties to exchange their first designations of expert witnesses by May 17, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">On May 17, 1990, AAR served on Massie its first designation of expert witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">On June 22, 1990, Massie served AAR with a first designation of expert witnesses naming as experts chiropractor Randall Keith and aircraft mechanics expert Davy.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">On July 9, 1990, AAR filed a motion to strike Massie\u2019s designation of expert witnesses as untimely. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 2034, subd. (j).)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The same day, Massie filed a motion to submit a tardy designation of expert witnesses. (\u00a7 2034, subd. (1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-13\">On July 24, 1990, the superior court granted AAR\u2019s motion to strike Massie\u2019s designation of expert witnesses. The court denied Massie\u2019s motion to submit a tardy designation of expert witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-14\">On August 6,1990, the parties appeared for a joint disposition conference. The court stated Massie had waived the right to a jury trial by not posting jury fees as required under San Diego Superior Court Rules,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> division II, rule 1.12. In the parties\u2019 joint disposition conference report Massie named Davy and Keith as witnesses to be called at trial; AAR objected, asserting Massie was attempting to circumvent the court\u2019s earlier order striking Massie\u2019s designation of expert witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>On August 7, 1990, Massie deposited $145 advance jury fees and filed a demand for jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">On August 9, 1990, AAR filed an ex parte application to strike Massie\u2019s demand for jury trial. The court granted AAR\u2019s application. The same day Massie filed an ex parte application for an order allowing jury trial after waiver. The court denied Massie\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">On August 15, 1990, Massie filed an ex parte application for an order shortening time to file papers \u201crenewing\u201d the motion to submit a tardy designation of expert witnesses. The court denied Massie\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">On August 29, 1990, AAR filed motions <em>in limine </em>to preclude testimony by Davy and Keith.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">On August 31, 1990, we denied Massie\u2019s petition for writ of mandate seeking relief from the superior court\u2019s orders granting AAR\u2019s motion to strike Massie\u2019s untimely designation of expert witnesses and AAR\u2019s motion to strike Massie\u2019s demand for jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">On September 4,1990, the matter came for trial. The court granted AAR\u2019s motion to preclude Davy from testifying in any capacity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Massie then announced inability to proceed. The court entered judgment favoring AAR. Massie appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">Right to Jury Trial</p>\n<p id=\"ARx\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b328-13\">Massie\u2019s Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b328-14\">As an officer of the court Massie\u2019s counsel bore professional responsibility to be aware of and knowledgeable about local court rules. <em>(Moyal </em>v. <em>Lanphear </em>(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 491, 499 [256 Cal.Rptr. 296]; <em>Annex British Cars, Inc. </em>v. <em>Parker-Rhodes </em>(1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 788, 791 [244 Cal.Rptr. 48].)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Effective July 1, 1990, rule 1.12 provided in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-5\">\u201cWhen setting a case for trial, the court shall determine which party demands a jury, who will post fees and set a deadline for the deposit of the fees. Absent a court order to the contrary, said fees shall be posted at least five court days before the joint disposition conference. Failure to deposit the fees on or before the date ordered and/or set forth above will constitute a waiver of the right to a jury, [\u00b6] At the time of the disposition conference, the court will notify the parties of any such waiver.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">On August 6, 1990, when the parties appeared for the joint disposition conference, Massie had not deposited jury fees. Thus, the court properly notified the parties Massie had waived the right to a jury trial. (Rule 1.12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">Massie\u2019s Request for Jury Trial After Waiver</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">On August 7, 1990, Massie deposited $145 advance jury fees and filed a demand for jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">On August 9, 1990, Massie sought an order allowing jury trial after waiver. The court denied Massie\u2019s request. At AAR\u2019s request the court struck Massie\u2019s demand for jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">Massie contends the court erred in not allowing a jury trial because in early August 1990 the matter had already been calendared as a jury trial, the parties had submitted requested jury instructions, and the trial date was almost one month away. Citing section 575.2, subdivision (b), and section 631, subdivision (d), Massie contends the court should have granted relief from the jury waiver because upon learning of rule 1.12 counsel promptly posted jury fees. We conclude the court erred in not relieving Massie from the jury waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-13\">The Law</p>\n<p id=\"b329-14\">Section 575.1, subdivision (a), authorizes adoption of superior court local rules \u201cdesigned to expedite and facilitate the business of the court\u201d and to \u201cprovide for the supervision and judicial management of actions from the date they are filed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-15\">Section 575.2, subdivision (a), provides such local rules may make provision for imposition of penalties for failure to comply with the rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Section 575.2, subdivision (b), provides: \u201cIt is the intent of the Legislature that if a failure to comply with these rules is the responsibility of counsel and not of the party, any penalty shall be imposed on counsel and shall not adversely affect the party\u2019s cause of action or defense thereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Section 631, subdivision (a)(5), provides a party waives the right to a jury trial by failing to deposit one day\u2019s advance jury fees 25 days before the scheduled trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Section 631, subdivision (d), provides: \u201cThe court may, in its discretion upon just terms, allow a trial by jury although there may have been a waiver of a trial by jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">In <em>Cooks </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 723 [274 Cal.Rptr. 113], the superior court as a sanction denied a jury trial because defense counsel failed to submit proposed jury instructions within the deadline set by local \u201cfast-track\u201d rules of court. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 724-725.) The defendant was not personally responsible for omitting the jury instructions. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 725-726.) The Court of Appeal issued mandate directing the superior court to vacate its orders striking the defendant\u2019s jury request and denying the defendant\u2019s motion to reinstate her demand for jury trial. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 727-728.) The Court of Appeal construed section 575.2, subdivision (b), to mean \u201cany sanction imposed shall be only upon counsel, not the innocent party, and that such sanction upon counsel shall not adversely affect the party\u2019s cause of action or defense thereto.\u201d (224 Cal.App.3d at p. 726.) The Court of Appeal noted: \u201cCases have held section 575.2, subdivision (b) applicable both to fast-track local rules and other local rules, promulgated pursuant to section 575.1, affecting supervision and management of actions.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">In <em>Moyal </em>v. <em>Lanphear, supra, </em>208 Cal.App.3d 491, we reversed the superior court\u2019s sanction of dismissal against a plaintiff for plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2019s failure to file a joint at-issue memorandum within the time specified under local fast-track rules. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 494-496, 502-504.) We stated section 575.2, subdivision (b), \u201cconstitutes an exception to the general rule the negligence of an attorney is imputed to the client. [Citation.]\u201d (208 Cal.App.3d at p. 499.) We noted in enacting section 575.2, subdivision (b), the Legislature \u201cmade clear its intent a party\u2019s cause of action should not be impaired or destroyed by his or her attorney\u2019s procedural mistakes. [Citation.] Further, the court is required to invoke section 575.2(b) on its own motion when appropriate to guarantee the protection of an innocent party\u2019s right of action. [Citation.]\u201d (208 Cal.App.3d at p. 502.)</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">In <em>State of California </em>ex rel. <em>Public Works Bd. </em>v. <em>Bragg </em>(1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 1018 [228 Cal.Rptr. 576], the appellate court reversed the superior court\u2019s imposition of the sanction of issue preclusion against a party for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>counsel\u2019s failure to file an appraisal report or list of experts within the deadline required by local rules. The appellate court stated: \u201cAny sanctions imposed should have been limited to counsel because counsel, not the client, was responsible for filing the incomplete appraisal report in violation of the local rules.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1023.)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">\u201cCourts have held that, given the public policy favoring trial by jury, the trial court should grant a motion to be relieved of a jury waiver \u2018unless, and except, where granting such a motion would work serious hardship to the objecting party.\u2019 <em>(Boal </em>v. <em>Price Waterhouse &amp; Co. </em>(1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 806, 809 [212 CaLRptr. 42].) Where doubt exists concerning the propriety of granting relief from such waiver, this doubt, by reason of the constitutional guarantee of right to jury trial (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 16), should be resolved in favor of the party requesting trial by jury. [Citation.] [\u00b6] The court abuses its discretion in denying relief where there has been no prejudice to the other party or to the court from an inadvertent waiver. [Citations.] The prejudice which must be shown from granting relief from the waiver is prejudice from the granting of relief and not prejudice from the jury trial. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Gann </em>v. <em>Williams Brothers Realty, Inc. </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1698, 1703-1704 [283 Cal.Rptr. 128].)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">In <em>Winston </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 600 [242 Cal-Rptr. 113], a party suffered waiver of a jury trial for not timely posting jury fees. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 601-602.) The superior court denied the party\u2019s motion for relief from the waiver. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 602.) The Court of Appeal issued mandate directing the superior court to restore the case to the jury calendar. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 603.) The Court of Appeal noted section 631 expressly provided \u201ca court may, in its discretion, allow a trial by jury although there has been a waiver. Discretion in this regard is abused if relief has been denied where there has been no prejudice to the other party or to the court from an inadvertent waiver. [Citations.]\u201d (196 Cal.App.3d at p. 602.)</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">In <em>Byram </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1977) 74 Cal.App.3d 648 [141 Cal.Rptr. 604], the plaintiff inadvertently failed to deposit jury fees on time. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 650.) Jury trial was thus waived. (\u00a7 631.) The Court of Appeal stated: \u201cThe purpose of section 631 is to provide a means whereby the parties may waive a jury but not to impose conditions constituting an irrevocable waiver, and the trial court has discretion to allow a jury trial despite a prior waiver. [Citation.]\u201d (74 Cal.App.3d at pp. 650-651.) The Court of Appeal held \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>denial of a jury trial after waiver where no prejudice is shown to the other party or to the court is prejudicial.\" <em>(Id. </em>at p. 654.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Massie\u2019s not timely posting jury fees was apparently attributable to counsel\u2019s unfamiliarity with rule 1.12.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The resulting waiver of jury trial necessarily adversely affected Massie\u2019s case. Nothing in the record suggests Massie was responsible for counsel\u2019s failure. (\u00a7 575.2, subd. (b); <em>Cooks </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>224 Cal.App.3d at p. 726; <em>Moyal </em>v. <em>Lanphear, supra, </em>208 Cal.App.3d at p. 502; <em>State of California </em>ex rel. <em>Public Works Bd. </em>v. <em>Bragg, supra, </em>183 Cal.App.3d at p. 1023.) Upon learning of rule 1.12, Massie\u2019s counsel acted promptly to post jury fees and seek relief from the jury waiver. <em>(Byram </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>74 Cal.App.3d at p. 653.) Further, nothing in the record suggests granting Massie relief from the jury waiver would prejudice AAR. <em>(Gann </em>v. <em>Williams Brothers Realty, Inc., supra, </em>231 Cal.App.3d at p. 1704; <em>Winston </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>196 Cal.App.3d at p. 602; <em>Byram </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>74 Cal.App.3d at p. 654.) To the contrary, from at least as early as the July 1989 joint at issue memorandum AAR knew Massie wanted a jury trial. By August 6, 1990, both parties proposed their requested jury instructions and included them in their joint disposition conference report. Under these circumstances, the superior court should have permitted a jury trial and imposed any penalty only on Massie\u2019s counsel. (\u00a7 575.2, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Expert Witnesses<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">The judgment is reversed. Each side shall bear its own costs on appeal.

Although it did not do so in the trial court, real party filed opposition in this court and argues that petitioners\u2019 ignorance of local court rules is not excusable neglect. [Citations.] This argument misses the point. [\u00b6] Where the right to jury is threatened, the crucial focus is whether any prejudice will be suffered by any party or the court if a motion for relief from waiver is granted. [Citation.] A trial court abuses its discretion as a matter of law when *. . . relief has been denied where there has been no prejudice to the other party or to the court from an inadvertent waiver. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citations.] [\u00b6] Here, petitioners sought a jury trial at every conceivable stage of the proceedings and took prompt action upon receiving notice that the proper amount of jury fees had not been deposited. More significantly, neither real party nor the court established that any prejudice would result by allowing a jury.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>atp. 104.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b332-8\"> In <em>Winston </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>196 Cal.App.3d 600, the appellate court stated: \u201cCounsel\u2019s mistake as to the time for depositing jury fees resulted from the existence of two conflicting statutes.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 602.)
