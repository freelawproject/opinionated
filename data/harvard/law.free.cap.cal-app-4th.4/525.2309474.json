J.\u2014</author>\n<p id=\"A32\">As will be discussed more fully below, we dismissed petitioner Joseph A.\u2019s appeal from a judgment declaring his minor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>children free from his custody. He then filed the instant petition for a writ of habeas corpus in which he seeks to have his appeal reinstated or, in the alternative, to raise certain issues afresh in a collateral attack on the judgment rendered by the trial court. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we deny all relief and discharge the order to show cause previously issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Although, in light of our resolution, we need give no extensive recitation of the facts of the case, the procedural history must be set out in some detail. On April 1, 1988, Sherry Lynn T., the mother of the minor children (Mother) filed a petition to have Issac and Cassi declared free from the custody and control of Joseph A. (Father). It was alleged that Father had not contacted the children since July 1, 1985, and had not provided for their support, and that these omissions were done with the intent to abandon. Father responded in propria persona, asserting that Mother had actually concealed the children from him. It appears that Father filed a complaint with the district attorney, alleging that Mother and her husband, Steven T., were unlawfully interfering with his visitation rights under a dissolution decree, which he then began attempting to enforce.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">After the preparation of a report by the probation officer, and referral of Father to a psychologist, a 12-day trial was held at which Father was represented by appointed counsel, Timothy Guhin. The issue of abandonment was tried first, and although the testimony of Father and Mother was in sharp conflict, the trial court found that Father had made no serious efforts to contact the children during the period from July of 1985, until the petition was filed, and further found the intent to abandon. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 232, subd. (a)(1).)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The hearing then proceeded to a determination of whether the children\u2019s best interests required a termination of the parent-child relationship. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 232, subd. (b).) Although both sides presented expert psychological testimony, the trial court found that of Mother\u2019s expert, Dr. William Nelson, more persuasive. Dr. Nelson testified, in essence, that Father had serious personality and psychological defects amounting to a \u201csevere mental disorder.\u201d He also testified that the children were afraid of their father, and that even visitation, at the present time, would be detrimental. His conclusion was that the best interests of the children required a stable family unit such as they were currently enjoying.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">The court announced its findings on February 23, 1989, although the judgment was not filed until March 24, 1989. On April 14, Father filed a motion for new trial; due to other obligations (both personal and professional), counsel requested that the court continue the hearing for \u201cas long a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>period of time [as]. . . possible.\u201d As a result, the hearing was set for August 3, 1989, and then continued again to August 31. On the latter date, the motion was denied. In the meantime, notice of entry of judgment was finally served on Father on July 20, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Father filed a notice of appeal on October 11, 1989. On our own motion, we requested briefing on the issue of whether the appeal should be dismissed as untimely filed. Father, then represented by attorney James Bostwick, argued that his failure to comply with the 60-day limit of California Rules of Court, rule 39(b),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was excused because the trial court failed to apprise him of his right to appeal. (See rules 250 (renumbered 470 eff. Jan. 1, 1991), 251.) We ruled that, even assuming that this failure gave rise to a right to a late appeal (see <em>Castro </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 614 [115 Cal.Rptr. 312]), Father failed to show that he was actually ignorant of his right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Father also argued that his failure to file the notice of appeal on time was excused because the trial court did entertain his motion for a new trial, albeit erroneously,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> thus misleading him into believing that the motion was appropriate. We noted, however, that the notice of appeal was untimely even under this theory, as it was not filed within 30 days of the denial of the motion. (Rule 3(a).) Accordingly, we dismissed the appeal by order dated January 25, 1991, and a remittitur issued on April 1, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">The petition for habeas corpus with which we are now concerned was filed on June 5, 1991. Representing Father are attorneys for Appellate Defenders, Inc., which was responsible for supervising the work of attorney Bostwick on the original appeal. Attorney Ellen Geis, for Appellate Defenders, Inc., submitted an affidavit in which she averred that Attorney Bostwick had been advised to expect a motion to dismiss, and to contact the trial attorney concerning the delay in filing the notice of appeal. After we requested briefing on the issue, Mr. Bostwick told Ms. Geis that he had not contacted trial counsel, Timothy Guhin, or his client. Instead, he intended to raise the issues discussed above. Ms. Geis suggested that this argument was unlikely to succeed, and advised that Bostwick look into the factual basis for a motion pursuant to <em>In re Benoit </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 72 [109 Cal.Rptr. 785, 514 P.2d 97]. This was not done.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Following the dismissal, Appellate Defenders, Inc., elected to pursue Father\u2019s other possible remedies because it was felt that Father had not received the effective assistance of counsel on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>The issues presented by this petition\u2014some explicitly, some by implication\u2014are to a large extent intertwined. First, we must determine whether the doctrine of constructive filing under <em>In re Benoit, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d 72 applies to judgments under Civil Code section 232. As subparts of that issue, we must decide whether the motion for new trial should be construed as a notice of appeal, and also consider the effect of the allegedly ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, which arguably resulted in an avoidable dismissal. Secondly, if the answer to the first question is in the negative and the appeal therefore cannot be resuscitated, we must decide whether Father may seek collateral relief from the judgment by way of habeas corpus. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">We will discuss the factual assertions of the petition in more detail as required. We will note at this point, however, that Father represents that the stepparent adoption proceeding has been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">\n<em>Does the doctrine of constructive filing apply to judgments under Civil Code</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">\n<em>section 232? No.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">As Father recognizes, one reported case squarely addresses the above issue after the 1987 amendment to rule 39, which we discuss below, and holds that the doctrine of constructive filing does not apply in this situation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>(In re A. M. </em>(1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 319 [264 Cal.Rptr. 666].) However, he argues both that <em>In re A. M. </em>was wrongly decided, and that, even if it is correct, it need not and should not be applied to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">This court held in <em>In re Fredrick E. H. </em>(1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 344, 347 [215 Cal.Rptr. 171], that the failure to file a timely notice of appeal in a proceeding under Civil Code section 232 deprived the appellate court of jurisdiction to hear the appeal. This holding was in accordance with the law generally applicable to civil cases. (See e.g., <em>Hollister Convalescent Hosp. </em>v. <em>Rico </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 660, 666-667 [125 Cal.Rptr. 757, 542 P.2d 1349].) However, in 1987, rule 39(a) was amended to provide that \u201c[t]he rules governing appeals from the superior court in criminal cases are applicable to all appeals from juvenile court and any appeal in an action under Civil Code section 232, except where otherwise expressly provided by this rule or rule 39.1, <em>or where the application of a particular rule would be clearly impracticable or </em>inappropriate.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>In criminal cases, the doctrine of constructive filing effectively extends the time in which to file an appeal otherwise governed by rule 31(a). The appellant in <em>In re A. M. </em>contended that the amendment to rule 39 therefore impliedly incorporated the doctrine of constructive filing which was applied to rule 31 by <em>In re Benoit, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d. 72. Assuming, without deciding, that this construction was correct,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the court nevertheless found the doctrine inapplicable under the exception stressed above. Citing the \u201cspecial need for finality in cases under section 232,\u201d and noting the danger of imperiling adoption proceedings, the court found it inappropriate to extend <em>In re Benoit </em>to appeals involving the termination of parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">We agree that the doctrine of constructive filing may not be indiscriminately extended to cases involving the termination of parental rights. However, this case presents a particular situation in which the doctrine would apply to criminal cases\u2014one that requires further discussion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">There is, of course, a federal constitutional right to counsel in criminal cases under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The federal right is extended to the states through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>(Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright </em>(1963) 372 U.S. 335, 339-340 [9 L.Ed.2d 799, 802-803, 83 S.Ct. 792, 93 A.L.R.2d 733].)  The concept of due process as applied to the termination of parental rights may also include the right to appointed counsel.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>(Lassiter </em>v. <em>Department of Social Services </em>(1981) 452 U.S. 18, 27 [68 L.Ed.2d 640, 649-650, 101 S.Ct. 2153].)</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Where there is a due process right to counsel, there is a concomitant right to the effective assistance of counsel. (See <em>Adoption of Michael D. </em>(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 122, 135 [256 Cal.Rptr. 884].) To this extent we disagree with the contrary holding in <em>In re Ammanda G. </em>(1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 1075, 1080 [231 Cal.Rptr. 372], It is true, as we have noted above, that in a proceeding involving parental rights, the child\u2019s interests should be given great weight. However, if counsel\u2019s ineffective representation of the parent has resulted in an inappropriate termination of the parent-child relationship, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>the child may have an interest equal to that of the parent\u2019s in its restoration. Thus, we believe with the court in <em>Adoption of Michael D., supra, </em>that the denial of effective assistance at trial is an issue properly presented to a reviewing court.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">This conclusion bears on our consideration of the request for relief under <em>In re Benoit, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d 72, but, as we explain, does not require that it be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">It is true that relief is granted to a criminal defendant in a variety of situations, one of which is the justifiable reliance on the promise of counsel that a timely notice will be filed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In this situation, the attorney\u2019s inaction can usually be justly characterized as ineffective assistance, and it certainly was so in this case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> If, to make the guarantee of counsel genuine, a parent must be permitted to raise ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal, it may very plausibly be argued that he must be given a concomitant right to pursue his appellate rights despite his attorney\u2019s inexcusable failure to perfect the appeal in a timely fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">However, we cannot accept this argument for the reasons of policy discussed in <em>In re A. M., supra, </em>216 Cal.App.3d 319. In our view, this is the point at which the interests of the child and parent collide, and at which the child\u2019s interest in finality prevails.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">In <em>Adoption of Alexander S. </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 857 [245 Cal.Rptr. 1, 750 P.2d 778], the trial court had rejected the natural mother\u2019s efforts to withdraw her consent to the adoption of the minor. She failed to appeal the judgment denying her petition to withdraw consent, but did appeal the denial, a few months later, of her petition to establish the paternity of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>alleged natural father. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 7006.) In that appeal, she raised issues relating to the adoption proceeding.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The Court of Appeal recognized that it had no appellate jurisdiction to consider those claims, but elected to treat this portion of the appeal as a petition for habeas corpus and found, inter alia, that the mother had not received effective assistance of counsel in the proceedings leading to her original consent. <em>(Adoption of Alexander S., supra, </em>44 Cal.3d atpp. 862-863.)</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The Supreme Court reversed. After discussing several procedural gaffes committed by the intermediate court\u2014including the failure to apply the rule that habeas corpus cannot serve as a substitute for appeal\u2014it acknowledged that habeas corpus is available as a means of collateral relief, and may serve as a belated appeal, where the basis is the ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Munoz </em>(1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 559, 563 [124 Cal.Rptr. 322].) However, the court then held flatly that adoption proceedings were not, in this respect, governed by the rules and principles applicable to criminal matters, and that\u2014with exceptions not here relevant<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\u2014\u201chabeas corpus may not be used to collaterally attack a final nonmodifiable judgment in an adoption-related action.\u201d <em>(Alexander S., supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at pp. 867-868.)</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">We find no basis for distinguishing the holding here. The petition under Civil Code section 232 can reasonably be described as \u201cadoption-related,\u201d as the purpose here was to permit adoption by the stepfather. However, we do not rest our decision on that basis, and do not create a distinction between those minors for whom adoption is imminent, those for whom it is probable, and those for whom it is merely a hope. As the United States Supreme Court stated, in refusing to recognize federal habeas corpus as a remedy in child custody matters, \u201c[i]t is undisputed that children require secure, stable, long-term, continuous relationships with their parents or foster parents. There is little that can be as detrimental to a child\u2019s sound development as uncertainty over whether he is to remain in his current \u2018home\u2019 . . . especially when such uncertainty is prolonged.\u201d <em>(Lehman </em>v. <em>Lycoming County Children\u2019s Services </em>(1982) 458 U.S. 502, 513-514 [73 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>L.Ed.2d 928, 938-939, 102 S.Ct. 3231]; see also <em>In re A. M., supra, </em>216 Cal.App.3d at p. 322.) We recognize that <em>In re Benoit, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d at p. 78, held that habeas corpus is the proper vehicle to enforce the right of appeal. However, we follow <em>Alexander S. </em>and hold that the remedy may not be employed as an means of obtaining belated relief in proceedings under Civil Code section 232.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">We concede that the result will be harsh in some cases, and may be so here. We have considered the desirability of a more flexible standard, but can formulate no rules for the applicability of such a standard under which we could confidently predict that more good would be done than harm. In reviewing an application, the appellate court would be in a poor position to evaluate the merits of the proposed appeal, or the effect of the delay on the child. In some cases, such as this one, the parent may have acted diligently and been the victim of attorney incompetence\u2014but this should not require relief if the judgment appears sound and the child is happily placed. Nor should a dilatory parent be allowed to proceed, if the appellate court believes, on limited information, that some error occurred at trial. Further, the court is uninformed of the child\u2019s current circumstances, and cannot resolve contradictory assertions by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Recently, the court in <em>Mauro B. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 949 [281 Cal.Rptr. 507] rejected a putative father\u2019s efforts to seek review by writ of a judgment denying him paternal rights, where he had failed to file a timely notice of appeal. The court observed that extraordinary relief has historically been held unavailable where the remedy by appeal has been lost by neglect. (See <em>Phelan </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1950) 35 Cal.2d 363, 370-371 [217 P.2d 951].) Although a dissenting justice argued that the neglect of counsel in failing to perfect the appeal constituted the \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d justifying extraordinary review briefly mentioned in <em>Adoption of Alexander S. </em>(44 Cal.3d at p. 865), the majority disagreed. Instead, it relied on <em>In re A. M. </em>and the special need for finality applicable to such proceedings, and rejected the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The court also noted, as we have above, that the underlying facts of a case should not influence the court in determining whether to entertain such a petition. <em>(Mauro B. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>230 Cal.App.3d at p. 955.) We think this rule particularly important in adoption-related proceedings. If an appellate court inaccurately evaluates the merits of a regular civil or criminal proceeding, and decides to grant extraordinary review based on this evaluation, no serious inconvenience or injustice will usually result from the delay in obtaining a final decision. However, in adoption-related proceedings, the simple fact that an apparently final judgment is placed in danger of being upset must have a deleterious effect on the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Father asks that we construe the request for new trial as a notice of appeal, under the rule of liberal construction mandated by rule 1(a). We decline to do so. Father does not cite, and our research has not disclosed, any case extending the principle so far. The crucial element specified in the rule is that a document express the party\u2019s intent to <em>appeal. </em>Where this is clear, imperfections of form, or such misdirections as addressing the document to the trial court instead of the clerk, are properly disregarded. (See <em>In re Gonsalves, supra, </em>48 Cal.2d 638.) However, where a party seeks a new trial, he is unequivocally requesting that an error be corrected by the trial court; in most civil cases, of course, the remedy of appeal is preserved. The fact that this was not true here does not retrospectively convert the motion for new trial into a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">As noted above, Father filed this petition for writ of habeas corpus, seeking the primary relief of the reinstatement of his appeal. He also sought to raise several new issues, including the ineffective assistance of counsel at the trial itself. He argued that his original appellate counsel, Bostwick, had himself rendered ineffective assistance by failing to raise these issues, making relief by habeas corpus appropriate. In a criminal case, this approach may lead to a recalling of the remittitur even after an unsuccessful appeal, and reinstatement of the appeal with the opportunity given to raise new issues. (See <em>In re Smith </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 192, 202-204 [90 Cal.Rptr. 1, 474 P.2d 969].)</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">We answer this contention here by reference once again to <em>Alexander S. </em>An action under Civil Code section 232 is not a criminal matter, and matters of \u201csound public policy\u201d require that finality prevail over the option for protracted litigation. (44 Cal.3d at p. 868.)</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">Finally, Father asks this court to reevaluate the decision of the trial court in light of the dismissal of the stepparent adoption proceeding. We believe that only in the most compelling circumstances should we exercise our power to consider the effect of postjudgment events. (See <em>In re Randi D. </em>(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 624, 627-628 [257 Cal.Rptr. 421].) To do otherwise would rob of all finality precisely those judgments as to which certainty is most important. We reject Father\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">McKinster, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b421-9\"> All further rule references are to the California Rules of Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b421-10\"> The trial court has no power to entertain a motion for new trial after a judgment freeing a minor from his parent\u2019s custody under Civil Code section 232.

Code, \u00a7 238; <em>In re Manuel J. </em>(1984) 150 Cal.App.3d 513, 520-521 [197 Cal.Rptr. 777].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b422-11\"> We are aware of one case which questioned the holding in <em>In re AM. </em>However, the opinion was depublished by order of the Supreme Court dated September 20, 1990. <em>(In re Baby Boy B. </em>(G008916).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b423-8\"> We have serious doubts about this assumption. Rule 39 applies other \u201crules\u201d to juvenile appeals; the doctrine of constructive filing, as it now exists, is judicially created and does not rest for its effect on any of the Rules of Court. Thus, the amendment to rule 39 hardly compels the conclusion that the drafters intended to import into juvenile procedure all of the case law applicable to criminal appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b423-9\"> Whether a parent is entitled to counsel as a matter of due process depends upon the extent to which counsel\u2019s assistance would be necessary, or even helpful, in presenting the parent\u2019s case.

Thus, we believe with the court in <em>Adoption of Michael D., supra, </em>that the denial of effective assistance [of counsel] at trial is an issue properly presented to a reviewing court.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>pp. 531-532.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-7\">(3) \u201cIt is true that relief [from the late filing of a notice of appeal] is granted to a criminal defendant in a variety of situations, one of which is the justifiable reliance on the promise of counsel that a timely notice [of appeal] will be filed. In this situation, the attorney\u2019s inaction can usually be justly characterized as ineffective assistance, and it certainly was so in this case. If, to make the guarantee of counsel genuine, a parent must be permitted to raise ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal, it may very plausibly be argued that he must be given a concomitant right to pursue his appellate rights despite his attorney\u2019s inexcusable failure to perfect the appeal in a timely fashion.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 532, fns. omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">With all of the above in mind, I turn now to the basis of my disagreement with the majority\u2019s conclusion that a constructive filing of the father\u2019s appeal should not be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">It was, of course, our Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>In re Benoit </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 72 [109 Cal.Rptr. 785, 514 P.2d 97] (hereinafter referred to simply as <em>Benoit) </em>which first extended the doctrine of \u201cconstructive filing,\u201d on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel, to late-filed criminal appeals. <em>Benoit </em>did not countenance the indiscriminate application of the constructive filing doctrine to all criminal cases in which it could be argued that there had been \u201cineffective assistance of counsel\u201d in failing to file a timely notice of appeal. Rather, <em>Benoit </em>limited the application of the constructive filing doctrine to those situations where the late filing of the notice of appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>occurred in the context of (a) the justifiable reliance of the defendant on his or her attorney to timely file a notice of appeal, (b) the due diligence of the defendant in assuring himself or herself that a notice of appeal was being timely filed, and (c) the ineffective assistance of counsel in nevertheless failing to timely file such a notice. (Benoit, at pp. 86-89.) It is the constructive filing doctrine, as specifically limited and applied by <em>Benoit, </em>that the father seeks to have applied to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\"><em>A: Incorporating the Benoit Constructive Filing Doctrine Into Procedural Rules for Free From Custody </em>Cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The primary \u201churdle\u201d to be crossed by the father in making his argument is the fact that <em>Benoit </em>applies to criminal cases and this is not a criminal case\u2014it is a \u201cfree from custody\u201d case brought under Civil Code section 232 et seq. (hereinafter referred to as an FFC case). Both the majority and the father seem to concur\u2014quite rightly, I think\u2014that, if this \u201churdle\u201d is to be overcome at all, it must be overcome by use of rule 39(a) of the California Rules of Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It must first be determined, then, whether rule 39(a) can be applied in such a way as to \u201ctransport\u201d the <em>Benoit </em>constructive filing doctrine to FFC cases. Rule 39(a) states, in pertinent part: \u201cThe rules governing appeals from the superior court in criminal cases are applicable to all appeals from the juvenile court and any appeal in an action under Civil Code section 232, except where otherwise expressly provided by this rule or rule 39.1, or where the application of a particular rule would be clearly impracticable or inappropriate.\u201d The 60-day statute of limitations for filing notices of appeal in criminal cases set forth in rule 31(a), then, applies as well to FFC cases. So too, the argument goes, the <em>Benoit </em>constructive filing doctrine, to the extent that it qualifies the 60-day time limit of rule 31(a), must also apply in FFC cases. There are two positions which are maintained, to a greater or lesser degree, by the majority in rejection of this argument that the <em>Benoit </em>constructive filing doctrine applies in FFC cases by virtue of the operation of rule 39(a):</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">(1) First, the majority notes that rule 39(a) applies only to \u201crules,\u201d while the <em>Benoit </em>constructive filing doctrine is only a judicially created doctrine. The majority professes to have \u201cserious doubts\u201d as to whether rule 39(a) applies to anything other than actual procedural rules of the California Rules of Court\u2014preferring, apparently, a somewhat literalistic interpretation of the word \u201crules\u201d in rule 39(a). I have no such doubts. Rule 31(a) does not exist in a vacuum; it, like all other procedural rules, has come to have a <em>particular </em>meaning, in the context of its application, by virtue of its interpretation and application <em>in actual cases. </em>\u201cRule 31(a)\u201d <em>means </em>\u201crule 31(a) of the California <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>Rules of Court as it has been interpreted and applied.\u201d Since our Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>Benoit, </em>rule 31(a) has been understood as being qualified by a constructive filing exception in certain situations concerning the ineffective assistance of counsel. It is <em>this </em>\u201crule 31(a),\u201d the qualified rule, which is made applicable to FFC cases by rule 39(a)\u2014unless the application of the rule, as qualified, \u201cwould be clearly impracticable or inappropriate.\u201d This \u201cunless\u201d provides the basis of the majority\u2019s second position taken in rejection of the argument that the <em>Benoit </em>constructive filing doctrine should apply in FFC cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">(2) The majority finds, on policy grounds, that a minor\u2019s interests in the finality of FFC proceedings outweigh a parent\u2019s interests in being able to obtain a full and fair adjudication of the termination of his or her parental relationship with that minor and, on the basis of that finding, concludes that it would be impracticable or inappropriate (to use the language of rule 39(a)) to permit the application of the <em>Benoit </em>constructive filing doctrine in FFC cases.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is here, on the issue of conflicting policy considerations, that I have my clearest disagreement with the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">I do not contest the majority\u2019s position that a minor\u2019s interest in final, stable, long-term relationships is an important one\u2014but I cannot agree that the law, in seeking to protect a minor\u2019s interests in such relationships, should countenance an irrevocable and complete severance of a parent-child relationship on the basis of anything less than a full and fair adjudication of the grounds alleged in support of such a severance.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The United States Supreme Court has explicitly recognized that: \u201c[F]reedom of personal choice in matters of family life is a fundamental liberty interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. [Citations.] [\u00b6] The fundamental liberty interest of natural parents in the care, custody, and management of their child does not evaporate simply because they have not been model parents or have lost temporary custody of their child to the State. Even when blood relationships are strained, parents retain a vital interest in preventing the irretrievable destruction of their family life. If anything, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>persons faced with forced dissolution of their parental rights have a more critical need for procedural protections than do those resisting state intervention into ongoing family affairs. When the State moves to destroy weakened familial bonds, it must provide the parents with fundamentally fair procedures.7\u201d The court\u2019s footnote 7 provides: \u201cWe <em>therefore reject respondent </em>[\u2019s] . . . <em>claim that a parental rights termination proceeding does not interfere with a fundamental liberty interest. </em>[Citations.] <em>The fact that important liberty interests of the child and its foster parents may also be affected by a permanent neglect proceeding does not justify denying the natural parents constitutionally adequate procedures. </em>Nor can the State refuse to provide natural parents adequate procedural safeguards on the ground that the family unit already has broken down; that is the very issue the permanent neglect proceeding is meant to decide.\u201d <em>(Santosky </em>v. <em>Kramer </em>(1982) 455 U.S. 745, 753-754 [71 L.Ed.2d 599, 606-607, 102 S.Ct. 1388], italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Our own Supreme Court has likewise recognized the \u201cfundamental liberty interest\u201d which a parent has in retaining and maintaining a parent-child relationship <em>(In re Laura F. </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 826, 844 [191 Cal.Rptr. 464, 662 P.2d 922]) and has also recognized that constitutional principles of due process serve to protect this fundamental liberty interest under both the federal and the state Constitutions <em>(In re Malinda S. </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 368, 383, fn. 17 [272 Cal.Rptr. 787, 795 P.2d 1244]). In short: \u201cThe fundamental and crucial right to \u2018conceive and to raise one\u2019s children\u2019 is protected by due process guarantees. [Citations.] \u2018[T]he interest of a parent in the companionship, care, custody, and management of his children is a compelling one, ranked among the most basic of civil rights [citations], [and] the state, before depriving a parent of this interest, must afford him adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re Brendan P. </em>(1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 910, 915 [230 Cal.Rptr. 720].) In this case, of course, \u201can opportunity to be heard\u201d includes a fair opportunity to be heard <em>on appeal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Thus, in my view, there are no compelling policy arguments that suggest that it would be \u201cimpracticable or inappropriate\u201d to apply a constructive filing doctrine in FFC cases and, consequently, I view rule 39(a), as qualified by <em>Benoit, </em>as requiring the application of that doctrine in such cases. As I discuss below, the <em>Benoit </em>constructive filing doctrine, if properly construed and applied, would not inappropriately impinge on a minor\u2019s interest in the finality of FFC proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">\n<em>B: Raising and Applying the Benoit Constructive Filing Doctrine in FFC Cases.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">The majority has relied at least in part on the following statement taken from <em>Adoption of Alexander S., supra, </em>to support its conclusion that a petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>for a writ of habeas corpus should not be granted in this case: \u201c[W]e hold that habeas corpus may not be used to collaterally attack a final nonmodifiable judgment in an adoption-related action where the trial court had jurisdiction to render the final judgment.\u201d (44 Cal.3d, at pp. 867-868.) Assuming, arguendo, that FFC cases can be characterized as \u201cadoption-related,\u201d I still do not see that the statement has any relevance to the matter at hand. In <em>Adoption of Alexander S., </em>the petition for a writ of habeas corpus was made in a situation in which no appeal had ever been taken\u2014that is, the petition for the writ was made <em>in lieu </em>of an appeal (constituting an attempt to mount a <em>collateral </em>attack on a judgment). Here, the father does not seek to <em>collaterally </em>attack the FFC judgment entered below in case No. E007280, nor does he argue that his petition should substitute for a proper notice of appeal: To the contrary, an appeal (although belated) <em>was </em>taken by the father in this case\u2014and the writ is merely being sought to <em>preserve </em>that appeal (thus constituting an attempt by the father to maintain a <em>direct </em>attack on the FFC judgment).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Such a use of a writ of habeas corpus is clearly proper. As stated in <em>Benoit: </em>\u201cWe observe at the start that \u2018[i]n the absence of another adequate remedy, habeas corpus lies to\u2019. . . determine that an appeal is pending and to effect preparation of the record so as to perfect the appeal. [Citations.]\u201d (10 Cal.3d at p. 78.) It is true that this court traditionally has required the use of a separate motion to request permission for a late filing under the <em>Benoit </em>constructive filing doctrine\u2014but, to the extent that this court might insist on calling such a motion \u201canother adequate remedy,\u201d it would be a simple enough task to construe a petition for a writ of habeas corpus as such a motion. (See <em>In re Arthur N. </em>(1974) 36 Cal.App.3d 935, 937 [112 Cal.Rptr. 89].)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Once it has been established that a cognizable request for permission to file a late appeal has been made, it remains to review such a request. The standards by which to review a request for permission to file a late appeal are suggested by <em>Benoit. </em>As I alluded to previously, <em>Benoit </em>suggests that a constructive filing of an appeal (based on ineffective assistance of counsel) should only be allowed when the request for permission to make such a filing shows (a) justifiable reliance by the appellant on counsel to file the notice of appeal, (b) due diligence by the appellant in assuring himself or herself that counsel was, in fact, proceeding to file the notice of appeal, and (c) the ineffective assistance of counsel in nevertheless failing to file the notice of appeal in a timely fashion. The showing made by a petitioner as to these three factors constitutes the basis on which an appellate court should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>determine, in the exercise of its discretion, whether to allow a late filing of an appeal in an FFC case pursuant to the <em>Benoit </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Use of the above three factors by an appellate court has several salutary effects:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-6\">(1) Requiring a showing of \u201cjustifiable reliance\u201d would deny the privilege of a late filing to those who merely \u201cassumed\u201d that counsel would pursue an appeal of the judgment. A proper showing of \u201cjustifiable reliance\u201d would include a showing of an affirmative act by the appellant to obtain counsel\u2019s services in pursuing an appeal as well as some showing of an affirmative response by counsel that he or she would pursue an appeal (at least to the extent of filing a notice of appeal).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-7\">(2) Requiring a showing of \u201cdue diligence\u201d on the part of the appellant would deny the privilege of a late filing to those who merely told their counsel to file an appeal and then \u201cforgot about it.\u201d A parent wishing to contest the validity of a judgment in an FFC case must continue to bear some personal responsibility for assuring counsel\u2019s compliance with the requirements of the law. If a parent has been properly advised of his or her rights to appeal as well as \u201cthe necessary steps and time for taking an appeal\u201d pursuant to <em>In re Jacqueline H. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 170 [145 Cal.Rptr. 548, 577 R2d 683], at page 179, then it is entirely appropriate that a somewhat more stringent showing of \u201cdue diligence\u201d be required. It is also arguable that, if a parent knows, or should know, of a pending adoption, a somewhat more stringent showing of \u201cdue diligence\u201d likewise be required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-8\">(3) Requiring the appellate court to base its determination on the above three <em>Benoit </em>factors focuses the court\u2019s attention on the precise issue at hand\u2014whether a late filing should be allowed so as to protect the fundamental constitutional interests of the appealing party\u2014without calling for a preliminary examination into the equities or competing policy considerations raised by the overall circumstances surrounding the particular FFC case subject to appellate review.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>C: <em>Application of the Benoit Doctrine in This Case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">The facts of this case, as shown in the appellate record before us as well as in the petition for a writ of habeas corpus, clearly reveals the father\u2019s entitlement to a late filing of his appeal in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-5\">(1) The father never received an <em>\u201cIn re Jacqueline H. </em>advisement\u201d by the court\u2014and, so, was left without any direct, personal knowledge of the law respecting the taking of appeals. The father clearly communicated to his trial counsel his desire to appeal the FFC judgment. Trial counsel assured the father that all appropriate steps were being taken to contest the FFC judgment, including the taking of an appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-6\">(2) The father continued to impress upon trial counsel his desire to contest the FFC judgment. The father was aware that trial counsel was filing a motion for a new trial prior to filing a notice of appeal\u2014and had been told by trial counsel that this was the appropriate manner in which to pursue the matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-7\">(3) Trial counsel erred in believing that a motion for a new trial was permissible in an FFC case (Civ. Code, \u00a7 238). Trial counsel never filed a notice of appeal in a timely fashion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">Under the above facts, the conclusion is inescapable that the father\u2019s fundamental rights in and to a full and fair adjudication of the FFC case in which his rights as a father were completely and irrevocably terminated were eviscerated by the ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Basic considerations of fairness and due process compel the application of the <em>Benoit </em>doctrine in this case\u2014and competing policy considerations which recognize a minor\u2019s interest in stable, long-term relationships do not compel a contrary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">To adopt a blanket, \u201cacross-the-board\u201d holding, as the majority does, that the <em>Benoit </em>constructive filing doctrine simply does not, ever, apply to late-filed appeals in FFC cases where the late filing of the appeal is attributable to the professional incompetence of an appellant parent\u2019s counsel would (1) severely (and, to a large degree, needlessly) undermine that appellant parent\u2019s constitutionally protected \u201cfundamental liberty interest\u201d in the basic human rights to conceive and raise children and (2) deprive that appellant parent of his or her constitutional right to receive the full appropriate measure of the due process of law in contesting the termination of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>or her parental rights. In my view, an ad hoc, \u201ccase-by-case\u201d approach to applying the <em>Benoit </em>constructive filing doctrine in FFC cases respects and preserves these fundamental constitutional rights held by parents without unduly prejudicing the interest of children (and of society) in seeing that children enjoy the benefits of stable, long-term relationships while growing up.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Petitioner\u2019s application for review by the Supreme Court was denied May, 14, 1992, Kennard, J., was of the opinion that the application should be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-9\"> All further references to \u201crules\u201d are references to the California Rules of Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b430-7\"> The majority cites both <em>In re A.

Both of these cases, however, focused their policy arguments on the need to protect the finality of <em>adoption </em>proceedings\u2014proceedings which may, but very well may not, form a part of the overall circumstances surrounding an FFC case. The majority has rightly recognized this distinction (\u201c[W]e do not rest our decision on ... a distinction between those minors for whom adoption is imminent, those for whom it is probable, and those for whom it is merely a hope.\u201d) and has focused its policy argument on the general need for children to have stable, long-term relationships (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>p. 533, quoting from <em>Lehman </em>v. <em>Lycoming County Children\u2019s Services </em>(1982) 458 U.S. 502, 513-514 [73 L.Ed.2d 928, 938-939, 102 S.Ct. 3231].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b432-6\"> For the same reason, <em>Mauro B. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 949 [281 Cal.Rptr. 507] (as cited by the majority) is also inapposite.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b433-9\">By making this point, I am not lightly brushing aside \u201ccompeting policy considerations\u201d\u2014 such as a minor\u2019s interest in the finality of FFC proceedings. Rather, by making this point, I am urging that the reviewing court focus on the fact that it is being asked to treat this appeal <em>as if </em>it had been <em>timely </em>filed\u2014and no one contests the fact that a minor\u2019s interest in the finality of FFC proceedings must be subrogated to the processing of a <em>timely </em>appeal taken in an FFC case.</p>\n<p id=\"AHjc\">Further, I take strong issue with the suggestion in the majority opinion that in determining whether to allow a constructive late filing in an FFC case an appellate court would become enmeshed both in evaluating the soundness of the underlying FFC judgment and in determin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>ing the \u201cdesirability\u201d of the minor\u2019s current placement.
