(Pen. Code, \u00a7 182; Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11379.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1087-7\">In the published portion of this opinion we hold that a conviction of Penal Code section 246 (discharging a firearm at an inhabited dwelling house) is a crime of moral turpitude as defined in <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 301 [211 Cal.Rptr. 719, 696 P.2d 111] and therefore admissible for purposes of impeachment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>*</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-8\">We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-9\">Statement of Facts - Discussion, II.<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1087-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-11\"><em>Is Shooting Into an Inhabited Dwelling a Crime of Moral </em>Turpitude?</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-12\">In a case of first impression, we are asked to decide whether shooting into an inhabited dwelling (Pen. Code, \u00a7 246) is a crime of moral turpitude within the meaning of <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 301 [211 Cal.Rptr. 719, 696 P.2d 111].</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-13\">At trial, the prosecution was allowed to impeach White with his 1978 conviction of Penal Code section 246.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> White contends the trial court erred in its assessment of Penal Code section 246 as a crime of moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>This court summarized the <em>Castro </em>rule in <em>People </em>v. <em>Mansfield </em>(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 82, 87 [245 Cal.Rptr. 800]:</p>\n<p id=\"AqV\">\u201cPursuant to <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d 301, and subject to the trial court\u2019s discretion under Evidence Code section 352, only prior felony convictions that necessarily involve moral turpitude may be used to impeach a witness in a criminal proceeding. [Citation.] \u2018Moral turpitude\u2019 means a general \u2018readiness to do evil\u2019 [citation], i.e., \u2018an act of baseness, vileness or depravity in the private and social duties which a man owes to his fellowmen, or to society in general, contrary to the accepted and customary rule of right and duty between man and man.\u2019 [Citations.] <em>Castro </em>makes no attempt to list or define those felonies which involve moral turpitude, but it makes clear that moral turpitude does not depend on dishonesty being an element of the felony. \u2018[I]t is undeniable that a witness\u2019 moral depravity of <em>any kind </em>has some \u201ctendency in reason\u201d [citation] to shake one\u2019s confidence in his honesty.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-5\">One of the tenets of the <em>Castro </em>analysis is that in determining whether a crime is one of moral turpitude, a court must look only to the elements of the offense and decide whether its least adjudicated elements necessarily involve moral turpitude. Such limitation is made necessary by the confusion, surprise and prejudice to the defendant engendered by examination of underlying specific and often extraneous facts. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at pp. 316-317.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-6\">Seizing upon the phrase \u201cleast adjudicated elements,\u201d White makes a disingenuous argument. He contends that since a person could be convicted of Penal Code section 246 by shooting at a building which was <em>actually </em>unoccupied at the time the shot was fired, the least adjudicated element would simply consist of maliciously shooting at an <em>unoccupied </em>building without the intent or likelihood of committing serious bodily injury upon anyone else. We reject his attempt to minimize by syllogism the magnitude of Penal Code section 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-7\">For purposes of Penal Code section 246, a building is considered \u201cinhabited\u201d if there are permanent residents thereof, even if it is temporarily unoccupied. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 1005, 1018 [232</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1303\">*1303</page-number>Cal.Rptr. 132, 728 P.2d 202].)  Moreover, as pointed out in <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 689, 698 [254 Cal.Rptr. 15], the Supreme Court, in setting forth the \u201c \u2018least adjudicated elements of the conviction necessarily involve[d]\u2019 \u201d standard in <em>Castro </em>could not have meant that a prior conviction for purpose of impeachment cannot be used if there is any conceivable set of facts under which the offense could have been committed free of moral turpitude. All that <em>Castro </em>requires is that moral turpitude can reasonably be inferred from the elements of the offense alone without regard to the facts of the particular violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-5\">We note that Penal Code section 247 makes punishable as a <em>misdemeanor </em>the discharge of a firearm at an <em>uninhabited </em>dwelling house. From a reading of the penal consequences of Penal Code sections 246 (felony) and 247 (misdemeanor), it is readily apparent that the Legislature has determined that shooting at an <em>inhabited </em>dwelling house is far more serious than if the house were <em>uninhabited. </em>There is no provision for a lesser <em>range of punishment </em>should the house be <em>fortuitously </em>unoccupied at the time of the discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-6\">It is elementary, yet essential to this analysis, to note that inhabited is defined as \u201clived in.\u201d (Webster\u2019s New World Diet. (2d college ed. 1982) p. 724.) By definition then, inhabitants are generally <em>in </em>or <em>around </em>the premises. From this, we can readily perceive the inherent danger in one firing a weapon at an inhabited dwelling. Such an act is done with reckless disregard of probable consequences (someone being struck). <em>(People </em>v. <em>Chavira </em>(1970) 3 Cd.App.3d 988, 993 [83 Cal.Rptr. 851].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-7\">Since Penal Code section 246 does not require a specific intent to accomplish an objective (e.g., injure, kill, frighten, etc.), White first argues, without citation, that <em>Castro </em>cannot be extended to apply to a conviction of section 246. He next argues that even if moral turpitude could be extended to a situation where there is some probability of injury, regardless of intent, even that probability is not among the least adjudicated elements of section 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-8\">He next makes the rather startling argument that if a person were killed as a result of a shot fired pursuant to Penal Code section 246, \u201cthe most likely crime of which the shooter would be guilty is involuntary manslaughter\u2014 one of the crimes which has been held <em>not </em>to involve moral turpitude,\u201d citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Solis </em>(1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 877, 883 [218 Cal.Rptr. 469],</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-9\">Addressing his last conclusion first, we disagree that the most likely crime resultant from a death caused by firing into an inhabited dwelling would be involuntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1304\">*1304</page-number>We have already found that one who fires shots into an inhabited dwelling is doing so with a reckless disregard for the consequences. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Chavira, supra, </em>3 Cal.App.3d at p. 993.) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 290, 300 [179 Cal.Rptr. 43, 637 P.2d 279], it was held that one who does an \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018act, the natural consequences of which are dangerous to life, which act was deliberately performed by a person who knows that his conduct endangers the life of another and who acts with a conscious disregard for life\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d may be convicted of second degree murder. The <em>Watson </em>decision was significant because it extended the possibility of a second degree murder consequence to a person driving under the influence of alcohol under certain circumstances. The Supreme Court found malice (a necessary element of murder) implied from such a conscious disregard for others. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 298.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-4\">We conclude that under the principles set forth in <em>Watson, </em>a person who demonstrates such wanton disregard for the life of another by firing shots into an inhabited dwelling could be convicted of second degree murder should someone die as a result. <em>Castro </em>defines moral turpitude as a readiness to do evil. (38 Cal.3d at p. 314.) A \u201csecond degree murder conviction certainly demonstrates a readiness to do evil, murder being the most evil of crimes.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Littrel </em>(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 699, 702 [230 Cal.Rptr. 83].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-5\">It has been held that possession of an illegal weapon is a crime of moral turpitude <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garrett </em>(1987) 195 Cal.App.3d 795, 799-800 [241 Cal.Rptr. 10])<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that possession of a firearm by a felon is a crime involving moral turpitude. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Littrel, supra, </em>185 Cal.App.3d at p. 703.) Possession of such weapons was determined by each court to involve a readiness to do evil. <em>(Garrett, supra, </em>195 Cal.App.3d at p. 800; <em>Littrel, supra, </em>185 Cal.App.3d at p. 703.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-6\">It would be anomalous to hold here that the \u201cevil\u201d actually done (shooting at an inhabited dwelling) was not also a crime of moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-7\">White cites certain cases which hold, as to the specific crime presented, that moral turpitude does not exist.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Drawing from the cases he cites, White argues that an element of the crime must involve dishonesty or significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1305\">*1305</page-number>injury to another person for moral turpitude to exist. Therefore, White contends that because the intent to do serious injury to a person or a likelihood of serious injury resulting to a person is not an element of the crime of shooting into an inhabited dwelling, the crime does not involve moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-5\">However, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Lang </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 991, 1010 [264 Cal.Rptr. 386, 782 P.2d 627], the Supreme Court held that escape by a convicted felon without force is a crime involving moral turpitude because it necessarily involves some form of stealth, deceit, or breach of trust and the <em>potential for violence </em>when an escaped felon is recaptured. Moral turpitude was found even though an injury to another or the likelihood of injury to another was not an element of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-6\">Although the least adjudicated elements of Penal Code section 246 do not require that an intent to injure or a likelihood of serious injury to another be present, there is <em>always </em>present a potential for violence in the commission of a violation of section 246. Penal Code section 246 is clearly a crime of moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-9\">Stone (W. A.), Acting P.
