J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYa\">A jury found defendant David Castro Perez, a prisoner, guilty of assault with a deadly weapon (Pen. Code, \u00a7 4501)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and possessing a deadly weapon (\u00a7 4502). The jury also found Perez personally used a deadly weapon under section 1192.7, subdivision (c)(23) as to both counts. Perez appeals, contending the evidence was insufficient to support the judgment and the court erred in denying his motions for self-representation and for new trial based upon jury misconduct. For the reasons set forth below, we remand for the court to conduct a limited inquiry on issues relating to Perez\u2019s new trial motion. We affirm the judgment in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"A6u\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">Perez and the victim, Anel Rojas, were inmates at the Donovan State Prison in San Diego. On the date of the stabbing, Rojas and Perez were standing outside in the exercise yard. Officer Frank Ardilla stood in a control booth overlooking the yard. Ardilla saw Rojas and Perez engage in a \u201cverbal argument,\u201d which \u201cseemed very heated.\u201d As Perez and Rojas walked towards the housing unit, Ardilla saw Perez charge at Rojas with his arm uplifted. Rojas attempted to defend himself but was too late, and Perez struck Rojas in the right side of the neck with an object. Ardilla then saw Rojas clench his neck with his left hand and observed blood flowing between Rojas\u2019s fingers. Ardilla went to the window and ordered everyone in front of the building to freeze and to get down. Except for Perez everyone complied. Perez kept on walking. When Perez did not stop, Ardilla went to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>the gun rack and removed a rifle, aiming it at Perez. Perez turned and hit the ground. Ardilla then directed correction officers to search the ground following Perez\u2019s path up to the point where he was stopped. Using a metal detector, one officer found a weapon in a puddle along the path Perez had taken. The weapon was an inmate-manufactured weapon sharpened to a point and made from metal stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">During a search conducted two hours after the attack, Officer Grace Johnson found another weapon in a trash can <em>inside </em>the prison. The weapon appeared to be an inmate-manufactured weapon that looked like a screwdriver, sharpened to a point.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The prosecution\u2019s evidence showed the second weapon could not have been used in the attack because all prisoners were searched before they went inside the building.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Johnson explained prisoners throughout the prison frequently discard their weapons after an attack because they know correction officers will probably conduct a general search.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Immediately after the attack, medical technical assistant Mary Kowinsky treated Rojas. Kowinsky believed Rojas\u2019s injury was a puncture wound caused by a sharp instrument to the collarbone.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Perez did not testify. Victim Rojas testified he was \u201cabsolutely\u201d positive the prisoner who stabbed him was <em>not </em>Perez. In rebuttal, the prosecution elicited expert testimony establishing the existence of a prison code of silence resulting in few inmates, if any, ever naming their attackers for fear of retribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">Contending the court erred in denying his section 1118.1 motion,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Perez says the evidence was insufficient to show he had a weapon available to him which could have caused Rojas\u2019s injuries. He relies exclusively on the testimony of his expert witness, forensic pathologist Homez Guard, who testified the homemade knife found near Perez in the yard could not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>been the weapon used in the stabbing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Guard based his opinion on his finding Rojas\u2019s wound was one and one-half inches deep and the opening was three-eighths of an inch in width. Guard opined if the knife found in the yard had been used to make a stab wound one and one-half inches deep, it would have left a much wider wound. Guard also concluded the screwdriver-like weapon found inside the prison was consistent with Rojas\u2019s wound because of the depth, width, and shape of the wound opening.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Even though such expert testimony is relevant on the issue of whether Perez assaulted Rojas, such evidence is not conclusive. Perez emphasizes there was no prosecution expert to establish the homemade knife could have caused the injury. Nonetheless, in spite of this omission the jury was entitled to draw an inference based upon their evaluation of the evidence, including the fact that the wound was not a rounded hole but a slice. A jury is not required to accept the testimony of an expert witnesses even if he or she is the sole expert testifying at trial. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Coogler </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 153, 166 [77 Cal.Rptr. 790, 454 P.2d 686].) Here, for example, the jury could have decided to disregard Dr. Guard\u2019s testimony because he failed to examine the victim\u2019s scar until 11 months after the injury, legitimately finding his ability to determine the type of instrument used to cause an injury could not be resolved by examining scar tissue several months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">The eyewitness testimony of correction officer Ardilla established Perez struck Rojas in the neck with an object, causing Rojas serious injury. A weapon was found on the path on which Perez retreated after the attack. The jury was shown such weapon and heard testimony describing Rojas\u2019s injuries. There was, therefore, sufficient evidence to establish Perez was the individual who caused Rojas\u2019s injuries, including that he had the means to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">Faretta Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">The court initially appointed attorney Evelyn Goldman to represent Perez. At one point early in the representation, Perez became angry at Goldman and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>spit at her.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Based upon this incident, the court relieved Goldman and appointed another attorney.  Later, Perez successfully moved on two different occasions to substitute his appointed attorneys. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Marsden </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 118 [84 Cal.Rptr. 156, 465 P.2d 44].)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> One day before his trial was scheduled, Perez made another <em>Marsden </em>motion to substitute his fourth attorney, Donald Levine. The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">On the day of trial, defense counsel unsuccessfully moved for a continuance to permit him to obtain additional witnesses and to petition for a writ from the denial of an earlier section 995 motion. After the court denied the continuance and minutes before jury selection was scheduled to begin, the following exchange took place between defense counsel, Perez and the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-6\">\u201cThe Court: The record should indicate that I have returned to the bench without the jury panel being called in response to a message that I received before the panel could get through the door. What was that message, Mr. Levine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-7\">\u201cMr. Levine: Message was Mr. Perez indicated to me he wanted to make a motion to go pro per.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-8\">\u201cThe Court: It is my understanding that there was a <em>Marsden </em>hearing in this matter within the last few days, was there not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-9\">\u201cMr. Levine: We didn\u2019t address the issue of pro per.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-10\">\u201cThe Court: I understand you did not.

I will not entertain it. Bailiff is directed to bring in the jury panel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-7\">\u201cMr. Levine: Judge, Mr. Perez would like to address you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-8\">\u201cThe Defendant: Can I address the court, your honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-9\">\u201cThe Court: No, I think not. You\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-17\">\u201cThe Defendant: If I stipulate for the record\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-18\">\u201cThe Court: These games have gone on long enough. You didn\u2019t make this motion yesterday when you found out that Mr. Levine was not going to be relieved. The necessity would be\u2014and, you know, we have had motions for continuances on every ground, every which way, and that\u2019s what this is. I\u2019m not going to continue the case. I\u2019m not going to allow a substitution of counsel, and there\u2019s therefore no reason for me to listen to you at this point. [\u00b6]We have now come to the moment of truth. There is a jury panel in the hallway, and we are in session. . . . [\u00b6]Get the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-19\">\u201cThe Defendant: Your honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-20\">\u201cMr. Levine: Judge\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-21\">\u201cThe Court: Get the jury. [\u00b6] And remember Mr. Perez, that this is your</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-22\">jury.

He\u2019s says he\u2019s ready to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-24\">\u201cThe Defendant: I want to speak to the Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b760-25\">\u201cThe Court: No, he\u2019s not ready to do that. The motion is denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-26\">Perez contends the court erred in ruling his self-representation motion was untimely and in failing to inquire into his reasons for requesting propria persona status.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-27\">\u201cA criminal defendant has a right under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to represent himself at trial. <em>(Faretta </em>v. <em>California </em>(1975) 422 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>U.S. 806, 807 . . . .) The defendant\u2019s right is absolute and unconditional if his motion is timely and if he is deemed competent to waive counsel. <em>(Ferrel </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 888, 891 .. . .)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hernandez </em>(1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 645, 650 [209 Cal.Rptr. 809].) A motion is timely if it is asserted \u201c \u2018within a reasonable time prior to the commencement of trial.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Windham </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 121, 128 .. . .)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Burton </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 843, 852 [258 Cal.Rptr. 184, 771 P.2d 1270].) \u201cThe \u2018reasonable time\u2019 requirement is intended to prevent the defendant from misusing the motion to unjustifiably delay trial or obstruct the orderly administration of justice.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 852.) To determine whether a motion made at or near the time of trial is timely, the court should inquire \u201cas to the reason(s) for the lateness of the [defendant\u2019s] request.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez, supra, </em>163 Cal.App.3d at p. 652.)</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">A court <em>must </em>grant a timely <em>Faretta </em>motion. However, where the defendant\u2019s motion is untimely, the court is not obligated to grant the motion, but it must exercise its discretion to determine whether the request should be granted or denied. <em>{People </em>v. <em>Windham </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 121, 128 [137 Cal.Rptr. 8, 560 P.2d 1187].) In such situation, <em>Windham </em>mandates \u201cthe trial court shall inquire <em>sua sponte </em>into the specific factors underlying the request thereby ensuring a meaningful record in the event that appellate review is later required. Among [the] factors to be considered by the court. . . are the quality of counsel\u2019s representation of the defendant, the defendant\u2019s prior proclivity to substitute counsel, the reasons for the request, the length and stage of the proceedings, and the disruption or delay which might reasonably be expected to follow the granting of such a motion.\u201d <em>{People </em>v. <em>Windham, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d atp. 128; see <em>Hernandez, supra, </em>163 Cal.App.3d 645, 650.)</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">Here the court found Perez\u2019s motion untimely because Perez initially responded he was not ready to proceed with trial. This was a legitimate basis for the court\u2019s ruling.  A trial court \u201c \u2018may <em>deny </em>a request for self-representation made on the very eve of trial, on the ground that granting the motion would involve a continuance for preparation . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 744, 757 [196 Cal.Rptr. 382], quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Fulton </em>(1979) 92 Cal.App.3d 972, 976 [155 Cal.Rptr. 327],)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Perez could have brought his <em>Faretta </em>motion a day earlier in conjunction with his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number><em>Marsden </em>motion as he had on several earlier occasions (see fn. 7) or even on the day of trial before his counsel requested a continuance. In light of the events which occurred before and on the day of trial, we can understand why the court reasonably concluded Perez\u2019s motion was untimely and that he was in a different situation than the defendants in <em>People </em>v. <em>Tyner </em>(1977) 76 Cal.App.3d 352, 354-55 [143 Cal.Rptr. 52] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Herrera </em>(1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 167, 173-175 [163 Cal.Rptr. 435], each of whom asserted a self-representation request on the day of trial without seeking a continuance or indicating in any way that a delay was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">Nonetheless, given the court\u2019s finding the motion was untimely, it was required to follow the procedure mandated in <em>Windham, </em>by inquiring sua sponte regarding the reasons underlying Perez\u2019s request to represent himself. While the court did not specifically make such inquiry, we conclude there were sufficient reasons on the record for the court to exercise its discretion to deny the request. As to the first <em>Windham </em>factor, the court was aware of the quality of counsel\u2019s representation based upon Judge Revak\u2019s denial of Perez\u2019s <em>Marsden </em>motion the day before the trial. The court was also presumably aware of Perez\u2019s \u201cprior proclivity to substitute counsel\u201d given his three previous <em>Marsden </em>motions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Additionally, though a jury had not yet been impaneled, trial was about to commence. Thus, the court\u2019s granting Perez\u2019s motion would have required a continuance (see fn. 10), thereby causing substantial disruption and delay in the proceedings. Finally, as the court noted, Perez\u2019s failure to assert the motion the day before when the court denied his <em>Marsden </em>motion justified the court\u2019s implied finding Perez\u2019s request was merely a device to disrupt the proceedings and to continue the</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>trial.  Such circumstances establish sufficient reason for the court to exercise its discretion to deny Perez\u2019s untimely motion.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Perez\u2019s New Trial Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Perez contends the court erred in denying his new trial motion on the basis of jury misconduct. (See \u00a7 1181, subd. 3.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">After the jury returned its verdict, Perez moved for funding to investigate possible jury misconduct. In support of his motion, defense counsel submitted points and authorities, stating he had questioned \u201cone of the jury members upon their discharge. One juror either Mr. Daniel Carr or Mr. Burt Le Vine related to defense counsel that the jury based its decision of guilt on the fact that the defendant did not testify during the course of the defendant\u2019s trial. One of these two jurors stated that several of the jurors mentioned this fact during their deliberations.\u201d Neither defense counsel nor any juror submitted a declaration or affidavit stating these or similar facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">In considering the motion the court made clear it would not rule on the technical basis that counsel had failed to submit a declaration or affidavit. \u201c[I] do not stand on the proposition that there\u2019s no declaration. I assume to be true the allegations that Mr. Levine has made not under oath.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">The court went on to discuss how it viewed the issue concluding \u201cthis type of inquiry is of the sort that is precluded; that a juror may not impeach his or her own verdict on the theory that he or other jurors did not follow the law; that that\u2019s exactly what is forbidden and therefore that it is not good cause for funding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-11\">The court then assumed counsel was also seeking a new trial so that the denial of that motion would also be on the record. When defense counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>balked at making an oral motion without other evidence which would be obtained in an investigation, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-4\">\u201cThe Court: I will assume for the sake of argument that all 12 jurors would say that that discussion [regarding appellant\u2019s failure to testify at trial] took place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-5\">\u201cCounsel: And I would make a motion for new trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b764-6\">\u201cThe Court: And it\u2019s denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">When a party seeks a new trial based upon jury misconduct, a court must undertake a three-step inquiry. The court must first determine whether the affidavits supporting the motion are admissible. (See Evid. Code, \u00a7 1150, subd. (a).) If the evidence is admissible, the court must then consider whether the facts establish misconduct. (See <em>Krouse </em>v. <em>Graham </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 59, 79-82 [137 Cal.Rptr. 863, 562 P.2d 1022].) Finally, assuming misconduct, the court must determine whether the misconduct was prejudicial. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Marshall </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 907, 950-951 [269 Cal.Rptr. 269, 790 P.2d 676]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Miranda </em>(1987) 44 Cal.3d 57, 117 [241 Cal.Rptr. 594,744 P.2d 1127].) A trial court has broad discretion in ruling on each of these questions and its rulings will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of discretion. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Montgomery </em>(1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 718, 728-729 [132 Cal.Rptr. 558].)</p>\n<p id=\"b764-9\">Because we are reviewing the court\u2019s exercise of discretion we must accept the premise on which the trial court denied the motion, i.e., that 12 jurors would have signed declarations saying they discussed Perez\u2019s failure to testify. We turn first to consider whether such hypothetical jury declarations would be admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-10\"><em>In re Stankewitz </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 391, 397 [220 Cal.Rptr. 382, 708 P.2d 1260] sets forth the general principles governing the admissibility of juror declarations to impeach a verdict. \u201c \u2018Upon an inquiry as to the validity of a verdict, <em>any otherwise admissible evidence may be received as to statements </em>made, or conduct, conditions, or events occurring, either within or without the jury room, <em>of such a character as is likely to have influenced the verdict </em>improperly.\u2019 (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1150, subd. (a) . . . .) It is settled that jurors are competent to prove \u2018objective facts\u2019 under this provision. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hutchinson </em>[1969] 71 Cal.2d at p. 351 [78 Cal.Rptr. 196, 455 P.2d 132].) By contrast, the Legislature has declared evidence of certain other facts to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"907\">*907</page-number>inadmissible for this purpose: \u2018No evidence is admissible to show the <em>effect </em>of such statement, conduct, condition, or event upon a juror either in influencing him to assent to or dissent form the verdict or concerning the mental processes by which it was determined.\u2019 (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1150, subd. (a) . . . .) Thus, jurors may testify to \u2018overt acts\u2019\u2014that is, such statements, conduct, conditions, or events as are \u2018open to sight, hearing, and the other senses and thus subject to corroboration\u2019\u2014but may not testify to \u2018the subjective reasoning processes of the individual juror . . .\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hutchinson, supra, </em>at pp. 349-350.) [\u00b6] Among the overt acts that are admissible and to which jurors are competent to testify are statements. Section 1150, subdivision (a), expressly allows proof of \u2018statements made . . . either with in or without the jury room . . .\u2019\u201d <em>(Stankewitz, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d at pp. 397-398.)</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\"><em>Stankewitz </em>held a declaration regarding a juror\u2019s erroneous legal advice to his fellow jurors during deliberations was admissible since the juror\u2019s advice constituted an overt act of misconduct. The court cautioned, however, that juror statements \u201chave a greater tendency than nonverbal acts to implicate the reasoning process of jurors .... They are therefore more apt to be misused by counsel in an effort to improperly open such processes to scrutiny.\u201d <em>(Stankewitz, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d at p. 398.) <em>Stankewitz </em>nonetheless made clear that \u201cno such misuse is threatened when, as here, <em>the very making of the statement sought to be admitted would itself constitute misconduct. </em>Such an act is as much an objective fact as a juror\u2019s reading of a novel during the taking of testimony [citation] or a juror\u2019s consultation with an outside attorney for advice on the law applicable to the case [citation].\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics added; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Hedgecock </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 395, 419 [272 Cal.Rptr. 803, 795 P.2d 1260] [\u201ca statement by a juror during deliberations may itself be an act of misconduct, in which case evidence of that statement is admissible\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Consistent with <em>Stankewitz, </em>several courts have held evidence of a jury discussion on an improper topic to be admissible as an \u201covert act,\u201d provided the evidence is not directed at the subjective reasoning processes of the individual juror. (See e.g., <em>DiRosario </em>v. <em>Havens </em>(1987) 196 Cal.App.3d 1224, 1238 [242 Cal.Rptr. 423] [statements between jurors regarding the court\u2019s authority to reduce an excessive jury award are overt acts that are admissible and to which jurors are competent to testify]; <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Preventive Medicine Medical Group, Inc. </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 728, 740 fn. 8, 742-743 [223 Cal.Rptr. 859] [holding admissible declarations reflecting juror statements disregarding court\u2019s admonition not to draw any inference of liability from a party\u2019s out-of-court settlement]; <em>Trammell </em>v. <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. </em>(1984) 163 Cal.App.3d 157, 172 [209 Cal.Rptr. 427] [holding juror comments during deliberations regarding effect of attorney\u2019s fees and income <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>taxes on damage award \u201cis overt conduct, objectively ascertainable</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Here, the court was asked to exercise its discretion in ruling on Perez\u2019s new trial motion. In so doing the court accepted a worst case scenario, explicitly assuming all jurors discussed Perez\u2019s failure to testify. In effect, the court envisioned the jury had explicitly or implicitly agreed to disregard the court\u2019s express instruction not to consider or discuss Perez\u2019s failure to take the witness stand.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Such jury discussion is admissible to impeach the verdict under the express provisions of Evidence Code section 1150. As in Stankewitz, <em>DiRosario, Moore </em>and <em>Trammell, </em>the discussion is an overt act, \u201copen to sight, hearing, and the other senses and thus subject to corroboration.\u201d (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hutchinson, supra, </em>71 Cal.2d 342, 350; Evid. Code, \u00a7 1150, subd. (a); see also <em>Brown </em>v. <em>State </em>(Tex.Ct.App. 1991) 804 S.W.2d 566, 569 [\u201ca jury\u2019s discussion of an accused\u2019s failure to testify would constitute an overt act of misconduct. . .\u201d].)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> More importantly, evidence of a jury\u2019s explicit or implicit agreement to violate a court\u2019s instruction does not touch upon the juror\u2019s subjective reasoning processes, since, as in <em>Stankewitz, </em>such agreement in and of itself constitutes misconduct. (See <em>DiRosario </em>v. <em>Havens, supra, </em>196 Cal.App.3d at p. 1235 [\u201cif the jurors in this case made their decision based upon an intentional collective disregard of [a jury instruction] . . . then such activity would be grounds for seriously considering reversal of the judgment\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Elkins </em>(1981) 123 Cal.App.3d 632, 638 [176 Cal.Rptr. 729] [finding juror affidavits inadmissible since the declarations failed to \u201cindicate] . . . any open discussion or agreement among the jurors evidencing a deliberate refusal to follow the court\u2019s instructions\u201d]; see also <em>Krouse </em>v. <em>Graham, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d 59, 81; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 16, 37-38, [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 258].)</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Given the court\u2019s scenario that 12 jurors effectively agreed to disregard the court\u2019s express instructions, the jury declarations would have been admissible and constituted clear evidence of misconduct. While the court has broad discretion to rule on a new trial motion, that discretion was abused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>here, where the court denied the motion on a factual scenario presumptively establishing prejudicial jury misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">Our conclusion the court prejudicially erred in denying the new trial motion requires that we vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings. On remand we wish to emphasize the trial court should not assume 12 jurors actually discussed Perez\u2019s failure to testify. Although we appreciate a substantial period of time has expired since the jury in this case was discharged and obtaining declarations from some or all of the jurors may be difficult or impossible, we do not believe the court\u2019s earlier error relieving defense counsel of this burden should result in any other procedure than that required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b767-8\">After the jury returned its verdict, the court found Perez suffered two serious felony priors within the meaning of section 667, subdivision (a)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and two prison priors within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The court sentenced Perez to sixteen years in prison: the middle term of four years for assault with a deadly weapon by a prisoner; two consecutive five-year enhancements for serious felony priors and two consecutive one-year enhancements for his two prison priors.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">Perez makes two distinct sentencing arguments. The first is that the court improperly enhanced his sentence by imposing an additional one year for each of the prison priors because each such enhancement violates the rule against double punishment under section 654. He explains a single prison term for each of the prior serious felonies was included within the single term for which he is now serving a five-year enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>Perez makes this argument on the basis of <em>People </em>v. <em>James </em>(1985) 170 Cal.App.3d 164 [216 Cal.Rptr. 24] where the court held imposition of a five-year prior serious felony enhancement for one offense and a one-year prior prison term enhancement for another offense violated section 654 when time for the two offenses had been served concurrently. <em>People </em>v. <em>Vaughn </em>(1989) 209 Cal.App.3d 398, 401 [257 Cal.Rptr. 229], however, held otherwise, declining to follow <em>James, </em>describing it \u201cwrongly decided based on an improvident concession by the Attorney General.\u201d (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Medina </em>(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 986, 989-990 [254 Cal.Rptr. 89] [refusing to follow <em>James].) Vaughn </em>explains: \u201c[t]he reasoning in . . . <em>James </em>... is flawed in that a serious felony enhancement under section 667 depends solely on the nature of the felony conviction irrespective of whether a prison term was served. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Traina </em>(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 305, 308 . . . .) Under section 667.5, the service of a prior prison term is the critical event which triggers imposition of an additional one-year term. Under section 667, the \u2018act\u2019 within the meaning of section 654 for prior conviction enhancements is the conviction. Under section 667.5, the enhancement requires service of a prison term and the \u2018act\u2019 is the conviction <em>plus </em>service of the prison term. In this case, there were two separate acts: (1) the <em>conviction </em>of a serious felony within the meaning of section 667 in . . . 1981; and (2) the conviction of an unrelated felony . . . [in] 1982 <em>and </em>the <em>service </em>of a prison term within the meaning of section 667.5. That the prison term for 1981 serious felony conviction \u2018overlapped\u2019 the section 667.5 prison term imposed for the 1982 burglary is immaterial as defendant\u2019s sentence was enhanced by two entirely separate \u2018acts.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 402.)</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">We believe <em>Vaughn </em>was correctly decided. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Irvin </em>(1991) 230 Cal.App.3d 180, 189 [281 Cal.Rptr. 195] [\u201cA defendant may be sentenced for a prior serious felony conviction and then also sentenced for a prior prison term for a different prior offense even though the convictions occurred at the same time and the sentences were served together\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Medina, supra, </em>206 Cal.App.3d 986, 989 [\u201cwe hold that a single previous prison commitment for two or more serious felony offenses may serve as the basis for sentence enhancements pursuant to both section 667 and section 667.5.\u201d].) The court did not violate the rule against double punishment by enhancing Perez\u2019s sentence with his serious prior conviction and his prison priors.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">Perez\u2019s other sentencing argument is that the court erred in sentencing him to the two 1-year enhancements because both were the result of one continuous period of confinement in state prison correctly pointing out that section 667.5, subdivision (b) provides that the additional one-year enhancement for a prior prison sentence may only be imposed for each earlier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>separate prison term served for any felony. (See <em>Medina, supra, </em>206 Cal.App.3d at p. 991.) The Attorney General, however, argues that the terms Perez served on the two priors were separate. On the record before us we reach a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-5\">The probation report shows the first prison prior involved a case where the court ordered Perez to serve five years on a burglary conviction, commencing in August 1983. The second prison prior involved a case where Perez was first committed to California Rehabilitation Center for treatment in October 1979. Later he was released, returned to that facility on several occasions but ultimately in April 1983 was excluded from the program and sent to prison. Thus Perez\u2019s prison sentence on both priors involved a single \u201cblock of time.\u201d \u201cThe plain meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (g) is to prevent multiple one-year enhancements under section 667.5 itself where the offender has served one period of prison confinement, or block of time, for multiple offenses or convictions. Extra section 667.5 enhancements may only be added for additional periods of prison confinement.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Medina, supra, </em>206 Cal.App.3d 986, 992.) We therefore hold Perez may only be sentenced for one of the earlier priors, and accordingly we strike one year from his sixteen-year sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">The judgment is modified by striking the one-year sentence imposed for a prison prior. As modified the judgment is affirmed. The abstract of judgment and the records at the Department of Corrections shall be modified accordingly. The case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">Todd, J., and Nares, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">A petition for a rehearing was denied April 3, 1992, and appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied June 11, 1992.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b756-11\"> All statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b757-10\">This second weapon was not produced at trial because it could not be found.

Perez recognizes, however, \u201cthe jury might have been sufficiently persuaded by the testimony of Frank Ardilla\u2014and equally unpersuaded by the testimony of the victim\u2014to convict [him] based on the prison guard\u2019s eyewitness account alone.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b759-13\"> Perez was apparently angry at Goldman because she had not obtained a continuance at the preliminary hearing and had purportedly failed to meet with Perez other than at the readiness and preliminary hearings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b759-14\"> In those motions, Perez also moved to represent himself pursuant to <em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California </em>(1975) 422 U.S. 806 [45 L.Ed.2d 562, 95 S.Ct. 2525]. On each occasion, the court substituted counsel and denied the self-representation request, apparently construing the latter request as an alternative motion. In his reply brief, Perez attempts to ground his allegation of <em>Faretta </em>error on these early denials of self-representation. This contention is not well taken. By initially accepting each substitute counsel and making no attempt to raise the issue by way of writ or through other channels, Perez waived his right to complain about the early denials of his right to represent himself. The early requests, however, may be relevant in determining whether Perez\u2019s <em>Faretta </em>motion on the day of trial was timely, including whether Perez asserted the motion for the purpose of delay.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b761-7\"> We reject Perez\u2019s argument that once he changed his mind and stated he was ready to represent himself that day, the court was required to find his motion timely. Such equivocation did not render the motion timely. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Hill, supra, </em>148 Cal.App.3d at p. 760 [\u201cwhere the sole consideration supporting granting the . . . <em>Faretta </em>motion is the defendant\u2019s willingness to forego a continuance (despite his representations that he considers one necessary) the most prudent course would be to deny the <em>Faretta </em>motion rather than condition its grant upon denial of the continuance\u201d].) Once Perez indicated on the record he was <em>not </em>prepared to go to trial that afternoon, the court was virtually required to deny the motion or to grant a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>continuance if it permitted Perez to proceed in propria persona. Otherwise, we could see an appellate argument in which Perez would assert denial of due process based on his being compelled to represent himself without adequate preparation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b762-8\">We recognize Perez\u2019s success on two of those motions implies they were not made frivolously and had some reasonable basis. However, on at least one of those motions, the conflict requiring substitution was entirely self created when Perez filed a complaint against his attorney with the State Bar. As the court hearing Perez\u2019s <em>Marsden </em>motion noted: \u201cWell, I\u2019m going to have to relieve [your attorney] because you\u2019ve discovered a very unique way of getting rid of a lawyer. That\u2019s file a complaint against the State Bar. That creates an almost irrefutable conflict of interest. So where one did not exist before, you have personally created on your own.\u201d Later at the hearing, the court emphasized \u201cyou further understand that if I grant this request based on what I am hearing, this is now the third very capable lawyer you\u2019ve had. You\u2019re going to get a fourth. And the likelihood of your going forward with that fourth is almost a hundred percent because you\u2019ve used the ploy now of filing a complaint against [your attorney], a very capable lawyer, as a means by which a conflict has arisen. And any future conduct in that regard is going to indicate to a judge that you you\u2019re just playing games.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b763-12\">Our conclusion does not reflect our belief a court is relieved from complying with <em>Windham </em>merely because the reasons for the court\u2019s exercise of discretion may later be gleaned from the record. <em>Windham </em>mandates a court provide the defendant an opportunity to show the specific facts weighing in favor of granting an untimely motion. \u201cA trial court should \u2018establish[ ] a record based on [the] relevant considerations\u2019 to facilitate appellate review. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Windham, supra, </em>19 Cal.3d 121, 128-129.)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hill, supra, </em>148 Cal.App.3d at p. 759; accord <em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez, supra, </em>163 Cal.App.3d 645, 650-653.) Where, as here, however, the reasons for the denial of the motion are absolutely clear on the record, we conclude there will be no detrimental effect on the justice system for the appellate court to draw the inferences necessarily implied by the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b763-13\"> Section 1181, subdivision 3 provides a court may grant a new trial \u201cWhen the jury has . . . been guilty of any misconduct by which a fair and due consideration of the case has been prevented.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b766-7\">The court specifically instructed the jury as follows: \u201cIt is a constitutional right of the defendant in a criminal trial that he may not be compelled to testify. You must not draw any inference from the fact that the defendant does not testify. <em>Further, you must neither discuss this matter nor permit it to enter into your deliberations in any way.\" </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b766-8\">At least one federal court and several courts in other jurisdictions have ruled to the contrary, holding that juror declarations regarding the jury\u2019s discussion of the defendant\u2019s failure to testify are inadmissible to impeach a verdict. (See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pavon </em>(D.C.Fla. 1985) 618 F.Supp. 1245; <em>State </em>v. <em>Walker </em>(Mo.Ct.App. 1990) 783 S.W.2d 145; <em>Sims </em>v. <em>State </em>(Fla. 1983) 444 So.2d 922; <em>State </em>v. <em>Myers </em>(1974) 215 Kan. 600 [527 P. 2d 1053,1057].) Those decisions, however, are inapposite, since under federal law and the law of each of those states the type of evidence which is admissible to impeach a verdict is substantially more limited than under California law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b767-10\">Section 667, subdivision (a) provides \u201cany person convicted of a serious felony who previously has been convicted of a serious felony . . . shall receive, in addition to the sentence imposed by the court for the present offense, a five-year enhancement for each such prior conviction on charges brought and tried separately.
