J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGU\">Plaintiffs Pamela Malcom (Pamela) and Medmetric Corporation (Medmetric) appeal summary judgment favoring defendant Farmers New World Life Insurance Company (Farmers) on their first amended complaint for breach of life insurance contracts. Plaintiffs contend the court erred in determining the contracts\u2019 suicide provision to be plain, clear, conspicuous and unambiguous as a matter of law. Plaintiffs also contend the court erred in concluding Farmers did not owe the decedent insured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Lawrence Malcom (Lawrence)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> an affirmative duty at time of purchase to advise him of the suicide provision\u2019s limiting effect. We affirm the summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">We state the undisputed facts in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">In 1982 Farmers issued and delivered two $100,000 policies on Lawrence\u2019s life with plaintiffs as beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">Each policy contained a clause providing: \u201cSuicide, whether sane or insane, will not be a risk assumed during the first two policy years. In such a case we will refund the premiums paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\"> In May 1984, within two years after the policies were issued, Lawrence committed suicide.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">In July 1984 Farmers received plaintiffs\u2019 claims seeking each policy\u2019s $100,000 benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">In December 1984 Farmers declined plaintiffs\u2019 claims on the basis Lawrence\u2019s death constituted a suicide occurring within the first two policy years.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">Superior Court Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"Ab0\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b253-14\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Pleading</p>\n<p id=\"AjN\">In December 1988 plaintiffs sued Farmers.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Plaintiffs\u2019 first amended complaint alleged Farmers breached the contracts by not paying plaintiffs\u2019 claims for benefits \u201cfor covered risks which were not specifically excluded under the contracts <em>[sic] </em>terms.\u201d Plaintiffs also alleged Farmers should have known Lawrence was a high suicide risk based on discussions with Lawrence and his insurance applications\u2019 disclosure of his history of observation, care, and hospital treatment for depression.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Farmers\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Farmers sought summary judgment, asserting it was not obligated to pay plaintiffs benefits because the policies clearly, conspicuously and unambiguously precluded coverage for death by suicide within the first two policy years.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">After hearing, the court stated the policies\u2019 suicide provision was \u201cconspicuous,\u201d \u201cbold,\u201d \u201cclear\u201d and \u201cunambiguous.\u201d The court granted Farmers\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">Plaintiffs seek reversal of the summary judgment, asserting the superior court erred in determining the policies\u2019 suicide provision to be plain, clear, conspicuous and unambiguous. Plaintiffs also contend the suicide provision\u2019s asserted ambiguity prevented the policies as a whole from meeting Lawrence\u2019s reasonable expectation of coverage. Plaintiffs further contend circumstances at the time of purchase imposed on Farmers a legal duty\u2014 assertedly breached by Farmers\u2014to point out the suicide provision and explain its limited effect to Lawrence. Interpretation of the meaning of Farmers\u2019 policies\u2019 language is a question of law for our independent determination. <em>(Fragomeno </em>v. <em>Insurance Co. of the West </em>(1989) 207 Cal.App.3d 822, 827 [255 Cal.Rptr. 111].) We conclude as a matter of law the suicide provision barred plaintiffs\u2019 benefit claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b254-12\">Suicide Provision Was Plain, Clear and Conspicuous</p>\n<p id=\"b254-13\">Plaintiffs contend the suicide provision is not \u201cplain and clear\u201d and \u201cconspicuous.\u201d <em>(Crane </em>v. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. </em>(1971) 5 Cal.3d 112, 115 [95 Cal.Rptr. 513 [485 P.2d 1129, 48 A.L.R.3d 1089].) It is.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>1</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">\u201cTo be plain and clear, the substance of the exclusion must be precise and understandable. \u2018To be effective in this context, the exclusion must be couched in words which are part of the working vocabulary of average lay persons.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Travelers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Lesher </em>(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 169, 184 [231 Cal.Rptr. 791].) That is, precision alone is not enough, understandability is also required. <em>(Ponder </em>v. <em>Blue Cross of Southern California </em>(1983) 145 Cal.App.3d 709, 723 [193 Cal.Rptr. 632].)</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">At the hearing on Farmers\u2019 motion for summary judgment, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, while contesting conspicuousness, conceded the language of the suicide provision was \u201cplain and clear.\u201d Plaintiffs now contend the court should not have found the suicide provision to be plain and clear because its words \u201ca risk assumed\u201d were assertedly \u201cwords of art in the insurance industry and are not used in the normal manner in which they are used by lay persons.\u201d Plaintiffs also assert the suicide provision was unclear in not specifying whether risks were assumed by the insured or by the insurer. Assuming plaintiffs may raise those contentions on appeal despite their concession in superior court, we conclude as a matter of law the suicide provision was plain and clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Farmers\u2019 policies\u2019 suicide provision contains only 27 words. The provision states: \u201cSuicide, whether sane or insane, will not be a risk assumed during the first two policy years. In such a case we will refund the premiums paid.\u201d None of those words was beyond the working vocabulary of lay persons. Further, the suicide provision\u2019s second sentence expressly states <em>Farmers </em>would refund premiums for claims for suicide occurring within the policies\u2019 first two years. Thus, the policies clearly identified Farmers as the party not assuming risk of loss for such suicides. Where, as here, an insurer has clearly limited its coverage, the limitation\u2019s plain language must be respected. <em>(Blumberg </em>v. <em>Guarantee Ins. Co. </em>(1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 1286, 1296 [238 Cal.Rptr. 36] ,)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>2</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">\u201cTo be conspicuous, an exclusion must be positioned in a place and printed in a form which will attract the reader\u2019s attention. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Travelers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Lesher, supra, </em>187 Cal.App.3d at p. 184.)</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Farmers\u2019 policies mentioned suicide twice. On the policies\u2019 second page, the \u201cAlphabetic Guide to Your Policy\u201d listed \u201cSuicide\u201d and the suicide provision\u2019s location in the policy. Following the page with the alphabetic guide was the page containing the suicide provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Plaintiffs contend the policies\u2019 two references to suicide were not conspicuous. Plaintiffs assert the alphabetic guide\u2019s reference to suicide appeared in small type as the 31st of 32 items. Plaintiffs assert the suicide provision appeared as the sixth item in an eight-item list in the second column of the policies\u2019 \u201cGeneral Provisions.\u201d However, we conclude the suicide provision was in a place and form readily attracting the reader\u2019s attention. <em>(Travelers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Lesher, supra, </em>187 Cal.App.3d at p. 184.)</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">The suicide provision was located on the policy\u2019s third page\u2014the first operative page after the cover page and the alphabetical guide\u2014and preceded by the bold-faced capitalized word \u201cSuicide.\u201d The suicide provision contained only 27 words and was clearly separated from its neighboring provisions by several blank lines and blank spaces. The provision was neither submerged in \u201ca sea of print\u201d nor \u201cinserted incidentally in a paragraph dealing with promised benefits.\u201d <em>(Schmidt </em>v. <em>Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>(1969) 268 Cal.App.2d 735, 737-740 [74 Cal.Rptr. 367].) Nor was it otherwise hidden or obscured. (Compare <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Elite Ins. Co. </em>(1980) 100 Cal.App.3d 739, 752 [161 Cal.Rptr. 322]; <em>Ponder </em>v. <em>Blue Cross of Southern California, supra, </em>145 Cal.App.3d at pp. 722-723; <em>Fields </em>v. <em>Blue Shield of California </em>(1985) 163 Cal.App.3d 570, 579 [209 Cal.Rptr. 781]; also <em>Davis </em>v. <em>United Services Auto. Assn. </em>(1990) 223 Cal.App.3d 1322, 1332-1333 [273 Cal.Rptr. 224].)</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">In sum, Farmers had the right to limit its policies\u2019 coverage. <em>(Blumberg </em>v. <em>Guarantee Ins. Co., supra, </em>192 Cal.App.3d at p. 1296.) The suicide provision clearly and conspicuously conveyed its message in understandable language. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">Farmers Had No Duty to Point Out and Explain Suicide Provision</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Plaintiffs contend the summary judgment should be reversed because the record assertedly contained triable material factual issues about whether at the time Lawrence bought the policies Farmers owed him an affirmative duty to point out the suicide provision and explain its limiting effect on coverage. Citing <em>Westrick </em>v. <em>State Farm Insurance </em>(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 685, 691, footnote 3 [187 Cal.Rptr. 214],<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> plaintiffs assert such affirmative duty of disclosure arose because there was disparity of knowledge between Farmers and Lawrence. Specifically, plaintiffs assert Lawrence\u2019s inquiries about the effect his earlier treatments for depression might have on the policies\u2019 scope of coverage and Lawrence\u2019s disclosed history of mental and psychological instability demonstrated he apparently lacked knowledge\u2014and Farmers had superior knowledge\u2014about the policies\u2019 coverage and limitations on coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s theory Farmers breached an affirmative duty of disclosure exceeds the scope of their first amended complaint. Plaintiffs pleaded only breach of contract. Plaintiffs did not allege Farmers breached any duty of disclosure under the theory of <em>Westrick </em>v. <em>State Farm Insurance, supra, </em>137 Cal.App.3d 685.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Plaintiffs simply alleged Farmers should have known Lawrence was a high suicide risk based on discussions with Lawrence and his disclosure of his history of observation, care and hospital treatment for depression. Moreover, assuming the pleadings could be read as encompassing the issue of Farmers\u2019 asserted breach of an affirmative duty of disclosure, the only evidence presented on that issue was consistent with the summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Supporting its motion for summary judgment, Farmers submitted its life claims examiner Olson\u2019s declaration asserting she determined Lawrence\u2019s death was not covered by Farmers\u2019 policies and benefits were not payable due to the policies\u2019 suicide provision. Attached to Olson\u2019s declaration were copies of the policies. As discussed earlier, the suicide provision of those policies was as a matter of law plain, clear, conspicuous, and unambiguous and thus barred plaintiffs\u2019 benefit claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Opposing Farmers\u2019 motion for summary judgment, plaintiffs submitted their counsel\u2019s declaration attaching portions of Farmers\u2019 agent Sullivan\u2019s deposition. At deposition Sullivan stated when applying for the policies Lawrence asked about any effect his treatment for depression would have on his application and Sullivan replied the decision was up to the underwriter. Sullivan did not recall discussing with Lawrence or Pamela the suicide provision, the two-year contestability provision, or any other policy term or condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The mere fact when applying for the policies Lawrence asked Farmers about the effect his treatment for depression might have on his application did not impose upon Farmers an affirmative duty to advise him specifically about the suicide provision and its effect on coverage. The record contained no evidence suggesting Lawrence asked Farmers for coverage for all suicide-related death or asked Farmers whether the policies would cover suicide-related death.  Neither did the record contain evidence suggesting Lawrence sought clarification of the suicide provision after receiving the policies.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In sum, there was no evidence suggesting Farmers knew Lawrence entered the transaction under a mistaken belief the policies would cover all suicide-related death. <em>(Westrick </em>v. <em>State Farm Insurance, supra, </em>137 Cal.App.3d at p. 691, fn. 3.) Thus, the superior court properly determined there was no triable factual issue whether Farmers was under an affirmative duty to advise Lawrence specifically about the suicide provision and its effect on coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Farmers was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because this record disclosed no triable issue of material fact. The superior court properly granted summary judgment favoring Farmers.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Work, J., and Froehlich, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">Appellants\u2019 petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied June 10, 1992.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b253-15\"> For purposes of clarity we refer to the Malcoms by their first names.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b253-16\"> The parties stipulated Lawrence\u2019s death constituted a \u201csuicide\u201d under <em>Searle </em>v. <em>Allstate Life Ins. Co. </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 425, 437 [212 Cal.Rptr. 466, 696 P.2d 1308], In <em>Searle </em>the Supreme Court stated the burden of proving suicide \u201crequires more than proof of the act of self-destruction, the proof must further establish that the act was committed with suicidal intent, i.e., the purposeful or intentional causing of death.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 437, fn. omitted.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b255-7\"> We also reject plaintiffs\u2019 similar contention the suicide clause was ambiguous because it could be read to mean that Lawrence did not have to worry about assuming any risk of suicide during the policies\u2019 first two years. Courts may not fabricate an ambiguity through a strained or absurd construction of otherwise clear language. <em>(Producers Dairy Delivery Co. </em>v. <em>Sentry Ins. Co. </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 903, 912 [226 Cal.Rptr. 558, 718 P.2d 920].) The words in question here manifestly referred to suicide occurring within the policies\u2019 first two years and made clear Farmers assumed no risk for such suicide. Since the provision is unambiguous plaintiffs\u2019 contention coverage should be extended consistent with Lawrence\u2019s reasonable expectations also fails. \u201cThe doctrine of reasonable expectation of coverage is applicable only where the language of the policy is ambiguous.
