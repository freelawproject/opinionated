The Pomona, California property had been used as a gasoline station. The station was 23 years old, with some renovation in recent years. It was a self-service station with \u201cno frills.\u201d The soil on the land was contaminated due to gasoline spillage. Gasoline sales constantly declined during the years prior to the station being taken by City. Thrifty\u2019s financial documents indicated the station was losing money.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The only issues to be determined by the jury were the value of the parcel of property and the value of the business goodwill.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Prior to trial City took possession of the property and spent $182,000 to treat the contamination in a remediation procedure. Thrifty\u2019s expert opined that the real property was worth $950,000 ($1 million less $50,000 for the cost of remediation). City\u2019s expert opined that the property was worth $5,000, after deducting the cost of remediation. The expert appointed by the court opined that the fair market value of the property was $125,000, after deducting a reasonable cost for remediation. The jury determined the fair market value of the real property was $136,200.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">On the issue of goodwill, Thrifty\u2019s expert suggested the value of lost goodwill was $125,000. City suggested the expert\u2019s opinion was not reasonably based and that no goodwill was lost. City did not present expert testimony on this issue. The jury determined lost goodwill was $67,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">Thrifty\u2019s appeal raises a broad spectrum of issues, none of which show reversal is warranted. When relevant, additional facts are delineated below.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">In the unpublished portions of this opinion (pts. I, IVA, IVD, IVE and V), we discuss the admission of an augmented appraisal report, specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>instructions, and the accusation of judicial misconduct. In the published portions of this opinion (pts. II, III, IVB, IVC and VI), we deal with issues relating to property fair market value, goodwill value, instructions regarding remediation, instructions regarding goodwill, and the disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Augmented Appraisal Report<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Property Fair Market Value</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">Contrary to Thrifty\u2019s suggestion, the fair market value of the property was shown by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">Thrifty\u2019s expert utilized the income capitalization approach to reach his conclusion that the real property was worth $950,000 ($1 million less $50,000 for remediation cost). This conclusion was based upon comparable leases. <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> City\u2019s expert determined the best approach to value the property was the market data/sales approach; he concluded the property was worth $5,000. This sum was ascertained after the expert explained that the property was worth $165,000, but that after deducting the cost of remediation (approximately $182,000) the property would have only minimal value. He also rejected the income capitalization approach stating the circumstances did not warrant its use. The court-appointed appraiser also rejected the income capitalization approach used by Thrifty\u2019s expert and concluded the property was worth $125,000. This opinion was reached after valuing the property and then deducting approximately $100,000 for remediation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\n                   The experts disagreed as to the significance of many factors, such as the declining sales of gasoline, the financial information which indicated the station was losing money, the poor location of the station, traffic counts, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>station\u2019s self-service facilities, contamination, the surrounding environment and the costs for getting rid of the contamination, i.e., the remediation costs.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, all of these factors were presented to the jury for its consideration. This evidence, amply supports the jury\u2019s conclusion that the fair market value of the property was $136,200.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Goodwill Value</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">In eminent domain actions, neither party has the burden of proof with regard to compensation. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1260.210, subd. (b).) Thus, both the landowner and the condemning entity offer evidence as to property valuation. The jury\u2019s award for the value of the real property must be \u201cwithin the range of expert testimony if such testimony is the only substantial evidence in the case.\u201d <em>(Foreman &amp; Clark Corp. </em>v. <em>Fallon </em>(1971) 3 Cal.3d 875, 889 [92 Cal.Rptr. 162, 479 P.2d 362]; see <em>Redevelopment Agency </em>v. <em>Modell </em>(1960) 177 Cal.App.2d 321, 326-327 [2 Cal.Rptr. 245]; <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>D. of P.

(Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1263.510; <em>Redevelopment Agency </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Theatres Corp. </em>(1989) 215 Cal.App.3d 808, 811 [263 Cal.Rptr. 637]; <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Dept of Transportation </em>v. <em>Salami </em>(1991) 2 Cal.App.4th 37, 44 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 833].) After entitlement to goodwill is shown (which includes a showing that compensation for the loss will not be duplicated) neither party has the burden of proof with regard to <em>valuation. (Redevelopment Agency </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Theatres Corp., supra, </em>215 Cal.App.3d at p. 812; <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Dept, of Transportation </em>v. <em>Salami, supra, </em>2 Cal.App.4th at p. 45.)</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">Thrifty\u2019s expert valued the lost goodwill at $125,000. Prior to trial, City\u2019s expert opined that the value of lost goodwill was $80,000. City\u2019s expert\u2019s valuation was without regard to soil contamination and it assumed Thrifty had met its burden in proving that such goodwill existed pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1263.510. Thrifty was aware of the opinion by City\u2019s expert.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> At trial, the opinion of Thrifty\u2019s expert was admitted into evidence. City, however, took the position that no goodwill was shown and thus did not submit an expert opinion on the value of goodwill. City\u2019s goodwill appraisal of $80,000, therefore, was unknown to the jury. The jury awarded $67,500 for the value of goodwill.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">We do not find persuasive Thrifty\u2019s contention that the issue of goodwill must be redetermined.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">In presenting its case, City pointed to the fact that the gallonage was constantly decreasing, that the property was at a secondary location (one not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>located near a freeway), that the station was in a dilapidated area of Pomona, and that the station was losing money. Additionally, there was potential that in proving goodwill value, Thrifty would duplicate the award given for the real property. Thrifty\u2019s expert, who appraised the value of the land, utilized monthly rental value (purportedly to be $7,000 per month) to reach a conclusion. Monthly rental value was also utilized by Thrifty\u2019s other expert in valuing goodwill compensation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Based upon these facts, City suggested Thrifty had not met its burden to prove goodwill existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">On appeal, Thrifty contends the jury only had before it the valuation of its expert and thus was limited to that value.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> However, this contention neglects the concept that the jury is limited in eminent domain cases to the evidence of experts which is competent and substantial. The jury is not precluded from evaluating the credibility of witnesses. <em>(Marshall </em>v. <em>Department of Water &amp; Power </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 1124, 1147 [268 Cal.Rptr. 559].) By arguing that no goodwill existed and by not presenting any evidence as to its value, City attacked Thrifty\u2019s valuation arguing the existence of goodwill had not been proven by competent evidence. Thus City suggested Thrifty had not met its burden of proof on the issue of entitlement of goodwill. Additionally, by proceeding in this manner, City was also establishing as a floor the sum of $0 as the value of goodwill. <em>{Ibid, </em>[entity\u2019s failure to present evidence on value sets floor at $0].)</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">If a governmental entity reasonably believes that there is no goodwill and the landowner has not met the burden to prove entitlement, the governmental entity can argue this position to the jury. It need not, as would be concluded from Thrifty\u2019s suggestion, put into evidence expert valuation evidence which it finds to be unsupported.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Here, prior to trial City\u2019s expert opined that lost goodwill was worth $80,000. However, in reaching this conclusion the expert assumed that entitlement to goodwill had been shown and that remediation had no effect on the value. At trial, however, cross-examination of Thrifty\u2019s expert and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>other evidence (such as the location of the property and its financial condition) could have supported a finding that no goodwill existed.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> City therefore reasonably argued there was no competent evidence to support Thrifty\u2019s claim for lost goodwill. City did not conceal any information in presenting its case. Rather, City reasonably examined the evidence and concluded no goodwill existed; City had the prerogative of presenting its case in this fashion.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Although the jury did not totally accept City\u2019s position, the evidence would have supported a finding that no goodwill was proven. <em>(People </em>ex rel. <em>Dept. Pub. Works </em>v. <em>Bond </em>(1964) 231 Cal.App.2d 435 [41 Cal.Rptr. 900, 13 A.L.R.3d 1142] [verdict less than experts\u2019 opinions supported by the evidence]; <em>Sacramento etc. Drainage Dist. </em>v. <em>W.P.

As discussed above (see fn. No. 9), remediation was properly considered by the jury in valuing the fair market value of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">C. <em>Goodwill</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The jury was instructed with versions of certain instructions requested by Thrifty which were modified slightly by the court. These instructions informed the jury that it was not bound to accept the opinion of any witness on the issue of compensation and that it had to determine the compensation to be paid for the property acquired and the goodwill loss, \u201cif any, . . .\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>\n                   Thrifty suggests that the court\u2019s added words \u201cif any\u201d were prejudicial because \u201c(1) there was no question that Thrifty had lost goodwill; and (2) Thrifty was entitled to be compensated for its loss of goodwill.\u201d However, as discussed above (see pt. Ill), the evidence on the entitlement to goodwill was not conclusive, thus there was a question as to whether an award was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Additionally, the jury was instructed with BAJI No. 11.98, \u201cExcept on the issue of loss of goodwill, neither the plaintiff nor the defendant has the burden of proof on the issue of compensation.\u201d A modified version of BAJI No. 11.91 was also utilized. This instruction defined goodwill, stated that the owner had to prove the four elements required pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1263.510 (see fn. 11) and defined what was required by a preponderance of the evidence.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The court refused to give two other instructions proffered by Thrifty: (No. 24) \u201cA loss of goodwill caused by the taking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>of a business location is compensable\u201d; and (No. 28) \u201cNeither the plaintiff nor the defendant has a burden of proof on the amount of compensation for loss of goodwill.\u201d Citing two recent cases, <em>Redevelopment Agency </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Theatres Corp., supra, </em>215 Cal.App.3d 808 and <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Dept, of Transportation </em>v. <em>Salami, supra, </em>2 Cal.App.4th 37, Thrifty argues this was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">As discussed above (see pt. Ill), <em>Metropolitan Theatres </em>and <em>Salami </em>hold that the landowner has the burden of proof on the issue of <em>entitlement </em>to an award for the loss of goodwill, but not on the issue of <em>compensation </em>for loss of goodwill. In <em>Metropolitan Theatres, </em>the parties stipulated that the landowner had met its burden to prove entitlement of goodwill by meeting the requirements of Code of Civil Procedure section 1263.510, i.e., that the condemnation caused the loss of goodwill, that the loss could not be prevented by relocation, that relocation expenses were not involved, and there was no duplication in other compensation. (See fn. 11.) The <em>Metropolitan Theatres </em>court refused to instruct the jury that the landowner had the burden of establishing the <em>amount </em>of goodwill but merely instructed the jury that neither party \u201chas the burden of proof on the issue of compensation.\u201d (215 Cal.App.3d at p. 810.) <em>Metropolitan Theatres </em>did not discuss at length the evidence. However, since there was a stipulation on the issue of entitlement, the court concluded there was no instructional error and that had there been error it would have been harmless. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 812.) In <em>Salami </em>the parties also stipulated that the landowner had met his burden to establish the entitlement of compensation pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1263.510. The only evidence on the value of the loss of goodwill was presented by the landowner, who valued it at $277,300. In addition to other instructions, the <em>Salami </em>jury was instructed with BAJI No. 11.98, \u201c[e]xcept on the issue of loss of good will, neither the plaintiff nor the defendant has the burden of proof on the issue of competition <em>[sic] </em>(compensation).]\u201d The jury was also instructed that the landowner had the burden to prove that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>goodwill existed. In that the jury awarded zero for the loss of goodwill and the parties had stipulated that entitlement was not in issue, the <em>Salami </em>court concluded that the instructions erroneously placed the burden of proof on the landowner on the issue of the amount of compensation and reversal was warranted. (2 Cal.App.4th at p. 46.)</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Here, any problems generated by instructions which were not precise and which switched the burden of proof on the issue of <em>entitlement </em>were not prejudicial. By awarding Thrifty $67,500 for goodwill the jury determined Thrifty had proven it was entitled to goodwill and flatly rejected City\u2019s claim that no loss was shown. Although the award indicates the jury did not totally agree with Thrifty\u2019s valuation of the loss, the instructions did not prevent the jury from properly considering all of the evidence. Thus, the jury would not have awarded a different amount of compensation had the instructions been more precisely stated. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243].)</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">D., E.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Judicial Misconduct*</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-11\">Turner, P.

The contamination of the property was used by all experts in determining the fair market value of the property. Extensive cross-examination was conducted as to the proper remediation procedure and the costs of different types of remediation. Inherent in this discussion was the reasonableness of the procedures taken by City. As a characteristic of the property which would affect its value, the remediation issue was properly before the trier of fact. <em>(San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Daley </em>(1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 1334, 1346 [253 Cal.Rptr. 144]; <em>County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Bean </em>(1959) 176 Cal.App.2d 521, 527 [1 Cal.Rptr. 464].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b366-9\"> Goodwill \u201cconsists of the benefits that accrue to a business as a result of its location, reputation for dependability, skill or quality, and any other circumstances resulting in probable retention of old or acquisition of new patronage.\u201d (Code.

[\u00b6] The term goodwill as used in this instruction means the benefits that attach to a business as a result of its location, its reputation for dependability, skill, or quality and any other circumstances resulting in probable retention of old patronage or acquisition of new patronage, [\u00b6] In order to establish a loss of goodwill, the burden of proof is on the owner to prove each of the following by a preponderance of the evidence: [&lt;\u00a10 One, that goodwill exists; [\u00b6] Two, that the loss of goodwill will be caused by the taking of the property being taken; [\u00b6] Three, that the loss [cannot] reasonably be prevented by a relocation of the business or by taking steps and adopting procedures that a reasonably prudent person would take and adopt in preserving the goodwill; [\u00b6] Four, that the compensation for the loss will not be duplicated in the compensation otherwise awarded to the owner, [\u00b6] By a preponderance of the evidence is meant such evidence as, when weighed with that opposed to it, has more convincing force and the greater probability of truth. [\u00b6] If the evidence is so evenly balanced that you are unable to say that the evidence on either side of an issue preponderates, then your finding upon that issue must be against the owner.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b372-13\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 469.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
