We will deny the petition, on the ground petitioners failed to satisfy the demands of Code of Civil Procedure<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 437c. This case is a laboratory example of the application of section 437c; we publish for this reason alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Petitioners hired Whitten Excavation Company, an independent contractor, to haul water. Whitten employed real party Peter Cobb to drive a water truck. He was doing so when he lost control of the truck and it overturned. The accident took place \u201cat South 10th Street (also known as 25 Hill Road), 148 feet north of Buena Vista Place, Kern County, California.\u201d Petitioners were the agents and employees of each other and were acting within the course and scope of such agency at all relevant times.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">Real parties allege in the fifth cause of action that petitioners are liable for Cobb\u2019s injuries arising out of the accident for the following reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-10\">\u201cAt all times relevant herein [petitioners] knew or should have known that Whitten Excavation Company would use mechanically defective trucks to haul the water and that such method of hauling water would constitute a hazard to [Cobb] as the driver of the truck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-11\">\u201c[Petitioners] negligently failed to exercise reasonable care to employ a competent and careful contractor to haul the water by employing Whitten Excavation Company knowing that the trucks used to haul the water were mechanically defective. Such negligence was the proximate cause of [Cobb\u2019s] injuries and damages alleged herein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-12\">Petitioners brought a motion for summary judgment and, in the alternative, for summary adjudication of numerous listed issues. Opposition was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>filed. The court announced at the hearing it would grant summary adjudication as to one issue,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but would otherwise deny the motion. Thereafter, petitioners filed this challenge to the trial court\u2019s written order denying the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">A defendant who moves for summary judgment must either <em>prove </em>an affirmative defense which would bar every cause of action pled in the complaint or <em>disprove </em>at least one essential element of each cause of action in the complaint. <em>(Twain Harte Associates, Ltd. </em>v. <em>County of Tuolumne </em>(1990) 217 Cal.App.3d 71, 79-80 [265 Cal.Rptr. 737].) The moving party must show that under no possible hypothesis within the reasonable purview of the allegations of the complaint is there a material question of fact which requires examination by trial. <em>(Molko </em>v. <em>Holy Spirit Assn. </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 1092, 1107 [252 Cal.Rptr. 122, 762 P.2d 46]; <em>Pultz </em>v. <em>Hogerson </em>(1986) 184 Cal.App.3d 1110,1114 [229 Cal.Rptr. 531].) If the defendant does not satisfy its burden as the moving party, the motion must be denied, and it is unnecessary for the court to consider the plaintiff\u2019s opposition, if any. <em>(Conn </em>v. <em>National Can Corp. </em>(1981) 124 Cal.App.3d 630, 639 [177 Cal.Rptr. 445]; <em>Residents of Beverly Glen, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1973) 34 Cal.App.3d 117, 127 [109 Cal.Rptr. 724].)</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">In evaluating the correctness of a ruling under section 437c, we must independently review the record before the trial court. Because the grant or denial of a motion under section 437c involves pure questions of law, we are required to reassess the legal significance and effect of the papers presented by the parties in connection with the motion. <em>(Saldana </em>v. <em>Globe-Weiss Systems Co. </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1505, 1513 [285 Cal.Rptr. 385].) We thus must apply the same three-step analysis required of the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">\u201c \u2018First, we identify the issues framed by the pleadings since it is these allegations to which the motion must respond ....[$ Secondly, we determine whether the moving party\u2019s showing has established facts which negate the opponent\u2019s claim and justify a judgment in movant\u2019s favor. . . . [\u00b6] When a summary judgment motion prima facie justifies a judgment, the third and final step is to determine whether the opposition demonstrates the existence of a triable, material factual issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Zuckerman </em>v. <em>Pacific Savings Bank </em>(1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 1394, 1400-1401 [232 Cal.Rptr. 458]; see also <em>Saldana </em>v. <em>Globe-Weiss Systems Co., supra, </em>233 Cal.App.3d atp. 1513.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>In practical effect, we assume the role of a trial court and redetermine the merits of the motion. In doing so, we must rigidly scrutinize the moving parties\u2019 papers. (See <em>Rincon </em>v. <em>Burbank Unified School Dist. </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 949, 954-955 [224 Cal.Rptr. 88]; and <em>Jos. Schlitz Brewing Co. </em>v. <em>Downey Distributor </em>(1980) 109 Cal.App.3d 908, 915-918 [167 Cal.Rptr. 510].)</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">The fifth cause of action of real parties\u2019 first amended complaint asserts petitioners were negligent because they knew or should have known, when they hired Whitten, that it would use defective trucks and that such conditions would create a risk of harm to persons such as real party.  As all parties acknowledge, this theory of recovery is the \u201cnegligent hiring\u201d exception to the general rule that an employer is not liable for the torts of an independent contractor or of the employees of the independent contractor. <em>(Green </em>v. <em>Soule </em>(1904) 145 Cal. 96, 99 [78 R 337].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under this exception, an employer who negligently fails to employ a competent and careful contractor may be liable for injuries caused by the contractor\u2019s failure to exercise due care. <em>(Risley </em>v. <em>Lenwell </em>(1954) 129 Cal.App.2d 608, 622 [277 R2d 897]; <em>Gettemy </em>v. <em>Star House Movers, Inc. </em>(1964) 225 Cal.App.2d 636, 643 [37 Cal.Rptr. 441].) The employer\u2019s knowledge of the existence of the risk of harm is an important factor in determining whether the exception applies to a particular fact situation. <em>(Risley, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.2d at p. 622; <em>Gettemy, supra, </em>225 Cal.App.2d at p. 643.)</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Having identified the theory of liability relied upon in the first amended complaint, we must next determine whether the admissible evidence contained in the moving papers entitles petitioners to judgment as a matter of law. <em>(Zuckerman </em>v. <em>Pacific Savings Bank, supra, </em>187 Cal.App.3d at p. 1400.) In this regard, the evidence purporting to support petitioners\u2019 proposed undisputed facts consists of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">\n<em>Declaration of Gary Whitten</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-7\">\u2014Whitten owns Whitten Excavation and is familiar with its projects.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-8\">\u2014On the day of the accident, Cobb was assigned to work on the Jubilian project, which was unrelated to the Chevron job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>\u2014The Jubilian project was located near Elk Hills City and the Elk Hills Naval Reserve.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-4\">\u2014Cobb picked up the water truck at the Chevron site; the truck was used at this site until the day before the accident, when it was moved to another, unrelated site.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">\u2014Cobb drove the truck to the Jubilian site the day before the accident and returned it to the Chevron site for the evening.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\">\u2014On the morning of the accident, Cobb was told that the 1969 water truck would be again needed at the Jubilian site, and the accident occurred while he was traveling towards the Jubilian site.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">\n<em>Deposition of Gary Whitten</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">\u2014On the day of the accident Cobb was driving from the Chevron site to a jobsite \u201ccalled Elk Hills City,\u201d where \u201c[sjomebody was trying to develop an area.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-9\">\u2014Cobb drove the truck the morning of the day before the accident to the same job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-10\">\u2014By reviewing company time cards and talking to \u201cother people,\u201d Whit-ten \u201cfigured out\u201d where Cobb was headed \u201cthat morning.\u201d He was not working at the Chevron site because he was headed away from it. Whitten was convinced that Cobb was working at the Jubilian project after a thorough study of the time cards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-11\">\u2014Jubilian was a developer who was trying to develop a \u201cmultiple family project.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-12\">\u2014Jubilian had never been to Whitten to inspect its equipment before Whitten was hired as a subcontractor, nor had Jubilian asked to see any maintenance schedules, fleet records, or DMV records on Whitten\u2019s trucks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-13\">\u2014Jay Robertson was another company employee who worked at the Jubilian site, \u201crunning a motor grader.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-14\">\u2014The only equipment supplied by Whitten to Jubilian before the accident was a water truck and motor grader, for which Whitten has invoices. All Whitten did at the Jubilian site was rough grading, weed eradication, and dust control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-15\">\u2014Whitten obtained the Jubilian work by telephone contact with someone who cannot now be recalled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>\u2014Whitten was at the Jubilian site for three or four days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-4\">\u2014Whitten believed Jubilian identified his project as \u201cElk Hills City.\u201d Whitten does not know if it was \u201cever developed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">\n<em>Deposition of Jack Moseley</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">\u2014Moseley was not \u201cpart of\u2019 the negotiations which resulted in the Whitten subcontract. It was \u201cDavid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">\u2014The contract between G &amp; D and Whitten was oral. Whitten did not have to \u201cgive Chevron any of the subcontractors\u2019 charges in order to be paid ... for this contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-8\">\u2014Moseley does not recall what Whitten was paid, but thinks \u201cit\u2019s 46,000.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-9\">\u2014Even though the truck was a \u201clittle old,\u201d it was \u201cpainted good and looked good.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">It is obvious these few, detached evidentiary facts are inadequate to prove, without question and as a matter of law, that petitioners, or any one or more of them, are not liable to real parties as claimed under the fifth cause of action. For example, real parties have alleged petitioners knew or should have known of Whitten\u2019s defective trucks. However, there is nothing in petitioners\u2019 evidence, directly or by reasonable inference, which establishes petitioners did not know Whitten would, and did in fact, use a defective water truck. In this regard, the deposition testimony of Jack Moseley, which is the only evidence pertaining to petitioners\u2019 knowledge, simply demonstrates that <em>he </em>knew the trucks were old but thought they were \u201cpainted good and looked good.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This proves nothing about Moseley\u2019s, or anyone else\u2019s, knowledge concerning the actual mechanical condition of the water truck, Whitten\u2019s equipment in general, or Whitten\u2019s alleged habit of using defective machinery. Further, it does not establish without question that no other responsible Chevron or G &amp; D employee had such knowledge or had any reason to have such knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">Similarly, to the extent petitioners argue they are not liable because the accident occurred \u201con a public highway\u201d and off the Chevron jobsite, their submittals fail to unambiguously prove this was the case. The location <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>identified in the fifth cause of action, \u201cat South 10th Street (also known as 25 Hill Road) 148 feet north of Buena Vista Place,\u201d and the location referred to in petitioners\u2019 undisputed facts, \u201con 25 Hill Road,\u201d are patently inadequate to identify the spot of the accident as \u201con a public highway.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The remaining evidence in petitioners\u2019 papers relevant to this subject shows only that Cobb was hurt while he was \u201ctravelling towards\u201d the Jubilian site, while he was \u201cdriving from\u201d the Chevron site to the Jubilian site, or while he was \u201cheaded away from\u201d the Chevron site. Nothing in this evidence enables us to <em>conclusively </em>determine that the truck had \u201ctraveled,\u201d \u201cdriven,\u201d or \u201cheaded\u201d far enough to in fact be off the Chevron property when the accident happened. Similarly, petitioners\u2019 assertion that Cobb was \u201cworking on another job\u201d at the time of the accident is not clearly shown. The fact Cobb had been \u201cassigned\u201d to work at the Jubilian project does not establish he was there when the accident occurred. In fact, as noted above, if the petitioners\u2019 evidence proves anything, it proves Cobb had not arrived at the Jubilian site. The testimony and declarations recite he was \u201ctravelling toward\u201d this project when he was hurt.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">Petitioners may not be liable to real parties on the facts and the law relevant to this case. However, they have not shown this to be unquestionably true in their moving papers.  In order to obtain summary judgment, petitioners, as the moving defendants, must establish, directly or inferentially,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> all the facts necessary to entitle them to judgment as a matter of law, without the aid of assumptions or guesswork. In effect, for purposes of section 437c, a moving defendant is statutorily treated as a \u201cplaintiff,\u201d and hence must present sufficient facts to make out a prima facie case of nonliability. If the defendant meets this burden, and if the plaintiff fails to contradict one or more of the material facts upon which the defendant\u2019s case of nonliability rests, the defendant will be entitled to the practical equivalent of a statutory \u201cdirected verdict.\u201d However, if, as here, the defendant\u2019s showing is insufficient to satisfy its burden, the trial court must declare a form of statutory \u201cnon-suit\u201d and deny the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">It is immaterial that the few facts offered by petitioners may in reality be all that are available to the parties in the case. While this state of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>the evidence could have a bearing on whether real parties can prove their case at trial, it is irrelevant to the outcome of a motion under section 437c, where the burden of proof is on the moving defendant, not the responding plaintiff. <em>(.Security Pac. Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Associated Motor Sales </em>(1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 171,179 [165 Cal.Rptr. 38].) We concede it is ofttimes difficult, usually time consuming, normally expensive\u2014and, in some instances, even impossible\u2014for a defendant to meet the demands of the statute. As a consequence, certain cases simply may not lend themselves to resolution by way of summary judgment. <em>(Barnes </em>v. <em>Blue Haven Pools </em>(1969) 1 Cal.App.3d 123, 128 [81 Cal.Rptr. 444].) Nonetheless, the evidentiary impediments faced by a defendant do not lessen or eliminate the burden of proof imposed by the summary judgment law. <em>{Conn </em>v. <em>National Can Corp., supra, </em>124 Cal.App.3d at pp. 639-640.)  Contrary to petitioners\u2019 contention in its motion filed with the trial court, under section 437c the fact the plaintiff may have \u201cno evidence\u201d with which to prove its case, and is therefore likely to be nonsuited at trial, does not warrant entry of summary judgment in favor of the defendant. <em>{Barnes </em>v. <em>Blue Haven Pools, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.3d at p. 126; 3 Weil &amp; Brown, Cal. Civil Procedure Before Trial (The Rutter Group 1991) <em>f </em>10.243, p. 10-59.)</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">Petitioners have not presented sufficient undisputed facts to absolutely \u201cnegative\u201d the liability of any one or more of them for Cobb\u2019s injuries. <em>(Barnes, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.3d at p. 127.) If the defendant does not properly establish a relevant fact concerning nonliability, neither the trial court nor this court may supply it by assumption. For example, the accident may in reality have taken place on a public highway, thereby perhaps absolving petitioners from liability.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although the parties may know the fact to be empirically true, and although real parties may not intend to dispute it at trial, petitioners did not clearly establish it by admissible evidence. To grant summary judgment nevertheless would reduce the legislative scheme set out in section 437c to irrelevance. It would also deny both sides an aspect of procedural due process in the application of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">To summarize, on the basis of the sparse undisputed facts presented by petitioners in support of their motion, we cannot say with certainty and as a matter of law that the undisputed facts compel a conclusion petitioners, or one or more of them, cannot in any manner be held responsible under the fifth cause of action for Cobb\u2019s injuries. On the other hand, from the allegations of the fifth cause of action, in the context of the few evidentiary facts presented in petitioners\u2019 moving papers, we can logically hypothesize the existence of a number of consistent scenarios under which real parties might be entitled to recover. <em>(Molko </em>v. <em>Holy Spirit Assn., supra, </em>46 Cal.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>p. 1107.) The motion must therefore be denied because the moving parties failed to carry their affirmative burden of proof. <em>(Conn </em>v. <em>National Can Corp., supra, </em>124 Cal.App.3d at p. 640.)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">II<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The petition for writ of mandate is denied.

A defendant\u2019s burden under section 437c is to disprove every claim or theory presented by the complaint, even those deficiently pled. The fact that a demurrer, if brought, may have been sustained does not reduce the defendant\u2019s burden on a motion for summary judgment. <em>(Segura </em>v. <em>Brundage </em>(1979) 91 Cal.App.3d 19, 28 [153 Cal.Rptr. 77].) Even though the trial judge had the option to evaluate the adequacy of the complaint by treating the motion as one for judgment on the pleadings (see <em>Hejmadi </em>v. <em>AMFAC, Inc. </em>(1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 525, 536-537 [249 Cal.Rptr. 5]), he was not asked to do so and did not do so. Accordingly, we assume the technical sufficiency of the first amended complaint for purposes of this proceeding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b443-12\"> For purposes of discussion, we will assume the allegation of the first amended complaint that all petitioners were agents of all the others to be sufficient to impute Moseley\u2019s knowledge, whatever it was,.to G &amp; D and Chevron.

Code, \u00a7 2332.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b444-6\"> The declaration of George Blair, submitted in opposition to the motion and referred to by petitioners at oral argument, nowhere states that the accident occurred on a public highway.
