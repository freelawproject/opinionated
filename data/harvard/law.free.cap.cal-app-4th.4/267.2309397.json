For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">In 1982, Lyon constructed numerous tract homes in seven developments within California. The houses were built according to various standard plans without consideration of whether they qualified for solar energy system tax credits. A few years later, a consultant determined Lyon could qualify for tax credits for some of these houses after reviewing the plans, maps, and selected sites of actual houses in Lyon\u2019s 1982 developments. Based upon his recommendation and calculations, Lyon filed an amended 1982 California income tax return requesting a refund based upon solar energy system tax credits for which it allegedly qualified. Lyon claimed credits of $116,376 for the costs of installing excess south-facing windows, entry floor tile, and kitchen countertop tile in certain of its homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">When the Franchise Tax Board (FTB) denied Lyon\u2019s request, citing the lack of a specific intent to qualify for such tax credits, Lyon sued to obtain the tax credits. Before trial, the court ruled Lyon need not prove it specifically intended to install a solar energy system or to qualify for a solar energy system tax credit at the time it constructed the houses. At trial, it was established that Lyon\u2019s claim was based upon its installing certain south-facing windows and kitchen and entry area tile. Lyon claims the windows are qualifying \u201csolar glazing systems\u201d under regulations adopted by the California Energy Commission, officially known as the Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission (CEC). The tile is alleged to be qualifying \u201cthermal mass\u201d which was installed in conjunction with the solar glazing systems and entitled for credits under the regulations. The parties agreed to use Lyon\u2019s Travis Ranch development as a model for qualification of houses in the other developments.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-9\">The testimony of a solar energy expert, Dr. Donald Aitken, showed a substantial portion of the houses for which credits were claimed did not qualify, because their excess windows were not facing south or were impaired by substantial shading. Dr. Aitken also testified he had run computer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>projections as to energy consumption of certain Travis Ranch houses using Micropas, a computer program widely used in the energy conservation field, showing the excess windows in one of the south-facing houses would increase energy costs by $300 annually, because additional air conditioning would be required to make the house livable. Thus, although from $8 to $12 in annual heating costs would be saved by reason of the additional windows, a very substantial increase, rather than decrease, in overall energy costs would result from Lyon\u2019s alleged passive thermal system, because the excess south-facing windows created unnecessary heating and resulted in \u201ccatastrophic overheating\u201d and uncomfortable conditions in the living areas of the house. He said 40 to 50 square feet per 1,000 square feet of living area is the maximum amount of south-facing glass to keep the house comfortable. Since for certain houses Lyon was claiming several hundred square feet of glass for tax credits, Dr. Aitken concluded the houses were not livable as designed. It was Dr. Aitken\u2019s opinion the excess windows did not constitute a \u201csolar glazing system\u201d and the solar energy transmitted \u201ccannot be used for heating.\u201d Further, Dr. Aitken stated his opinion structure of the houses do not \u201cin any way function as a passive thermal system.\u201d Dr. Aitken\u2019s testimony was largely undisputed by Lyon.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">As to the tile in the entry area and kitchen area, Dr. Aitken stated the tile could not qualify as thermal mass, because it was inferior to concrete or masonry in heat storage capacity. This testimony was contradicted by Sam Rashkin, an energy specialist for the CEC, who stated the CEC had allowed ceramic tile in entry ways and on kitchen countertops to be eligible for credits as thermal mass in other situations. However, Dr. Aitken also stated the entry tile would not qualify as thermal mass, because it was too remote from the solar energy.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">The primary witness testifying on behalf of Lyon was David Hauk. Hauk\u2019s testimony almost entirely dealt with verification of his calculations in support of Lyon\u2019s claims for tax credits and orientation of the houses. Hauk did not testify as to the effective functioning of the alleged solar energy systems in providing heat for the houses.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">The trial court made a number of evidentiary and legal findings in upholding the FTB\u2019s denial of tax credits. First, the court found the applicable statutes and regulations do not require any performance standard to be met in order to qualify for a tax credit (i.e., the taxpayer need not show any particular level of performance by a solar energy system). Second, the court found there was insufficient evidence to show a passive thermal system existed under the statutes and regulations, because there was no showing of any collection, storage or distribution of solar energy. Further, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>found there was insufficient evidence to show the structural elements of the houses were used to \u201ceither collect, store or distribute solar energy.\u201d Essentially, the court found there \u201cmust be some showing that the system worked in such a way to collect, store or distribute solar energy for purposes of heating or cooling the structure.\u201d The trial court went on to make additional findings which it acknowledged were moot based on its holding, but would be helpful in the event its holdings were reversed on appeal. Specifically, the court also found the windows constituted solar devices, and, if a qualifying solar energy system were found to exist, only 78 percent of the houses qualified by virtue of their positioning and shading characteristics, and the excess windows in such houses would then qualify for tax credits as solar glazing. Further, the court found the tile in the entry areas and kitchen areas was in fact masonry, but only the kitchen countertop tile could qualify for credits because of proximity to direct sunlight. There was insufficient evidence to show the entry tile acted in conjunction with a system. However, since the court found no qualifying passive thermal system to exist based on the evidence, it held Lyon was not entitled to any tax credits for the costs of excess windows or tile in the entry and kitchen areas, and entered judgment for the FTB.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">\n<em>Statute and Regulations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">In 1976, the Legislature enacted certain statutes to encourage energy conservation and the use of alternative energy sources, and, in particular, section 23601 of the Revenue and Taxation Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was passed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As applicable in 1982, section 23601 provided in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">\u201c(a)(1) There shall be allowed as a credit against the taxes imposed by this part....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">\u201c(2) ... 55 percent of the cost (including installation charges . . . ) incurred by the taxpayer for any solar energy system installed [not to] exceed three thousand dollars ($3,000) per solar energy system ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-9\">\u201c(d) The Energy Resources Conservation and Development Commission shall, after one or more public hearings, establish guidelines and criteria for solar energy systems which shall be eligible for the credit....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>\u201c(f) The following definitions govern construction of this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">\u201c(1) \u2018Installed\u2019 means placed in position in a functionally operative state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">\u201c(5)(A) \u2018Solar energy system\u2019 means the use of solar devices for the individual function of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-7\">\u201c(ii) Space conditioning;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-8\">\u201cThe term \u2018solar energy system\u2019 shall include, but is not limited to, passive thermal systems, . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-9\">\u201c(6) \u2018Solar device\u2019 means the equipment associated with the collection, transfer, distribution, storage or control of solar energy. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-10\">\u201c(7) \u2018Passive thermal system\u2019 means a system which utilizes the structural elements of the building, and is not augmented by mechanical components, to provide for collection, storage, or distribution of solar energy for heating or cooling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">Thus, under section 23601, a taxpayer could qualify for a tax credit equal to 55 percent of its costs of installing a \u201cpassive thermal system,\u201d as one type of system specifically listed as a \u201csolar energy system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">The CEC adopted regulations pursuant to section 23601\u2019s mandate it \u201cestablish guidelines and criteria for solar energy systems which shall be eligible.\u201d In 1982, the applicable regulations were found in sections 2601 through 2611 of title 20 of the California Code of Regulations (regulations)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (which was then known as the California Administrative Code). The regulations restate the same definitions of \u201csolar energy system\u201d and \u201cpassive thermal system\u201d as contained in section 23601. In addition, former section 2602, subdivision (c) of the regulations defines \u201cglazing\u201d as a \u201ctransparent or translucent material used to transmit solar energy and to reduce the loss of thermal energy from the structure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b227-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Most importantly, however, the regulations set forth further standards for qualification as an eligible \u201cpassive thermal system.\u201d Former section 2604, subdivision (b) of the regulations stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-4\">\u201cPassive Thermal Systems. Eligible passive thermal systems utilize the structure of a building and its operable components (and the climate resources available at the site) to provide heating or cooling during the appropriate times of the year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-5\">\u201c(1) Passive thermal systems which qualify for the tax credit shall include one or more of the following systems when installed . . . :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-6\">\u201c(A) Solar Glazing. Solar glazing systems shall meet the following criteria:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-7\">\u201c1. Glazing shall be clear (shading coefficient of 0.80 or greater per pane). . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-8\">\u201c2. Glazing in walls must face south, plus or minus 45[ degrees] (i.e., between SE and SW) and be fully exposed to direct solar radiation during the heating season.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-9\">\u201c6. For newly constructed residential buildings, the credit shall be given for as much of the solar glazing as is in excess of one-third of all other glazing area.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">The regulations also established guidelines for devices installed in conjunction with passive thermal systems which also qualify for a tax credit. Former section 2604, subdivision (b)(2) of the regulations stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-11\">\u201cDevices in Conjunction With Passive Thermal Systems. The following devices shall be eligible when installed as a part of, or in conjunction with, eligible passive thermal systems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-12\">\u201c(C) Thermal Mass Storage. Thermal mass within the insulated shell of the building . . . shall be eligible when installed in conjunction with a passive thermal system if the following criteria are met:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-13\">\u201c1. The thermal mass must lie inside the insulated shell of a building if it is part of an exterior wall. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>\u201c2. Eligible mass shall be in the form of water, masonry, rock, concrete walls or ceilings, or other material with equal or better heat storage capacity. Concrete slab floors ... are not eligible. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">To summarize, a \u201csolar energy system\u201d uses solar devices \u201cfor the individual function of . . . [s]pace conditioning.\u201d One type of solar energy system is a \u201cpassive thermal system\u201d which is defined as a \u201csystem\u201d which utilizes structural elements \u201cto provide for collection, storage, or distribution of solar energy for heating or cooling.\u201d Under the regulations, passive thermal systems must \u201cprovide heating or cooling during the appropriate times of the year.\u201d The obvious meaning of this requirement is that a system must provide heating during the winter season. The regulations specifically list \u201csolar glazing systems\u201d as one type of eligible passive thermal system. In addition to the implicit requirement that a solar glazing system provide heating during the winter, the system must also meet certain criteria set forth in the regulations. These additional criteria are that the glazing be clear, the glazing face south and be exposed to direct solar radiation during the winter, and for new houses a tax credit is given only for solar glazing in excess of one-third of other glazing areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">\n<em>Interpretation of Language of Statute and Regulations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">To decide this case, we must first interpret the language of section 23601 and the regulations. Specifically, we must determine what the Legislature meant by the term .\u201csystem\u201d and by the phrases \u201cfor the individual function of . . . [s]pace conditioning\u201d and \u201cto provide heating.\u201d Interpretation of statutes and regulations is a question of law to be decided by this court. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 310, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Established rules of statutory interpretation require us to ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law. <em>(Westfall </em>v. <em>Swoap </em>(1976) 58 Cal.App.3d 109, 114 [129 Cal.Rptr. 750].) While we should normally give words their usual and ordinary meaning, we also need to construe them in context with the \u201cnature and obvious purpose of the statute.\u201d <em>(Johnstone </em>v. <em>Richardson </em>(1951) 103 Cal.App.2d 41, 46 [229 P.2d 9].) Further, a particular clause or section should be interpreted in the context of the statutory language and intent as a whole. <em>(Moyer </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d 222, 230 [110 Cal.Rptr. 144, 514 P.2d 1224].) Legislative intent must prevail even if the literal meaning of the words is in contradiction with such intent. <em>(Friends of Mammoth </em>v. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>(1972) 8 Cal.3d 247, 259 [104 Cal.Rptr. 761, 502 P.2d 1049]; <em>Dickey </em>v. <em>Raisin Proration Zone No. 1 </em>(1944) 24 Cal.2d 796, 802 [151 P.2d 505, 157 A.L.R. 324].) To this same effect, the Supreme Court in <em>In re Haines </em>(1925) 195 Cal. 605, 613 [234 P. 883], stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>\u201c \u2018The mere literal construction of a section in a statute ought not to prevail if it is opposed to the intention of the legislature apparent by the statute; and if the words are sufficiently flexible to admit of some other construction it is to be adopted to effectuate that intention. The intent prevails over the letter, and the letter will, if possible, be so read as to conform to the spirit of the act. [Citations.]\u2019 \u201d (Fn. omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">We find the following statement in <em>Bruce </em>v. <em>Gregory </em>(1967) 65 Cal.2d 666, 673 [56 Cal.Rptr. 265, 423 P.2d 193], to be particularly relevant in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-5\">\u201cIt is a settled principle of statutory interpretation that language of a statute should not be given a literal meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences which the Legislature did not intend. [Citations.] \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Statutory provisions for tax credits must be narrowly construed. As the California Supreme Court has stated, a provision allowing a tax credit \u201cmust be strictly construed against the taxpayer . . . .\u201d <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>McColgan </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 432, 442 [110 P.2d 419, 134 A.L.R. 1424].)  Accordingly, the provisions of section 23601 and the regulations for solar energy system tax credits must be narrowly construed against Lyon.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">It is common knowledge that California, along with most other states and countries, experienced a severe petroleum energy crisis during the 1970\u2019s resulting in federal and state governments taking various actions to lessen the effects of the energy crisis. One such measure was the enactment of laws that encouraged people to install energy saving devices or systems, such as solar energy systems, for the purpose of reducing the use of petroleum energy. Although there appears to be no official pronouncement, the obvious legislative intent in enacting section 23601 in 1976 was to encourage persons to reduce their consumption of petroleum energy by installing solar energy systems.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is with this legislative intent in mind we interpret the provisions of section 23601 and the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">In this case, there are three requirements of the statute and regulations that are open to interpretation in light of either ambiguity or conflict with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>legislative intent. First, there is a consistent requirement in the statute and regulations that a \u201csystem\u201d be installed, as opposed to merely a \u201cdevice.\u201d Since the statute and regulations do not define this term, we look to the common meaning of \u201csystem.\u201d One authority defines a \u201csystem\u201d as \u201ca complex unity formed of many often diverse parts subject to a common plan or serving a common purpose\u201d or \u201ca group of devices . . . forming a network. . . for a common purpose.\u201d (Webster\u2019s New Intemat. Dict. (3d ed. 1966) p. 2322.) Thus, it is implicit the term \u201csystem\u201d in section 23601 and the regulations refers to a mechanism in which multiple parts work together to provide solar energy according to the provisions of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">Second, in this case \u201csolar energy system\u201d means the use of solar devices for the \u201cfunction of. . . [sjpace conditioning.\u201d The phrase \u201cspace conditioning\u201d is not defined. However, in light of the legislative intent discussed above, we interpret \u201cspace conditioning\u201d to mean the heating or cooling of living space to provide a comfortable environment for the persons using the space.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Third, a \u201cpassive thermal system,\u201d including a solar glazing system, must utilize the structure of the building \u201cto provide heating or cooling during the appropriate times of the year.\u201d In this case, it is heating during the winter season that is applicable. In light of the legislative intent to encourage the installation of energy saving devices and the rule of narrow construction of tax credit provisions, we conclude the phrase \u201cto provide heating\u201d requires the passive thermal system to provide heating that is useful in maintaining a comfortable temperature within the living space.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Therefore, unless Lyon proved at trial it installed devices that function together for the common purpose of providing heating during the winter season in order to maintain a comfortable temperature within the living space, it will not be entitled to tax credits under section 23601.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">\n<em>Substantial Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">The judgment of the trial court must stand unless there was no substantial evidence presented at trial which would support its judgment holding Lyon was not entitled to the tax credits under section 23601.  As one court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>recently stated, the substantial evidence standard of review means that a reviewing court \u201cmust consider all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, giving it the benefit of every reasonable inference, and resolving conflicts in support of the judgment.\u201d <em>(Grappo </em>v. <em>Coventry Financial Corp. </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 496, 506-507 [286 Cal.Rptr. 714].) Accordingly, we must look only at the evidence supporting the judgment and disregard evidence to the contrary. <em>(Campbell </em>v. <em>Southern Pacific Co. </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 51, 60 [148 Cal.Rptr. 596, 583 P.2d 121].)</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">Our review of the trial record supports the findings of the trial court that there was insufficient evidence presented by Lyon to show the solar glazing system worked to collect, store or distribute solar energy for purposes of heating the structure. The record reflects the testimony of Dr. Aitken, an expert in solar energy, to the effect that the alleged systems installed by Lyon would not provide any useful heating in terms of a comfortable environment as drastic overheating would result, but also that the alleged systems would substantially increase overall energy costs due to increased air conditioning which would be required due to the overheating situation. Further, the declaration of Rashkin supported the conclusion that Lyon had not installed passive solar energy systems in the houses. The testimony of Hauk was merely to describe the location and orientation of the houses and the glass and tile in the houses. He did not, nor did any other witness, testify as to the effective functioning of the solar glazing in the houses in order to maintain a comfortable living space or to save energy costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The burden of proof at trial was upon Lyon to establish its entitlement to tax credits under section 23601, and the court found there was insufficient evidence in the record to establish a right to tax credits. Our review of the trial court record indicates there was substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s judgment. Lyon failed to prove it installed solar energy systems or passive thermal systems eligible for tax credits under section 23601. Since Lyon did not prove the installation of passive thermal systems, it logically follows that no thermal mass (i.e., the tile in the entry areas and kitchen areas) could possibly be installed \u201cin conjunction with\u201d passive thermal systems. Accordingly, we hold Lyon is not entitled to tax credits under section 23601 for any of its windows or tile installed in houses during 1982.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Kremer P.
