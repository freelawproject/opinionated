J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ai2\">An amended information charged defendant David Bruce Lloyd with second degree burglary (Pen. Code, \u00a7 459),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> automobile theft (Veh. Code, \u00a7 10851), and receiving stolen property (\u00a7 496, subd. (1)). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>The jury found Lloyd guilty of the burglary and stolen property charges, but found him not guilty of auto theft. The court subsequently found true two alleged prison priors within the meaning of section 667.5, subdivision (b). The court sentenced Lloyd to prison for five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Lloyd appeals and petitions for writ of habeas corpus.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment and deny the habeas corpus petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">On March 29, 1990, at approximately 4 a.m., San Diego Police Officer Daniel Massie and his partner responded to a silent burglar alarm at the Treasure Trove, an antiques store on University Avenue. Massie saw a black Toyota pickup parked at the rear of the building. Massie also saw Lloyd standing on the sidewalk at the corner of the building about 10 yards from the truck. Lloyd looked at the officer, turned around, and began walking away. When the officer asked him to stop, Lloyd complied. Lloyd identified himself with a false name. Lloyd said he worked the graveyard shift as a welder and was coming from work. He said he worked on University Avenue, but did not know the address.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">During the conversation, the officers heard noises coming from inside the store. Officer Scott Morrison, another police officer who had arrived at the scene, placed Lloyd in the back of a patrol vehicle, and locked the doors. With the assistance of a police dog, the officers apprehended a suspect, later identified as Donald Prevatt, inside the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">While still at the scene, the officers discovered the pickup truck had been reported stolen about a week earlier. They found several types of shoeprints near the truck. San Diego Police Officer William Farmer testified, based on his training and experience as a field evidence technician, it was his opinion one of the types of shoeprints belonged to Lloyd. Farmer based his opinion on his on-site matching the shoeprint with shoes Lloyd was wearing at the time of the burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">After Lloyd had been taken out of the police car, officers searched the backseat. They found a foreign car key beneath the backseat where Lloyd had been sitting.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After arresting Lloyd, the officers obtained a waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. During questioning, Lloyd denied knowing Prevatt or anything about the burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>Christine Prevatt, Donald Prevatt\u2019s grandmother, testified he lived with her at the time of the burglary. Lloyd visited with Donald \u201ca couple of times\u201d before the break-in at the Treasure Trove. She further testified that several hours before the burglary, Lloyd came to her house around 9 p.m. and spoke to her grandson for a few minutes. Shortly thereafter, they left together.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Marsden/Faretta Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">Lloyd contends the court\u2019s failure to conduct Marsden<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and <em>Faretta</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>hearings in response to a pretrial letter written to the superior court constitutes reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">The court appointed assistant public defender Albert Bradley to represent Lloyd. About one month before the scheduled date for his trial, Lloyd wrote a letter to the superior court addressed to \u201cYour Honor,\u201d stating in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">\u201cI, David B. Lloyd. BK #90-126610, do wish to have my \u2018Lawyer,\u2019 one, Mr. A. Bradley (Public Defenders) relieved from my case. [\u00b6] It is not merely just a few points of \u2018difference\u2019... I strongly feel Mr. Bradley has not the time nor the interest. [\u00b6] At \u2018discovery\u2019, . . . Mr. Bradley could not even find time to attend in his clients behalf, his client being myself. He has yet to make known that my so called \u2018co-defendant\u2019, Mr. Donald Prevatt has filed a document . . . stating . . . that I, David Lloyd, had no prior knowledge nor involvement in this crime . ... [\u00b6] [Bradley] . . . has not filed for a \u2018fast and speedy trial\u2019, as requested, He did not file a motion . . . for dismissal of charges do [sic] to the \u2018anemic\u2019 condition of the prosecutors circumstantial case against <em>m&amp; ... I am asking for the courts to either entertain the thought of granting me the right to defend myself\u2014pro per\u2014or, as I\u2019ve asked, dismiss Mr. Bradley from this case so I may acquire a Lawyer who can and may provide an adequate defense. . . </em>,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Italics added.) The letter bears a superior court file stamp date of May 23, 1990. The Attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>General acknowledges the court did not conduct a hearing in response to this letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">About a month later, on the second day of trial and outside the presence of the jury, defense counsel informed the court he had received a letter from Lloyd asking, among other things, that counsel subpoena certain witnesses. Counsel then stated to the court: \u201cI take it from these papers that Mr. Lloyd has some problems with my representation of him, and would like the court to hear him out on that.\u201d The following colloquy then took place between the court and Lloyd:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\">\u201cThe Court: All right. Mr. Lloyd?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">\u201cThe Defendant: I have some questions and they have to be answered. The articles in the back of the truck are in the picture. Those articles aren\u2019t listed any evidence here. There is no report on them articles, and I think it might be pertinent to this case because none of them belong to me. The truck didn\u2019t belong to me and, I think, the officers by returning the truck to the owner with the articles in the back, he stated clearly yesterday that nothing in the back of the truck was his. Whose are they? I think that it\u2019s important. I think it should be found out. [ft] All evidence at the crime scene should have been gone over and logged or tagged, not just what might have been apparent or what they assumed was apparent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\">\u201cThe Court: It sounds like your concerns at this point don\u2019t really pertain to counsel as much as to the way the evidence is being presented, and one of the factors that you have to recognize is that evidence only comes in one witness at a time. I presume there may be some police officers that will be called in this case. But those police officers will probably address seeing the truck and describing its condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-8\">\u201cYour attorney will have an opportunity, if he feels that it\u2019s a matter that is of concern to the defense and will assist them in the defense, to ask the officer what became of the items, if that is a matter that is of concern to you and of counsel. You can\u2019t expect the first two witnesses to cover virtually everything that is here. There are many items of evidence yet to be introduced, and I assume that we can communicate your concerns to counsel and then counsel can decide what is in the best interests of you in terms of how to best present your case and how to challenge any evidence that is being offered by the prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>\u201cIs there anything further?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">\u201cThe Defendant: Nothing further.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">\u201cWhen a defendant seeks to discharge his appointed counsel and substitute another attorney, and asserts inadequate representation, the trial court must permit the defendant to explain the basis of his contention and to relate specific instances of the attorney\u2019s inadequate performance.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Crandell </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 833, 854 [251 Cal.Rptr. 227, 760 P.2d 423]; see <em>Marsden, supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at p. 123.) Likewise, once a defendant timely asserts his constitutional right to represent himself, a court must allow the defendant to proceed with his own defense, provided the court is satisfied the defendant made a knowing and intelligent election. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Burton </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 843, 852 [258 Cal.Rptr. 184, 771 P.2d 1270]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Windham </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 121, 127-128 [137 Cal.Rptr. 8, 560 P.2d 1187]; see <em>Faretta, supra, </em>422 U.S. 806.)</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Lloyd\u2019s May 23d letter unequivocally stated Lloyd\u2019s dissatisfaction with his counsel and his desire to represent himself if the court would not appoint a new counsel. Thus, the court should have conducted a hearing to determine whether Lloyd was entitled to new counsel, and if not, whether his self-representation request was timely and made knowingly and intelligently.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">The Attorney General maintains Lloyd was not entitled to a hearing because the trial judge may have been \u201cpersonally\u201d unaware of the letter.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Such circumstances, however, do not justify the court\u2019s failure to conduct the requisite hearing. The letter, bearing a superior court clerk\u2019s office file stamp, clearly identified Lloyd, his codefendant, and Lloyd\u2019s appointed counsel. In such context, the fact that a particular judge may not have been aware of the letter does not excuse the court from providing Lloyd with his constitutionally mandated hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">We conclude, however, the effect of the administrative error was resolved when Lloyd failed to renew his earlier motion at the hearing conducted on the second day of trial. At that time Lloyd essentially reasserted his <em>Marsden </em>motion, but the reasons for the motion were not that he wanted to substitute his counsel; rather, he stated only he had problems with the way counsel planned to present the evidence. At the hearing, the court provided Lloyd full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>opportunity to voice any complaints he had about his attorney. There was nothing in Lloyd\u2019s response indicating he was dissatisfied with counsel\u2019s representation, other than the way the evidence was being presented. Lloyd appears to have been satisfied with the trial court\u2019s explanation of the evidentiary process and his right to express his concerns with his attorney at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Thus, the court\u2019s error in failing to consider Lloyd\u2019s first <em>Marsden </em>motion became harmless when Lloyd failed to reassert the reasons underlying the motion at the later hearing. For the same reason, Lloyd waived his earlier request for self-representation, which had been asserted as an <em>alternative </em>to substitution of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">- Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Lloyd contends he was denied the effective assistance of counsel both before and during his trial. To successfully make this argument Lloyd has the burden of showing \u201c(1) counsel\u2019s representation was deficient, i.e., it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms; and (2) counsel\u2019s deficient representation subjected the defense to prejudice, i.e., there is a reasonable probability that but for counsel\u2019s failings the result would have been more favorable. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Babbitt </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 660, 707 [248 Cal.Rptr. 69, 755 P.2d 253].)</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">\n<em>Suppression Motion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">Initially Lloyd says his counsel was ineffective because he failed to bring a suppression motion. He explains the preliminary hearing testimony by police officers Massie and Morrison established the officers first considered him as a possible witness, not a suspect, and therefore his detention inside the police vehicle was illegal. He emphasizes Morrison\u2019s testimony, \u201cI did not pat him down or anything when I arrived at the scene. [Lloyd] was being detained as a possible witness to the crime that occurred.\u201d Lloyd says such testimony should \u201chave put any reasonable and prudent defense counsel on notice of a potential basis for moving to suppress substantially all evidence connecting appellant to the burglary . . . and the . . . stolen truck.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">Lloyd asserts he would have prevailed on a suppression motion because under California law a detention is rendered unlawful if the officer, such as Officer Morrison here, did not subjectively entertain a suspicion that the detainee was involved in criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>Pre-Proposition 8 California decisions hold the lack of such <em>subjective </em>suspicion may render a detention unlawful, requiring the suppression of evidence flowing from the detention. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Bower </em>(1979) 24 Cal.3d 638, 647 [156 Cal.Rptr. 856, 597 P.2d 115]; <em>In re Tony C. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 888, 893 [148 Cal.Rptr. 366, 582 P.2d 957].) Now, however, the analysis of such evidentiary issues must be conducted under federal law. <em>(In re Lance W. </em>(1985) 37 Cal.3d 873, 896 [210 Cal.Rptr. 631, 694 P.2d 744]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gonzales </em>(1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 1185, 1190 [265 Cal.Rptr. 507]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Le </em>(1985) 169 Cal.App.3d 186, 193-195 [215 Cal.Rptr. 106].) Under federal law, a subjective suspicion is not required. The reasonable suspicion necessary to justify a detention is measured <em>solely </em>by an objective standard. (See <em>Scott </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1978) 436 U.S. 128, 138 [56 L.Ed.2d 168, 178, 98 S.Ct. 1717]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Le, supra </em>169 Cal.App.3d at p. 193; see also <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Macon </em>(1985) 472 U.S. 463, 470-471 [86 L.Ed.2d 370, 378, 105 S.Ct. 2778]; 3 LeFave, Search and Seizure (2d ed. 1987) \u00a7 9.3(a) at p. 425 [\u201c[the] test [for a temporary seizure] ... is <em>purely </em>objective and thus there is no requirement that an actual suspicion by the officer be shown\u201d].) \u201cWhether a Fourth Amendment violation has occurred \u2018turns on an objective assessment of the officer\u2019s actions in light of the facts and circumstances confronting him at the time,\u2019. . . and not on the officer\u2019s actual state of mind at the time the challenged action was taken.\u201d <em>(Maryland, supra, </em>472 U.S. at pp. 470-471 [86 L.Ed.2d at p. 378], quoting <em>Scott </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>436 U.S. 128, 136 [56 L.Ed.2d 168,177].)  Thus, following the enactment of Proposition 8 and pursuant to <em>Lance W., </em>the prosecution no longer has the burden of showing a police officer <em>actually </em>suspected the individual detained was involved in criminal activity.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Rather, the focus is on whether the officer\u2019s conduct was objectively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">Here, it was objectively reasonable for the officers to suspect Lloyd was involved in the burglary. The officers found Lloyd standing alone at 4 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>a.m. next to a business in which a silent alarm had just been triggered. When he saw the officers, Lloyd began walking away. On these facts, the officers acted reasonably under the circumstances in stopping and detaining Lloyd as a possible burglary suspect. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Dolliver </em>(1986) 181 Cal.App.3d 49, 56 [225 Cal.Rptr. 920].) Once it was discovered that someone was still inside the business, it was reasonable for the police to temporarily<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> detain Lloyd in the car until they could stabilize the situation to further question Lloyd about his possible involvement in the criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">We therefore conclude Lloyd was not prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failure to bring a suppression motion and accordingly reject his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Howard </em>(1987) 190 Cal.App.3d 41, 48-49 [235 Cal.Rptr. 223].)</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">\n<em>Trial Counsel\u2019s Failure to Challenge a Juror</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\"> Lloyd argues his counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge Juror Delane Veaner for cause, under section 1089,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> or to challenge her peremptorily.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Included in Lloyd\u2019s charged offenses was automobile theft. During voir dire, prospective Juror Veaner said her car had been stolen approximately two weeks earlier and it had not yet been recovered. Thereafter, the court questioned Veaner regarding whether she could be a fair and impartial juror despite her personal experience. Veaner indicated she could \u201ctry to be fair,\u201d but \u201cI can\u2019t say that, you know, it\u2019s not totally out of my mind that my car is still missing. Auto theft, that is a fact.\u201d The court later asked \u201cdo you have some question because this incident of the car theft is so recent in your mind, some of that might possibly spill over to the defendant\u2019s disadvantage? Veaner responded: \u201cYou know, that\u2019s possible.\u201d After the court inquired whether counsel had any questions, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: I have had cars stolen and that doesn\u2019t disqualify me from being a lawyer for Mr. Lloyd. Just the fact that you have had a car stolen doesn\u2019t disqualify you from being a juror and being fair in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-9\">\u201cWhat the court is asking to you to do is simply be cognizant, be aware of the fact that you have a possible prejudice and be able to deal with that and still be fair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>\u201cDo you think you could do that? \u201cMrs. Veaner: Yeah, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">\u201c[Prosecutor]: Mrs. Veaner, there won\u2019t be any evidence, to my knowledge, about your car in this case. That is kind of bottom line here. Knowing that, do you feel you can sit as a fair and impartial juror of the facts in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">\u201c[Mrs. Veaner]: Right. I do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Veaner\u2019s final responses to defense counsel and the prosecutor made clear she could be a fair and impartial juror and belie Lloyd\u2019s assertion she was unable to perform her duty within the meaning of section 1089. Significantly, <em>defense counsel </em>made the effort to rehabilitate Veaner and to make clear in Veaner\u2019s own mind that she could be a fair and impartial juror. Such conduct shows defense counsel had some reasonable justification for wanting to keep Veaner on the jury, despite the recent theft of her car. Absent any evidence to the contrary, Lloyd failed to establish his counsel\u2019s representation was deficient by failing to challenge Juror Veaner. Moreover, Lloyd did not assert any additional facts in his writ petition to rebut the inference in the record that defense counsel had reasonable justification for retaining Veaner on the jury panel. Lloyd has therefore failed to establish a prima facie case for writ relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">\n<em>Counsel\u2019s Failure to Interview Christina Prevatt</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">Lloyd contends his lawyer was also ineffective by failing to interview prosecution witness Christina Prevatt.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Prevatt testified that about seven hours before the burglary her grandson and Lloyd left her house together. Lloyd says he was prejudiced because \u201c[p]retrial verification of Mrs. Prevatt\u2019s statement to police would have enabled [trial counsel] to effectively counsel me regarding the strength of the prosecution\u2019s case and the wisdom to proceed to trial or to settle the case by plea bargain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">Aside from this statement Lloyd makes no further showing he was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failure to interview Prevatt. Lloyd does not support his writ petition with any <em>facts </em>showing the prosecution ever offered a pretrial plea bargain. But even if we were to assume the prosecution made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>such an offer, Lloyd fails to state the specifics of any such offer, that counsel failed to communicate the offer to him, or he would have accepted a particular plea bargain in light of Mrs. Prevatt\u2019s damaging testimony. Finally, he makes no showing that absent the interview he was unaware of Prevatt\u2019s proposed testimony, including that she could identify him as the person who was with her grandson hours before the incident. Lloyd has failed to establish a prima facie case for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Judgment affirmed. Writ denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Todd, J., and Nares, 1, concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied June 10, 1992.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b619-11\"> All statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b620-10\">In his writ petition, Lloyd asserts the same contentions as those advanced in his appeal. We therefore consolidated the petition with the appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b620-11\">At trial, the prosecution referred to this incident as evidence of Lloyd\u2019s knowledge of his guilt. Since the ignition had been tampered with and the owner\u2019s key had not been stolen, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>prosecutor did not argue this particular key was the one used to drive the stolen pickup, since any key could have been used for this purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b621-13\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Marsden </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 118 [84 Cal.Rptr. 156, 465 P.2d 44],</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b621-14\"><em>Faretta </em>v. <em>California </em>(1975) 422 U.S. 806 [45 L.Ed.2d 562, 95 S.Ct. 2525],</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b621-15\">The letter concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APu\">\u201cYour honor, [\u00b6] for a lawyer to do less than his or her u[t]most is, truly, a betrayal to his or her profession as well as to his or her client.

Despite this, the court set forth the controlling test in terms of both objective and subjective standards: \u201c \u2018[I]n order to justify an investigative stop or detention the circumstances known or apparent to the officer must include specific articulable facts causing him to suspect that (1) some activity relating to crime has taken place or is occurring or about to occur, and (2) the person he intends to stop or detain is involved in that activity.
