Code, \u00a7 10851) and four counts of residential burglary (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 459, 460). The court sentenced him to prison for twelve years as follows: the upper term of six years for one of the residential burglaries as the principal term, plus consecutive subordinate terms of sixteen months for each of the other three residential burglaries (one-third the midterm), and consecutive mid-terms of one year each for the two vehicle thefts. On appeal, Canto contends the court erred in imposing subordinate terms in violation of the five-year limit of Penal Code section 1170.1, subdivision (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\">Section 1170.1, subdivision (a) imposes a five-year limit on the total consecutive subordinate terms for offenses that are not \u201cviolent felonies\u201d under section 667.5, subdivision (c). Because none of Canto\u2019s convictions was for a violent felony, section 1170.1, subdivision (a) would ordinarily apply to limit the total consecutive subordinate terms to five years. However, the Legislature has determined that certain subordinate terms are to be excluded from the five-year limitation. As is applicable here, section 1170.95, subdivision (a) increases the five-year limitation for consecutive subordinate terms to ten years \u201cfor consecutive offenses which are all residential burglaries . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\">Canto received a total of six years in consecutive subordinate terms.  He contends under section 1170.1, subdivision (a) the court could not impose subordinate terms exceeding the five-year limit. He further contends the exception provided in section 1170.95, subdivision (a) for residential burglaries does not apply where consecutive terms are imposed for offenses other than residential burglaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-6\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 187, 190 [212 Cal.Rptr. 121], the defendant raised the identical issue, arguing section 1170.95, subdivision (a) did not apply because 11 of his 14 convictions were not for residential burglaries. The court disagreed, however, and after a thorough analysis of the legislative history of section 1170.95, concluded the defendant\u2019s interpretation of that section was \u201cinconsistent with the Legislature\u2019s expressed goal of punishing criminals for each residential burglary committed to the maximum extent possible in the face of limited state prison resources. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>166 Cal.App.3d at p. 194.) The court reasoned that \u201c[a]n absurd result would occur if. . . section 1170.95 were to be construed as increasing subordinate terms . . . <em>only </em>when a defendant is convicted of multiple offenses which are <em>all </em>residential burglaries. Under such a construction, [defendant] and persons similarly situated would continue to be \u2018immune\u2019 from appropriate punishment for their multiple acts of residential burglary merely because they were also charged with, and convicted of, committing other crimes, a result expressly considered and rejected by the Legislature as a \u2018loophole in the law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-7\">Although Canto disagrees with the <em>Jackson </em>court\u2019s interpretation of section 1170.95, subdivision (a), we do not. A logical reading of that provision requires the increased limits on subordinate terms to apply to all convictions for residential burglaries, regardless of whether a defendant is convicted of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>other offenses to which the five-year limit of section 1170.1 applies. As stated by the court in <em>Jackson, </em>the enactment of section 1170.95, subdivision (a) represents a policy determination that residential burglaries pose a unique threat to society warranting a substantial increase in the otherwise existing limitations on consecutive sentencing. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>166 Cal.App.3d at p. 193; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Navarro </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1144, 1151 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 245.].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-5\">Here, Canto\u2019s consecutive subordinate sentence consisted of three 16-month terms (four years) on each of the residential burglaries other than the principal burglary count. The consecutive total for the nonburglary counts was two years. Although the total of the consecutive subordinate terms was six years, the court properly sentenced Canto in accord with the legislative intent to punish those who commit multiple residential burglaries as mandated by section 1170.95, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-8\">Work, Acting R J., and Nares, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-9\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied June 24, 1992.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1067-11\"> In light of Canto\u2019s guilty plea and the single, narrow sentencing issue presented on appeal, we need not recite a statement of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-12\">All subsequent statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
