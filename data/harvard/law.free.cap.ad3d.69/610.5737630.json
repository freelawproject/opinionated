Without answering, the appellant filed a bankruptcy petition on August 13, 2008, which had the effect of staying the instant action <em>(see </em>11 USC \u00a7 362 [a] [1]). While the stay was pending, the plaintiff moved for, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>obtained, an order entered November 8, 2008, directing the entry of a judgment on default. The appellant\u2019s bankruptcy proceeding was dismissed by order dated December 10, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">The Supreme Court erred in denying that branch of the defendants\u2019 motion which was to vacate so much of the order entered November 8, 2008, as directed the entry of judgment against the appellant. The order, insofar as it pertained to the appellant, issued when a stay was in effect during the appellant\u2019s bankruptcy proceeding, was not merely voidable, but void <em>(see Rexnord Holdings, Inc. v Bidermann, </em>21 F3d 522 [1994]; <em>In re Best Payphones, Inc., 279 </em>BR 92, 97-98 [SD NY 2002]; <em>Carr v McGriff, </em>8 AD3d 420, 423 [2004]). Since the order insofar as it pertained to the appellant was void, the appellant did not have to establish an excusable default or a meritorious defense for its vacatur. In the absence of a further motion by the plaintiff for a default judgment outside the scope of the bankruptcy stay, the Supreme Court\u2019s denial of that branch of the defendants\u2019 motion which was to vacate so much of the order as directed the entry of judgment against the appellant amounted to, in effect, an improper ratification of that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The plaintiffs remaining contentions either are without merit or have been rendered academic. Dillon, J.E, Miller, Eng, Hall and Sgroi, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
