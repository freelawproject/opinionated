This was an action to recover damages for an injury alleged to have been sustained by the female plaintiff while a passenger on the defendant\u2019s train. The evidence and the first three prayers of the plaintiffs, which were granted,-are set forth in the opinion of the Court. At the trial the defendant offered the following prayers:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b428-14\"><em>ist Prayer. </em>\u2014 If the jury shall find that the drag-rope used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>in shifting the cars of the defendant at Pope\u2019s Creek had been broken or cut in shifting the cars on the afternoon or evening of May ioth, 1893, and that therefore there was no drag-rope on the train on May nth, 1893, the day on which the injuries complained of are said to have occurred, a drag-rope not being obtained until the morning of May 12th, 1893 ; then the jury shall further find that there was no negligence on the part of defendant\u2019s servants or agents-in charge of the train in the switching off of the passenger coaches at Cox Station on the arrival of the train on the afternoon or evening of May nth, 1893, and in their proceeding to Pope\u2019s Creek with the engine and baggage car alone ; and the verdict of the jury must therefore be for the defendant, unless the jury further find there was some negligent act or conduct on part of defendant\u2019s agents or servants, towards the plaintiff, Elizabeth Swann, on said trip from Cox Station to Pope\u2019s Creek, or some accident to the said baggage car or train from the negligence of defendant\u2019s agents 6r servants, which caused or directly contributed to the injuiy or sickness or pain complained of.

(Rejected.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b431-8\">The Court below (Briscoe, C. J., and Brooke, J.), granted the fourth and fifth prayers of the defendant, and rejected the others. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>$1,000, and from the judgment thereon the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b432-5\">The cause was argued before Robinson, C.

Allison Wilmer </em>and <em>Samnel Cox, Jr., </em>on the brief), for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s second and third prayers involved the question of the burden of proof, and are an attempt to apply to the circumstances of this case the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur, </em>which, it is submitted, is entirely inapplicable; in the first place, there is no room for the invoking of a presumption as to the cause of any injury when there is direct testimony as to the same; in other words, the proof of the fact disables the presumption. <em>Neubeur v. Md. C. R. R. Co., </em>62 Md. 401 ; <em>P. W. &amp; B. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Stebbing, </em>62 Md. 518; <em>Redgrave </em>v. <em>Redgrave, </em>38 Md. 93, 98; <em>Blackburn </em>v. <em>Crawfords, </em>3 Wall. 195; <em>Owings </em>v. <em>Norwood, </em>2 H. &amp; J. 96, 107 ; <em>Colvin </em>v. <em>Warford, 20 </em>Md. 396 ; <em>Beale </em>v. <em>Lynn, </em>6 H. &amp; J. 336, 351; <em>Andrew\u2019s case, </em>39 Md. 329. But, moreover, even were there no direct proof, the injury in this case was not of a kind to raise any such presumption. <em>Flannery </em>v. <em>W. &amp; L. Railway Co., </em>Irish Reps. 11 Common Law, 30; <em>Daniel </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Railway Co., </em>L. R. 5 House of Lords, 45 ; <em>B. &amp; O. R. R. </em>v. <em>State, </em>63 Md. 143 ; <em>Western Md. R. R. </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>61 Md. 266; <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>R. &amp; S. R. R., </em>18 N. Y. 534; <em>Le Barron </em>v. <em>Terry Co., </em>11 Allen, 312; <em>Met. Ry. Co. v. Jackson, </em>L. R. 3 App. 193.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s first prayer is defective, as imposing upon defendant the same degree of care and skill with regard to the convenience provided for the passenger as with regard to the passenger\u2019s carriage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-9\">It is also defective inasmuch as it entirely ignores the testimony with regard to the plaintiff\u2019s voluntary assumption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>of the risk, such as there was. This prayer also, like all the others that go to the question of liability, ignores the true test of a carrier\u2019s duty with regard to the accommodation furnished his passengers, namely, that he is bound to the extent of his profession. <em>Story on </em>Bailments, sec 591; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Rw. Co., </em>4 Ex. 367. And it does not leave it to the jury to say that this was a regularly scheduled passenger train, upon which the defendant had a right to expect regular passenger coaches, as indeed it could not, because there is no evidence thereof in the record.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s fourth prayer is defective, inasmuch as it ignores the assumption of the risk by the plaintiff, as shown in Thompson\u2019s testimony, which is quite a different question from contributory neglig\u00e9nce on her part. This assumption of the risk, it is clear, if the jury believed the fact as testified to by that witness, would relieve the defendant from responsibility. <em>Siner v. G. W. Rw., </em>L. R. 3 Ex. 150; S. <em>C. (on </em>Appeal), L. R. 4 Ex. 117, 124; <em>Del. &amp; L. R. R. </em>v. <em>Napheys, </em>90 Pa. St. 135; <em>Dietrich </em>v. <em>Rw. Co., </em>58 Md. 358.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s fifth prayer is defective, in the first place, because it treats the question of the plaintiff\u2019s attempting to make the journey in a baggage car as a matter of contributory negligence, instead of an assumption of the risk (see authorities cited above); and is further defective in that it instructs the ^ury that this was no bar to recovery, if defendant\u2019s servants in charge of the car could have prevented the injury complained of by the exercise of ordinary care; now, even if it were a contributory negligence case, this doctrine only applies where the defendant\u2019s servants have actually become aware that the plaintiff was in a position of danger, and should be further limited by leaving it to the jury to say that they could have avoided the injury by such means as they-had at hand. But a reference to some of the authorities, in which this doctrine has been applied, will show better than anything else that it has nothing to do with a case such as this at bar, as for instance, <em>Kean </em>v. <em>B. &amp; O. R. R., </em>61 Md. 154; <em>Harvey\u2019s case, </em>69 Md. 339.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>The defendant\u2019s second and third prayers are founded upon the assumption of the risk, and should have been granted, it is submitted, as laying down the true rule applicable to a case of this character. The seventh prayer of the defendant instructs the jury that if the injuries suffered by her were caused by'her own over-exertion and excitement in running or walking on the day'in question, then the verdict must be for the defendant; this is founded on the testimony of Drs. Spencer and Diggs, and it is difficult to say upon what theory it was rejected; because, certainly, if her injuries were caused by something other than the circumstances of her railroad trip, the defendant could not be liable. The defendant\u2019s ninth, eleventh and twelfth prayers simply put to the jury the ordinary doctrine with regard to contributory negligence, and it is submitted should have been granted. ' The defendant\u2019s eighth and tenth prayers, it is submitted, should have been granted in connection with each other, as founded on the principle that the female plaintiff, being familiar with the line of defendant\u2019s road, assumed the risks ordinarily incident to the journey over a line of that character, especially in view of the entire absence of proof that any different' structure of the line was consistent with the nature of the defendant\u2019s undertaking.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b434-5\"><em>John H. Mitchell </em>and <em>Adrian Posey, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b434-6\">Bryan, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AR1\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">William T. Swann and Elizabeth, his wife, brought suit against the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Company for bodily injuries sustained by the wife. Verdict and judgment being rendered in their favor, the defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">The female plaintiff, about midday on the eleventh day of May, 1893, accompanied by her child ten months old, travelled on the mixed train of the defendant, composed of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>passenger coaches and freight cars, from Pope\u2019s Creek to Cox\u2019s Station, intending to return on the evening of the same day. She purchased a ticket at Cox\u2019s Station for the purpose of taking the passenger train which would in ordinary course leave that station about seven o\u2019clock, P. M. The passenger coaches were \u201c switched off\u201d at Cox\u2019s and only a baggage car was run from that station on that evening to Pope\u2019s Creek. She entered that car and was conveyed to Pope\u2019s Creek. The evidence in behalf of the plaintiffs tended to show that the accommodations were very uncomfortable and unsuitable for travellers; and that in consequence of the absence of all conveniences she \u201cwas shaken up and knocked about from side to side, and slammed against the side of the car several times, and that immediately after one of these slams, when she was struck in her right side by the side of the car, she experienced a pain there, which was followed by a pain in her back.\u201d The evidence also tended to show that the woman was pregnant, and that the injuries which she received caused a miscarriage and that she had suffered pains in her back and side almost constantly for six months. The evidence for the defendant tended to show that she was not thrown about or jostled. It was further testified, that the cars could not be shifted at Pope\u2019s Creek without special danger, unless a drag-rope was used; and that the drag-rope used for this purpose had been broken in two on the evening of the tenth, having been before that time weakened by being run over by cars; that the conductor had telegraphed for one on the morning of the ninth, and thereafter, on reaching Baltimore, had applied at the office of the company, but that none was received until the morning of the twelfth. The female plaintiff was a laboring woman, being in the habit of washing, cooking and working in the field. She lived about a mile or a mile and a-half from Pope\u2019s Creek, and at the time of these occurrences she had three children. She went to Cox\u2019s on a visit to the family of Thompson, a section hand on the railroad, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>who lived about half a mile from the station. There was some conflict of evidence in reference to the cause of the alleged miscarriage, the defendant\u2019s testimony supporting the theory that it was more likely to have been caused by the woman\u2019s exertions and the excitement consequent upon them before she entered the cars, and after she left them, than by any injuries received while travelling in them.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">When the female plaintiff purchased a ticket at Cox\u2019s Station, she acquired a contract right to be conveyed to Pope\u2019s Creek, in one of the defendant\u2019s passenger coaches. If we assume that causes beyond the defendant\u2019s control prevented the use of a passenger coach on that occasion, the obligation still remained to carry the passenger safely, so far as it could be done by the exercise of the highest degree of care and skill which was consistent with the nature of the undertaking. If the baggage car was as safe a vehicle of transportation for passengers as the defendant could procure by the utmost care and diligence, it fulfilled its duty in this respect. There is no evidence to sustain such an hypothesis, and probably it is contrary to the usual experience of travellers. And yet, as the defendant substituted it for the passenger coach which it was bound by its contract to furnish, the least which could be demanded of it would be some reasonable effort to make it safe and convenient for a passenger. If the passenger was injured in the defendant\u2019s cars in the course of her journey, and in consequence of some fault or defect in the vehicle of transportation, the defendant is clearly liable for the injury, unless it can show the utmost care and diligence on its part. And we think that these are the proper inquiries for the jury in this case. It cannot be alleged against the passenger as fault or negligence that she took passage in the baggage car. She had a right to be conveyed by the defendant, and she was constrained to travel in this way or not be conveyed at all. Domestic duties of the most pressing kind required that she should return that night to Pope\u2019s Creek. It would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>be unreasonable to hold that, she had made a voluntary choice, whereby she had in this way renounced the right to safety and protection which she had purchased.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The Court granted six prayers in behalf of the plaintiff. Exception was taken to only three of them. They are as follows : ist. If the jury believe from the evidence that the defendant was the owner of the railroad mentioned in the declaration, and sold the plaintiff, Elizabeth, a ticket entitling her to travel on said railroad, and received and accepted her as a passenger to be carried from Cox to Pope\u2019s Creek on the line of said railroad, then defendant was bound to exercise on said trip, for plaintiff\u2019s safety, the highest degree of care and skill which was consistent with the nature of its undertaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">2nd. If the j ury believe from the evidence that the plaintiff, Elizabeth Swann, was injured whilst a passenger on a train of the defendant, the fact of such injury is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of negligence on the part of the defendant, throwing upon it the <em>omis </em>of rebutting the presumption, by showing there was no negligence on its part.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">3rd. That in order to rebut the presumption of negligence on its part, the defendant must show that the injury sustained by said plaintiff while travelling as a passenger on its train ; if the jury find that she was so injured, could not have been prevented by the utmost care and diligence, not only in the running and management of the train, but also in the structure and care of the track, and in all the subsidiary arrangements necessary to the safety of the passengers.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">These prayers are taken almost <em>verbatim </em>from opinions of this Court. <em>Baltimore and Ohio Railroad </em>v. <em>Worthington, </em>21 Maryland, 283 ; <em>Same </em>v. <em>State use of Haner, </em>60 Maryland, 462 ; <em>Hewes and Wife </em>v. <em>Philadelphia, &amp;c., R. R. Co., 76 </em>Maryland, 159. The three prayers of the defendant which seek to excuse the failure to use a passenger car, because of the want of a drag-rope, do not require the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>to find that the defendant made a diligent use of the means at its command for the purpose of enabling it to use the car. The first prayer puts it to the jury to find that the drag-rope was broken on the evening of May the tenth, and that no other was obtained until the morning of May the twelfth; but they are not by the prayer required to find that the defendant made a diligent effort to obtain the rope, or that it made any efforts to supply other means of running the car to Pope\u2019s Creek. And none of these prayers require the jury to find that the baggage car was a safe conveyance for passengers. The sixth and seventh prayers deny the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover, if the miscarriage was caused, in part, by the action of the female plaintiff in making physical exertions and undergoing excitement before she entered the baggage car and after she left it. But even if there could be no recovery for the miscarriage, the pain inflicted and injury sustained in the car would support a verdict, if found by the jury. The same remark will apply to the ninth prayer, which denies a recovery, unless the miscarriage was caused directly and exclusively by injuries sustained on the trip on account of the negligence of the defendant. The eighth prayer makes no reference to the question of the safety of the baggage car as a conveyance for passengers. The tenth prayer institutes a comparison between the injuries complained of, and those to which the female plaintiff would have been liable if seated in a regular passenger coach. It is altogether conjectural what she might have suffered in a regular passenger coach, and such a conjecture cannot be made a basis for the verdict of a jury. The ground of recovery is the absence of the proper degree of care and diligence qn the part of the defendant, provided it is shown to the satisfaction of the jury, and not what might have occurred elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">The eleventh and twelfth prayers present the question of contributory negligence. There is no evidence from which any negligence.on the part of the female plaintiff can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>inferred, except such as tends to show that the miscarriage may have been caused in some measure by the fatigue which she underwent before she reached the cars at Cox\u2019s, and after she left them at Pope\u2019s Creek. We have already stated our views on this question. But we may further say, that the plaintiff\u2019s fourth prayer, granted by the Court, confines the recovery to the injuries sustained by the female plaintiff whilst <em>\u201cmaking said journey.\u201d</em></p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AZD\">(Decided June 18th, 1895.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">All the defendant\u2019s prayers, which we have been considering, were rejected by the Court and we approve of the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
