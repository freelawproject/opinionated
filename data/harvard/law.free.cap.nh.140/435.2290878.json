The fire commission argues that the comments were an exercise of free speech protected by the State and Federal Constitutions and that the PELRB erred in interpreting RSA 273-A:5. We reverse on statutory grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-18\">On May 15, 1991, at a public meeting of the fire commission, a member of the respondent, Portsmouth Firefighters, Local 1313 (the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>union), provided to the press an alcoholic rehabilitation agreement between the Portsmouth Fire Department and a union member. The union\u2019s executive board authorized the release of the agreement to the press in retaliation for the member\u2019s criticism of the union for failing to help him after he was suspended for losing his driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Later that evening, a newspaper reporter contacted Sheila Loch, one of the fire commissioners, at her home and asked her to comment on the release of the agreement. When she asked the reporter for his source of the copy of the agreement, she was told that someone in a firefighter\u2019s uniform had supplied it. The reporter implied that it had come from a union member. Loch responded that what the union had done was reprehensible. In addition, she made negative comments about the union and its leadership. The following day, Loch\u2019s comments appeared in <em>Foster\u2019s Daily Democrat </em>in an article entitled, \u201cCommissioners slam union for releasing part of personnel file.\u201d This article, which is the basis of the union\u2019s unfair labor practice complaint, contained the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\">Commissioner Sheila Loch said she was furious about what happened. \u201cEveryone has the right to expect their privacy respected .... As a human being it concerns me that a person would belong to the kind of group that would do something like that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-8\">\u201cTo me it\u2019s low. It\u2019s below classless.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-9\">Ms. Loch said she believes the union has been led astray by its leadership. \u201cI am not sure they have done themselves a favor in who they have representing them. I question whether they have chosen the best they could.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-10\">She said she believes there are a number of individuals in the union who are able to compromise and view matters with common sense. \u201cI don\u2019t think these people are in the leadership,\u201d adding she believes the union leadership hurt members during recent contract negotiations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">The union filed unfair labor practice charges with the PELRB. The PELRB\u2019s ruling that the fire commission had committed unfair labor practices was reversed on appeal due to an evidentiary error, and the case was remanded to the PELRB. <em>See Appeal of City of Portsmouth, Bd. of Fire Comm\u2019rs, </em>137 N.H. 552, 630 A.2d 769 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-12\">On remand, the PELRB again ruled that the fire commission had committed unfair labor practices in violation of RSA 273-A:5, 1(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>and (b). The PELRB found that Loch\u2019s comments violated the statute when she specifically attacked the union leadership and suggested that leadership hurt members during recent contract negotiations. The board found \u201cno evidence that [Loch\u2019s] criticism was justified,\u201d and it expressed concern about the implications of the comments for future negotiations. Finally, the board found that Loch\u2019s comments, \u201cwhether intended or not,\u201d had \u201ca disruptive effect,\u201d \u201ccreated doubt in the effectiveness and truthfulness of the union leadership,\u201d and created \u201cconfusion and interference with the administration\u201d of the union. The fire commission\u2019s motion for rehearing was denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The findings of the PELRB \u201care deemed <em>prima facie </em>lawful and reasonable.\u201d <em>Appeal of Town of Pelham, </em>124 N.H. 131, 135, 469 A.2d 1295, 1297 (1983). Absent error of law, this court will not overturn a ruling of the PELRB unless we find that it abused its discretion. <em>Appeal ofAFL-CIO Local 298, </em>121 N.H. 944, 947, 437 A.2d 260, 262 (1981). This reflects the standard of review set forth in RSA 541:13 to which we strictly adhere. <em>Appeal of State of N.H., </em>138 N.H. 716, 720, 647 A.2d 1302, 1305 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The fire commission first argues that the comments regarding the union and union leadership which were published in the press are protected by the New Hampshire and United States Constitutions as the exercise of free speech. Because we resolve this case on statutory grounds, we need not reach the constitutional issues. <em>See Appeal of Astro Spectacular, </em>138 N.H. 298, 299, 639 A.2d 249, 250 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">RSA 273-A:5 prohibits unfair labor practices. It reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-8\">I. It shall be a prohibited practice for any public employer:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-9\">(a) To restrain, coerce or otherwise interfere with its employees in the exercise of the rights conferred by this chapter;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-10\">(b) To dominate or to interfere in the formation or administration of any employee organization; ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">RSA 273-A:5, 1(a), (b) (1987). The fire commission argues that the PELRB erred when it interpreted RSA chapter 27S-A as prohibiting Loch\u2019s comments to the press, and it urges us to adopt the standard of protection contained in the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\"> The NLRA provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>The expressing of any views, argument, or opinion . . . shall not constitute or be evidence of an unfair labor practice ... if such expression contains no threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Labor Management Relations (Taft-Hartley) Act \u00a7 8(c), 29 U.S.C.- \u00a7 158(c) (1988). The fire commission argues that by limiting prohibited speech to expressions containing threats or promise of benefits, the NLRA establishes the minimum acceptable protection of free speech for public employers. The fire commission then argues that even if the federal standard is not adopted, the comments at issue did not amount to interference with the administration of a union. The union counters that because the \u201cfree speech plank\u201d contained in the NLRA does not exist in RSA chapter 273-A, we should limit our inquiry to deciding whether the comments were coercive. The union then argues that the comments were coercive, even if viewed in light of the federal statute. We find that the speech was not coercive, and that it did not amount to interference with the administration of the union. We decline, however, to impute the requirements of section 8(c) of the NLRA to RSA chapter 273-A.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">The issue before us is what speech constitutes \u201cinterference\u201d within the meaning of RSA chapter 273-A. Although we resolve this case on nonconstitutional grounds, we recognize that the first amendment is a significant factor in our construction of the statute. In a case presenting questions of statutory interpretation similar to those before us, the Michigan Court of Appeals found the purposes of the statute embodying the organizational rights of public employees best served by permitting the free flow of information from both union and employer. <em>Local 79, Serv. Emp. v. Lapeer Cty. Gen. Hosp., </em>314 N.W.2d 648, 651 (Mich. Ct. App. 1981). In addition, that court assumed, without deciding, the existence of a constitutional right to engage in union activities, but reasoned that there was \u201cno infringement thereof merely by virtue of a public employer\u2019s expression of its views on union representation, absent intimidation, coercion, or misrepresentation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 652. The court concluded, \u201cManifestly, fair comment on the question of union representation does not abridge an employee\u2019s freedom of association.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We find the Michigan court\u2019s decision helpful in establishing the contours of \u201cinterference\u201d under RSA 273-A:5, 1(a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">We also find that the federal counterpart to RSA chapter 273-A provides a useful backdrop for our decision in this case. The federal statute requires that in order for the views, argument, or opinion of a public employer to constitute an unfair labor practice, those views, argument, or opinion must contain \u201cthreat of reprisal or force or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>promise of benefit.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(c). Although we decline to adopt specifically the requirements of the federal statute, we have relied on the language of that statute for guidance in the past. <em>See Appeal of AFL-CIO Local 298, </em>121 N.H. at 946, 437 A.2d at 261. In that case, we also recognized our need to \u201cbe cognizant of the constitutional provisions that raise the freedom to communicate one\u2019s views to the highest level of protection that can be provided.\u201d <em>Id,.; see </em>U.S. CONST, amend. I; N.H. CONST, pt. I, art. 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">In this case, the PELRB found that Loch\u2019s comments were \u201cunjustified,\u201d and, \u201cwhether intended or not, . . . did have a disruptive effect on the union and its administration.\u201d In support of this finding, the PELRB relied upon testimony by a union official that, after the comments were published, \u201ca number of firefighters came up between union meetings and during the union meeting wanting to know what had the Executive Board done to hurt negotiations, did we have anything offered that we didn\u2019t bring to the body and basically they couldn\u2019t understand what was going on.\u201d The PELRB concluded that interference had occurred, stating that Loch\u2019s comments \u201ccreated doubt in the effectiveness and truthfulness of the union leadership as it represented negotiations positions to the membership.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">In finding that Loch\u2019s comments constituted interference under the statute, the PELRB erred. Proof of \u201cdisruptive effect,\u201d \u201cwhether intended or not\u201d and whether \u201cjustified\u201d or not, does not amount to, or rise to the level of, interference. We do not think it unusual or even unhealthy for union members to ask questions relating to the competence of, and honest representation by, their elected representatives. Moreover, Loch\u2019s comments did not contain elements of \u201cintimidation, coercion, or misrepresentation.\u201d Consequently, we cannot say that the union demonstrated interference on the part of Loch within the meaning of RSA 273-A:5, 1(a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b487-8\">BATCHELDER, J., retired, sat by special assignment under RSA 490:3; all concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
