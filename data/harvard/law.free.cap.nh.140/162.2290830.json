We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-22\">After a jury trial in Superior Court <em>{Sullivan, </em>J.), the defendant was convicted of three counts of selling cocaine, one count of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>accomplice to the sale of cocaine and one charge of possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute, all in violation of RSA chapter 318-B. After the conviction, the defendant filed an appeal to this court; on the advice of counsel, however, he withdrew the appeal because \u201cnon-meritorious issues [were] presented.\u201d He subsequently argued in a motion for a new trial, and argues here on the instant appeal, that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to preserve, an adequate record of the grounds of several objections to testimony at trial deprived him of meaningful review on direct appeal, and that his trial counsel\u2019s assistance was thus ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The defendant raises his claim of ineffective assistance under both the New Hampshire and Federal Constitutions. The State Constitution is at least as protective as the Federal Constitution in this area. <em>See State v. Chase, </em>135 N.H. 209, 211, 600 A.2d 931, 933 (1991). We address the question under the State Constitution independently, <em>see State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 231, 471 A.2d 347, 350 (1983), \u201cusing federal precedent only for its help in dealing with the State issue.\u201d <em>State v. Glidden, </em>127 N.H. 359, 361, 499 A.2d 1349, 1350 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">The right of effective assistance of counsel guarantees the defendant \u201creasonably competent assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>State v. Matiyosus, </em>134 N.H. 686, 687, 597 A.2d 1068, 1069 (1991). Under either constitution, .to prevail on an ineffective assistance claim the defendant must demonstrate that his \u201ccounsel\u2019s conduct so undermined the proper\u2019functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result.\u201d <em>State v. Anaya, </em>134 N.H. 346, 351, 592 A.2d 1142, 1145 (1991) (quotation omitted). This test contains two prongs: the defendant must show that his attorney\u2019s performance was deficient, or not \u201creasonably competent,\u201d and that the deficient performance resulted in actual prejudice to the outcome of the defendant\u2019s trial. <em>Id. </em>at 351-52, 592 A.2d at 1145; <em>see Matiyosus, </em>134 N.H. at 687, 597 A.2d at 1069-70. This actual prejudice must rise to such a level \u201cthat there is a reasonable probability that. . . the result of the proceeding would have been different. . . ; [I]f the defendant is unable to demonstrate such prejudice, we need not even decide whether counsel\u2019s performance [was deficient.]\u201d <em>Chase, </em>135 N.H. at 212, 600 A.2d at 933 (quotations omitted). In cases where a defendant can demonstrate a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different, the United States Supreme Court has recently refined the prejudice inquiry in the federal test to include a focus on \u201cwhether counsel\u2019s . . . performance renders the result of the trial unreliable or the proceeding fundamentally unfair.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number><em>Lockhart v. Fretwell, </em>113 S. Ct. 838, 844 (1993). In the present case, the defendant must demonstrate a reasonable probability that, but for his counsel\u2019s failure to preserve the record, his conviction would have been reversed on appeal, and that the verdict on a subsequent retrial would be different. <em>See State v. </em>Killam, 137 N.H. 155, 158, 626 A.2d 401, 403 (1993); <em>Chase, </em>135 N.H. at 212-13, 600 A.2d at 933. Because the defendant in the instant case cannot demonstrate such a probability, we do not decide today whether the recent refinement of the federal standard renders the State and federal standards different. <em>See Chase, </em>135 N.H. at 211, 600 A.2d at 933 (because the State and federal \u201cstandards are identical, the analysis and result is the same under each constitution\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The defendant presents the testimony of Manchester Police Sergeant Gary Tibbetts as grounds for his claim. Tibbetts executed a warrant for the defendant\u2019s arrest at the Manchester bus terminal after the defendant exited a bus arriving from Boston. On direct examination by the State, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">Q. Now you said you saw him get off the bus?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-7\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-8\">Q. What happened after he got off the bus?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-9\">A. I had started to move in his direction the same time calling for a backup unit, as the information was that he might possibly be armed too. As I approached \u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">Defendant\u2019s counsel then interrupted and asked for a bench conference, which was not recorded. No objections, requests for relief, or rulings thereon were stated on the record regarding this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-11\">The defendant complains that the statement, \u201cas the information was that he might possibly be armed,\u201d although not precisely evidence of another \u201cbad act,\u201d should be analyzed pursuant to New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 404(b). He contends that this testimony \u201cadvanced the State\u2019s portrayal of the defendant as . . . [a]n armed person [who] surely fits the stereotypical image of a drug dealer that must have resided with the jury.\u201d According to the defendant, this portrayal was highly prejudicial. He contends that we would have reversed the superior court\u2019s denial of a mistrial had there been an adequate record on appeal. There is some indication in the record that the statement was allowed for \u201cnon-hearsay purposes,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>to show why Sergeant Tibbetts acted as he did prior to arresting the defendant. The trial record is not clear on this-point; however, for the purposes of this case only, we will analyze the statement as though it were inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-12\">Even if the defendant\u2019s trial counsel had preserved the issues for review on the defendant\u2019s direct appeal, we would not have reversed-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>the superior court\u2019s denial of a motion for a mistrial absent an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Lemire, </em>130 N.H. 552, 554, 543 A.2d 425, 426 (1988). If the circumstances surrounding Sergeant Tibbetts\u2019 testimony indicated that justice would not have been served had the trial continued to a verdict, then the trial court should have granted the motion for a mistrial, and we would have reversed a denial of such a motion. <em>See id. </em>The \u201cremarks or the conduct must be more than merely inadmissible; they must constitute an irreparable injustice that cannot be cured by jury instructions.\u201d <em>State v. Drew, </em>137 N.H. 644, 648, 633 A.2d 108, 110 (1993). Although trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the admissibility of Sergeant Tibbetts\u2019 statement, or to request a curative instruction after it was made, may be evidence of counsel\u2019s inadequate performance, <em>see State v. Staples, </em>121 N.H. 959, 964, 437 A.2d 266, 268-69 (1981), the defendant has failed to demonstrate that a failure to make such an objection or request on the record caused him actual prejudice at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-3\">No irreparable injustice or prejudice resulted from these statements. On cross-examination of Sergeant Tibbetts and Officer David Sullivan, who searched the defendant pursuant to his arrest, defense counsel elicited testimony that the defendant was indeed <em>not </em>armed at the time of the arrest. The superior court found Sergeant Tibbetts\u2019 statement to be \u201cvery vague,\u201d and to have only a \u201cquestionable\u201d prejudicial effect. We conclude that the statement created, at most, a temporary ambiguity, which was subsequently corrected by the testimony of Tibbetts himself and of Officer Sullivan. <em>Cf. State v. Collins, </em>138 N.H. 217, 220-21, 637 A.2d 153, 155 (1994) (court was \u201csatisfied on the trial record as a whole\u201d that the jury\u2019s knowledge of a separate, ultimately dismissed, indictment did not entitle the defendant to a mistrial); <em>Blais v. Town of Goffstown, </em>119 N.H. 613, 620, 406 A.2d 295, 300 (1979) (trial court\u2019s denial of a mistrial was proper where any prejudice to defendant was \u201covercome by the trial court\u2019s careful handling of the situation\u201d). \u201cWhere the testimony is ambiguous, a defendant is not so substantially prejudiced that a mistrial is required.\u201d <em>State v. Ellison, </em>135 N.H. 1, 6, 599 A.2d 477, 480 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">Finally, a review of the entire record discloses that the defendant was not irreparably harmed by the statement. <em>See Killam, </em>137 N.H. at 158, 626 A.2d at 403; <em>Ellison, </em>135 N.H. at 7, 599 A.2d at 481. Several officers testified at trial to their participation in four individual controlled purchases of cocaine from the defendant. At trial, the defendant admitted that a large quantity of cocaine was found on his person when he was arrested. The r'ecord contains abundant evidence from which a jury rationally could infer guilt. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number><em>Killam, </em>137 N.H. at 158, 626 A.2d at 403; <em>State v. Wisowaty, </em>137 N.H. 298, 307-08, 627 A.2d 572, 578 (1993); <em>State v. Dustin, </em>122 N.H. 544, 547, 446 A.2d 1186, 1188-89 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-3\">The challenged statement would not have supported the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial, and would not have supported a reversal of his conviction on appeal. Because this is so, the defendant has failed to demonstrate that his counsel\u2019s failure to preserve a record of his objection and the grounds for his objection for direct appeal constituted actual prejudice. <em>Killam, </em>137 N.H. at 158, 626 A.2d at 403. Because the defendant has not demonstrated prejudice, we need not assess whether his trial counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, <em>id., </em>and conclude that the defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel, under the New Hampshire Constitution, at his trial. Because the defendant has failed to meet this prong of the State and federal constitutional standards, we need not address separately whether he meets the recent refinement of the federal test. <em>See Lockhart, </em>113 S. Ct. at 844.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"A8I\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
