Steed appeals, arguing that the superior court erred in: (1) admitting evidence that he possessed a gun seventeen hours after the offense charged; (2) admitting the victim\u2019s <em>ex parte </em>domestic violence petition, through which she had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>sought to restrain the defendant; (3) excluding a new version of a form for domestic violence restraining orders; (4) denying his motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence; and (5) denying his motion-for reconsideration of his sentence; We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\">The superior court trial was a <em>de novo </em>appeal from Steed\u2019s conviction in the district court of criminal trespass for violating the restraining order. <em>See </em>RSA 599:1 (Supp. 1994). In the superior court, the victim testified as follows. She and Steed were involved in a romantic rel\u00e1tionship and lived together for over- a year. The victim ended the relationship in May 1993 and moved into a house she had just purchased. Soon afterwards, Steed began harassing her and her friends and family with telephone calls. Steed repeatedly asked the victim if he could see her and threatened her when she refused. The victim testified that she was afraid of Steed because he had a drinking problem and a gun. She recounted' an incident when she believed he was threatening her with the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">On June 10, 1993, the victim obtained a domestic violence restraining order forbidding Steed from entering her residence. A police officer served Steed with the order the same'day. In the early hours of June 15, the victim twice heard Steed\u2019s car, with its distinctive muffler, in her driveway, but she did not see his car. Then, between 5:00 and 5:30 a.m., the victim observed Steed pull his car into her driveway, walk to'the garage attached to her house, return to his car, and drive away. She called the police and gave a statement to Officer Charles Hillsgrove that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">\u2022 After obtaining a warrant for Steed\u2019s arrest, Hillsgrove drove to the victim\u2019s home. The time was approximately 10:30 p.m., still on June 15,1993. Steed was at the victim\u2019s home, parked in front of the house; He drove away as Hillsgrove approached, and Hillsgrove followed him, blue lights flashing. When Steed came to a stop, Hillsgrove saw him hide something under his front seat. After arresting him, Hillsgrove asked Steed if he had any weapons in the car. Steed replied that' he did not, but a search shortly thereafter revealed a loaded revolver. Steed had a permit to carry the gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Hillsgrove. testified that Steed confessed he had been in the victim\u2019s driveway that morning. Steed, on the other hand, admitted at trial to being near the victim\u2019s property but denied entering her driveway. He also testified that he thought the restraining order simply prohibited him from entering the victim\u2019s house, and his lawyer argued to the jury that he did not knowingly violate the order. The jury returned a verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">Approximately one month later, Steed filed a motion for a new trial, on the basis of newly discovered evidence. The evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>consisted of a videotaped recording of conversations between Steed and Hillsgrove on June 15, 1993, after Steed\u2019s arrest. Steed argued that Hillsgrove\u2019s recorded statements contradicted the officer\u2019s assertion at trial that Steed had confessed to being on the victim\u2019s property. At the hearing on the motion, Steed\u2019s counsel admitted to possessing the videotape prior to trial but stated that he did not review it \u201cin detail\u201d until afterwards. The superior court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The superior court sentenced Steed to twelve months in the house of correction and two years of probation. Noting that the district court had not sentenced him to any period of incarceration, Steed filed a motion for reconsideration. The superior court denied this motion, and Steed appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Steed first contests the admission of evidence that he had a gun in his car at the time of his arrest. He contends that this evidence was irrelevant and \u201conly served to inflame or confuse the jury.\u201d Steed does not argue that the admission of this evidence violated New Hampshire Rule of Evidence 404(b). We therefore address this issue under our traditional tests of relevancy and prejudice, <em>cf. State v. Allen, </em>128 N.H. 390, 398, 514 A.2d 1263, 1268-69 (1986); <em>see also </em>N.H. R. Ev. 401, 403, and express no opinion whether our recent decisions in <em>State v. Bassett, </em>139 N.H. 493, 659 A.2d 891 (1995), and <em>State v. McGlew, </em>139 N.H. 505, 658 A.2d 1191 (1995), would compel a different analysis or result.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">\u201cEvidentiary rulings are within the sound discretion of the trial court,\u201d <em>Clipper Affiliates v. Checovich, </em>138 N.H. 271, 275, 638 A.2d 791, 794 (1994), and \u201c[t]he defendant has the burden to demonstrate that the trial court\u2019s discretionary ruling is clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case,\u201d <em>State v. Bouchard, </em>138 N.H. 581, 583, 643 A.2d 963, 965 (1994). We hold that Steed has failed to meet this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">To establish Steed\u2019s guilt, the State had to prove that he knew he was not licensed or privileged to enter the victim\u2019s driveway. RSA 635:2, I; <em>State v. Wentworth, </em>118 N.H. 832, 839, 395 A.2d 858, 863 (1978). At trial, Steed denied that he knowingly violated the restraining order. Officer Hillsgrove\u2019s testimony regarding the gun tended to counter this assertion. As recounted above, Steed immediately drove away from the victim\u2019s hous\u00e9 when Hillsgrove appeared in his police cruiser. When stopped, Steed apparently hid his permitted gun under the front seat of his car. Then, when Hillsgrove arrested him for criminal trespass, Steed lied about the gun, denying its presence. The jury could have reasonably concluded that Steed\u2019s behavior manifested an effort to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>flee and avoid suspicion, hallmarks of a defendant\u2019s consciousness of guilt. <em>See State v. Philbrook, </em>138 N.H. 601, 603, 644 A.2d 66, 67 (1994) (effort to flee); <em>State v. Thorp, </em>86 N.H. 501, 506-07, 171 A. 633, 638 (1934) (effort to avoid suspicion). The evidence was therefore relevant to the issue of intent. <em>See </em>N.H. R. EV. 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-3\">Steed does not explain how this evidence might have \u201cinflame[d] or confuse[d]\u201d the jury. Although the evidence likely prejudiced Steed, its probative value was not \u201csubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice . . . [or] confusion of the issues.\u201d N.H. R. EV. 403. Intent was a hotly contested issue at trial. The superior court would therefore have been justified in assigning the evidence a high probative value. Moreover, neither the prosecutor nor the court used this evidence to invite any improper inferences about Steed\u2019s character or disposition. In closing argument, for example, the prosecutor made no mention of Steed\u2019s earlier, threatening use of the gun against the victim. Instead, she focused on Steed\u2019s evasive behavior at the time of his arrest to impugn his credibility and thereby discredit his claim that he did not act knowingly. We hold that Steed has failed to prove that the superior court\u2019s discretionary ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case. <em>See Bouchard, </em>138 N.H. at 583, 643 A.2d at 965.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Steed next alleges error in the superior court\u2019s admission of the victim\u2019s petition for the restraining order. We need not decide whether the court erred because this evidence was merely cumulative and therefore harmless. <em>See State v. Lemieux, </em>136 N.H. 329, 331, 615 A.2d 635, 636 (1992). The victim had already testified concerning the circumstances of the restraining order and her reasons for fearing Steed. Steed does not contest the admissibility of this testimony on appeal and did not object at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Steed next contests the trial court\u2019s exclusion of a new court form for domestic violence restraining orders. Like the form actually used in this case, the new form lists several items that a court may check off and make part of the order. One of the items restrains the defendant from entering the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cpremises.\u201d The form used in this case uses the term \u201cresidence\u201d instead of \u201cpremises.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Steed sought admission of the new form to support his defense that he did not knowingly violate the restraining order actually served on him. Steed denied entering the victim\u2019s driveway but argued alternatively that, even if he did enter the driveway, he did not believe he was violating the order by doing so. Steed\u2019s counsel pointed out in closing argument that the victim\u2019s petition for the restraining order used the word \u201cpremises,\u201d whereas the order says <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>\u201cresidence.\u201d The trial court instructed the jury to find Steed not guilty if it found that \u201cthe reasonable and prudent person would construe the word residence to be limited to the building [wherein the victim resided].\u201d Steed does not argue on appeal that, as a matter of law, a driveway is not part of a person\u2019s \u201cresidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-3\">We find no error in the trial court\u2019s decision to exclude the new form from the jury\u2019s consideration. Steed was charged with violating a restraining order prohibiting him from entering the victim\u2019s \u201cresidence.\u201d Steed does not allege that he knew of the form change and therefore the new form\u2019s reference to \u201cpremises\u201d could not have played a role in the formation of his intent. The trial court properly excluded this irrelevant evidence. We do not address Steed\u2019s claim that the superior court violated his right to produce all favorable proofs, <em>see </em>N.H. CONST, pt. I, art. 15, because he did not raise it below. <em>See State v. Giordano, </em>138 N.H. 90, 93, 635 A.2d 482, 483 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"> Steed next argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence, a videotaped recording of conversations between himself and Officer Hillsgrove. To obtain a new trial on this ground, Steed bore the burden of proving:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-5\">(1) that [he] was not at fault for not discovering the evidence at the former trial; (2) that the evidence is admissible, material to the merits, and not cumulative; and (3) that [the evidence is] of such a character that a different result will probably be reached upon another trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-6\"><em>State v. Abbott, </em>127 N.H. 444, 450, 503 A.2d 791, 795 (1985) (citations and quotations omitted). \u201cThe granting or denial of a new trial, after notice and an opportunity to be heard, is in the discretion of the [trial] court . . . .\u201d <em>State v. Cote, </em>129 N.H. 358, 370, 530 A.2d 775, 781 (1987) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Steed fails the first prong of this test. As discussed above, his attorney possessed and viewed the videotape at issue before trial. Steed contends that he should not be deemed at fault for failing to discover the significance of this evidence prior to trial. We do not accept his argument. The videotape was made within one or two hours after Steed\u2019s arrest. The conversations recorded were between Steed and the police officer who had just arrested him. This same officer later testified that Steed had confessed to being in the victim\u2019s driveway. We do not agree that Steed should be held blameless for failing to \u201ccritically review[]\u201d such a recording prior to trial. <em>See id. </em>at 370-71, 530 A.2d at 782. We hold that the superior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>court did not abuse its discretion in denying Steed\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-3\">Steed\u2019s final claim of error is the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration of sentence. He argues that the superior court\u2019s sentence of twelve months in the house of correction, the maximum possible, <em>see </em>RSA 651:2, 11(c) (Supp. 1994), was motivated by hostility and vindictiveness against him. Moreover, because the district court had not imposed any incarceration, he maintains that the superior court\u2019s increased sentence required justification, and that such justification is lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">Although Steed invokes general due process protections, he did not mention the State Constitution at trial and failed to specifically invoke any provision of the State Constitution in his brief. Accordingly, no issue under the State Constitution is properly before us. <em>State v. Dellorfano, </em>128 N.H. 628, 632, 517 A.2d 1163, 1166 (1986). Steed does not argue that the due process analysis of <em>State v. Hurlburt, </em>135 N.H. 143, 147-48, 603 A.2d 493, 495-96 (1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>503 U.S. 1008 (1992), applies to this case. We therefore leave this issue for another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">On the due process issue, Steed does argue that the record in the superior court should reflect the reasons for the change in sentence when a harsher sentence is imposed upon appeal after a trial <em>de novo, </em>citing <em>State v. Wheeler, </em>120 N.H. 496, 416 A.2d 1384 (1980). <em>Wheeler, </em>however, was overruled by <em>State v. Landry, </em>131 N.H. 65, 550 A.2d 94 (1988). Nevertheless, because Steed raised the question of vindictiveness below, he has sufficiently preserved the issue of whether the sentence increase violates the standard set forth in <em>Landry.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">\u201c[T]rial judges need not explain a sentence increase after a trial <em>de novo. </em>\u201d <em>Landry, </em>131 N.H. at 66, 550 A.2d at 95. Where a superior court\u2019s sentence increase on <em>de novo </em>appeal violates no statutory provision, we will uphold it unless \u201cthe defendant has met his burden of showing that the increase results from prosecutorial or judicial misconduct or vindictiveness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 67-68, 550 A.2d at 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">To support his claim of vindictiveness and hostility, Steed suggests that \u201cprolonged and derogatory comments and long-standing media criticism of the [Superior] Court in the disposition of matters of \u2018domestic violence\u2019 have colored the Court\u2019s reasoning and strongly affected the reasonable exercise of the discretion permitted in sentencing the defendant.\u201d Steed offered no evidence to bolster this sheer speculation. As nothing in the record lends it any credence, we reject it. Steed\u2019s remaining arguments supporting his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>claim of vindictiveness and hostility were not raised below; therefore, we do not address them. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>130 N.H. 578, 587, 547 A.2d 213, 218 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b207-4\">BATCHELDER, J., dissented; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b207-5\">BATCHELDER, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ARa\">dissenting: Under the majority\u2019s \u201cconsciousness of guilt\u201d analysis, I believe the evidence of the defendant\u2019s conduct with respect to the gun was inadmissible. The defendant\u2019s flight from the scene may have been probative of his consciousness of guilt of the charged offense; hiding and lying about his gun arguably raises an inference only of a \u201cconsciousness\u201d of guilt about having the gun. I also believe that the record supports finding the preservation of a Rule 404(b) claim. Evidence of the defendant\u2019s subsequent \u201cother wrong\u201d of hiding and lying about the gun was irrelevant to the trespass charge and highly prejudicial. <em>See State v. Richardson, </em>138 N.H. 162, 635 A.2d 1361 (1993). I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
