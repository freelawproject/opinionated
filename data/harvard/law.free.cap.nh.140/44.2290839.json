Fray-Witzer, </em>attorney, on the brief and orally), for the State.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b92-15\"><em>David M.

On appeal, the defendant argues that his conduct was not within the purview of RSA 634:2, 11(b). We agree that the defendant did not violate the statute and therefore reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-17\">On March 31, 1991, Easter Sunday, the defendant and three friends were \u201ccruising around and . . . drinking.\u201d They decided to stop near some satellite dishes because the defendant and one of his companions, Alan Hobbs, needed to relieve themselves. Hobbs testified that, after answering nature\u2019s call behind a small building, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>he returned and saw the defendant hanging from one of the satellite dishes, \u201chooting and hollering\u201d and \u201cacting like a monkey.\u201d Hobbs also saw the defendant grab one of the satellite dishes and move it.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The manager of Simmons Cable TV\u00a1 the company that owns the dishes, testified that the reception of fourteen channels was affected when the dishes were moved. Over half of the cable system\u2019s channels were interrupted for approximately four hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">The defendant was convicted under RSA 634:2,11(b), which makes it a class B felony purposely to cause or attempt to cause a \u201csubstantial interruption or impairment of public communication, transportation, supply of water, gas or power or other public service.\u201d The defendant was indicted for \u201cpurposely causing a substantial interruption of a public service.\u201d He argues that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that cable television is a \u201cpublic service.\u201d \u201cA sufficiency inquiry may involve two steps: a preliminary legal question may exist as to the definition of [an] element of the crime,\u201d and the evidence produced at trial may be insufficient to support a reasonable jury\u2019s finding that the element, so defined, was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Paglierani, </em>139 N.H. 37, 38, 648 A.2d 209, 210 (1994). The defendant argued below that the \u201cState failed to produce sufficient evidence to show Simmons Cable T.V. Service was a \u2018public service\u2019 as contemplated by . . . [RSA] 634:2.\u201d Therefore, the definition of that element was at issue before the trial court and is properly before us on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">The legislature has not defined \u201cpublic service\u201d in this context. General words in a statute that follow specific words, however, are construed to include only items of a similar character to the specific ones mentioned. <em>Town of Gilsum v. Monadnock Reg. School District, </em>136 N.H. 32, 40, 611 A.2d 625, 629 (1992). Therefore, \u201cother public service,\u201d as used in RSA 634:2, 11(b), comprises services similar to public communication, transportation, water, gas, and power service. The legislature has employed similar phrasing, including the words \u201cother public services,\u201d to describe services essential to the public welfare. <em>See </em>RSA 674:36, 11(a) (1986); RSA 205:1 (1989); <em>see also </em>RSA 374:48, II (1984) (differentiating between \u201cpublic utility companies] which suppl[y] gas, electricity, water or telephone service\u201d and \u201ccable television companies]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">We have previously had occasion to consider the legislative intent underlying RSA 634:2. Although <em>State v. Paris, </em>137 N.H. 322, 627 A.2d 582 (1993), involved a violation of RSA 634:2, 11(a), we noted that the legislative history indicates that \u2018\u201c[t]he grading of this offense is based upon considerations of seriousness similar to those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>that govern theft offenses, namely, the amount of property lost, and upon the seriousness as measured by effects on <em>essential public services.\u2019\u201d Paris, </em>137 N.H. at 328, 627 A.2d at 586 (quoting the 1969 \u201cReport of Commission to Recommend Codification of Criminal Laws\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-3\">Because cable television is not an essential public service, <em>accord Devon-Aire Villas Home. v. Americable Assoc., </em>490 So. 2d 60, 63-64 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1985) (cable television not \u201cthe equivalent of, for example, electricity and water\u201d); <em>Sheppard v. City of Orangeburg, </em>442 S.E.2d 601, 603 (S.C. 1994) (\u201cWe do not believe that the value and necessity of cable television is so self-evident that this court should declare that a cable television system provides an essential service.\u201d), we conclude that the legislature did not intend that RSA 634:2, 11(b) apply to interruption or impairment of cable television service; therefore, the defendant\u2019s actions did not constitute felony criminal mischief under RSA 634:2, 11(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"Aqz\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
