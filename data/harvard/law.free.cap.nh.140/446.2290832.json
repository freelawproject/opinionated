We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">Without prior notice, the town selectmen terminated the plaintiff from his position as police chief. In response, the plaintiff sued the town in superior court. <em>See </em>RSA 105:2-a (1990). Following this court\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson v. Nash, </em>135 N.H. 534, 608 A.2d 200 (1992), the plaintiff moved for summary judgment, arguing that the lack of prior notice of his termination violated New Hampshire\u2019s Right-To-Know Law. <em>See </em>RSA 91-A:3, 11(a) (1990). The superior court agreed and, after a hearing, ordered the plaintiff\u2019s reinstatement. Citing <em>Bradbury v. Shaw, </em>116 N.H. 388, 360 A.2d 123 (1976), the court also awarded the plaintiff his attorney\u2019s reasonable fees. The town appealed; we accepted only its appeal of the award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-12\">RSA 91-A:8 (1990) governs the award of attorney\u2019s fees when the Right-To-Know Law has been violated. Although the statute as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>originally enacted mandated the award of attorney\u2019s fees in every case, subsequent amendment provided for the award of fees at the discretion of the trial court. <em>Compare </em>Laws 1973, 113:1 <em>with </em>Laws 1977, 540:6. Prior to the violation here, the statute was again amended to prohibit the award of attorney\u2019s fees \u201cunless the court finds that the body, agency or person knew or should have known that the conduct engaged in was a violation of this chapter.\u201d RSA 91-A:8; <em>see </em>Laws 1986, 83:7. Consequently, only if the town knew or should have known that the plaintiff was entitled to prior notice of his termination would the award of attorney\u2019s fees be proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The trial court found that the selectmen consulted with town counsel about what procedure should be followed before dismissing the plaintiff and that, to the extent relevant, they followed that advice. It also found that prior to our decision in <em>Johnson v. Nash, </em>\u201cit was not generally understood among municipal law practitioners in New Hampshire that the provisions of RSA 91-A:3,11(a) required advance notice to an employee that his or her dismissal would be considered in executive session.\u201d Moreover, the trial court found that the town acted in good faith, and that the violation of the Right-To-Know Law was not obvious, deliberate, or willful.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">These factual findings fail to support the award of attorney\u2019s fees. Although the trial court cited <em>Bradbury v. Shaw </em>in support of the award, that decision was based on the original version of the statute, which mandated an award of attorney\u2019s fees whenever the Right-To-Know Law was violated. <em>See </em>Laws 1973, 113:1.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Nor do the cases cited by the plaintiff, <em>Silva v. Botsch, </em>121 N.H. 1041, 437 A.2d 313 (1981), and <em>Foster v. Town of Hudson, </em>122 N.H. 150, 441 A.2d 1183 (1982), sustain the award of attorney\u2019s fees. Neither case dealt with the Right-To-Know Law, which has its own statutory directive regarding attorney\u2019s fees. Rather, they each dealt with the award of attorney\u2019s fees to a public servant under common law principles, which do not apply here. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b496-9\">Johnson and Broderick, jj., did not sit; batchelder, j., retired, sat by special assignment under RSA 490:3; all who sat concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
