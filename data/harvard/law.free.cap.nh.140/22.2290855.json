Would any other provision of the New Hampshire Constitution be violated by the enactment of HB 301, as amended?</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">\u201cThat the clerk of the senate transmit copies of this resolution and HB 301, as amended, to the Justices of the Supreme Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">The following response is respectfully returned:</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">\n<em>To the Honorable Senate:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">The undersigned justices of the supreme court now submit the following replies to your questions. Following our receipt of your resolution on April 18, 1995, we invited interested parties to file memoranda with the court on or before June 5, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">HB 301 (the bill) proposes to amend RSA 632-A:6 (Supp. 1994) by inserting after paragraph III a new paragraph to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-12\">Ill-a. The victim\u2019s manner of dress at the time of the sexual assault shall not be admitted as evidence in any prosecution under this chapter to infer consent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-13\">Your first question asks whether enacting the bill \u201cprohibiting evidence from which consent could be inferred in a sexual assault prosecution [would] be improper because it may result in preempting an accused\u2019s right to produce all proofs that may be favorable to the accused and cross-examine witnesses in violation of Part I, Article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution.\u201d We answer this question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-14\">Part I, article 15 of the State Constitution provides that every criminal defendant \u201cshall have a right to produce all proofs that may be favorable to himself; to meet the witnesses against him face to face, and to be fully heard in his defense.\u201d Whether or not particular evidence constitutes \u201cfavorable\u201d proof is to be assessed by considering the relevance-of the evidence and its potential for confusing the issues or misleading the jury. <em>See State v. Woodsum, </em>137 N.H. 198, 201, 624 A.2d 1342, 1344 (1993). Part I, article 15 does not guarantee a criminal defendant \u201can absolute right to introduce testimony which is not relevant to the issues being tried.\u201d <em>State v. Hunt, </em>122 N.H. 59, 60, 440 A.2d 1126, 1127 (1982); <em>see also United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number><em>States v. Duncan, </em>855 F.2d 1528, 1533 (11th Cir. 1988) (federal rule prohibiting evidence of victim\u2019s sexual history \u201cwas premised on the precept that an accused does not have a constitutional right to present irrelevant evidence\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>489 U.S. 1029 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">When a defendant charged with sexual assault claims that the alleged victim consented, the State\u2019s burden is not to prove the defendant\u2019s subjective state of mind but \u201cwhether a reasonable person in the circumstances would have understood that the victim did not consent.\u201d <em>State v. Ayer, </em>136 N.H. 191, 196, 612 A.2d 923, 926 (1992). The inquiry focuses on the victim\u2019s objective manifestations of her unwillingness to engage in the charged conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 195-96, 612 A.2d at 926. The question of lack of consent thus concerns the victim\u2019s demonstrative and verbal conduct. <em>See </em>RSA 632-A:6, III (Supp. 1994) (\u201cConsent is no defense if, at the time of the sexual assault, the victim indicates by speech or conduct that there is not freely given consent to performance of the sexual act.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The record before us contains legislative history surrounding this bill. Explaining the purpose of the proposed legislation, Representative Clair Snyder, prime sponsor of the bill, remarked, \u201cThere are some misguided individuals who still believe the old saw, \u2018she was asking for it,\u2019 because of her manner of dress. ... No one should be constrained in their manner of dress no matter how brief or tight \u2014 for fear of inviting rape. We must remove this as an excuse for this despicable act.\u201d <em>See </em>Hearing on HB 301 Before the Senate Judiciary Committee at 1 (March 29, 1995). Representative William McCann, co-sponsor of the bill, echoed this view: \u201cI don\u2019t think that the defense of the alleged rapist should be that she was \u2018asking for it because she had tight jeans.\u2019... It isn\u2019t relevant to the fact that a woman was raped.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The bill\u2019s attempt to preclude manner-of-dress evidence to imply consent thus rests on the premise that such evidence is not relevant to the issue. A mock cross-examination of a robbery victim in the style of a manner-of-dress interrogation of a sexual assault victim illustrates the point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-7\">[Q] What were you wearing at the time, Mr. Smith?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-8\">[A] Let\u2019s see ... a suit. Yes, a suit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-9\">[Q] An <em>expensive </em>suit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-10\">[A] Well, yes, I\u2019m a successful lawyer, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-11\">[Q] In other words, Mr. Smith, you were walking around the streets late at night in a suit that practically advertised the fact that you might be a good target for some easy <em>money, </em>isn\u2019t that so? I mean, if we didn\u2019t know better, Mr. Smith, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>might even think that you were <em>asking </em>for this to happen, mightn\u2019t we?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Berger, <em>Man\u2019s Trial, Woman\u2019s Tribulation: Rape Cases in the Courtroom, </em>77 COLUM. L. REV. 1, 26 n.163 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">We have recognized that the rape shield statute, RSA 632-A:6, represents an acknowledgment of the rights of personal privacy of alleged victims of sexual assault, <em>see State v. Howard, </em>121 N.H. 53, 59, 426 A.2d 457, 461 (1981), noting that \u201cthe old concept of equating a woman\u2019s promiscuity with lack of credibility is seriously outdated and is no longer, if it ever truly was, deserving of respect by the courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60, 426 A.2d at 462. We believe that the same may be said about a victim\u2019s mode of dress. <em>Cf. United States v. Saunders, </em>736 F. Supp. 698, 704 (E.D. Va. 1990) (evidence at most suggested defendant believed victim was.\u201cwoman of easy virtue,\u201d and this \u201cstate of mind is neither relevant, nor exculpatory\u201d), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>943 F.2d 388 (4th Cir. 1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 1105 (1992). This bill may be construed as a legislative determination that society will not permit an individual to rely upon another\u2019s manner of dress as a signal of consent to sexual activity. Such a determination is within the legislature\u2019s authority. <em>Cf. State v. Wong, </em>125 N.H. 610, 622, 486 A.2d 262, 270 (1984) (legislature has constitutionally recognized authority to define criminal acts).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Because such evidence has no relevance to the issue of consent, its tendency -to humiliate the victim and mislead and confuse the jury <em>a fortiori </em>outweighs its probative value and leads to its inadmissibility. We conclude that evidence of a sexual assault victim\u2019s manner of dress when offered on the issue of consent is not \u201cfavorable proof\u201d or evidence about which a defendant has the right to cross-examine. <em>Cf. Woodsum, </em>137 N.H. at 202, 624 A.2d at 1345 (court concludes as matter of law that rejection of beneficial plea offer is not \u201cfavorable proof,\u201d where little if any probative value outweighed by risk of prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">Your second question asks whether enactment of HB 301 would \u201cimpinge upon an accused\u2019s right to due process in violation of Part I, Article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution.\u201d When we interpret statutes already in effect, they are \u201cconstrued to avoid conflict with constitutional rights wherever reasonably possible.\u201d <em>State v. Smagula, </em>117 N.H. 663, 666, 377 A.2d 608, 610 (1977). We believe that this axiom also authorizes us to announce that proposed legislation is not offensive to the constitution, for it is understood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>that the statute if enacted will be construed harmoniously with an individual\u2019s constitutional rights in any given case.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">HB 301, as amended, does not propose a blanket exclusion of manner-of-dress evidence in sexual assault prosecutions. Rather, the plain language of the bill forbids introduction of such evidence only on the issue of consent. As we have already observed, the probative value of a victim\u2019s manner of dress <em>per se </em>to imply consent to sexual activity is not demonstrable. The evidence may be relevant, however, for a purpose unrelated to consent. And, although such situations are not immediately apparent, we are unwilling in an Opinion of the Justices to categorically rule out the possibility that there may be situations in which the manner of dress is so interrelated with contemporaneous conduct of the victim that it could provide evidence helpful to the defense. Therefore, we conclude that, were this bill enacted, a defendant in a sexual assault prosecution would have a right to move for the opportunity to demonstrate that due process requires admission of manner-of-dress evidence because the probative value of the evidence in the context of the particular case outweighs its prejudice to the victim and its tendency to mislead and confuse the jury. <em>See </em>Howard, 121 N.H. at 58-59, 426 A.2d at 460-61. A hearing held on such a motion would take place outside the presence of the jury. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Your third question asks whether \u201cany other provision of the New Hampshire Constitution [would] be violated by the enactment of HB 301, as amended.\u201d \u201cWe respectfully decline to answer this question because of its generality.\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices (Limitation on Civil Actions), </em>137 N.H. 260, 269, 628 A.2d 1069, 1074 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Finally, \u201c[w]e note that our response is necessarily qualified,\u201d <em>Opinion of the Justices (Alternate Jurors), </em>137 N.H. 100, 105, 623 A.2d 1334, 1338 (1993), because we cannot anticipate every possible fact pattern that may arise and test the limits of the bill, <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">David A. brock</p>\n<p id=\"AO\">William F.
