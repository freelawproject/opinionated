We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>In May 1991, plaintiff Omer Beaudoin was bitten by a dog owned by the defendant, Theresa Marchand, while Mr. Beaudoin was working for United Parcel Services. He and his wife, plaintiff Dolores Beaudoin, brought an action against the defendant to recover for their injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\">Because Mr. Beaudoin was injured in the course of his employment, he also made a claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits from the intervenors, United Parcel Services and Liberty Mutual Insurance Company. Liberty Mutual Insurance Company paid Mr. Beaudoin benefits totaling $86,546.07, including an award of $19,866.84 for permanent impairment in accordance with RSA 281-A:32 (Supp. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">In July 1993, the plaintiffs agreed to settle their action against the defendant for $250,000. They filed a motion for approval of the settlement agreement and asked the superior court to rule that the intervenors\u2019 lien for workers\u2019 compensation benefits did not include the amount of the permanent impairment award. The superior court approved the settlement of $250,000 but ruled that the intervenors\u2019 lien included the amount of the permanent impairment award. The plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">RSA 281-A:13, 1(b) (Supp. 1994) gives the employer or the employer\u2019s insurance carrier a lien on the employee\u2019s recovery from a third party \u201cto the extent of the <em>compensation, </em>medical, hospital, or other remedial care already paid ... by the employer, or the employer\u2019s insurance carrier . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The plaintiffs argue that the amount paid as a permanent impairment award is not \u201ccompensation.\u201d They note that RSA 281-A:32 (Supp. 1994) refers to a payment for permanent impairment as an \u201caward,\u201d not \u201ccompensation,\u201d and argue that under <em>Chambers v. Geiger, </em>133 N.H. 149, 573 A.2d 1356 (1990), this reflects the legislature\u2019s intent not to include a permanent impairment award within the lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">Because this is an issue of statutory construction, we first examine the words of the statute. <em>Chambers, </em>133 N.H. at 152, 573 A.2d at 1357. Although the legislature did not define the term \u201ccompensation\u201d in the workers\u2019 compensation statute, both the plain meaning of the term and the structure of the statute as a whole support the conclusion that the term \u201ccompensation\u201d includes a permanent impairment award. An award for permanent impairment is intended to \u201ccompensate\u201d the injured employee for loss of a body part. <em>See Ranger v. New Hampshire Youth Development Center, </em>117 N.H. 648, 651, 377 A.2d 132, 134 (1977). Other provisions of the workers\u2019 compensation statute indicate that the legislature considered a permanent impairment award to be one type of compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>provided by the statute. <em>See, e.g., </em>RSA 281-A:33 (\u201cAny employer who is liable for the <em>compensation </em>provided by. . . [RSA281-A:]32. . .\u201d). Because the language and structure of the statute support the conclusion that the term \u201ccompensation\u201d includes a permanent impairment award, we reject the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments that the absence of the term \u201caward\u201d evidences the legislature\u2019s intent to exclude such an award from the scope of the lien. Similarly, we reject the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the use of the term \u201caward\u201d in RSA 281-A:32 (Supp. 1994), rather than the term \u201ccompensation,\u201d which the legislature used in an earlier version of the provision, reflects such an intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-3\">The purpose of the lien statute also supports the conclusion that the lien includes amounts paid for permanent impairment. We have recognized that the purpose of the lien is to prevent double recovery by the employee. <em>Tarr v. Republic Corp., </em>116 N.H. 99, 102, 352 A.2d 708, 711 (1976) (interpreting predecessor statute). The plaintiffs conceded during oral argument that one aspect of their claim against the defendant was a claim for permanent impairment, and that their settlement included this. Since the plaintiffs have been compensated for permanent impairment through their settlement, their retention of the permanent impairment award would have the effect of giving them a double recovery. We do not believe that the legislature intended this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">We hold that the intervenors\u2019 lien includes amounts paid for permanent impairment. Accordingly, we affirm the superior court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"ABW3\">All concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
