The Superior Court (Manias, J.) found that the signed release barred the plaintiff\u2019s negligence claim and granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">Before embarking on a horseback riding tour at the Loon Mountain Equestrian Center, owned and operated by the defendant, the plaintiff was asked to read, complete, and sign the following exculpatory agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-10\">I accept for use, as is, the animals listed on this form and accept full responsibility for its care while it is in my possession. I have made no misrepresentation to Loon Mountain regarding my name, address or age. I agree to hold harmless and indemnify Loon Mountain Recreation Corporation and its owners, agents and employees for any loss or damage, including any that result from claims for personal injury or property damage related to the use of this animal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-11\">I understand and am aware that horseback riding is a HAZARDOUS ACTIVITY. I understand that the above activity and the use of horses involves a risk of injury to any and all parts of my body. I hereby agree to freely and expressly assume and accept any and all risks of injury or death from the use of this animal while participating in this activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-12\">I understand that it is not possible to predict every situation and condition of the terrain a horse will be ridden on; therefore, it is impossible to guarantee the horse I am riding will react safely in all riding situations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>I realize that it is mandatory that I wear a helmet at all times while horseback riding, and that I will obey all trail signs and remain only on open trials.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-3\">I therefore release Loon Mountain Recreation Corporation, its owners, agents and employees FROM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES AND PERSONAL INJURY TO MYSELF OR ANY PERSON OR PROPERTY RESULTING FROM THE NEGLIGENCE OF LOON MOUNTAIN RECREATION CORPORATION TO INCLUDE NEGLIGENCE IN SELECTION, ADJUSTMENT OR ANY MAINTENANCE OF ANY HORSE, accepting myself the full responsibility for any and all damages or injury of any kind, which may result. (PLEASE SIGN: Brenda Wright/s)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-4\">I agree that there have been no warranties, expressed or implied, which have been made to me which extend beyond the description of the equipment listed on this form. I the undersigned, acknowledge that I have carefully read this agreement and release of liability, and I understand its contents. I understand that my signature below expressly waives any rights I have to sue Loon Mountain Recreation Corporation for injuries and damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The plaintiff signed this agreement after the fifth paragraph and at the bottom.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">While on the tour, the plaintiff was kicked in the leg by her guide\u2019s horse and sustained an injury. She brought a negligence action against the defendant, alleging that her tour guide had failed to respond to indications that his horse was about to \u201cact out.\u201d The defendant argued that the exculpatory contract barred the plaintiff\u2019s suit and moved for summary judgment. The Superior Court (Manias, J.) granted its motion, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">On appeal, the defendant argues that we should uphold the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment because the contract \u201cclearly and specifically indicated an intent to release Loon Mountain from liability for injury resulting from its own negligence while [the plaintiff] was engaged in the activity of horseback riding.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-8\">The trial court must grant summary judgment when it finds no genuine issue of material fact, after considering the affidavits and other evidence presented in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, and when the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The party opposing summary judgment must put forth contradictory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>evidence under oath, sufficient to indicate that a genuine issue of fact exists so that the party should have an opportunity to prove the fact at trial. All reasonable doubts should be resolved against the movant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-3\"><em>Phillips v. Verax Corp., </em>138 N.H. 240, 243, 637 A.2d 906, 909 (1994) (brackets, ellipses, and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">This court will not enforce an exculpatory contract that contravenes public policy. <em>Audley v. Melton, </em>138 N.H. 416, 418, 640 A.2d 777, 779 (1994). \u201cOnce an exculpatory agreement is found unobjectionable as a matter of public policy, it will be upheld only if it appears that the plaintiff understood the import of the agreement or that a reasonable person in his position would have known of the exculpatory provision.\u201d <em>Barnes v. N.H. Karting Assoc., </em>128 N.H. 102, 107, 509 A.2d 151, 154 (1986). \u201c[S]ince the terms of the contract are strictly construed against the defendant, the contract must clearly state that the defendant is not responsible for the consequences of his negligence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The plaintiff does not argue that the exculpatory contract contravenes public policy. Accordingly, we determine only whether \u201cthe plaintiff understood the import of the agreement,\u201d and if not, whether \u201ca reasonable person in [her] position would have known of the exculpatory provision.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The parties dispute whether the plaintiff understood the agreement to release the defendant from liability for its own negligence. The plaintiff\u2019s understanding presents an issue of fact, and the plaintiff should have an opportunity to prove the fact at trial unless the exculpatory language was clear and a misunderstanding was unreasonable. <em>See Phillips, </em>138 N.H. at 243, 637 A.2d at 909; <em>Barnes, </em>128 N.H. at 107, 509 A.2d at 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">We therefore examine the language of the release to determine whether \u201ca reasonable person in [the plaintiff\u2019s] position would have known of the exculpatory provision.\u201d <em>Barnes, </em>128 N.H. at 107, 509 A.2d at 154; <em>cf. Raudonis v. Ins. Co. of North America, </em>137 N.H. 57, 59, 623 A.2d 746, 747 (1993) (interpretation of insurance contract language a question of law; we construe terms as would reasonable person in insured\u2019s position). A reasonable person would understand the provision if its language \u201cclearly and specifically indicates the intent to release the defendant from liability for personal injury caused by the defendant\u2019s negligence . . . .\u201d <em>Barnes, </em>128 N.H. at 107, 509 A.2d at 154. We will assess the clarity of the contract by evaluating it as a whole, not by examining isolated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>words and phrases. <em>See Chadwick v. CSI, Ltd., </em>137 N.H. 515, 524, 629 A.2d 820, 826 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\">We conclude that the contract structure and organization obscured the exculpatory clauses. Strictly construing the contract language against the defendant, we find the contract did not clearly relieve the defendant of responsibility for the sort of negligence at issue in this case. <em>See Barnes, </em>128 N.H. at 107, 509 A.2d at 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">The defendant emphasizes the language of the agreement\u2019s fifth paragraph, which states: \u201cI <em>therefore </em>release [the defendant] from ANY AND ALL LIABILITY FOR . . . PERSONAL INJURY TO MYSELF . . . RESULTING FROM THE NEGLIGENCE OF [THE DEFENDANT] TO INCLUDE NEGLIGENCE IN SELECTION, ADJUSTMENT OR ANY MAINTENANCE OF ANY HORSE, accepting myself the full responsibility for any . . . injury of any kind which may result.\u201d (Emphasis added.) We find that when this clause is read within the context of the entire agreement, its meaning is less than clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">In this case, the term \u201ctherefore\u201d is significant. A common definition of \u201ctherefore\u201d is \u201cfor that reason: because of that: on that ground. . . .\u201d WEBSTER\u2019S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 2372 (unabridged ed. 1961) (WEBSTER\u2019S ). A clause that is introduced by the term \u201ctherefore\u201d cannot be understood without reading the antecedent language.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">The paragraphs preceding the exculpatory clause emphasize the inherent hazards of horseback riding. Because the exculpatory clause is prefaced by the term \u201ctherefore,\u201d a reasonable person might understand its language to relate to the inherent dangers of horseback riding and liability for injuries that occur \u201cfor that reason.\u201d Being kicked by a horse is a danger inherent to horseback riding; receiving an injury that would not have occurred but for a tour guide\u2019s negligence, however, is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">The exculpatory phrase in the fifth paragraph is further clouded by the qualifying language that follows. Pursuant to the contract, the defendant is released from liability for its negligence \u201cto include negligence in selection, adjustment or any maintenance of any horse.\u201d If we parse these terms, they do not necessarily restrict the defendant\u2019s release to liability for negligent selection, adjustment, or maintenance of any horse. The superfluity of the terms, however, serves to obscure rather than clarify. Moreover, one sense of the word \u201cinclusive\u201d is \u201ccovering or intended to cover all items <em>....\u2019\u2019 </em>WEBSTER\u2019S, <em>supra </em>at 1143. A reasonable person reading the clause thus might conclude that the agreement relieved the defendant of responsibility for the enumerated types of negligence only.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Whether the tour guide\u2019s failure to control his horse constitutes \u201cthe negligent . . . maintenance of any horse,\u201d is unclear. WEBSTER\u2019S gives several definitions for the word \u201cmaintain,\u201d the two most relevant being: (1) \u201cto keep in a state of repair, efficiency, or validity: preserve from failure or decline\u201d and (2) \u201cto provide for: bear the expense of: SUPPORT.\u201d WEBSTER\u2019S, <em>supra </em>at 1362. When read in the context of selection and adjustment, therefore, a reasonable person in the position of the plaintiff might understand \u201cthe negligent. . . maintenance of any horse\u201d to relate to negligent upkeep rather than control.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-3\"> The contract is also unclear with respect to injuries involving horses not ridden by the plaintiff. The first, second, and third paragraphs emphasize only the horse that the plaintiff \u201caccept[s] for use.\u201d We reject the defendant\u2019s argument that the phrase \u201cuse of this animal,\u201d used in the first and second paragraphs, \u201cis merely an alternative expression for the activity of \u2018horseback riding.\u2019\u201d We also reject the defendant\u2019s contention that the phrase \u201cuse of this animal\u201d does not limit the contract\u2019s application to injuries involving the plaintiff\u2019s horse because \u201c[a] careful reading . . . reveals that it is part of a clause modifying plaintiff\u2019s agreement to \u2018hold harmless and indemnify [the defendant] for any loss or damage. . . .\u2019\u201d The <em>Barnes </em>test requires that release language be plain; a careful reading should not be necessary to divine the defendant\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">In <em>Audley, </em>we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-5\">Quite simply, the general release language does not satisfy the <em>Barnes </em>requirement that the contract must clearly state that the defendant is not responsible for the consequences of his negligence. The release fails in this respect not because it neglects to use the word \u2018negligence\u2019 or any other special terms; instead it fails because no <em>particular </em>attention is called to the notion of releasing the defendant from liability for his own negligence. The general language in the context of the release simply did not put the plaintiff on clear notice of such intent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-6\"><em>Audley, </em>138 N.H. at 419, 640 A.2d at 779 (quotations and citations omitted). Whereas the release language in <em>Audley </em>failed because it was too general, the release language in the present case fails because it is obscured by qualifying terms and phrases. The cases are similar, however, because neither contract put the plaintiff \u201con clear notice,\u201d <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The exculpatory contract lacks a straightforward statement of the defendant\u2019s intent to avoid liability for its failure to use reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>care in any way. The agreement easily could have been .framed in a manner that would have expressed more clearly its conditions and exclusions. The defendant was not entitled to judgment as \u00e1 matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-3\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b220-4\">THAYER, J., with whom BROCK, C.J., joined, dissented; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b220-5\">THAYER, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ajj\">dissenting: I would uphold the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment because the exculpatory contract explicitly indicated an intent to release the defendant from liability for. its own negligence. The contract in question purports to release.the defendant from \u201cANY AND ALL LIABILITY FOR . . . PERSONAL INJURY TO MYSELF . . . RESULTING FROM THE NEGLIGENCE OF [THE DEFENDANT] TO INCLUDE NEGLIGENCE IN SELECTION, ADJUSTMENT OR ANY MAINTENANCE OF ANY HORSE.\u201d The language clearly indicates an intent to release the defendant from liability for its own negligence. I agree with the majority that the use of the word \u201ctherefore\u201d restricts the release to negligence associated with the inherent hazards of horseback riding. I do not agree, however, that the negligence alleged is not such a risk. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant\u2019s employee had failed to properly control his horse, and that as a result, the horse \u201cacted out.\u201d Controlling a horse is an essential part of horseback riding. The possibility that someone will fail to exercise the proper control would seem to fall squarely within the category of dangers inherent in the sport.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">The majority bases its holding in part on its interpretation of the phrase \u201cto include.\u201d In holding that the list prefaced by the words \u201cto include\u201d is meant to be exhaustive, the majority relies on a definition of the word \u201cinclusive.\u201d Such reliance is misplaced. The contract used the word \u201cinclude\u201d as a verb. The primary relevant definition of that word is \u201cto place, list, or rate as a part or component of a whole or a larger group, class, or aggregate.\u201d WEBSTER\u2019S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY 1143 (unabridged ed. 1961) (WEBSTER\u2019S). \u201cInclusive,\u201d however, is an adjective and its definition differs from the verb form of the word. <em>See In re Dumaine, </em>135 N.H. 103, 107, 600 A.2d 127, 129 (1991). The use of the verb form of the word indicates that the listed types of negligence \u00e1re \u201ccomponent[s] of a whole or a larger group,\u201d WEBSTER\u2019S, <em>supra, </em>and that the list was not exhaustive.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">The appropriate question, therefore, is whether the negligence alleged in this case is of the same type as those listed. The plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>alleges that the defendant\u2019s employee failed to properly control his mount. This would seem to fall squarely within the type of negligence defined by the contract. That the horse causing the injury was not ridden by the plaintiff is irrelevant. The contract releases the defendant for negligence resulting from \u201cthe use of horses\u201d and specifically from \u201cNEGLIGENCE IN SELECTION, ADJUSTMENT OR <em>ANY </em>MAINTENANCE OF ANY HORSE.\u201d (Emphasis added.) While the contract does refer to the plaintiff\u2019s horse on a number of occasions, it also refers to horses generally and to \u201cany\u201d horse. This language cannot be read to restrict the defendant\u2019s release solely to injuries caused by the plaintiff\u2019s horse. I disagree with the majority\u2019s reading of the exculpatory contract. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b221-4\">BROCK, C.J., joins in the dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
