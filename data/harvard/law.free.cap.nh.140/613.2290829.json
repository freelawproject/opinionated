Thompson and Deborah A. Stavseth, a variance to demolish a preexisting, nonconforming structure and erect a new building in the footing of the old one. The court issued injunctive relief, ordering the intervenors to demolish part of the new building. Additionally, the court ordered the town to pay the attorney\u2019s fees of the plaintiffs, David W. Taber, Harriet F. Taber, and Mary E. Taber (Tabers).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-3\">The town appeals the award of attorney\u2019s fees. The Tabers cross appeal, asserting that if this court reverses the trial court\u2019s ruling on attorney\u2019s fees, this court should also remand, instructing the trial court to order the demolition of the entire new building. We reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling on attorney\u2019s fees and affirm the court's ruling regarding injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">In January 1992, the intervenors obtained a building permit from the town to replace a detached garage located on their property with a new structure. The old garage protruded into the side yard setback required by the Westmoreland Zoning Ordinance but was a preexisting nonconforming use. The Tabers, residents of Syracuse, New York, own the property adjacent to the garage. When they discovered the construction of the new structure approximately two months after construction had begun, they filed a complaint with the Westmoreland Board of Selectmen. They alleged that the new structure violated the town zoning ordinance, which prohibits the moving, enlarging, altering, extending, reconstructing, or restoring of any preexisting nonconforming uses. <em>See </em>WESTMORELAND ZONING ORDINANCE art. II, \u00a7 206(1). After initially rejecting the Tabers\u2019 complaint, the board issued a cease and desist order to the intervenors. The intervenors filed a zoning permit application which the town rejected. The town referred the intervenors to the ZB A where they filed for a variance, which was granted. The Tabers appealed the ZBA\u2019s ruling to the superior court. The court found that the ZBA had applied a \u201clegal fiction\u201d in order to avoid the \u201cunnecessary hardship\u201d factor that must be met by a party seeking a variance. <em>See Grey Rocks Land Trust v. Town of Hebron, </em>136 N.H. 239, 242, 614 A.2d 1048, 1049-50 (1992). The court granted the Tabers\u2019 request for attorney\u2019s fees against the town and ordered the intervenors to remove the porch of the new structure, which was the only feature that was not superimposed on the same footing as the old garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">\n<em>I. Attorney\u2019s Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">\u201cAn award of attorney\u2019s fees . . . must be grounded upon statutory authorization, an agreement between the parties, or an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>established exception to the rule that each party is responsible for paying his or her own counsel fees.\u201d <em>DePalantino v. </em>DePalantino, 139 N.H. 522, 525, 658 A.2d 1207, 1210 (1995) (quotation omitted). The trial court rested its decision to award attorney\u2019s fees on two judicially created exceptions to the American rule that each party must pay his or her own attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See Leavitt v. </em>Hamelin, 126 N.H. 670, 671, 495 A.2d 1286, 1287 (1985). First, the court reasoned that the Tabers had conferred a substantial benefit on nonparties such as the citizens and taxpayers of the State by forcing the town and the ZBA to adhere to the correct formulation of the law. <em>See Irwin Marine, Inc. v. Blizzard, Inc., </em>126 N.H. 271, 277, 490 A.2d 786, 791 (1985). Second, the court concluded that by softening the legal standard for unnecessary hardship created by this court, the ZBA ignored the proper legal standard and forced the Tabers \u201cto seek judicial assistance to secure a clearly defined right which should have been freely enjoyed without such intervention.\u201d <em>See Indian Head National Bank v. Corey, </em>129 N.H. 83, 87, 523 A.2d 70, 72 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-3\">When reviewing a trial court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees, we will uphold the court\u2019s factual findings unless they are erroneous as a matter of law or unsupported by the evidence. <em>Dumont v. Town of Wolfeboro, </em>137 N.H. 1, 10, 622 A.2d 1238, 1244 (1993). We conclude that the trial court\u2019s first ground for awarding attorney\u2019s fees is erroneous as a matter of law. We have never held that forcing the losing party to a strict adherence to the law is a sufficient benefit conferred on nonparties to justify awarding attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party. <em>Cf. Dugas v. Town of Conway, </em>125 N.H. 175, 183, 480 A.2d 71, 76 (1984) (distinguishing unconstitutional abuse of power from mere \u201cerroneous application of a valid zoning regulation or some arcane procedural error\u201d for purposes of awarding attorney\u2019s fees). If adherence to the law were sufficient benefit conferred on nonparties, then any time a town sought to support its agencies and lost, the prevailing party should recover attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Cf. Smith v. Town of Wolfeboro, </em>136 N.H. 337, 347, 615 A.2d 1252, 1258 (1992) (affirming trial court\u2019s denial of attorney\u2019s fees despite finding that planning board made mistaken decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\"><em>Irwin Marine, Inc. v. Blizzard, Inc., supra, </em>and <em>Board of Water Commissioners, Laconia Water Works v. Mooney, </em>139 N.H. 621, 660 A.2d 1121 (1995), provide the strongest support for the Tabers\u2019 position that conferring benefit on taxpayers and citizens is sufficient to award attorney\u2019s fees. Both cases, however, are distinguishable from the Tabers\u2019 law suit. In <em>Irwin Marine, </em>other bidders who participated in a public auction were directly harmed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>city\u2019s unfair public bidding procedures. <em>Irwin Marine, </em>126 N.H. at 276, 490 A.2d at 790. Invalidating the sale put all bidders \u201con an equal footing\u201d to compete in a future sale of the property. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Mooney, </em>the board of water commissioners assessed on all new users of the water system a system development charge, which we held to be illegal. <em>Mooney, </em>139 N.H. at 623, 626, 660 A.2d at 1123, 1125. Not only was the defendant in that case injured but so were all new users of the water system. Both <em>Irwin Marine </em>and <em>Mooney, </em>therefore, present much more concrete benefits conferred on third parties by the lawsuit than the general benefit that citizens and taxpayers receive when the town adheres strictly to the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-3\">Moreover, the public trust cases cited by the Tabers to support their argument that they should be awarded attorney\u2019s fees for benefiting the citizens and taxpayers of the State are inapposite. <em>E.g., Silva v. Botsch, </em>121 N.H. 1041, 1043, 437 A.2d 313, 314 (1981). In <em>Silva, </em>a public official was awarded attorney\u2019s fees for successfully defending his illegal removal. <em>Id. </em>at 1042, 437 A.2d at 315. We reasoned that a town official \u201cis elected by his fellow citizens to administer the affairs of the municipality\u201d and hence assumes \u201ca special position as a public trustee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1043, 437 A.2d at 314. By successfully retaining his position, the official has conferred a substantial benefit on the citizens as a whole. <em>Id. </em>The Tabers hold no similar position as public trustee to enforce the zoning laws. Moreover, their primary purpose in litigating the case is for their own personal benefit. <em>Cf. In re Dumaine, 135 </em>N.H. 103, 110, 600 A.2d 127, 132 (1991) (noting that on the issue of awarding attorney\u2019s fees to a trustee, \u201c[t]he inquiry is whether her primary motive was the benefit of the trusts as a whole or her own benefit\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">The second ground on which the trial court based its decision to award attorney\u2019s fees is not supported by the facts. Where a party is forced to seek judicial assistance to secure a clearly defined right, a court may award attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party if bad faith on the part of the losing party is established. <em>See Keenan v. Fearon, </em>130 N.H. 494, 501-02, 543 A.2d 1379, 1383-84 (1988). For purposes of awarding attorney\u2019s fees in this case, the issue is not whether the ZBA improperly granted the variance, but rather whether the town exercised bad faith in the defense of the ZBA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">When interpreting a zoning ordinance and determining the appropriateness of a variance, the ZBA is acting in a quasi-judicial capacity. <em>See Piecuch v. Manchester, </em>114 N.H. 8, 9-10, 314 A.2d 642, 643 (1974); <em>Supry v. Bolduc, </em>112 N.H. 274, 275-76, 293 A.2d 767, 769 (1972). When a body exercises a quasi-judicial function in rendering a decision, a court may not award attorney\u2019s fees, unless that body <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>is acting outside of its jurisdiction. <em>See Gould v. Director, N.H. Div. of Motor Vehicles, </em>138 N.H. 343, 346-47, 639 A.2d 254, 257-58 (1994). Nor may a party recover attorney\u2019s fees from the governmental employer for the bad faith actions of an official with immunity. <em>State v. Dexter, </em>136 N.H. 669, 672-73, 621 A.2d 435, 437 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Since the ZBA, in the case at hand, was acting in a quasi-judicial capacity, and is not alleged to have acted outside its jurisdiction, the Tabers could not have recovered attorney\u2019s fees had they sued the ZBA directly. <em>Cf. </em>RSA 677:15, V (1986). We hold that when a town is simply defending the actions of a body acting in a quasi-judicial capacity, there are no grounds for awarding attorney\u2019s fees, <em>cf. Dexter, </em>136 N.H. at 672-73, 621 A.2d at 437, even if the town subjectively believed that the position of the quasi-judicial body was legally incorrect. <em>See Treisman v. Town of Bedford, </em>135 N.H. 573, 575, 607 A.2d 950, 951 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">This is not to say that a court may never award attorney\u2019s fees against a town, defending the ZBA. If the ZBA acts outside the scope of its jurisdiction or is not acting in a quasi-judicial capacity, the town, acting in bad faith, may be subject to an award of attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See Gould, </em>138 N.H. at 346-47, 639 A.2d at 257-58. Additionally, if the town causes unnecessary delay or uses tactics such as excessive discovery to run up its opponent\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees while defending the ZBA, that type of bad faith could warrant the award of attorney\u2019s fees. <em>See Keenan, </em>130 N.H. at 502, 543 A.2d at 1383-84. Because the Tabers failed to demonstrate that the town did anything other than defend the position of its ZBA, we reverse the award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">\n<em>II. Cross-appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">The Tabers argue that if we reverse the grant of attorney\u2019s fees we should also remand the case with instructions to order the removal of all offending structures within the setback. The Tabers cite no authority for the proposition that a trial court <em>must </em>order the removal of improvements that violate zoning provisions, contending only that a court <em>may </em>do so. We have held that \u201c[w]hether <em>an </em>injunction is appropriate is within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Voedisch v. Town of Wolfeboro, </em>136 N.H. 91, 93, 612 A.2d 902, 904 (1992). In deciding whether to grant equitable relief \u201cthe court may consider a wide range of circumstances and equitable procedures.\u201d <em>Assoc. Home Util\u2019s, Inc. v. Town of Bedford, </em>120 N.H. 812, 816, 424 A.2d 186, 189 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">We cannot say that the trial court\u2019s order to remove only the porch, which was the only portion of the new building that was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>superimposed on the old structure, was an abuse of discretion. <em>See Frost v. Polhamus, </em>110 N.H. 491, 494, 272 A.2d 596, 597-98 (1970). We, therefore, affirm the trial court\u2019s order regarding the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-3\">\n<em>Affirmed in part; reversed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"A0S\">BRODERICK, J., did not sit; the others concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
