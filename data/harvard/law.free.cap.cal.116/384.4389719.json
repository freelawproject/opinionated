The facts above set forth are insufficient to establish the plea of once in jeopardy upon the second trial. When this case went back to the trial court <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wickham, </em>113 Cal. 283), if that court, upon good cause shown, had denied the motion to dismiss the prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>tion, and had proceeded to again try the defendant upon the same information, certainly no jeopardy in his favor would have existed to bar a second conviction; and the fact that the prosecution was dismissed, rather than proceeded with, does not alter the case. In all essentials, <em>People </em>v. <em>Schmidt, </em>64 Cal. 260, covers the present case, and, upon the legal principles there declared, defendant\u2019s contention in this respect is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">2. It is claimed that the court erred in rendering judgment that defendant be imprisoned in the state prison, it appearing from the verdict of the jury that the value of the property embezzled was only forty dollars. This contention involves the construction to be given section 514 of the Penal Code, which provides: \u201c Every person guilty of embezzlement is punishable in the manner prescribed for feloniously stealing property of the value of that embezzled.\u2019\u2019 This section has been construed in <em>People </em>v. <em>Leehey </em>(Cal., Sept. 13, 1879), 4 Pac. Coast L. J. 75, and also in <em>People </em>v. <em>Salorse, </em>62 Cal. 139; and, upon the authority of those cases, we hold that the defendant has been convicted of a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">For the foregoing reasons the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">Harrison, J., and Van Fleet, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
