As the agreement merely bound the defendant to \u201ctake the number of shares set opposite\u201d his name, and contained no promise to pay on demand, a \u201ccall\u201d or \u201cassessment\u201d was necessary in order to render the defendant liable. (1 Thompson on Corporations, sec. 1185; 2 Thompson on Corporations, secs. 1702, 1824; 1 Cook on Stocks and Stockholders, secs. 104-07,120; 23 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 804.) The complaint shows that only about one-ninth of the stock had been taken, and therefore no action could be maintained for the collection of an assessment thereon, as at least one-fourth of the stock must be first subscribed for in this state. (Civ. Code, sec. 331; <em>San Bernardino etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Merrill, </em>108 Cal. 492; <em>Santa Cruz R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Spreckels, </em>65 Cal. 194.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b293-3\"><em>Barnes &amp; Selby, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-4\">A subscription for shares of stock of a corporation implies a promise to pay for them, and this promise sustains an action to collect. (1 Cook on Stocks and Stockholders, 71, 121; Angel\u00ed and Ames on Corporations, secs. 517-19; <em>Baines </em>v. <em>Babcock, </em>95 Cal. 581, 590; 29 Am. St. Rep. 158; <em>Kohler </em>v. <em>Agassiz, </em>99 Cal. 17.) The signing of the agreement constituted a \u201cpromise to pay,\u201d and where no time is fixed for payment, money owing is payable on demand. (5 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 527; <em>Sweetland </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>4 Mont. 217.) It was not necessary to levy an assessment. ( <em>California etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Callender, </em>94 Cal. 127; 28 Am. St. Rep. 99; Angell and Ames on Corporations, secs. 19, 518.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b293-5\">Harrison, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEl\">The Ventura <em>&amp; </em>Ojai Valley Railway Company was incorporated under the laws of this state April 21, 1892. Its capital stock, as provided in its articles of incorporation, was $250,000, divided into 2,500 shares of $100 each. Of this amount only 260 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>shares were subscribed at the commencement of this action. Prior to its incorporation a preliminary agreement therefor had been entered into between several individuals, which was to become operative in the event that $20,000 should be subscribed to its capital stock. This amount having been subscribed, the necessary-steps for its incorporation were taken, and subsequently thereto the defendant, with others, subscribed the following agreement, which appears to have been annexed to the original subscription paper:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-4\">\u201cWhereas, under and pursuant to the foregoing agreement and subscription there was incorporated the Ventura <em>&amp; </em>Ojai Valley Railway Company, to the capital stock of which there was subscribed the amounts above named by the parties named respectively.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">\u201cNow, therefore, we, the undersigned, subscribe and agree to take the number of shares set opposite our names respectively, and thereon pay the amount in cash named, to wit, ten per cent of the amount of stock by us subscribed, to A. Bernheim, treasurer of such corporation:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">\u201cSUBSCRIBERS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">STOCK</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\">SUBSCRIBED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-9\">AMOUNT OF CASH.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-10\">\u201cF. Hartman. $2,000. $200. Pd.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">Of the amount thus subscribed by the defendant, he paid to the plaintiff two installments of $200 each. It is alleged in the complaint that the plaintiff had incurred certain obligations in building its road above the amount received by it from its stockholders, and that to provide funds to meet the same, it had demanded from each of its stockholders an additional payment of forty per cent of the amount of their several subscriptions respectively; and that on or about the sixth day of June, 1895, it demanded from the defendant the payment of the sum of $800, being said forty per cent of the amount of the capital stock for which he had subscribed, and that the defendant had refused to pay the same. The present action was brought to recover this amount. The defendant demurred to the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>plaint, and, his demurrer having been overruled, judgment was entered against him for the amount demanded by the plaintiff, from which he has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\">The right of the plaintiff to a recovery from the defendant depends solely upon the terms of the agreement of subscription made by him. Aside from the absence of all averments in the complaint of a compliance by the plaintiff with the statutory requirements for an assessment, it affirmatively appears therefrom that the plaintiff had no authority to levy an assessment upon its capital stock. Section 331 of the Civil Code gives authority to a corporation to levy such assessment only when one-fourth of its capital stock has been subscribed, and it is alleged that only 260 out of 2,500 shares of its capital stock had been subscribed. (See <em>San Bernardino etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Merrill, </em>108 Cal. 490.)</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">That a subscriber to the capital stock of a corporation may by the terms of his subscription vary his liability from that which exists merely by virtue of the statute, has been frequently decided in this state. ( <em>West </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>80 Cal. 19; <em>Marysville Electric Light etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>93 Cal. 538; 27 Am. St. Rep. 215), but, as in the case of all other obligations arising from contract, the liability of the subscriber in such cases is measured by the terms of his agreement. As a copy of the subscription agreement which the defendant signed is annexed to the complaint, the averment in the complaint that he thereby agreed to pay his subscription \u201cwhen and as it might be demanded by said plaintiff,\u201d not being contained therein, must be disregarded, and the liability of the defendant is to be determined by a construction of the language used in the agreement. The agreement to \u201csubscribe and take\u201d the shares set opposite his name bound him as a stockholder in the corporation, but not to pay for the stock otherwise than as assessments therefor might be legally made. (Cook on Stocks and Stockholders, sec. 105.) The further agreement: \u201cand thereon pay the amount in cash named, to wit, ten per cent of the amount of stock by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>us subscribed, to A. Bernheim, treasurer of said corporation,\u201d is shown by the complaint to have been complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">As the defendant\u2019s liability to the plaintiff in the present action is based upon the terms of his agreement, the plaintiff\u2019s right to enforce the agreement was not affected by the indebtedness it had incurred in constructing the road, and the averments thereof in the complaint are immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">The court should have sustained the demurrer to the complaint, on the ground that no cause of action is alleged against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">The judgment is reversed, and the superior court is directed to sustain the demurrer to the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Temple, J., McFarland, J., Van Fleet, J., Garoutte, J., and Henshaw, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
