To ascertain what acts constitute the crime against nature the unwritten or common law must be appealed to. <em>(Fennell </em>v. <em>State, supra; Frazier </em>v. <em>State, supra; Ex parte Bergen, </em>14 Tex. App. 52; <em>Cross </em>v. <em>State, </em>17 Tex. App. 476; <em>Hillhouse </em>v. <em>Chester, </em>3 Day (Conn.), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>211.) The acts proven in this state do not constitute the crime against nature under the common law. <em>(Prindle </em>v. <em>State, </em>31 Tex. Crim. Rep. 551; 37 Am. St. Rep. 833; 1 Russell on Crimes, 698; Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary; Bishop\u2019s Criminal Law, 1194; 1 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law, 579.) The term \u201c infamous crime\u201d as used in the statute has been confined to its legal sense. <em>(Rex </em>v. <em>Heckman, </em>1 Moody, 34; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shaver, </em>3 Watts &amp; S. 338; Bishop on Statutory Crimes, sec. 242; 2 Bishop on Criminal Law, sec. 118.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b691-5\"><em>Attorney General W.

He appeals from the judgment and order denying his motion for a new trial. The facts of the case do not make out the offense of which the defendant has been convicted. It has been so held in at least two cases. (See <em>Prindle </em>v. <em>State, </em>31 Tex. Crim. Rep. 551; 37 Am. St. Rep. 833; 1 Wharton on Criminal Law, sec. 575.)</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">Judgment and order reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
