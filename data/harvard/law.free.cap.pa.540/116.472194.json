If we determine that appellant was not a \u201cperson responsible for the child\u2019s welfare,\u201d we must reinstate the trial court\u2019s order dismissing the criminal charges. We hold that appellant can in fact be described as a \u201cperson responsible for the child\u2019s welfare\u201d within the context of 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5554(3). The events at issue occurred on or about May 1,1984, through December of 1987. During this period, appellant provided baby-sitting services for the two minor children (the victim and her sister) of a friend, whom he had met through their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>mutual participation in an Alcoholics Anonymous program. Appellant baby-sat for the children in his own home \u201csometimes once a week, sometimes less, sometimes more.\u201d When appellant cared for the children, neither their mother nor any other adult was present. Occasionally, the children would remain overnight with appellant; sometimes, the mother stayed at appellant\u2019s home with her children after appellant had watched them. However, on most of these occasions the children were alone with appellant. The children looked upon appellant as a Mend of the family, and he was not paid for watching them.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">On September 21, 1992, appellant was charged with one count of Indecent Assault<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and one count of Corruption of Minors.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The prosecution filed a Notification of Commonwealth\u2019s Intention to Proceed Pursuant to the Tolling of Statute of Limitations Provisions under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5554(3). In its Notification, the Commonwealth acknowledged that the criminal complaint, dated on June 4, 1992, was filed after the statute of limitations had run. However, the Commonwealth contended that because the victim was under the age of 18,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and appellant was the paramour of the victim\u2019s parent and/or the person responsible for the victim\u2019s welfare when he watched her, the tolling provisions of 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5554 would apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Appellant filed an Omnibus Pretrial Motion which included a motion to dismiss on the grounds that each charge against him was barred by the applicable statute of limitations. Appellant asserted that because he was not the paramour of the victim\u2019s parent, and was not in any way responsible for the child\u2019s welfare, he was never in an association with the victim sufficient to satisfy the tolling provisions of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">On January 26, 1992, the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County held a hearing on appellant\u2019s motions. At this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>point, the Commonwealth abandoned the argument that appellant was a paramour of the victim\u2019s parent, and pursued only the theory that while baby-sitting, appellant was a person responsible for the victim\u2019s welfare. On February 22, 1993, the trial court concluded that because appellant fulfilled none of the statutory criteria, the tolling provisions of Section 5554(3) did not apply and granted Appellant\u2019s Motion to Dismiss for Violation of Statute of Limitations. On appeal, the Superior Court reversed and remanded for trial, reasoning that because Appellant was in fact a person responsible for the child\u2019s welfare, Section 5554(3) tolled the statute of limitations. <em>Commonwealth v. Gerstner, </em>428 Pa.Super. 337, 630 A.2d 1277 (1993) (Del Sole, J. dissenting). We granted allocatur to determine the proper application of Section 5554(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">After the January hearing on appellant\u2019s status, the trial court made the following factual findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-6\">The charges arose when the victim was approximately seven or eight years old. The [Appellant] was at least 53 years old when this incident occurred in 1984. The [Appellant] is not a familial relative of the victim. The mother of the victim testified that there was no romantic relationship between her and the defendant. She met him in 1983 and they became very good friends. She occasionally used other baby-sitters but during the time they were friends he would baby-sit the children once or twice a week without pay at his home. The mother characterized him as a good friend but not a father figure to her children nor an authority figure authorized to discipline the children in her absence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">(N.T. at 3, Feb. 22, 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">From these facts, the trial court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-9\">Clearly in light of the mother\u2019s testimony, the [Appellant] is not a parent nor, in fact, any relative at all to this child victim. Moreover, the [Appellant] was not a paramour of the mother. She testified that he was simply a friend. She also testified that she and the child victim did not reside with the [Appellant], only that they stayed at his house very briefly. Finally, the [Appellant] was not someone responsi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>ble for the child\u2019s welfare. He was merely a babysitter. The applicable cases stress that the [Appellant] exercises control over the victim and has the advantage of an authority figure that somehow deters the child from reporting the abuse. However, from the testimony of the mother, there wasn\u2019t any kind of emotional pressure on the child not to report the incident in a timely fashion. Accordingly, the Commonwealth is barred from prosecution notwithstanding 42 PACS [sic] Section 5554(3).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><em>(Id. </em>at 4-5).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">In reversing, the Superior Court first discussed <em>Commonwealth v. Bethlehem, </em>391 Pa.Super. 162, 570 A.2d 563 (1989), <em>alloc, denied, </em>525 Pa. 610, 577 A.2d 542 (1990), which involved \u201csexual assaults by the victim\u2019s uncle during periodic visits to the victim\u2019s parent\u2019s home, while the victim\u2019s parents were at home in the next room.\u201d <em>Id., </em>391 Pa.Super. at 167, 570 A.2d at 565. The court found that the legislature did not intend the phrase \u201cperson responsible for the child\u2019s welfare\u201d to apply \u201cto an uncle visiting the victim\u2019s parents\u2019 home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 168, 570 A.2d at 566. Because the parents were present in the next room,, the court reasoned that \u201cit was the parents and not the visiting relative who remained the \u2018person(s) responsible for the child\u2019s welfare\u2019 \u201d within the meaning of Section 5554(3). <em>Id. </em>The court construed the phrase \u201cperson responsible for the child\u2019s welfare\u201d to apply \u201cto persons under whose permanent or temporary custody and control the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) have placed a child----\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The Superior Court then applied Bethlehem\u2019s definition of \u201cperson responsible for the child\u2019s welfare\u201d as \u201cone who has \u2018permanent or temporary custody and control\u2019 of the child\u201d to Appellant and concluded,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-7\">Under the record facts of this case, it is apparent that Gerstner, as babysitter, had temporary custody and control of the child at the time the alleged offenses took place. Hence it cannot be refuted that Gerstner was responsible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>for the child\u2019s welfare, and consequently, the statute of limitation period was tolled by \u00a7 5554(3).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-4\"><em>Gerstner, </em>428 Pa.Super. at 342, 630 A.2d at 1280.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">To support this conclusion, the Superior Court relied upon <em>Commonwealth v. Powers, </em>395 Pa.Super. 231, 577 A.2d 194 (1990). There, a grandfather was convicted of offenses relating to the sexual abuse of his granddaughter while babysitting for her. On appeal to the Superior Court, the grandfather claimed that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to \u201cpursue a pre-trial motion to quash on statute of limitations grounds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 234-235, 577 A.2d at 195. The <em>Powers </em>court concluded that the grandfather was not prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure because, \u201cas an adult babysitter for <em>absent </em>parents, appellant was acting as a \u2018person responsible for the child\u2019s welfare\u2019 within the meaning of the phrase in 42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 5554(3).... \u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">After analyzing both <em>Bethlehem </em>and <em>Powers, </em>the Superior Court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-7\">The same logic is applicable in this case. Gerstner was the child\u2019s babysitter, in <em>his home, </em>on a regular basis. He had temporary custody and control of both children, being responsible for them for hours at a time. This included those occasions when the young girls stayed in his house overnight, under his care, while the <em>mother was absent. </em>This arrangement lasted approximately three years. The trial court minimized these facts. That the child\u2019s mother and Gerstner were not paramours has no bearing on the determination of whether he was responsible for the child\u2019s welfare while babysitting. We conclude that Gerstner was, at the time of the alleged criminal acts, responsible for the child\u2019s welfare. The trial court erred by finding otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-8\"><em>Gerstner, </em>428 Pa.Super. at 343, 630 A.2d at 1280 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">In <em>Bethlehem, </em>the Superior Court equated one responsible for a child\u2019s welfare with one who stands <em>in loco parentis. Bethlehem, </em>391 Pa.Super. at 168, 570 A.2d at 566. In the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number><em>sub judice, </em>the Superior Court treated this comparison as dicta.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Gerstner </em>428 Pa.Super. at 341, 630 A.2d at 1280. However, other than stating that <em>in loco parentis </em>is \u201cused almost exclusively in matters of child custody,\u201d <em>id., </em>the court failed to distinguish the terms. This has resulted in some confusion. Therefore, before addressing the merits of this case, we shall attempt to dispel the confusion surrounding the terms <em>in loco parentis </em>and \u201cperson responsible for the child\u2019s welfare.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">As the Superior Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-6\">The term <em>in loco parentis </em>is not part of 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5554; in fact, it is a specific, technical phrase used almost exclusively in matters of child custody. Had the General Assembly intended to incorporate the term <em>in loco parentis </em>into \u00a7 5554, it would have done so, instead of using the phrase \u201ca person responsible for the child\u2019s welfare.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-7\"><em>Gerstner </em>at 342, 630 A.2d at 1280 (emphasis in original). The term <em>in loco parentis </em>appears in the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes thirty-two times. The General Assembly knew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>the meaning of the term and yet chose not to include it in Section 5554(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\"><em>In loco parentis </em>and \u201cperson responsible for the child\u2019s welfare\u201d are not interchangeable.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\">The phrase \u201cin loco parentis\u201d refers to a person who puts himself in the situation of the lawful parent by assuming the obligations incident to the parental relationship without going through the formality of legal adoption. The status of \u201cin loco parentis\u201d embodies two ideas; first, the assumption of the parental status, and, second, the discharge of parental duties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-6\"><em>Commonwealth ex rel. Morgan v. Smith, </em>429 Pa. 561, 565, 241 A.2d 531, 533 (1968). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines <em>in loco parentis </em>as,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-7\">In the place of the parent; instead of a parent; charged, factitiously, with a parent\u2019s rights, duties, and responsibilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 787 (6th ed. 1990). When courts find an <em>in loco parentis </em>relationship, \u201c[t]he rights and liabilities arising out of the relation are, as the words imply, exactly the same as between parent and child.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Cameron, </em>197 Pa.Super. 403, 407, 179 A.2d 270, 272 (1962). <em>In loco parentis </em>describes a relationship in which one assumes the <em>legal </em>rights and duties of parenthood.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>In contrast, the phrase \u201cperson responsible for the child\u2019s welfare\u201d encompasses a broader array of relationships in which an individual need not have the requisite legal relationship of one <em>in loco parentis </em>to the child. The <em>in loco parentis </em>standard is more stringent and those who stand <em>in loco parentis </em>generally comprise a subset of those responsible for the child\u2019s welfare.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Our conclusion that the <em>Bethlehem </em>court erred in equating a \u201cperson responsible for the child\u2019s welfare\u201d with one who stands <em>in loco parentis, </em>however, in no way changes the substance of the Superior Court\u2019s holding in <em>Bethlehem. </em>In reaching its holding, the <em>Bethlehem </em>court clearly found \u201ca person responsible for the child\u2019s welfare\u201d to be \u201cone who has \u2018permanent or temporary custody and control\u2019 of the child.\u201d It then stated, \u201cin other words, those who stand <em>in loco parentis.\u201d </em>The Superior Court did not, however, find a \u201cperson responsible for the child\u2019s welfare\u201d to be \u201cone who has \u2018permanent or temporary custody and control of the child <em>and </em>who stands <em>in loco parentis </em>to the child.\u201d When it stated \u201cin other words, those who stand <em>in loco parentis </em>\u201d, it was merely citing what it believed to be a synonymous term. The fact that we now* note that this term was, in fact, not synonymous does not remove any element of the definition of \u201cperson responsible for the child\u2019s welfare\u201d given by the <em>Bethlehem </em>court.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the Superior Court applied <em>Bethlehem\u2019s </em>interpretation of a \u201cperson responsible for the child\u2019s welfare\u201d as \u201cone who has \u2018permanent or temporary custody and control\u2019 of the child\u201d to appellant and concluded that he satisfied the definition. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">A baby-sitter is by definition one who is temporarily entrusted with the responsibility of ensuring a child\u2019s safety and caring for its needs (i.e. ensuring its welfare) in the parent\u2019s absence. Such duties place a baby-sitter squarely within the language of Section 5554(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Appellant argues that such an interpretation of Section 5554(3) paints with too broad a brush. Specifically, he asserts that in adopting Section 5554(3), the legislature sought to extend the tolling provision only to those situations in which a child has been abused by one holding such a position in the child\u2019s life as to make it impossible for the child to reveal the abuse. Hence, he contends that the phrase \u201cperson responsible for the child\u2019s welfare\u201d must be interpret\u00e9d to include only those individuals who provide for the maintenance and support of the child and/or occupy a position which would serve to deter an abused child from reporting the harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">We decline to adopt this definition of \u201cperson responsible for the child\u2019s welfare\u201d for two reasons. First, the legislative history surrounding the enactment of Section 5554(3) is silent. Thus, we are unable to conclude that the legislature\u2019s motivation in adopting Section 5554(3) was to refrain from applying the statute of limitations only in those cases in which the perpetrator occupies a position such as would deter reportage of the abuse. On the contrary, in light of our legislature\u2019s recent enactment of 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5552(c)(3), which tolls the statute of limitations for any sexual offense committed against a minor under 18 years of age, regardless of the relationship between the victim and the vietimizer, we find it far more likely that Section 5554(3) was adopted with the intention of restricting application of the statute of limitations in any instance where the victim is too young or too innocent to realize the wrongful nature of the acts performed. We are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>reluctant to deprive these victims of the protection Section 5554(3) provides.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">We, likewise, find Section 5552(c)(3) to be a strong indication that, for the purposes of 5554(3), the legislature did not intend the phrase \u201cperson responsible for the child\u2019s welfare\u201d to be given the restrictive definition employed by the Commonwealth Court in <em>Pennsylvania State Education Association v. Commonwealth, Department of Public Welfare, </em>68 Pa.Cmwlth. 279, 449 A.2d 89 (1982). In <em>Pennsylvania State Education Association, </em>the Commonwealth Court was called upon to interpret the phrase \u201cperson responsible for the child\u2019s welfare\u201d in the context of 11 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2203 (recodified at 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6303), which defines the term \u201cchild abuse\u201d. The Commonwealth Court subsequently held that a teacher was not a \u201cperson responsible for the child\u2019s welfare\u201d on the ground that this phrase referred only to those individuals providing such matters as housing, furnishings, income, clothing, and medical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">We find this definition, however, to be wholly inadequate even if we were to adopt appellant\u2019s position that Section 5554(3) applies only in those situations in which the perpetrator was in a position to deter the reportage of the abuse. While a school teacher may not provide a child\u2019s home environment, such an individual clearly occupies a position of sufficient authority to be able to deter a child from reporting abuse. Thus, <em>Pennsylvania State Education Association </em>is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The second reason we are reluctant to apply the restrictive definition of \u201cperson responsible for the child\u2019s welfare\u201d proposed by appellant is that such an application would render the phrase a virtual nullity since an individual responsible for providing for the maintenance and support of a child and/or occupying such an important position in the child\u2019s life so as to be able to deter the reporting of abuse would almost certainly fall within the three other categories listed by Section 5554(3), namely, a parent, an individual residing in the same home as the child, and a parent\u2019s paramour.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Thus, we hold that for the purposes of Section 5554(3), a \u201cperson responsible for the child\u2019s welfare\u201d includes any individual who is entrusted with custody and control of the child during a parent\u2019s absence. Since, appellant falls within this category the Superior Court was correct in determining that the statute of limitations had not run in this case. The judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">ZAPPALA, J., files a Dissenting Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">MONTEMURO, J., is sitting by designation.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b410-11\">. \u00a7 5554.

The precise language of the <em>Bethlehem </em>opinion was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">We construe the provision to apply to persons under whose permanent or temporary custody and control the parent(s) or legal guardians(s) have placed a child, in other words, those who stand <em>in loco parentis </em>to the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\"><em>Bethlehem </em>at 168, 570 A.2d at 566. We agree with the Superior Court that the portion of this language equating \"one with permanent or temporary custody and control of the child\u201d with one standing <em>in loco parentis </em>was indeed dicta since the issue of what constitutes <em>in loco parentis </em>or whether one who has \"permanent or temporary custody\u201d of a child stands <em>in loco parentis, </em>was not an issue essential to the disposition of the case in <em>Bethlehem.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">We note, however, that the Superior Court\u2019s determination that a \"person responsible for the welfare of a child\u201d was \"one who has permanent or temporary custody and control of the child\u201d was not dicta. The issue presented in <em>Bethlehem </em>was whether the defendant could be deemed a \"person responsible for the child\u2019s welfare\u201d. In order to resolve this issue, it was essential for the court to define that phrase. Thus, the court\u2019s determination that a \"person responsible for the child\u2019s welfare\u201d was \"one who has permanent or temporary custody and control of the child\u201d was not dicta. Nor does the fact that the court ultimately found that the defendant did not fall within this definition render this language dicta since such a determination simply could not have been made without applying this standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b416-9\">. The concept that <em>in loco parentis </em>embodies the legal aspects of parenthood receives further support when one examines its usage in the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes. <em>See </em>18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3206(b) (requiring consent of an adult standing <em>in loco parentis </em>when a parent or guardian is unavailable before a physician may perform an abortion upon a woman under eighteen years of age); 24 Pa.S. \u00a7 13-1327(b)(2) (preserving in the parent or parents, or person or persons <em>in loco parentis </em>to a child the right to choose the education and training for that child); 24 Pa.S. \u00a7 15-1546 (permitting a parent or person <em>in loco parentis </em>to remove child from school for religious instruction); 24 Pa.S. \u00a7 5703 (defining \"parent\u201d as a \"parent of a child enrolled in a nonpublic school or a person standing <em>in loco parentis </em>to such child\u201d under the Parent Reimbursement Act for Nonpublic Education); 50 Pa.S. \u00a7\u00a7 4402, 4403 (authorizing a parent, guardian or individual standing <em>in loco parentis </em>to a child under the age of eighteen to apply for voluntary admission or commission to a facility as defined in the Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act of 1966); 50 Pa.S. \u00a7 7201 (empowering a parent, guardian, or person standing <em>in loco parentis </em>to a child less them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>fourteen years of age to subject that child to examination and treatment under the Mental Health Procedures Act); 51 Pa.S. \u00a7\u00a7 20011, 20047, 20097, 20126, 20155 (permitting guardian or person standing <em>in loco parentis </em>to apply for compensation on behalf of minor children of World War II veterans, Korean Conflict veterans, Vietnam Conflict veterans, and Vietnam Conflict prisoners of war, under the Veterans\u2019 Compensation Act); 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1507 (requiring the signature of a father, mother, guardian, or person <em>in loco parentis </em>to a minor under the age of eighteen on an application for a driver\u2019s license or a learner\u2019s permit); 77 Pa.S. \u00a7 562 (defining children to include step-children, adopted children, and children to whom one stood <em>in loco parentis </em>for purposes of paying compensation under the Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b417-7\">.

To my mind, the majority\u2019s method of construing the phrase \u201cperson responsible for the child\u2019s welfare\u201d is backward. The majority begins with the interpretation developed in the 1989 Superior Court decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Bethlehem, </em>391 Pa.Super. 162, 570 A.2d 563 (1989), alloc. denied, 525 Pa. 610, 577 A.2d 542 (1990), then dismisses a significant segment of that interpretation, and ends by overruling the construction given to the same phrase in the 1982 Commonwealth Court decision in <em>Pennsylvania State Education Association v. Commonwealth, Department of Public Welfare, </em>68 Pa.Cmwlth. 279, 449 A.2d 89 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">In <em>Lock Estate, </em>431 Pa. 251, 263, 244 A.2d 677, 682-83 (1968), we wrote</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-9\">[i]t has been held, and rightly so, that where a decision of the Superior Court construing a statute was never modified by the Supreme Court, the presumption was that when the legislature subsequently enacted a similar statute dealing with the same subject matter, the legislature intended the same construction to be placed on the language of the subsequent statute____ Whether this presumption is derived from an interpretation of the Superior Court as a \u201ccourt of last resort\u201d under the [Statutory Construction Act] [now found at 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922(4) ], or from a common-sense view of the workings of the legislature really makes no difference. The intention of the legislature is obviously to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>adopt the construction placed upon the word ... by the Superior Court. (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">Following this reasoning, it should be presumed that in 1985 when the legislature enacted the statute of limitations tolling provision found at 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5554(3), it intended the same construction to be given to the phrase \u201cperson responsible for the child\u2019s welfare\u201d as had been given by the Commonwealth Court in <em>Pennsylvania State Education Association v. Commonwealth </em>three years earlier. The <em>P.S.E.A </em>case involved construction of the Child Protective Services Law, Act of November 26, 1975, P.L. 438, as amended, particularly the definition of an \u201cabused child\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1\">[a] child under 18 years of age who exhibits evidence of serious physical or mental injury which is not explained by the available medical history as being accidental, sexual abuse, sexual exploitation or serious physical neglect <em>if the injury, abuse or neglect has been caused by the acts or </em>omissions____ (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The similarity in both the subject matter and the language between the Child Protective Services Law and the tolling provision later enacted at 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5554(3) is readily apparent. Indeed, the legislature duplicated not only the phrase in question here, but the entire passage descriptive of the relevant personages: \u201cof the child\u2019s parents or by a person responsible for the child\u2019s welfare, or any individual residing in the same home as the child, or a paramour of the child\u2019s parent.\u201d Proper analysis, then, should <em>begin </em>with the presumption that the legislature intended to adopt the construction of the Commonwealth Court, which had held that \u201cthe clear import\u201d of the language of the Child Protective Services Law was \u201cthat persons responsible for the child\u2019s welfare customarily provide such matters as housing, clothing, furnishings, income and medical care for children in their care.... \u201d 68 Pa.Cmwlth. at 283, 449 A.2d at 92. Finding no indication that the legislature intended that a different construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>apply to the later statute, I believ\u00e9 that proper analysis should likewise end with this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">I also find fault with the reasoning by which the majority truncates the interpretation developed in <em>Commonwealth v. Bethlehem. </em>The court in <em>Bethlehem, </em>faced with the task of explaining the meaning of \u201cperson responsible for the child\u2019s welfare,\u201d \u201cconstrue[d] the provision to apply to persons under whose permanent or temporary control the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) have placed a child, <em>in other words, those who stand in loco parentis to the child.\u201d </em>391 Pa.Super. at 168, 570 A.2d at 566. (Emphasis added.) The majority, in essence, dismisses the emphasized language as dictum, but chooses to retain and follow the rest of the language, \u201cpersons under whose permanent or temporary control the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) have placed a child.\u201d The rest of the \u2019 language, however, is also, strictly speaking, dictum, in that it was not absolutely necessary to the decision in <em>Bethlehem. </em>The defendant in <em>Bethlehem </em>was the uncle of the victim, visiting in the victim\u2019s home with the victim\u2019s parents. Not only was he not \u201cin loco parentis\u201d to the child, but the parents had not even \u201cplaced the child under his permanent or temporary control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The majority finds it significant that the legisl\u00e1ture knew the meaning of the term \u201cin loco parentis\u201d and yet chose not to include it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Having rejected this portion of the <em>Bethlehem </em>analysis, the majority, without explanation, nevertheless elects to accept the remaining (and now less restrictive) interpretation of a \u201cperson responsible for the child\u2019s welfare\u201d as \u201cone who has \u2018permanent or temporary custody and control\u2019 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>child.\u201d It should go without saying, however, that removal of the \u201cin loco parentis\u201d clause from the language borrowed from <em>Bethlehem </em>changes the entire sense of that language, to the extent that it cannot be claimed with any certainty or confidence that the Superior Court panel in <em>Bethlehem </em>would have used the phrase \u201cpermanent or temporary custody and control\u201d without it.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">Stripped of the flawed citations to authority, then, what remains of the majority\u2019s analysis is nothing more than the unsupported assertion that the legislature intended \u201cperson responsible for the child\u2019s welfare\u201d to mean \u201cperson having permanent or temporary custody and control of the child.\u201d This, even though this same language had been construed in a more limited way by the judiciary prior to the legislature\u2019s deliberate repetition of it in the statute presently before the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">For the reasons stated, I would reverse the Order of the Superior Court. Finding the appellant not to be within the class of persons covered by the language of 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5554(3) so as to toll the statute of limitations, I would reinstate the Order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County granting the Motion to Dismiss and discharging the defendant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b421-7\">. The Child Protective Services Law was subsequently codified at 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6301 et seq. The statute now defines the term \"child abuse\u201d rather than \u201cabused child,\u201d but employs virtually the same language. See 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6303.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b422-7\">. The majority neglects to note the citation, following the critical language in <em>Bethlehem, </em>to 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1903(b)., The rule of statutory construction found there states that, \"[gjeneral words shall be construed to take their meanings <em>and be restricted by </em>preceding particular words.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The court in <em>Bethlehem </em>thereby \"explained\u201d its use of the \u201cin loco parentis\u201d comparison by reference to the fact that \"person responsible for the child's welfare\u201d followed the particular word \"parents.\u201d It should be noted that not only does the word \"parents\u201d immediately precede the words \"person responsible for the child's welfare,\u201d the entire phrase appears as one clause which is then set off from the other types of persons identified, i.e., \"any individual residing in the same home as the child\u201d and \"a paramour of the child\u2019s parent.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
