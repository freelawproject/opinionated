It is conceded in the case that the motion to strike out was- not made until after the lap-se of the term,, so that the judgment had become enrolled, and the question presented by this appeal is far from being a, new1 one in this State or elsewhere. The law governing a, case of this character is fully set out in 2 <em>Poe, PI. &amp; Pr., </em>section 392, <em>et seq., </em>where the author says: \u201cIn passing upon applications to strike out judgments when such applications, are made during the same term at which the judgments were entered, our courts usually act liberally; and, upon reasonable proof -of merits, and other equitable circumstances, strike out the judgments and. let the defendant in to be, beard; but where the application to strike out is made by the defendant after the lapse of the term, and when the judgment has consequently become enrolled, much greater s-trictness is- observed. In these cases- the court- acts in the exercise of its <em>quasi </em>equitable powers-, and will take into consideration all the facts and circumstances of the case, nor will the1 judgment be stricken out except upon clear p-roof of fraud, deceit, surprise or irregularities; * * * -and the application must disclose meritorious-, <em>bona fide </em>and substantial defense, for it- is- a necessary principle' of our jurisprudence that- judgments are presumed to have heen made up after careful deliberation, and consequently that they should not lightly be interfered with.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">The same rule is stated by quite a number -of other text writers, and has been applied in this- State in a number of cases. See <em>Pumpian </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>135 Md. 364; <em>Foxwell </em>v. <em>Foxwell, </em>122 Md. 263; <em>Sunderland </em>v. <em>Braun Packing Co., </em>119 Md. 125; <em>Houston </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>121 Md. 91; <em>McCambridge </em>v. <em>Walraven, </em>88 Md. 378, and <em>Malone </em>v. <em>Topfer, </em>125 Md. 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>The motion to strike out does not appear in full in the record, hut what it must have contained can he determined from: the evidence which was produced at the hearing of the motion. There is certainly in none of this, any thing to warrant the idea that the obtention of tbe judgment was obtained by fraud or deceit. Thus the defendant in the original suit testified to the service of summons which was, handed to him to' read, in which he is corroborated by tbe deputy sheriff who served the summons and then it was thereafter handed to his father-in-law, a justice of the peace of Allegany County, who again read it. Mo irregularity appears to- have -taken place in the case, nor was there any affidavit accompanying the motion to the effect that the defendant in the original proceeding had a good and meritorious defense. The most upon which it could have been based was tbe theory of surprise, as that can be deduced from, the answer\u2019 of the appellant on direct examination, when the appellant testified: \u201cThen I goes home that evening and my father-in-law told me to \u2019tend to- it and I called up Mr. Whiting and I could not get him and I tried to get him again and I could not get him,, then I got him at the house and I asked Mr. Whiting what the trouble was and he asked me whether I was in any automobile accident and I said, \u2018Mo, I wasn\u2019t in any automobile accident,\u2019 and then he asked m\u00a9 was I some time ago and I said I was not the man because-1 wasn\u2019t in no- accident. Mr. Whiting said, \u2018if you are not the man, all right then.\u2019 After that I left everything go. He left me under the impression that he was going to attend to it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">As -opposed to this was the positive identification of the appellant when on the witness stand as the individual who had caused the accident which gave rise to the original action ; furthermore, the witness is not borne out by the version of the telephone conversation given by Mr. Whiting, and the most that the appellant really says is that he was \u201cunder an impression.\u201d The judgment by default entered against him was therefore clearly owing to his own neglect in following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>the matter up after the telephone conversation with Mr. Whiting, and his failure to do as his father-in-law had advised when he told the appellant \u201cto \u2019tend to it.\u201d This is far removed from what might he included under the expression \u201csurprise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">In this condition of the case the Circuit Court for Allegany County was clearly correct in overruling the motion, and the judgment will accordingly he affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, the appellant to pay the costs above and below.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
