The declaration contained six of the common counts and one sp.ecial.count. To the special count the defendant pleaded: ,First \u201cThat the alleged cause.of action did not accrue within three years before the institution of this suit.\u201d Second: \u201cThat the loss or damage complained of in the plaintiff\u2019s declaration occurred prior to the dates on which the shipment in question should.have been delivered by the defendant, and that this suit was not instituted within two years and one day after a reasonable time for delivery had elapsed, as is required by the terms of the published classifications and tariffs .o-f .the common carriers who transported said shipment and under which classifications and tariffs said, shipment moved and that said classifications and tariffs were legally published and filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission, and were effective at the time the said shipment was made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">A demurrer filed to these pleas was sustained as to the first, but overruled- as to the second, and upon the plaintiff declining to reply to the second plea, a judgment was entered against it for defendant\u2019s costs. It was from that judgment the appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">The only fact that distinguishes this case from the case of the <em>Acme-Evans Company </em>v. <em>Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, </em>argued with it at the October Term of this Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number><em>(ante, </em>p. 658) is that in the latter ease the bill of lading did not contain the limitation clause in the tariffs filed with the commission; while in this case, such limitation clause was inserted in the bill of lading issued to the appellant by the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">This fact, however, does not, we think, materially affect or change the liability of the parties, and as the questions presented in this case are the same as those presented in the case above referred to, the views we expressed in that case are controlling in this, and, therefore, the judgment appealed from will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
