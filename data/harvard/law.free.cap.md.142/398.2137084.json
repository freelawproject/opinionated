Exeter Street, in said City of Baltimore, had the light to1 sell and deliver on Sunday, his bread so manufactured and this fact, the defendant makes known to the court, in this his special plea, and which fact, the defendant says relieves him from all liability under the terms of the indictment, in this case filed against him, by reason of the-act heretofore referred to. to wit, the Act of 1920, chapter 700, which among other things provides, \u201cNo person in this State shall sell, dispose of, barter or deal in, or give away any articles merchandise on Sunday, except retailers, who may sell and deliver on said day, tobacco, cigars * * * bread, etc.\u201d Wherefore your defendant prays judgment for'him by reason of this his special plea, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The State demurred to the special plea, and its demurrer was sustained. The traverser thereupon, upon trial before a jury, pleaded not guilty. He was convicted and sentenced to pay a fine of twenty dollars and costs. From this judgment he has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The objection that the special plea was not a proper answer and defense to the indictment and was a defective plea, we think, was properly sustained by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">The facts set forth in the plea do not answer the charge in the indictment nor in the third- and fourth counts thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">The plea in substance alleges, that the traverser on the day named in the indictment, was \u201ca manufacturer of bread and was also a retailer and still is, and retailed his bread, as well as wholesaling the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Tlie exception set out in the statute, it is clear, applies to and exempts only retailers and not wholesale dealers. Retailers may, in the language of the statute, sell, and deliver on Sunday, milk, bread and the other articles of merchandise specially named in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The third and fourth counts of tlie indictment, and the ones to which the. special plea, was filed, charged that the traverser, \u201c'unlawfully did sell certain goods, and merchandise, to wit: ten loaves of bread,\u201d to one David Bernstein and that he the traverser, naming him, not being then and there a retailer selling and delivering the said bread, on the clay named.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">It appears, therefore, that the distinct charge, set out in the third and fourth counts of the indictment, was that the traverser was not on the clay of the alleged sale of the bread, here in question, a retailer selling and delivering bread, as permitted by section 437, chapter 700, of the Acts of 1920, and it is plain that the plea, in the form in which it was tendered was a bad and defective plea, and was no sufficient answer to the allegations of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">In <em>Keller </em>v. <em>State, </em>122 Md. 677, 689, a somewhat similar state of pleadings was presented and the Court held the special pleas did not answer the indictment and were defective. See <em>Lake </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>84 Md. 608; <em>Moses </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>91 Md. 50; <em>Willing </em>v. <em>Bozman, </em>52 Md. 44; <em>Gott </em>v. <em>State, </em>44 Md. 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>89 Md. 388, this Court held that pleas of this kind were not only bad and defective, for the reason we have stated, but were open to the further objection that they amounted to the general issue, and were bad for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">The traverser, therefore, was in no aspect of this case injured by the court\u2019s action upon the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">There is no merit in the exception, set out in the record, and taken to the action of the court, in overruling: an objection to the question, asked the traverser on cross-examination, \u201cRow, for how much do you sell the pound loaves?\u201d The answer was that for a pound loaf he got. eight cents. This mling of the court forms the first and only exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>The traverser was a witness in his own behalf and was subject to cross-examination as other witnesses and to give evidence against himself as to all matters within the scope of proper cross-examination, pertaining to the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The price, at which the traverser sold pound loaves, reflected upon the issue, as to whether the sale of the bread, charged in the indictment, was made at retail or wholesale. The question objected to was proper on cross-examination, and the evidence sought to be elicited was pertinent and admissible, and there was no reversible error in requiring the witness to answer the question. <em>Roddy </em>v. <em>Finnegan, </em>43 Md. 502; <em>Guy </em>v. <em>State, </em>90 Md. 32; <em>Encyc. of Pleading and Practice, </em>147.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Finding no error in the rulings of the court, and as the case was properly submitted to the jury, the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
