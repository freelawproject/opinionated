There is one porch on the first floor and another\u2019 porch on the second floor. The porch leads- out from, the back bedroom by a door, and there is also a window leading on the porch. There is no- steps down stairs from the porch; there is no- stairway fro-m, the porch to the street or yard; the porch is private so far as the apartment is concerned. There is only one entrance to the porch, ,and that is the back bedroom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">It was further testified that the porch is covered by a roof; it has- rainspouting and there is a rail about three feet, high that runs- around the porch; that clothes lines run from- the post of th\u00a9 porch to\u00a1 the wall of the building; that the porch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>was used for wash basins, litter, and clothes were hung out there; that the porch cannot he reached from either adjoining house and does not adjoin any other porch; that the dimensions of the porch are 21 feet by 5, and it is approximately 2'0\"feet from the ground, and 12 or lo feet from the porch on the first floor; that there are no1 standards or poles from the porch on the first floor to the post of the floor of the second; that the yard immediately surrounding the dwelling is not enclosed by a fence; that there is noi way to reach that porch from the ground; that the only propel\u201d way to- connect up with the porch is through the apartment; that the coat which was lost was hanging on the clothes line stretched across the porch atove referred to; that the only way to get the coat off the porch was for some one to have either climbed up1 from the ground or put a stick up there .and gotten it. There was other testimony hearing on the question of whether the coat was stolen from the poreh or whether it might have fallen or been blown off.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">There are two questions raised by this appeal, viz.: (1) Was the coat, alleged to have been stolen, in a place covered by the terms of the policy? (2) Was there any evidence that the coat was stolen ?</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">The court refused to&gt; take the case from the jury at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">At the close of all the testimony defendant offered eleven prayers, of which only the first and fourth need he considered. Both of them were refused. The other prayers bear on the question of proof of larceny with which question we shall not have to deal. The first and fourth prayers were as follows :</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\"><em>First Prayer. </em>\u2014 Defendant prays the court to instruct the jury that the plaintiff has introduced no evidence legally sufficient to entitle him to recover, and that their verdict must, therefore, he for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\"><em>Fourth Prayer. </em>\u2014 Defendant prays the court to instruct the jury that the policy issued by the defendant covered articles while contained within the interior of the second-floor apart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>ment described therein, and that loss while the goods were in any other place whatsoever, whether feloniously taken or not, does not come within the terms of the policy, and the verdict of the jury must he for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The first prayer- was had in form when offered at the close of the case, and there was no error in refusing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The fourth prayer should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">It seems to ns that the- reason for the express restriction of the risk incurred by the policy to goods contained in the interior of the apartment is obvious, and that the Word \u201cinterior\u201d should be given a common sense meaning|. The mere fact that no exterior entrance to the porch is provided has no hearing, when the purpose o-f the restriction is considered. If it did, then a porch of the same character on the first floor should he considered as the interior of the first floor apartment. In the latter case a thief could more easily step over the rail; but it is a matter1 of no serious difficulty to climb up to the second floor or to reach up with a pole. It- is just such a risk that the terms of the policy excludes.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">The only ease cited by either side that seems to be in point is <em>Driver </em>v. <em>State </em>(Alabama), 89 So. 897, cited by appellant. This was an indictment for theft of seed corn under section 7324 of the Code of 1907: \u201cAny person who commits larceny <em>from </em>or <em>in </em>any dwelling house, store house, smoke house, etc., on conviction must be imprisoned in the penitentiary not less than three nor more than six years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">The law as it stood prior to\u00a1 that time omitted the word <em>\u201cfrom.\u201d </em>In the case cited the- court referred to the earlier case of <em>Henry </em>v. <em>State, </em>39 Ala. 680, in which it was held that the taking of goods from the banister or rail of the porch attached to the dwelling house would not come under the earlier statute, and that such taking was not a taking <em>\u201cin\u201d </em>the dwelling house. The word \u201cfrom\u201d was incorporated in the later act to meet the decision in the <em>Henry case. </em>The court added: \u201cOur understanding, however, of the holding in the <em>Henry case </em>is that the court merely held that, while the porch may have in some sense been a part of the house, it was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>(under section 3170) m the dwelling house in such a sense as that a felonious taking therefrom would constitute a taking m the dwelling house. A taking <em>from </em>the dwelling house is very different from the talcing <em>in </em>the dwelling house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\"><em>Chase </em>v. <em>Hamilton Ins. Co., </em>20 N. Y. 52, cited hy appellee, merely decides that the word dwelling house is to be construed as including the kitchen, although the subject of the risk is described in the application .as a stone dwelling house, and the kitchen attached is a wooden kitchen.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\"><em>Downer </em>v. <em>State, </em>10 Ga. App. 827, and <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>State, </em>2 Ga. App. 405, also cited by appellee, decide practically the same point as was decided in the Alabama case, <em>Driver </em>v. <em>State, supra, </em>viz.: that to take from a porch is to take from the dwelling house, as the porch is a part of the dwelling house. Neither of these cases holds that a porch is \u201cthe interior\u201d of a dwelling house.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed without a new trial, with costs to appellant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
