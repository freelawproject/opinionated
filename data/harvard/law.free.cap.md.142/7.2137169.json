Abbott, pay to the appellee, John J. Hibhitts, the sum of $4,371.62, the amount shown by the account of the auditor to he owing to the appellee by the appellant, -as his share of the profits in the construction by theqn as partners of two gun emplacements for the United States Government on the Aberdeen Proving Grounds in the year 1920.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Whether1 said decree or order1 was properly passed depends solely upon the question whether a partnership existed between them in the construction of the emplacements.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">' In 1919, and prior thereto', the .appellant, who' was employed by tire Government as advising superintendent of sewers and water lines, and the appellee, were at worlc at and near the Aberdeen Proving Grounds, and they occasionally met while so engaged in their work, or in going to and returning from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">In December, 1919, the appellee suggested to the appellant that they go in the contracting business if they could raise the money therefor, to which the appellant readily assented.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">Their plan, it seems, was to incorporate a company with a capital stock of $25,000, if they could interest others in its formation. To this end they called upon on\u00a9 or more persons to aid them financially in so doing, but were unsuccessful in their efforts, although they were told, if they were able to obtain good contracts, arrangements could be mad\u00a9 by which they could be financed.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">While the parties were still endeavoring to form the corporation, two gun emplacements were to he constructed by the Government at the proving grounds, and Hibhitts mentioned this fact to Abbott, and Abbott suggested that they file a bid with the Government for the- construction of the emplacements. To- this suggestion the appellee assented, and the hid was thereafter filed and accepted by the Government. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>The hid and contract, however, was not. made and. executed in the name of Abbott and Hibbitts but in the name of G. K. Abbott and Sons..</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">The appellee explains why the: bid was made, and the contract executed, in the name of Gr. B. Abbott and Sons, by saying that although he had received notice from those in authority that the work in which he was engaged would be \u25a0finished on the 38th day of January, he wras at that time (January 2nd) employed by tbe Government, and would be so. employed until the 38th of January, for which reason, as he says, he told Abbott that he thought it best not to have his (Hibbitts\u2019) name appear in the bid or contract, and Abbott said, \u201cAll right,\u201d and the bid was made and tbe contract \u25a0executed by Abbott in the name of G. B. Abbott, and Sons,</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Tbe contract made by tbe Government .for the construction of the emplacements called for unit prices, including so much per yard for excavation, and as stated by Hibbitts, \u201cWe were, at the end of the month, to give our estimate for all the work we had completed. We did not really have to wait until the first of the: month. If we took out one hundred yards of excavation on the 30th of the' month or on the 3.5 th of the month we could get our money per yard, less twenty per cent., for the * * * completed work\u201d; that \u201call equipment was furnished by tbe Government, the concrete mixer, tools, picks and shovels.\u201d The Government furnished everything that was required \u201cwith the exception of stone, cement, hydrate lime and^oundation\u201d and the sand taken out in making the excavation was used in mixing concrete, and, as stated by Hibbitts, very little capital was required to finance the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Hibbitts also testified that the efforts made by them to form a corporation, or to raise the quantity of money above mentioned ($25,000), were made with the view of taking care of large contracts \u201csuch as the construction of iron hangers or exhibition work\u201d; that they made at least three bids on contracts of this class, one .amounting to so much as $90,000. These were made in the name of Abbott and Hibbefts and were made during the progress of the work on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>gum emplacements, but they in each instance failed to obtain the contract, and consequently they were not required to call upon the party that had promised to finance them in the event of their getting the contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">The appellee testified that when the bid for the construction of the emplacements was prepared by Abbott, be brought it to him, who, at the time, was in the tool room of the Aberdeen Proving\u2019 Grounds with Hugh. M&amp;Heal, a young man who attended to the tools. This was on the second of January, 1920. The bid was submitted to. the appellee for his inspection. It contained a charge of $2.25 a yard for excavation. Hibbitts said, \u201cWe will boost that ten cents., making it $2.35 a yard\u201d which was done. \u201cThei concrete I left at. the unit price and all the other was left at ..the unit price. He (Abbott) left and went up to. the administration building .and put in the estimate. I waited at the shop, until he came down and on his return he .says, \u2018Well, we have landed the contract, but I am sorry we did not add on $5,000 more.\u2019 I told bim when he came in, it is just this., never mind, we will go. along and we will make money out of the job'. We have a. good price.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">McHeal was iu the room and heard the alleged conversation between Abbott and Hibbitts, and .testified t-bat Hibbitts told Abbott to raise the price of excavation ten cents per yard, and that at the conclusion of their conversation Abbott \u201ctook the papers and went out of the shop., and when he came back he said to Plibbitts, \u2018We have got the job..\u2019 \u201d When asked what else was said in the conversation he stated that Abbott said \u201cbe was sorry that he did not add $5,000 more to- it,\u201d and in reply thereto Hibbitts said, \u201cWe will lot it. go.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">The bid upon the gun emplacements and the contract executed therefor were made while they were endeavoring to incorporate a company, or at the time they were attempting to obtain assistance in financing contracts of a larger character than the one here involved, and as testified to by Hibbitts, Abbott said to bim that he had worked on gun emplacements and had made about five or six thousand dollars, and that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>could finance the construction of these gun emplacements, \u201cbecause I told, him I had just bought a house outside of the house I was living in for investment, and if he could not, I would raise a mortgage on it. 1 was going to sell it * * * and he said it was not necessary, it will not he required, because we arc' getting our estimates.\u201d By which he meant that they would receive from time to time, as the job progressed, eighty per cent, of the amount, allowed for the completed work.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">ITibbitts also testified that it was agreed between him and Abbott that they should ho equal partners in the transaction, that he was told \u201cover and over\u201d again by Abbott that he was to share in the1 profits,, that Abbott said to bim, \u201cWe will make at least- from $2,500 to $3,500 out. of the job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The appellee further testified that, he started to work on the job February 2nd, 1920, and worked every day thereon until April 26th, when he was taken with a (\u00a1old, on account of which he was required to remain -at home until the, 30th of April, when he again returned to. his work, but found himself unable to work. On the 11th of May he again returned to his work and asked Abbott if he could give him any help, and was told by him that he could not; that Abbott collected all the estimates and deposited the same in the hank in the name of G-. II. Abbott, and Sous,; that after the work had progressed for some time the soil came upon the job to work and, as be testified, was paid, first, thirty, and afterwards, forty dollars per week; that from the time when the son entered upon the job the conduct of Abbott, and bis treatment of Mm, changed, causing' him to suspect Abbott of unfairness and wrong dealings with him, and he asked that the money thereafter received upon the estimates he. deposited in the name of himself and Abbott, but. Abbott refused to do it.' Hibbitfs further testified that he never received any compensation for his labor, that his name wa,s never upon the pay-roll, and that nothing was ever said to him by Abbott in regard to paying him for the work until after the rupture or break between them, when the offer to pay him $600 \u2014 $200 per month for three months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>\u2014was made to- Mm through. Abbott\u2019s attorney; upon one occasion, however, Abbott, after collecting the first estimate, asked him if he needed any money, to which he said, \u201cHo, I can do without ;any money, as we need it in the business,\u201d and Abbott said to him \u201cI feel the same way about it.\u201d Thereafter he was not told by Abbott when the estimates were prepared and the money received thereon, hut on one occasion Abbott called upon him, saying, that he was running short of money, and Hibbitts offered him a note for $2,800. This was between the 5th and 10th of April, the day on which Hibbitts had sold his house. Abbott said it is not necessary \u201cbecause I will get the estimate.\u201d As stated by Hibbitts, Abbott, as he after-wards learned, had .at that time received the estimate of April first, although Abbott said nothing to him about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">It is upon the above stated evidence that Hibbitts contends that a partnership existed between him and the appellant in the construction of the gun emplacements.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">The appellant, on the other hand, contends that a partnership never existed betwen them, because of the failure of the appellee to provide or furnish Ms part of the money to finance the transaction. Abbott testified that not only was the hid made and the contract executed in the name of Gr. B. Abbott and S'ons, but the bond for the proper, performance of the contract was likewise executed by Gr. It. Abbott and Sons, and the premium thereon paid by him. It was admitted, however, by Abbott, notwithstanding these facts, that Hibbitts was to share in the profits if he put up his part of the money necessary to finance the job, and- this he could do after the execution of said contract, while the work was in progress, as shown by .the evidence of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">This admission of Abbott narrows the scope of the inquiry to the single question whether there was an agreement between them by which the putting up of money by Hibbitts to aid in financing the job was a condition precedent to the existence of a partnership between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>When Abbott\u2019s .attention was called to the conversation with Hibbitts, testified to by the latter, at the tool shop on the day of the filing of the hid, he stated that Hibbitts asked him what the bid was and be told him; that he did not recall that the bid was raised ten cents per yard for excavation. He admitted that, after the acceptance of the bid, he returned to Hibbitts\u2019 shop', as stated by both Hibbitts and MeTSTeal, but he denied that he said, \u201cWe have got the job,\u201d saying what he said was, \u201cI have got the job.\u201d He admitted that be had said that he was sorry he did not add more to it, hut he couldn\u2019t remember Hibbitts saying to him that \u201cit is all right, we will make pretty good as it is,\u201d but he could not say that he (Hibbitts) did not say it.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">He further stated that he told Hibbitts that the bid would bo made in the name of G. R. Abbott and Sons and no request was made by Hibbitts that he should file it in any other way, nor was there anything said by Hibbitts as to any embarrassment to him in having his name in the bid or contr act because of \u2019his connection with the Government. Abbott, when upon the stand, testified particularly as to the' money expended by him upon the contract, but made no denial of the statement made by Hibbitts that he told him (Hibbitts) that he had five or six thousand dollars that- he had made on a previous job, and that he would finance the gun emplacements, and that it would not be necessary for Hibbitts to mortgage his house to raise his part of the money required on the job, as they from time to time would receive money upon their estimates, as the work was done.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The job was started on the 2nd of February and the first, payment on the work was received about the 10th of March. At that time Abbott had ordered the material and had done-some excavation.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">When -asked: \u201cDid you pay for them ?\u201d He answered: \u201cPart of them. Q. What did you pay for ? A. I paid some freight on. some stone and paid freight on all stuff that came in. Q. Have you any idea of what the amount was you paid ?' A. About $700 or $800. Q. What other expense? A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>Labor. Q. How much labor? A. About $900. Q. Wbat else bad you spent?' A. Well I bad spent, some for incidentals, money for looking up labor, I suppose $50. Q. Wbat else? A. I do not know as I recall anything else. Q. Sb, the $1,650' was the outside limit, of the money you had to spend before you got your first payment from the Government, that is correct, isn\u2019t it ? A. Yes, as well as I can tell, that is approximate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Hibbitts testified that the first estimate, the only one shown him by Abbott, was for $2,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">Abbott was further .asked: \u201cQ. Did you at any time * * * as testified by Hibbitts, ,say to him, what are yon going to- do-in the event of a loss,, what security -are yon. going to give me ?' A. I -asked Mr. Hibbitts if he was going to give me any security iu the way of putting up- any money. Q. Did he tell you at the time he would give you a note or1 mortgage ? A. Ho, sir; he never told me he would give me a. note. Q. Did he say, \u2018Do you want any legal security or in a legal way ?\u2019 A. Ho-, sir, he had a-house that he was trying, to sell, he always told me, on CSarrollton Avenue, 'and when he sold that he would put that money in. Q-. Did you not tell him, \u2018never mind, we will make a fair profit on this: thing .anyway ?\u2019 A. I don\u2019t remember ever telling him that. Q, Will you say you never said that to him? A. I don\u2019t remember it if I did. Q. Did you never ask Mr. Hibbitts, after\u2019 drawing a requisition on the Governmeuit and receiving pay for it, whether he wanted any of -that money ? A. I believe I did on one occasion \u2014 if he needed any money. Q. Did you during the pendency of this contract tell him that he had no interest, in this contract ?' A. I told him that he- did not have any interest in it unless he put money in it. Q1. When ? A. I think prior to April 26th. When we first got the contract he agpeed then -to put, the money up. I fold him then he could come in on the contract if he put the money in if there was any profit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Abbott admitted that he was asked by ITibbitts to deposit the money he received from the estimates in their joint ae<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>count and not in the name of G. Bi. Abbott and Sons, as he had previously done, and that he (Abbott) refused to do so. lie was then asked, \u201cAnd that was the cause of the disagreement ? A. Well, it had been growing before that; that was when it broke.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The appellant further testified that the amount to be received on the contract for work .and material furnished was $21,500, and that the amount it cost to furnish the work and material was $23,900, leaving only a profit of $600'. Had ITibbitts been permitted to share equally in this profit there would have been owing to him therefrom only three hundred dollars, half of the amount Abbott offered him as compensation for his, labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">The court, however, announced that the question of profits would not be considered by him at that stage of the proceedings, that lie would only consider the question whether the partnership' existed, and if one were held to exist, the case would be inferred to the auditor, that an account might be stated by him,.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">The court, at the conclusion of the whole testimony, reached the conclusion that a partnership did exist, and so decreed by its order of the 13th of May, 1921, and by such order or decree the case was referred to the auditor. The auditor, after hearing testimony, which is not before us, on this appeal, fih'd his account, in which it appears that the .appellee\u2019s share of the profits was $4,371.62. This report and account of the auditor came before the court, and was. finally ratified and confirmed by its order of the 5th of January, 1922, and it is from that decree or order that this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">It is said in 20 <em>R. C. L. </em>36 that \u201cpartnership contracts, like other contracts, are governed by the intention of the parties. Every partnership rests on the mutual consent of the members. This intent may be manifested by the terms of their agreement, the conduct of the parties to each other under it, or by the circumstances generally surrounding the transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>This Court, in <em>Thillman </em>v. <em>Benton, </em>82 Md. 73, said, \u201cWe take it then to he well settled that -a partnership1 is a contract of -some kind involving mutual consent of the parties, and when such a contract is entered into between two or more persons for the purpose of carrying on a trade or business, with the right to participate in the profits of such trade or business, then such a contract constitutes a partnership unless there he other facts or circumstances which show that some other relation existed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">It is conceded by the appellant that, by the agreement between them, the appellee was to be a partner in the transaction and share in the profits, if he put up his part of the money necessary to finance the job, -and the evidence of the appellant warrants the conclusion that he could have done so after the execution of the contract by G-. B-. Abbott and Son, and while the work was in progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">The appellant, who collected and disbursed all monies, alone knew what amount, if any, was required by the appellee in financing the transaction, and, notwithstanding, this fact, it is nowhere shown in the record that -the latter ever called upon the appellee for any specific sum therefor; and nowhere in -the record is it shown that any amount was named or agreed upon by them that should -be paid by the appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">The appellee, who had worked constantly upon the job1 for three months, was never paid therefor, nor was h\u00e9 upon the payroll, although all others who worked thereon, excepting Abbott, were upon it; and during -this whole period the appellant never intimated -to the appellee that he would he compensated for his work otherwise than by receiving -a share of the profits-, and it was not until after the breach or rupture between them, in-the latter part of April, when the work was near completion, that any offer was made the appellee to pay, him for his work. The offer was then made by Abbott, through his attorney, to pay to -appellee $200 per month for three months. At this time, it may reasonably be inferred from the evidence, the appellant had been fully reimbursed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>from, the collections made by him for all monies that he had advanced upon the job.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The provisions of the contract permitting the property of the Government, and the sand taken from the excavations, to be used upon the job without charge therefor, and the payments at short intervals for the work done, made it unnecessary to advance more than a comparatively small amount of money to finance the transaction. It was because of these facts, as stated by the appellee, that the appellant agreed to advance the sum necessary in the progress of the work, Avhen told by the appellee that he had no money to aid in the financing of it, assigning as his reasons therefor that he had recently bought a house as an investment and to raise the money he 'would have to mortgage it.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">This statement of the appellee, which is said by him to have been the agreement between him and the appellant as to how and by whom the job Avias to he financed, is in our opinion supported by the facts and circumstances in the case, including the acts and conduct of the parties to Avhich reference has been made; consequently the court below was, we think, warranted in its conclusion, upon the evidence before it, that a partnership existed between the appellant and appellee in the construction of the gun emplacements, entitling the plaintiff to a share of the profits therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">We will, therefore, affirm the order appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">\n<em>Order affirmed, with costs to the appellee.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
