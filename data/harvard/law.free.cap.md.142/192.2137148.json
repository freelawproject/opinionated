The grounds upon which the relief mentioned was sought by the petitioners, appellees, in this case are practically the same grounds upon which the appellant (one of the appellees in this case) insisted upon a reversal of the judgment in No. 57, and as the questions raised in this appeal were considered and disposed of in No. 57, we must, for the reasons stated in the opinion filed in that case, reverse the decree from which this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-12\">\n<em>Decree reversed with costs, and petition dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
