See United States v Alderman, 22 USCMA 298, 46 CMR 298 (May 26, 1973). It appears that the confinement was suspended and apparently never revoked. Whether a sentence to confinement never actually served because of a satisfied period of probation is subject to constitutional attack as in <em>Alderman </em>need not be answered, for I am satisfied that the evidence of previous conviction did not lead the court-martial to impose a more severe sentence for the larceny and other offenses for which the accused was convicted at this trial. Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Military Review is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b363-15\">Darden, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AmZW\">(concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"b363-16\">I concur in the result for the reasons set forth in my separate opinion in United States v Alderman, 22 USCMA 298, 46 CMR 298 (May 26, 1973).</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b363-18\">Duncan, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AVBa\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b363-19\">Since I believe that the appellant\u2019s previous conviction and sentence to confinement by summary court-martial is constitutionally invalid for the reasons set forth in my separate opinion in United States v Alderman, 22 USCMA 298, 46 CMR 298 (May 26, 1973), I am unable to state that the sentence in this case might not have been different had the military judge known that the prior conviction \u201chad been unconstitutionally obtained.\u201d United States v Tucker, 404 US 443, 448 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-20\">I would return the record of trial to the Judge Advocate General of the Army for submission to the Court of Military Review for redetermination of the sentence without consideration of the evidence of the summary court-martial conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
