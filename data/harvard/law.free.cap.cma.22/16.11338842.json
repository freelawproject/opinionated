Almost every Government witness indicated that the accused\u2019s conduct was completely out of character. Captain Frazier, one of -.the victims, testified that the accused\u2019s action was \u201c180 degrees different from what . . . [he] had ever done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b38-17\">Evidence indicates that the accused had been on \u201cedge\u201d for some time; just before the incident he was \u201cjumping at the slightest noises\u201d and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>apparently \u201call shook up\u201d at taunting remarks by a Specialist Straughn. While his conduct was not regarded as unusual then, it was dramatically different after he \u201cfell flat on his back\u201d and struck his head \u201cvery hard\u201d on a board walkway. Apparently unconscious from the fall, he was carried td bed. In about five minutes, he regained consciousness and movement. His conduct and comments in the next half hour, during which he seized and loaded a M-79 grenade launcher and moved through the area calling persons \u201cgooks,\u201d \u201cdinks,\u201d and \u201cViet Cong imposters,\u201d and threatening to kill them, led several witnesses to conclude that his mind had \u201csnapped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-3\">To some witnesses it appeared that the accused \u201cdidn\u2019t recognize anything\u201d or anyone. A noncommissioned officer, who was the victim of one of the assault charges lodged against the accused, testified that the accused \u201cseemed confused more than anything\u201d and he \u201creally couldn\u2019t tell everything was happening.\u201d On the other hand, the division psychiatrist testified that two days after the episode he had examined the accused. The accused had informed him that he recalled \u201cdrinking quite a bit\u201d before the incident, but he \u201chad no actual memory\u201d of the events that resulted in the charges against him. He further testified that the accused exhibited no symptoms of any \u201cmental or neurological illness\u201d and gave no indication that he had suffered a head injury. His testimony can reasonably be construed as indicating that in his opinion the \u201cmost likely explanation\u201d for the accused\u2019s conduct was that \u201che had had too much alcohol to drink.\u201d Other evidence indicates the accused had been drinking before and after the \u201cred alert.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">By appropriate instructions, the trial judge submitted to the court members the question of the accused\u2019s mental condition as a defense to all the charges. He also instructed them that, as a matter of law, the accused was innocent of some of the assault charges if he had acted in the belief, however erroneous or unreasonable it might be, that the victims were \u201cmembers of the enemy force.\u201d On that issue, he admonished the court members to consider the evidence of intoxication, with the \u201cbasic question\u201d being whether it raised \u201ca reasonable doubt that he knew the identity\u201d of the victims as his superior officers. With one exception, the court members found the accused guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Appellate defense counsel contend that the evidence does not establish the accused\u2019s sanity beyond a reasonable doubt. See United States v Morris, 20 USCMA 446, 449, 43 CMR 286 (1971). They also contend that the sanity question is \u201cclosely akin\u201d to the insufficiency of the evidence \u201cto prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant knew\u201d the military status of the persons whom he assaulted. As explicated in their brief, the blow on the head the accused suffered in his fall made him \u201ctotally irrational.\u201d The same contention was made at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">Within minutes after the weapon was taken from the accused, he was examined by Dr. Pearson, the squadron surgeon. His testimony and that of the division psychiatrist fairly support a conclusion that the accused\u2019s fall did not have any noticeable physical effect upon him. Other testimony, by witnesses patently sympathetic to the. accused, leaves no doubt that, even after the fall, the accused was oriented to persons around him and to the implications of his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">First Sergeant Coffelt testified that he was notified by the Charge of Quarters that the accused was a \u201clittle bit wild.\u201d At the time of the report, the accused had already left his bed and had procured the M-79. Coffelt went to the accused\u2019s area. As he approached, three or four persons ran from the building in which the accused lived; the accused came \u201cright behind them.\u201d He had the \u201c79 in his hands . . . broken open.\u201d Coffelt asked the accused \u201cwhat\u201d he was \u201cdoing,\u201d and enjoined him to \u201cTake it easy.\u201d In response, the accused \u201clocked\u201d the weapon, \u201cpointed it\u201d at Coffelt, and \u201csaid, \u20181st <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Sergeant, get out of here or I'll kill you.\u2019 \u201d As Coffelt took a step forward, the accused repeated his remark. Cof-felt \u201cthrew up . , . [his] hands,\u201d turned, and walked away. Specialist Wile testified that when Warrant Officer Davis came on the scene another officer called out that it was Davis; the accused \u201cturned around and said, \u2018Oh, yeah, Mr, Davis is O. K.\u2019 \u201d Sergeant Dye testified that the accused, armed with the M--79, came up to his \u201chooch\u201d and ordered him and several others \u201cto get inside there and shut up,\u201d Inside he ordered Dye to turn off a light. Dye, who was patently reluctant to testify against the ac-' cused, admitted that the accused addressed .him as \u201csergeant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-3\">When the accused was disarmed, he was immediately taken to the orderly room. Specialist Wile testified that there the accused kept \u201ctrying to tell everybody he was sorry\u201d; that he \u201cdidn\u2019t mean to hurt anybody\u201d; and \u201cthings like this.\u201d Dr. Pearson indicated that when he arrived at the orderly room, the accused knew his name and that when Colonel Molinelli came in somewhat later, the accused remarked: \u201cThere\u2019s the colonel. I\u2019m in trouble.\u201d Similarly, Sergeant Cof-felt testified that the accused \u201cknew\u201d the troop commander, Major Gross, when he entered, and that he asked the major what \u201care they going to do to me.\u201d According to Captain Rosen-thal, he specifically questioned Major Gross as to whether he was \"going to punish\u201d hiffi \u201cfor this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">As appellate defense counsel argued, the accused\u2019s conduct was bizarre. Unusual, even irrational conduct, hpw-eyer, can be attributed to a \u201cnumber of factors\u201d other than mental malf unc-tioning. United States v Lewis, 14 USCMA 79, 82, 33 CMR 291 (1963). Substantial evidence ip this record indicates that the accused\u2019s conduct could have resulted from intoxication or emotional upset at Specialist Straughn\u2019s taunting. We need not decide whether the court-martial concluded that either or both of these factors precipitated the assaults. Suffice it, the record contains ample evidence to support the court\u2019s determination that, at the time of the offenses, the accused was, beyond a reasonable doubt, free of any mental disorder, defect, or derangement, United States v Carey, 11 USCMA 443, 29 CMR 259 (1960). The evidence further supports the court\u2019s finding that the accused knew the military identity of the officers he assaulted,</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">All the assaults of which the accused stands convicted were committed within a brief period of time, Certainly, the offenses are serious, but as one witness testified, the accused could easily have seriously injured all his victims, but he hurt none. The circumstances of the case, both in regard to the accused\u2019s condition and in the continuity of the several acts in the total episode, recall the reminder in United States v Cave, 17 USCMA 153, 156, 37 CMR 417 (1967), that \u201cfrom the standpoint of mitigation, all the wrongs committed by the accused can be regarded as \u2018just one long transaction.\u2019 \u201d At the time of the offenses, the accused was eighteen years of age. Captain Rosen-thal, former executive officer of the accused\u2019s troop and its commander at the time of trial, described the accused as \u201cnormally a softspoken, mild-mannered and well-behaved soldier\u201d whose performance of duty was \u201cexcellent.\u201d This case, therefore, impresses us as one deserving exacting review of the justice of suspension of the punitive discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">The decision of the Court of Military Review is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b40-9\">Chief Judge Darden concurs-</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"APW\">Duncan, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A9\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">Since I am unable to appraise the sufficiency of the evidence as the majority does, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-11\">Paragraph 122a, Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, 1969 (Revised edition), requires that an accused\u2019s sanity be presumed unless sanity becomes a fact issue upon which the Government has the burden to present sufficient evidence. In United States v Papenheim, 19 USCMA 203, 205, 41 CMR 203 (1970), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>\u201cThe test to be applied in determining the sufficiency of the evidence is whether there is, in the record, some competent evidence from which the members of the court-martial were entitled to find beyond a reasonable doubt, the existence of every element of the offense charged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-3\">In evaluation of testimony for sufficiency, a reviewing court should afford the prosecution\u2019s evidence an assumption of truth together with reasonable inferences that can be drawn from it. If so viewed by the court to be sufficient at law, then whether or not there is reasonable doubt is for the fact finders.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">In the case before us the trial judge recognized that the issue of the appellant\u2019s sanity was raised by the evidence and that the Government adduced sufficient evidence properly to make sanity a matter for the members of the court-martial to determine. Although I believe the issue of sanity to have been raised, I do not find that the Government sustained its burden to present sufficient evidence of appellant\u2019s sanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Evidence concerning Bigg\u2019s sanity is composed of opinions, both of lay witnesses and medical doctors, and observations of the conduct of the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">Paragraph 122c, Manual, supra, provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-7\">\u201c. . . Although the testimony of an expert on mental disorders as to his observations and opinion with respect to the mental condition of the accused may be given greater weight than that of a lay witness, a lay witness who is acquainted with the accused and who has observed his behavior may testify as to his observations and may also give such an opinion as to the general mental condition of the accused as may be within the bounds of the common experience and means of observation of men.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">Holding in mind that the testimony of lay witnesses has probative value on the issue of sanity, an examination of the <em>Government\u2019s </em>lay testimony indicative of Biggs\u2019 conduct and opinions regarding Biggs\u2019 sanity follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-12\">\n<em>Specialist Four Keith N. Louis.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-13\">\u201cQ. Did you hear him call anybody a dink or a gook?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-14\">\u201cA. Yes, sir, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-15\">\u201cQ.

How did he look at the things in the hooch, around the hooch?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-18\">\u201cA.

We sat there and talked for a little bit like I started to tell you, about him being scared, and Don and I told him that all that was going to kill him over here was his nerves.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-24\">\u201cQ. By Don, you mean Spec Four Straughn ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-25\">\u201cA. Spec Four Straughn, yes, sir. We told him that all that was going to kill him over here was his nerves, and we told him that he had to calm down and more or less relax, and it wouldn\u2019t bother him so much. And, Don told Tom that he had to calm down and all this, and Tom, <em>something went wrong with him all of a sudden </em>and Tom just started pushing Don.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-26\">\u201cQ. You mean something went wrong with PFC Biggs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-27\">\u201cA. Yes, it did. <em>Something just snapped in his mind the way it seems </em>and he just started pushing Specialist Straughn around, saying he wasn\u2019t going to die, he wasn\u2019t going to die. He pushed him three or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>four times down the hall way in our hootch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-3\">\u201cQ. Was his behavior different after he awoke from hitting his head, than before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-4\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-5\">\u201cQ. Did you say he was pushing Straughn ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-6\">\u201cA. Yeah, it was more or less the same, but more violent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-7\">\u201cQ. Has Biggs ever done anything like this before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-8\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-9\">\u201cQ. Never got violent before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-10\">\u201cA. No, sir, Tom is a quite easy going guy.

Coffelt.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-12\">\u201cA. ... I said, \u2018Take it easy.\u2019 At that time he locked \u2014 loaded the 79 with a HE round and pointed it at me and then said, \u20181st Sergeant, get out of here or I\u2019ll kill you\u2019. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-13\">\u201cQ. After he had been apprehended did you detect any change in his demeanor at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-14\">\u201cA. Yes, sir. I don\u2019t know. He \u2014he was just incoherent, body was completely flushed as if the person had a sunburn and he would go from recognizing and knowing who we was [sic] to calling us all dinks. <em>He didn\u2019t have any idea who we was </em>[sic] <em>back and forth.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-15\">\u201cQ. What was the nature of that conversation [with Major Gross] ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-16\">\u201cA. ... He mentioned this to Major Gross, \u2018What are you going to do to me?\u2019 Major Gross said, \u2018Well, we will have to do something.\u2019 <em>Then the next minute he would be off, \u2018All you dinks are trying to kill me,\u2019 again.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-17\">\u201cQ. Do you think he thought that \u2014before the shot do you think he thought that \u2014 do you think he thought, you know, he knew who you were?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-20\">\u201cA. Well, I\u2019m not really sure, especially after we had him in the orderly room there, and at times he seemed to know who he was talking to and then other times he would look at you and called us all dinks <em>and he, I believe, thought we was </em>[sic].\u201d [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-21\">\n<em>Private First Class Richard D.

Well, that is the thing. He just snapped. <em>His mind just went out on him.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-24\">\u201cQ. Why do you say that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-25\">\u201cA. Well, because he just wasn\u2019t himself. His eyes were different and in all he just wasn\u2019t himself. When I first came to the troop Tom helped me set up. Well, PFC Biggs helped me to set up all my stuff and all and he\u2019s been real good to me since I have been there and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-26\">\u201cQ. From what you observed that night, in your acquaintanceship with him do you have any knowledge why he may have acted that way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-27\">\u201cA. Well, Specialist Straughn kept on saying \u2014 just kept on saying to him, \u2018You\u2019re going to die,\u2019 and I guess it scared him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-28\">\u201cQ. Did you think he was intoxicated at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-29\">\u201cA. It\u2019s hard to say.

You have mentioned that he called a number of people by name. Do you feel that he recognized these people ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-32\">\u201cA. Well, sir, he called them by name. Whether, he recognized them or not I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-33\">\u201cQ.

During this period of time how was his coordination ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-13\">\u201cA. Rather alert, I think coordinated, very high-strung and jerky, I'd say would probably be the best way to explain that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-14\">\u201cQ. After jumping him, so to speak, what if anything did PFC Biggs say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-15\">\u201cA. Well, he was very overwrought and loud. He was \u2014 the entire time he was screaming, \u2018Don\u2019t let these gook bastards get me. Get these gook bastards out of the area,\u2019 things of that nature, virtually the whole time this was his primary train of thought.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-16\">\u201cQ.

Now, let\u2019s place ourselves back in time at the time when PFC Biggs was in possession of the weapon. What was he calling people at that time ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-26\">\u201cA.

When do you think he finally realized who you were?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-30\">\u201cA. Well, he finally realized who I was when he was down on the floor in the orderly room after the melee, we\u2019ll say, was all over with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-31\">\u201cQ. How would you characterize Biggs\u2019 conduct on the 29th of August with what you knew of him before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-32\">\u201cA. <em>180 degrees out. </em>There really is no comparison between what I saw that night and what I had known of him prior to that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-33\">\u201cQ. Do you think he was drunk when he held the weapon ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-34\">\u201cA. No, he didn\u2019t strike me that way, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-35\">\u201cQ.

After you went into the orderly room what if anything did PFC Biggs say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-9\">\u201cA. He was frightened that the VC were going to get him. He was still under this impression. A couple of times he would come and go. He would start to get rational but he didn\u2019t know \u2019where he was, I don\u2019t think. He just acted like he was scared.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-10\">\u201cQ. Did he appear to you to be intoxicated?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-11\">\u201cA. I really wouldn\u2019t say he was intoxicated. I mean, so far as he didn\u2019t \u2014 he acted like somebody that was scared rather than \u2014 more than somebody that was intoxicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-12\">\u201cQ. I have asked you this question. I will ask it again. Do you think he was intoxicated?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-13\">\u201cA. <em>1 have never seen an intoxicated man act like that. </em>That is I think he was \u2014 he may have had a drink. I have seen different people act different ways being intoxicated, certain degrees of intoxication, but whether he was intoxicated right at that point, he didn\u2019t act like it. He acted like a scared kid, anything like that. I don\u2019t know whether he \u2014he just didn\u2019t act like a drunk to me. A drunk gets up and falls down and Tom didn\u2019t fall at any time I saw him down through there. It was very possible he may have been drinking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-14\">\u201cQ. <em>Do you think he recognized you outside?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-17\">\u201cA. <em>I don\u2019t think so. </em>I think he .knew who I was or knew who Captain Frazier was supposed to be, but \u00cd don\u2019t think he thought that I was Captain Frazier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-18\">\u201cQ. Why do you say that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-19\">\u201cA. Because he kept calling me a VC imposter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-20\">\u201cQ. Would you compare his behavior the night of the 29th with that which you knew previously?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-21\"><em>\u201cA. </em>No, it\u2019s <em>180 degrees different </em>from what Tom had ever done, I mean, he\u2019s been an ideal soldier as far as I was concerned. Never had any trouble with him, hard working. He came in one time and wanted me to talk to Major Gross and he wanted to be taken out as a crew chief. He wanted to be put in an ammo dump which I considered to be a worse task. He didn\u2019t want to be responsible for the lives of people. He didn\u2019t feel competent enough to do the job. He asked us to put him in the ammo dump and we had.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-22\"><em>Private First Class Robert S. Salzer </em>(Stipulated Testimony, Defense Exhibit A).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-23\">\u201cPFC Thomas Biggs has been on edge for the last month or so between the long hours and the Red Alerts. It\u2019s been too much for him. About 2830 hours, on 29 August 1970 PFC Biggs came back to the hootch. We talked to him for about an hour and he was jumping at the slightest noises. After he threw the sandwich [sic] at Sp. Straughn he walked over to the end of the hootch. Then he fell backward hitting the floor very hard with his head. He then was unconscious. We put him into bed. Then about 5 minutes later he regained consciousness his mind snapped. He thought everyone was a gook, as if we were Vietnamese. PFC Biggs told Capt Frazier that, T don\u2019t be\u00edieve you are Captain Frazier.\u2019 PFC Biggs was O. K. until he hit his head. He was a different person after he hit his head.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>I have taken the liberty of setting forth the rather lengthy quotes from the testimony of lay witnesses for the prosecution. After directing attention to that testimony, I am unable to perceive how it carries the Government\u2019s burden to prove the appellant\u2019s sanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">Admittedly the testimony of these Government witnesses is not artful in the. use of language to communicate opinions as to an accused\u2019s sanity as We often see the opinion testimony of psychiatrists; nevertheless, I find an abundance of testimony from the Government\u2019s own witnesses that the appellant\u2019s behavior was far from the normal. It strikes me that the use of the vernacular phrase, \u201c180 degrees out of phase,\u201d fairly connotes the general view that the majority of the Government\u2019s witnesses believed appellant\u2019s conduct a vast departure from the normal. Such evidence is favorable to the defense contention that the evidence of sanity is insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The majority accurately relates that at times during the episode there was testimony that appellant identified by name First Sergeant Coffelt, Chief Warrant Officer Davis, Dr. Pearson, and Colonel Molinelli. The majority takes the position that this evidence tends to support the court\u2019s finding that the accused knew the military identity of the officers he assaulted; therefore, evidence of legal sanity. However, as I see it, quick reference to the evidence will indicate that the very officers assaulted all expressed the opinion that they did not believe the appellant recognized them when the assault took place. At best on the matter of recognition, the Government\u2019s evidence violently conflicts. Then does the testimony of the Government\u2019s two medical experts, coupled with its other evidence, lift the evi-dentiary burden high enough sufficiently to prove sanity? I do not believe so. Dr. Pearson, the squadron surgeon and not a psychiatrist, saw the appellant immediately after the assaults. Biggs was given 50 milligrams of thorazine because of his extreme agitation. I do not find any opinion expressed by Dr. Pearson regarding Biggs\u2019 sanity.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">Dr. Char, the division psychiatrist, found nothing organically wrong and was unable to give an opinion concerning accused\u2019s mental condition. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-8\">\u201cQ. On the basis of your discussion with him were you able to formulate opinions as to his probable condition at the time of the incident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-9\">\u201cA. Well, he related to me that he had no actual memory for the events and the only thing he could tell me about it is what other people had told him he had done. He did tell me he recalled drinking quite a bit previous to the incident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-10\">\u201cQ. Is there anything in your observation of him that would lead you to believe that hp was not responsible at the time of the incident, from your observation ?.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-11\"><em>\u201cA. Well, since he couldn\u2019t remember I really can\u2019t answer that question. </em>Since he couldn\u2019t remember what had happened to him <em>I couldn\u2019t answer that.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-12\">\u201cQ. Have you formulated any opinion as to why it is he may not have remembered?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-13\">\u201cA. Well, to my mind the most <em>likely </em>explanation is that he had had too much alcohol to drink and this interfered with his ability to recall what had happened.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-14\">On the other hand, the Government\u2019s medical witness who was on the scene provided testimony directly contrary to a theory that defendant had \u201ctoo much alcohol.\u201d Dr. Pearson stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-15\">\u201cQ. Did he appear to you to be inebriated at this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-16\"><em>\u201cA. </em>No, he didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t believe so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-17\">\u201cQ. At the time you treated him, did you feel that \u2014 well, I will put it this way: did you feel that he was intoxicated ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-18\">\u201cA. No, I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t feel he was intoxicated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Turning now to the lay testimony from the witnesses for the prosecution on the matter of intoxication. Certainly there is evidence that the accused was drinking and exhibited some of the physical signs commonly associated with one under the influence of alcohol. Again, examination of the testimony of the Government\u2019s own witnesses and assuming its truth, the plurality of those witnesses opined that Biggs was <em>not </em>intoxicated.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-3\">I fully recognize that the prosecution\u2019s evidence need not be so well orchestrated that it is without evi-dentiary conflicts. Indeed, it would be strange to find a case where multiple witnesses testify for the prosecution and there were no discernible conflicts. But when evidence is unsup-portiye of the Government\u2019s burden or so much in conflict that it offers only to the triers of fact an invitation to speculation, then it cannot be said that it provides a basis for a finding beyond a reasonable doubt by a reasonable mind. I believe the Government's evidence on the appellant\u2019s sanity suffer both infirmities.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">I would reverse.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b46-7\"> Only in the opinion of Mr. Davis do I find an opinion based upon observation that Biggs could have been drunk. Mr. Davis testified that he thought it was \u201cvery possible\u201d that the appellant was drunk. Lieutenant Merino stated that \u201cyou could tell he had been drinking.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
