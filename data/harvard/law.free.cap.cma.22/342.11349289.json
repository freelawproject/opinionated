The court-martial sentenced him to a bad-conduct discharge, confinement at hard labor for 3 months, and forfeitures. At issue on this appeal is the admissibility of evidence of a previous conviction by a summary court-martial at which the accused was sentenced to confinement at hard labor for 1 month. See United States v Alderman, 22 USCMA 298, 46 CMR 298 (May 26, 1973). That sentence was suspended, and it does-not appear that the suspension was revoked. Government counsel contend that other evidence demonstrates that the accused was \u201cnever confined as a result\u201d of this conviction. Apart from the effect of the unserved confinement upon the constitutional validity of the previous conviction, I am satisfied that the conviction did not result in a more severe sentence than the court-martial would have adjudged had evidence thereof not been admitted. The decision of the Court of Military Review is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b364-15\">Darden, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A1Y\">(concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"b364-16\">I concur in the result for the reasons set forth in my separate opinion in United States v Alderman, 22 USCMA 298, 46 CMR 298 (May 26, 1973).</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b364-17\">Duncan, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AU8\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b364-18\">In the case before us, the appellant pleaded guilty to a lengthy absence without leave. Trial counsel offered in evidence a prior conviction by summary court-martial for negligent homicide. See United States v Alderman, 22 USCMA 298, 46 CMR 298 (May 26, 1973). In his unsworn statement in mitigation, Smith disclosed that while in Vietnam he had accidently shot and killed a fellow serviceman for which he was tried by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>the above-mentioned summary court-martial.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-3\">In argument on sentence, trial counsel referred to this conviction and an unsatisfactory rating as to conduct and efficiency,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which the appellant received at the time of a permanent change of station one month following this incident, as revealing \u201cPrivate Smith as something a good deal less than a war hero.\u201d The military judge instructed the court members that they \u201cmay properly consider [as] a matter in aggravation the fact that the accused has a previous conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">As I view the record in this trial, I am unable to state that the sentence might not have been different had the members of the Court known that the prior conviction \u201chad been unconstitutionally obtained.\u201d United States v Tucker, 404 US 442, 448 (1972).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b365-7\"> During a period of 26 months of creditable service, appellant received four other ratings for conduct and efficiency, all of which were excellent, One of them was given 9 months after his return to the United States.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
