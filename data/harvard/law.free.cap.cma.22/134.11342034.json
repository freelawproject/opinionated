While the record of his trial was pending review by the convening authority, Commander, Fifth Coast Guard District, related charges against Petty Officer Daniels were scheduled for trial. When the Government indicated that it proposed to call the accused as a witness against. Daniels, the accused\u2019s counsel \u201cmade it known\u201d that the accused would refuse to testify \u201cunless he was given immunity . . . coextensive with his right to silence . . . protection of the widest scope recognized by the law.\u201d As a result, two documents captioned \u201cGrant of Immunity\u201d were issued to the accused. In pertinent part, the documents granted \u201cimmunity from further prosecution for any criminal acts\u201d connected with the damage to the reduction gear and specifically extended to \u201cany false statement\u201d made by the accused. In due course, the accused testified at Daniels\u2019 trial. Thereafter, the convening authority acted in the accused\u2019s case. He approved the findings of guilty, but modified the sentence to reduce the period of confinement to nine months to conform that punishment with the sentence provision of a pretrial agreement with the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-19\">As perceived by appellate defense counsel, law and the language of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>grant of immunity require that the accused\u2019s conviction be set aside and the charge against him be dismissed. The legal argument is primarily predicated upon Frank v United States, 347 F2d 486, 491 (DC Cir 1965), <em>petition for cert dismissed, </em>382 US 923 (1965) in which a divided Court of Appeals held that the \u201cGovernment may not convict a person and then, pending his appeal, compel him to give self-accusatory testimony [to a grand jury] relating to the matters involved in the conviction\u201d because such action would violate the prohibition of the federal immunity statute [47 USC \u00a7 409(1)] against subjecting an individual \u201cto any penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction . . . concerning which he is compelled, after having claimed his privilege against self-incrimination, to testify.\u201d Responding to the same argument, the Court of Military Review below observed that the United States Supreme Court had \u201cindicated plainly its disagreement with\u201d <em>Frank </em>in Katz v United States, 389 US 347, 349, footnote 3, 19 L Ed 2d 576, 88 S Ct 507 (1967). It also remarked that the retroactive effect accorded a grant of immunity in the <em>Frank </em>case was contrary to the Supreme Court\u2019s determination that a conviction already had is not extinguished by a subsequent grant of immunity as to other aspects of the criminal transaction, since the \u201ctraditional purpose of immunity statutes [is] to protect witnesses only as to the future.\u201d Reina v United States, 364 US 507, 513, 5 L Ed 2d 249, 255, 81 S Ct 260 (1960). The Court of Military Review concluded that \u201cthe law regarding the operative effect of a grant of immunity does not require\u201d that the accused\u2019s conviction be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">Arguing that the Court of Military Review misconstrued the import of <em>Katz </em>and <em>Reina, </em>appellate defense counsel contends that those cases are not opposed to <em>Frank. </em>They maintain that in each of those cases the conviction was final, whereas in <em>Frank, </em>as in this case, appellate review was incomplete at the time of the grant of immunity. The opinion in <em>Katz </em>refers to. affirmance of the conviction by the Court of Appeals, but it does not suggest that the accused\u2019s time to file for certiorari by the Supreme Court had expired, or even that the matter of finality was relevant to the issue. We need not determine, however, whether finality of conviction is important where the accused has, previous to the grant, remained silent as to his guilt; the accused did not remain silent here.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">According to appellate defense counsel, a grant of immunity is an \u201cexchange\u201d for the accused\u2019s right to remain silent. The element of exchange is apparent in the federal immunity statute upon which he relies in the prohibition against prosecution where the individual is compelled to testify \u201cafter having claimed his priviledge against self-incrimination.\u201d When an accused enters a voluntary plea of guilty at his trial, as the accused here did, he voluntarily surrenders his right to remain silent. \u201cOnce [the accused] . . . entered a plea of guilty and was convicted,\u201d we said in United States v Gilliland, 10 USCMA 343, 345, 27 CMR 417, 419 (1959), \u201c. . . he could not later refuse to testify on the ground of self-incrimination.\u201d In that case, a proposal by the accused to testify against another in regard to the same criminal incident \u201camounted to nothing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In terms of appellate defense counsel\u2019s own argument, therefore, not only was there nothing the Government could receive in exchange for the grant of immunity, insofar as it related to the same offense, but the Government would lose a conviction it had already obtained on the basis of the accused\u2019s voluntary plea of guilty. Thus, even if <em>Frank </em>has continued vitality, its rationale is inapplicable. We agree with the Court of Military Review, therefore, that legal principle and precedent did not bar appellate review of accused\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Considering the language of the grant of immunity, the Court of Military Review pointed out that the grant \u201cdid not express any promise\u201d to exon\u00e9rate the accused from responsibility. for the offense of which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>stood convicted. It further noted that the accused did not contend that the convening authority had agreed to take such action if he testified at Daniels\u2019 trial. See United States v Gilliland, supra at 345, 27 CMR at 419. The accused does not challenge the correctness of these observations, but he maintains that the text of the grant implicitly prohibits continuation of further proceedings in the case. As thus construed, the findings of guilty could never be approved and the sentence could never be ordered into execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\">A grant of immunity worded like that in this case was before us in United States v Vogel, 18 USCMA 160, 39 CMR 160 (1969). The construction accorded the grant by defense counsel in <em>Vogel </em>did not require the Court to consider the effect of the grant upon the approved findings of guilty and the sentence. However, Judge Ferguson\u2019s views in dissent led him to comment on the possible consequences of the grant. Like Vogel\u2019s counsel, Judge Ferguson did not construe the grant as operating, automatically, to vacate the adjudication of the court-martial or to prohibit completion of the appellate review required by the Uniform Code. He construed the provision for immunity \u201cfrom further prosecution\u201d as a <em>possible </em>bar to retrial if the conviction were overturned. Without considering whether all of Judge Ferguson\u2019s construction of the language of the grant was correct, we agree that, reasonably construed, the words \u201cfurther prosecution\u201d in the grant in issue did not invalidate the existing adjudication of the accused's guilt by the court-martial, and, therefore, did not prohibit review of its findings of guilty and sentence, as required by the Uniform Code of Military Justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The decision of the Court of Military Review is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b158-7\">Chief Judge Darden and Judge Duncan concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
