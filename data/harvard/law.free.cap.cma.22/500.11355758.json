At trial, he challenged, on several grounds, the admissibility of an oral pretrial statement by him in which he admitted he had removed the TV set from a ward at Beaumont General Hospital, where he was then a patient. The trial judge ruled against him. We granted review to consider \"whether the warning imparted by the investigator prior to obtaining accused\u2019s statement satisfied the requirements of Miranda v Arizona, 384 US 436 (1966).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-15\">At the hearing on a defense motion to suppress the pretrial statement, Wall, a \"detective investigator\u201d at Beaumont General Hospital, testified that on the day of the disappearance of the TV set, he interviewed the accused. At the beginning of the interview, he identified himself as an investigator and informed the accused he was suspected of larceny of the set. He then advised the accused of his rights, which he enumerated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>\"Your rights are: You have the right to remain silent. Any statement you make may be used as evidence against you in a criminal trial. You have the right to have counsel present with you during questioning. You may have military counsel of your own selection if he is available or you may have civilian counsel for which you will have to pay. <em>You may have a military counsel appointed for you at no expense to you. </em>Also, at any time during the interview if you decide to stop answering questions you may do so. Also at any time during the interview if you desire legal counsel, just say so.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-3\">After the advice as to his rights, the accused indicated that he desired counsel. Wall escorted him to Captain Phillips, the hospital judge advocate. Captain Phillips conferred with the accused in his private office, while Wall remained in the waiting room. Phillips determined that he could not advise the accused because of \"a conflict of interest,\u201d and he suggested to him, and later to Wall, that counsel be obtained at Fort Bliss.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">Other matters required Wall\u2019s attention so he confined the accused in a detention cell at the hospital. About a half hour later, Wall told the accused he would have \"to contact\u201d Fort Bliss \"to get him legal counsel.\u201d Thereupon, the accused remarked: \"Well, that\u2019s all right, I decided I don\u2019t want one and I\u2019ll answer your questions.\u201d Wall testified that he again \"warned\u201d the accused of his rights, which he again enumerated as above, and then specifically asked the accused whether he desired legal counsel. The accused responded, \"No.\u201d Wall proceeded to question the accused, and the accused made the admissions in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">During cross-examination, Wall admitted that at a hearing by the investigation officer appointed under Article 32, Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 USC \u00a7 832, he had testified that he \"could not be sure\u201d that when he advised the accused of his right to counsel he had said, \" 'Legal counsel would be appointed for you at no expense to you.\u2019\u201d Asked to explain the difference between this testimony and his trial testimony, he testified that the \"only way . . . [he could] answer this is to say I do normally tell them this when I give the warning.\u201d He maintained that he had given such advice \"approximately 2,000 times\u201d since the \"Miranda warning came into effect.\u201d He acknowledged that normally he read the advice from a card he carried, but he did not have the card at the interview with the accused. He further admitted he could not \"say for certain under oath\u201d that he had informed the accused he had the right to detailed counsel at no expense, but he insisted that \"I feel sure in my own mind that definitely the last time . . . [the accused] was informed of this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">In denying the motion to suppress and admitting the accused\u2019s statements, the trial judge made specific findings of fact. Among other things, he found that \"complete warning\u201d as to the right to counsel was given the accused before he made the statement, and \"that the accused did tell Mr. Wall that he did not want counsel, that counsel was not necessary; and that the accused did knowingly, intelligently, consciously, and voluntarily waive his right to counsel and his right to remain silent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">The admissibility of a pretrial statement by the accused \"need only be supported by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d United States v Mewborn, 17 USCMA 431, 437, 38 CMR 229, 235 (1968); Lego v Twomey, 404 US 477 (1972). If believed, Wall\u2019s testimony on direct examination as to the extent of his advice to the accused was more than sufficient to justify the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that he had properly informed the accused as to his right to military counsel without cost. However, appellate defense counsel perceived Wall\u2019s concession during cross-examination, that he could not \"say for certain under oath\u201d that he had so advised the accused, as diluting the strength of the direct testimony to a degree requiring the conclusion that the Government had \"failed to carry its burden\u201d of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-10\">Proof of the existence of an essential fact to the degree required by law is not susceptible of the kind of precise determination that is assured by the weights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>and measures of science or commerce. Indeed, as Professor Wigmore has observed, there may be no satisfactory quantitative \"mode of measurement for the intensity of human belief.\u201d 9 Wig-more, Evidence \u00a7 2497, at 325 (3d ed. 1940). But, as the late Justice Harlan pointed out, the phrase preponderance of the evidence \"communicate[s] to the finder of fact ... [a workable notion] concerning the degree of confidence he is expected to have in the correctness of his factual conclusions.\u201d <em>In re </em>Winship, 397 US 358, 368 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-3\">Wall did not, as the witness did in United States v Parham, 14 USCMA 161, 33 CMR 373 (1963), refuse to testify to the essential fact in issue. True, Wall, like the witness in <em>Parham, </em>admitted that he could not \"say for certain under oath\u201d that he gave the requisite advice to the accused, but the \"sum and substance\u201d of his testimony establishes him as the \"honest and cautious witness [who] refused to accord absolute certainty\u201d to his recall of the event, rather than as a witness who had \"such grave reservations and doubts that he would not, upon his oath, declare\u201d the existence of the essential fact. <em>Id. </em>at 165, 33 CMR at 377. In <em>Parham, </em>the witness admitted that he could not identify the defendant as the wrongdoer \"because . . . [he had] no sufficient proof of this;\u201d Wall, however, maintained that he had given the required advice on approximately 2,000 similar occasions, and he consistently insisted that he was \"sure\u201d in his \"own mind\u201d that he had advised the accused as to the matters in issue before he questioned him. <em>In Parham, </em>the witness admitted he did not \"know really that\u201d the accused was the culprit, and he was not \"fully convinced\u201d; Wall\u2019s testimony leaves no doubt that he was convinced that he had advised the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Besides Wall\u2019s testimony, other evidence bearing on the matter was before the trial judge. Immediately upon completion of Wall\u2019s advice, the accused asked for counsel, and he was taken to Captain Phillips, a qualified military lawyer. Although Captain Phillips determined that he could not act as accused\u2019s counsel, his account of the meeting with the accused demonstrates, as the trial judge found, that the accused was \"fully aware that he had the right to have a military attorney appointed at no expense to him.\u201d It can reasonably be inferred that the accused\u2019s awareness of the right resulted from the advice he received from Wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Considering all the evidence, the trial judge could, in our opinion, properly conclude that a preponderance thereof proved that before he questioned the accused, Wall advised him of the right to free military counsel. See United States v Goard, 13 USCMA 588, 33 CMR 120 (1963). Accordingly, we sustain his ruling admitting the accused\u2019s pretrial statements in evidence, and we affirm the decision of the Court of Military Review.</p>\n<judges id=\"b524-8\">Chief Judge Darden and Judge Duncan concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
