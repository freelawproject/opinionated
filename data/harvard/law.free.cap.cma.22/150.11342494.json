United States v Attebury, 18 USCMA 531, 40 CMR 243 (1969); United States v Tempia, 16 USCMA 629, 37 CMR 249 (1967); Miranda v Arizona, 384 US 436, 16 L Ed 2d 694, 86 S Ct 1602 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-21\">We need not detail at length, as did the Court of Military Review, the trial testimony regarding this issue. Suf<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>fice to note that the appellant did not testify and that all of the evidence was given by the Government\u2019s witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">It appears that the accused was interrogated on July 2, 3, and 7, 1971, by Major Flood, special agent in charge of the local Air Force Office of Special Investigations. Prior to each interview the appellant, who was at all times confined, was advised of his right to remain silent and of his right to counsel. On July 2nd, during a period of more than three hours, the appellant refused to respond, either in the affirmative or negative, to the agent\u2019s questions. He did not even acknowledge his understanding of the warnings given. On July 3rd, for approximately an hour, Agent Flood tried again with the same negative results. He testified that he felt he and his fellow agent were talking to themselves. On July 7th, for about li or 2 hours, Agent Flood fared no better. The appellant would merely shake his head in a negative fashion when asked why he did not wish to talk about the matters under investigation. Only upon Flood\u2019s inquiry whether the accused knew he had been \u201cdealing with the Soviets . . . the big boys,\u201d and whether he knew how the Soviets handled agents of theirs who had been picked up, did the accused\u2019s responses change.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thereafter, the appellant made the inculpatory statement which was admitted at trial over defense counsel\u2019s objection. What we said in United States v Attebury, supra at 531-532, 40 CMR at 243-244, is equally applicable here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">\u201cUnder the circumstances of this case, we need not determine whether an accused\u2019s assertion of the right to remain silent at one interrogation insulates him from future interrogation in the course of an investigation, or whether the relationship between two periods of custodial interrogations may be so attenuated as to allow law enforcement agents again to advise an accused of his rights and request that he submit to questioning. See United States v Bollons, 17 USCMA 253, 38 CMR 51 [1967]. We are satisfied that this accused\u2019s repeated reliance upon his right to remain silent made it incumbent upon the agent to desist in his attempts to get the accused to talk. We hold that the pretrial statement was improperly admitted in evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">The certified question is answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<judges id=\"b173-8\">Chief Judge Darden and Judge Quinn concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b173-9\">When initially taken into custody, the appellant was advised that he was suspected of a violation of Air Force Regulation 205-57 (failure to report contact with a foreign government representative) and espionage.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
