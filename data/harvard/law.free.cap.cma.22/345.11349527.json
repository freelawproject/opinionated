On this appeal, he contends that evidence of a previous conviction by summary court-martial was improperly admitted because at the trial he had been unrepresented by counsel. Unlike the situation in United States v Alderman, 22 USCMA 298, 46 CMR 298 (May 25, 1973), this record of trial demonstrates that the evidence of the previous conviction had no prejudicial effect. The decision of the Court of Military Review is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b367-15\">Darden, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AEl\">(concurring):</p>\n<p id=\"b367-16\">I concur in the result for the reasons set forth in my separate opinion in United States v Alderman, 22 USCMA 298, 46 CMR 298 (May 25, 1973).</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b367-17\">Duncan, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A6T\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b367-18\">I disagree with the conclusion that the evidence of a previous conviction, unconstitutionally obtained, had no prejudicial effect on the sentence in this case for the reasons set forth in my separate opinions in United States v Alderman, 22 USCMA 298, 46 CMR 298 (May 25, 1973), and United States v Seda, 22 USCMA 341, 46 CMR 341 (June 8,1973).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
