It is apparent, therefore, that contrary to the command of Article 6(c), th\u00e9 Article 32 officer \u201cassist[ed] in inducing the approval\u201d of the action of the court-martial by the convening authority. United States v Crunk, 4 USCMA 290, 294, 15 CMR 290, 294 (1954). See also United States v Coulter, 3 USCMA 657, 14 CMR 75 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-16\">Unlike the record in United States v Marsh, 20 USCMA 42, 42 CMR 234 (1970), the record before us does not indicate that the investigating officer\u2019s later role in the case was known to, and approved by, the accused. We are, therefore, unable to agree with the Court of Military Review that the fact, much less the appearance, of evil inherent in the dual role was demonstrably eliminated. Accordingly, we reverse its decision and set aside the action of the convening authority. New review proceedings consistent with the Uniform Code, supra, may be held. United States v Hightower, 5 USCMA 385, 18 CMR 9 (1955).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
