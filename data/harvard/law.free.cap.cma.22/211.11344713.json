Upon such review, that tribunal held petitioner\u2019s pretrial statement inadmissible and that he was prejudiced by its receipt in evidence at the trial. Accordingly, it set aside the findings and ordered a rehearing. The Judge Advocate General then certified the question of the correctness of the decision of the Court of Military Review for determination by this Court. Article 67 (b) (2), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 867(b) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-18\">By opinion dated February 16, 1973, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>upon which our mandate issued February 28, 1973, this Court sustained the challenged decision. United States v. DeChamplain, 22 USCMA 150, 46 CMR 150 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\">Petitioner now filed a \u201cPetition for Extraordinary Relief.\u201d He therein represents that as of March 26, 1973, despite the above-mentioned decision, he remains confined at the United States Disciplinary Barracks, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and has not been advised of any further disposition of his case. He concludes from this that Air Force authorities have taken no action to comply with this Court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">On the foregoing basis, petitioner seeks: immediate release from confinement, the appointment of a defense counsel, and, either a speedy trial upon, or other disposition of, the charges, or dismissal thereof with restitution of all pay and allowances.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">As a result of our decision of February 16, 1973, the convening authority is required to determine whether or not a rehearing of the charges against petitioner is practicable. Article 67(f), UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 867 (f). Necessarily, a reasonable time for making the required determination must be allowed. Pending that determination, the decision respecting continued confinement is governed by the provisions of Article 13, UCMJ, 10 USC \u00a7 813.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Since the limits of reasonableness have not been exceeded, and since petitioner has not alleged that his continued confinement results from any arbitrary exercise of the powers conferred by Article 13, UCMJ, the petition is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
