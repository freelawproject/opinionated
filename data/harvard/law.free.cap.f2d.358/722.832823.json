This litigation is not new. Its history is reflected in the following reported cases: Hunter v. Atchison, Topeka &amp; Sante Fe Railway Company, 78 F.Supp. 984 (N.D.Ill.1948), affirmed 171 F.2d 594 (7 Cir. 1948), cert. denied Shepherd v. Hunter, 337 U.S. 916, 69 S.Ct. 1157, 93 L.Ed. 1726; Hunter v. Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Company, 188 F.2d 294 (7 Cir. 1951), cert. denied Hunter v. Shepherd, 342 U.S. 819, 72 S.Ct. 36, 96 L.Ed. 619 (1957); Final Decree, Hunter v. Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Company, 44C 971 (N.D .Ill.1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-11\">In the prior litigation, a class action, appellants insisted upon their right to be heard before the Board with reference to the disputed employment. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois directed that the Board hear the matter. The Board did so and entered an award with which the appellants do not agree. This suit seeks to set aside the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-12\">The statute creating the Board, 45 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 151 et seq., provides that non-money awards \u201cshall be final and binding upon both parties to the dispute, except insofar as they shall contain a money award.\u201d 45 U.S.C.A. 153 First (m). It is our conclusion that the trial court reached the right conclusion and that the complaint was properly dismissed. See Gunther v. San Diego &amp; A. E. R. Co., 382 U.S. 257, 86 S.Ct. 368, 15 L.Ed.2d 308 (1965); Union Pacific R. Co. v. Price, 360 U.S. 601, 79 S.Ct. 1351, 3 L.Ed.2d 1460 (1959); Michel v. Louisville &amp; N. R. Co., 188 F.2d 224 (5 Cir, 1951). The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
