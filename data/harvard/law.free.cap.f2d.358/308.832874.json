Counsel for the plaintiffs-appellants informed us that he does not desire to amend the complaint. Thereafter, we entered an order allowing the necessary amendments to be made by any party to the cause to the end that the case would not have to be retried. On March 21, 1966, the defendant-appellee, Progress Manufacturing Company, by its counsel, filed an affidavit which amends adequately the jurisdictional allegations of the complaint. We find, therefore, that jurisdiction now exists. 28U.S.C. \u00a7 1653.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-18\">An examination of the record in this case and consideration of the arguments of the parties convinces us that the court below committed no error. Consequently, the judgment appealed from will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
