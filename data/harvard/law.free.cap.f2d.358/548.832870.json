The District Court, after a hearing, dismissed the petition and petitioner appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-27\">Following oral argument in this Court, the Juvenile Court released petitioner in the custody of his maternal grandmother in South Carolina. Since the detention from which petitioner sought release no longer exists, I agree that the serious issues raised by his petition are now moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>An appeal from the denial of a petition raising substantially the same issues was similarly mooted while pending in this court. See Elmore v. Stone, D.C.Cir., 355 F.2d 841, Order of January 7, 1966. If a substantial and recurring issue is repeatedly mooted before it can be adjudicated, a federal court is not without power to decide the issue in an appropriate case. See Southern Pac. Terminal Co. v. ICC, 219 U.S. 498, 515, 31 S.Ct. 279, 55 L.Ed. 310 (1911).
