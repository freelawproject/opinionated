Judge Tenney, sitting without a jury, found Freeman guilty of the charge, insofar as it related to liquid cocaine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On Freeman\u2019s appeal, we are presented with a difficult question concerning the constitutional requirements for obtaining a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">Prior to trial appellant moved, pursuant to Rule 41(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to suppress the evidence, i. e. the narcotic drugs, seized by Federal agents, under the authority of a search warrant, at the time of arrest. Appellant argued that the \u201cwarrant was invalid because the affidavit on the strength of which it was issued failed to make a sufficient showing of probable cause.\u201d The motion was denied and appellant claims that this ruling was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-16\">In January 1963, an informant told Agent Benjamin of the narcotics bureau that a man named Spooner and his partner, appellant Freeman, were selling large quantities of narcotics. The informant said that Spooner either lived or worked at 246 West 18th Street in New York City. Benjamin investigated and discovered that Spooner worked as a superintendent at 246 West 18th Street, and lived at 166 West 129th Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-17\">In early March 1963, Benjamin asked the informant to try to learn where Spooner and his partner kept their narcotics. On March 11,1963, the informant told Benjamin that he had seen Spooner and the appellant \u201cbagging up narcotics\u201d on a bed in the apartment, previously found to have been Spooner\u2019s residence, at 166 West 129th Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-18\">The informant had been working with the narcotics bureau since 1958 and with Agent Benjamin for about a year. During this time he had provided Benjamin with information leading to eight prosecutions. On the basis of the informant\u2019s past activities, Benjamin and other federal agents considered him \u201creliable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-19\">On March 13, 1963 Benjamin, in support of his application for a search warrant, submitted the following affidavit to a United States Commissioner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-22\">\u201c[The facts tending to establish the foregoing grounds for issuance of a Search Warrant are as follows: The heroin was seen within the premises on this date by an informant of previous reliability. On- March 11, 1963, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>and March 12, 1963, the occupant of the premises was observed in meeting with known addicts and the aforesaid informant saw him transfer narcotics to known addicts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The warrant was issued. The evidence which appellant moved to suppress was obtained during the search made pursuant to the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Appellant attacks the warrant on the ground that the affidavit of Agent Benjamin presented an insufficient basis to justify the Commissioner\u2019s determination that there was probable cause for the issuance of the warrant. The affidavit was not made upon personal knowledge and did \u201cnot contain any factual information independently corroborative of the hearsay contained therein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">The Fourth Amendment reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">\u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">The Amendment\u2019s admonition against unreasonable searches and seizures is reflected in Rule 41(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-10\">\u201cIssuance and Contents. A warrant shall issue only on affidavit sworn to before the judge or commissioner and establishing^ the grounds for issuing the warrant. If the judge or commissioner is satisfied that grounds for the application exist or that there is probable cause to believe that they exist, he shall issue a warrant identifying the property and naming or describing the person or place to be searched. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-13\">There would be no doubt of the sufficiency of the affidavit if it were based on the personal observations of the affiant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The question as to the sufficiency of Agent Benjamin\u2019s affidavit arises from its being based on hearsay. The Supreme Court has held that an affidavit though based on hearsay is sufficient \u201cso long as a substantial basis for crediting the hearsay is presented.\u201d Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257, 269, 80 S.Ct. 725, 735, 4 L.Ed.2d 697 (1960). The issue for decision is whether or not the statement that the source of the hearsay was an \u201cinformant of previous reliability\u201d offered such a \u201csubstantial basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b511-14\">The standard to be used in reaching a determination must not be so stringent nor so technical as to discourage the use of search warrants, since \u201cthe informed and deliberate determinations of magistrates empowered to issue warrants * * * are to be preferred over the hurried action of officers * * * who may happen to make arrests.\u201d United States v. Lefkowitz, 285 U.S. 452, 464, 52 S.Ct. 420, 423, 76 L.Ed. 877 (1932).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-16\">\u201cIf the teachings of the Court\u2019s cases are to be followed and the constitutional policy served, affidavits for search warrants, such as the one involved here, must be tested and interpreted by magistrates and courts in a common-sense and realistic fashion. They are normally drafted by non-lawyers in the midst and haste of a criminal investigation. Technical requirements of elaborate specificity once exacted under common law pleadings have no proper place in this area. <em>A grudging or negative attitude by reviewing courts toward warrants will tend to discourage police officers from submitting their evidence to a judicial officer before acting.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) United States v. Ventresca, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>380 U.S. 102, 108, 85 S.Ct. 741, 746, 13 L.Ed.2d 684 (1965).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">When a search is based upon a judge\u2019s or commissioner\u2019s, rather than a police officer\u2019s, determination of probable cause, a reviewing court will accept evidence of a less \u201cjudicially competent or persuasive character than would have justified an officer in acting on his own without a warrant.\u201d Jones v. United States, supra, 362 U.S. at 270, 80 S.Ct. at 736. See Aguilar v. State of Texas, 378 U.S. 108, 111, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">On the other hand, it is of critical importance that the judge or commissioner be provided with sufficient information to enable him to make a considered judicial determination as to whether the warrant should be issued. The proper performance of this function requires an affidavit which presents facts on which a finding of probable cause can reasonably be predicated. \u201cAlthough the reviewing court will pay substantial deference to judicial determinations of probable cause, the court must still insist that the magistrate perform his \u2018neutral and detached\u2019 function and not serve merely as a rubber stamp for the police.\u201d Aguilar v. State of Texas, supra, 378 U.S. at 111, 84 S.Ct. at 1512; see Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10, 13-14, 68 S.Ct. 367, 92 L.Ed. 436 (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">In Jones v. United States, supra, the affiant stated that he believed an informant\u2019s statements because the informant had \u201cgiven information to the undersigned on previous occasion and which was correct.\u201d The issue presented was \u201cwhether an affidavit which sets out personal observations relating to the existence of cause to search is to be deemed insufficient by virtue of the fact that it sets out not the affiant\u2019s observations but those of another.\u201d Id. 362 U.S. at 269, 80 S.Ct. at 735. In upholding the warrant the Court recognized that had the hearsay statement itself been the sole offering,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-8\">\u201cit might not have been enough; but [the agent] * * * swore to a basis for accepting the informant\u2019s story. The informant had previously given accurate information.\u201d Id. 362 U.S. at 271, 80 S.Ct. at 736.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">The Court concluded that \u201c[w]e cannot say that there was so little basis for accepting the hearsay here that the Commissioner acted improperly.\u201d Id. 362 U.S. at 271, 80 S.Ct. at 736.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-12\">It is true that in the <em>Jones </em>case the informant\u2019s story was corroborated by other sources of information, and in United States v. Ramirez, 279 F.2d 712, 715 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 850, 81 S.Ct. 95, 5 L.Ed.2d 74 (1960) it was suggested that <em>\u201cJones </em>may require that the affidavit include some factual information independently corroborative of the hearsay report.\u201d We believe, however, that United States v. Ventresca, supra, Aguilar v. State of Texas, supra and Rugendorf v. United States, 376 U.S. 528, 84 S.Ct. 825, 11 L.Ed.2d 887 (1964), establish that such corroboration is not required where the affiant attests to the previous reliability of the informant.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-13\">In Aguilar v. State of Texas, supra, the holding that a hearsay statement supported by the conclusory allegation that \u201c[a]ffiants have received reliable information from a credible person and do believe * * * \u201d was insufficient, did not rest on the absence of extrinsic corroboration. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-14\">\u201cAlthough an affidavit may be based on hearsay information and need not reflect the direct personal observations of the affiant, Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257 [80 S.Ct. 725], the magistrate must be informed of some of the underlying circumstances from which the informant concluded that the narcotics were where he claimed they were, and <em>some of the underlying circumstances from which the officer concluded that the informant, </em>whose identity need not be disclosed, see Rugendorf v. United States, 376 U.S. 528 [84 S.Ct. 825, 11 L.Ed.2d 887], was \u2018credible\u2019 or his information \u2018reliable.\u2019\u201d (Emphasis added.) Aguilar v. Texas, supra, 378 U.S. at 114, 84 S.Ct. at 1514.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Unlike <em>Aguilar, </em>where the mere recitation that the unidentified informant was a \u201ccredible person\u201d provided no basis on which to judge his reliability, in the present case \u201csome of the underlying circumstances\u201d from which Benjamin had concluded that the informant was credible, were given. The attestation to the informant\u2019s \u201cprevious reliability\u201d presents a \u201cfirmer foundation for belief than the \u2018totally innocuous\u2019 corroborating details sometimes cited as makeweights.\u201d United States v. Salgado, 347 F.2d 216, 217 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 870, 86 S.Ct. 146, 15 L.Ed.2d 109 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">In Rugendorf v. United States, supra, the Supreme Court sustained an affidavit, by an agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, resting on statements by informants who had \u201cfurnished reliable information * * * in the past.\u201d Although the affidavit pointed to independent evidence to support the informant\u2019s statements, the Court did not question the adequacy of the statement of reliability and concluded that there was a \u201csubstantial basis\u201d for crediting the hearsay. Id. 376 U.S. at 533, 84 S.Ct. at 828.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">In United States v. Ventresca, supra, 380 U.S. at 109, 85 S.Ct. at 746, the Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-7\">\u201c[W]here these circumstances are detailed, <em>where reason for crediting the source of the information is given, </em>and when a magistrate has found probable cause, <em>the courts should not invalidate the warrant by interpreting the affidavit in a hypertechnical, rather than a commonsense, manner. </em>Although in a particular case it may not be easy to determine when an affidavit demonstrates the existence of probable cause, the resolution of doubtful or marginal cases in this area should be largely determined by the preference to be accorded to warrants. Jones v. United States, supra, [362 U.S.] at 270 [80 S.Ct., at 735].\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">Under these standards we consider the affidavit in this case to be sufficient to support the issuance of a search warrant, although the case would have been much clearer had the length of time that Agent Benjamin had known and dealt with the informant, the number of times information had been received from the informant, and a statement as to the accuracy of such information, been presented to the Commissioner.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-12\">Appellant also complains that the trial judge refused to conduct a <em>voir dire </em>as to the circumstances of a post-arrest admission. Judge Tenney was sitting without a jury and could properly defer inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the admission until cross-examination. Appellant made no attempt on cross-examination to explore these circumstances, and, therefore, waived his right to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-13\">In view of our disposition of the case, we need not pass upon other points raised by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-14\">The court wishes to express to Theodore Krieger, Esq., its gratitude for his conscientious and able handling of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b510-13\">. Judge Tenney found that appellant had not been sufficiently connected with the heroin described in the indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b510-14\">. \u201cMotion for Return of Property and to Suppress Evidence. A person aggrieved by an unlawful search and seizure may move the district court for the district in which the property was seized for the return of the property and to suppress for the use as evidence anything so obtained on the ground that * * * (4) there was not probable cause for believing the existence of the grounds on which the warrant was issued * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b511-11\">. As the Supreme Court said in Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 173, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 1309, 93 L.Ed. 1879 (1949):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Anh\">\u201cThere is a large difference between the two things to be proved, [guilt and probable cause] as well as between the tribunals which determine them, and therefore a like difference in the <em>quanta </em>and modes of proof required to establish them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-18\">See United States v. Ventresca, 380 U.S. 102, 108, 85 S.Ct. 741, 13 L.Ed.2d 684 (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b513-8\">. A defendant may be able to challenge the veracity of recitals of \u201cprevious reliability\u201d by a motion to suppress pursuant to Rule 41(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. See Rugendorf v. United States, 376 U.S. 528, 532, 84 S.Ct; 825, 828, 11 L.Ed.2d 887 (1964) (\u201cassuming, for the purpose of this decision, that such attack may be made\u201d); King v. United States, 282 F.2d 398, 400 (4th Cir. 1960); United States v. Pearce, 275 F.2d 318 (7th Cir. 1960). But see Kenney v. United States, 81 U.S.App.D.C. 259, 157 F.2d 442 (1946). Such a procedure would diminish the danger of a warrant issuing on an officer\u2019s good faith misjudgment as to the reliability of an informant, as well as dangers of police laxity or bad faith. The temptation for officers to include unjustified recitals of informants\u2019 reliability would be reduced.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
