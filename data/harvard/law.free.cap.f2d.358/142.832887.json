The petitioner was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of six years.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-12\">The Government appeals from an order releasing the petitioner from custody on his motion to vacate the sentence filed under Section 2255 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (1948). The sentence was set aside on the ground that the indictment upon which the petitioner was convicted was defective in failing to name the person to whom he was alleged to have transferred the marihuana. The district court based its order upon our decision in Lauer v. United States, 320 F.2d 187 (7th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-13\">This court, sitting en banc in Collins v. Markley, 346 F.2d 230 (7th Cir. 1965), overruled the Lauer decision. In view of' the latest expression by this court on the subject, the order of the district court is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
