The appellants, prisoners in the New Mexico penitentiary, brought petitions for writs of coram nobis which the district court apparently treated as petitions for habeas corpus relief. The only point raised is that the appellants were committed to the wrong place of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-16\">Counsel argues that appellants were sentenced to the \u201cNew Mexico Penitentiary,\u201d N.M.S.A. 1953 \u00a7 42-1-1 places the management of the penitentiary in five commissioners who \u201cshall constitute a body corporate under the name and style of \u2018The Penitentiary of New Mexico.\u2019 \u201d N.M.S.A. 1953 \u00a7 41-13-7 provides that with unimportant exceptions all commitments shall run \u201cto the penitentiary of New Mexico.\u201d The misnomer, if one existed, was a clerical error which did not affect any substantial right of the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-20\">Counsel argues that \u201cThe Penitentiary of New Mexico\u201d was never incorporated in conformity with the New Mexico statutes. If appellants are in a position to raise this question, they do not negative the de facto existence of that corporation. The technical objections going to the alleged failure to comply with the constitutional and statutory requirements of New Mexico for the organization of corporations do not raise any issue under the United States Constitution and do not entitle them to federal habeas corpus relief. See Mooneyham v. State of Kansas, 10 Cir., 339 F.2d 209, 210, and Stewart v. Cox, 10 Cir., 344 F.2d 947. The petitions raised no issues requiring a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
