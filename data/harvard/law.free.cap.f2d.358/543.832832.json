Appellant then moved in this court for reduction to $5,000. Since no reasons had accompanied the District Court\u2019s initial order, we held the motion in abeyance and remanded the record so that the -District Court might advise us as to why it had found appellant a fit subject for bail and not a danger to the community, but had nevertheless set bond in an amount which the record indicated appellant could not meet. (See order dated January 4, 1966). Thereupon the Government moved the District Court to vacate its previous order and deny bail altogether, which motion was granted over appellant\u2019s opposition. Once again, the trial court gave no reasons for its action.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Under such circumstances, I would ordinarily remand the case and once again request the District Court to advise as to the \u201creasons and considerations\u201d for its denial of bail. \u201cBoth fairness to the appellant and this court\u2019s role in bail administration require the District Court to state its reasons for denying bail.\u201d Hansford v. United States, 353 F.2d 858 (Oct. 29, 1965) (dissenting opinion). And, where no reasons are given, \u201cthe decision cannot be accorded the weight it would otherwise merit.\u201d Rhodes v. United States, 275 F.2d 78 (4th Cir. 1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">However, since Judge Burger would deny bail and Judge McGowan would grant bail in the amount of $5,000,1 join with Judge McGowan solely for the purpose of reaching a decision in the case.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b594-8\">BURGER, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AXp\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">Appellant, who is not a resident in this jurisdiction, seeks release on his own personal recognizance or on bail pending determination of his appeal. He was indicted for second degree murder and the jury returned the verdict of manslaughter. On the basis of the record before us, he presents no non-frivolous question. More important, however, is the fact that he has now been convicted of a serious crime of violence and has a prior conviction in another jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
