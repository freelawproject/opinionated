The first is that the vessel owner\u2019s own fault was so glaring in quality and operative effect that this should constitute the sole proximate cause of the casualty. This would exculpate Appellant certainly as to Lutz\u2019 claim and theoretically as to those of the numerous by-stander claimants.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The second is that there is a total absence of evidence to sustain the finding that the design of the craft was defective for want of aft bilge ventilating ducts leading to aft ventilators in the transom.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-20\">These are typical fact questions whether land-based, maritime or amphibious. They readily pass muster on the clearly erroneous concept now so long absorbed by the admiralty. McAllister v. United States, 1954, 348 U.S. 19, 75 S.Ct. 6, 99 L.Ed. 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b349-15\">. However, the briefs inform us that Lutz, the vessel owner, was exonerated altogether in the limitation of shipowner\u2019s liability proceeding, 46 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 181 et seq., in which the Appellant-Manufacturer did not file any claim in the nature of a third-party impleader as to. the claims earlier filed against it in the instant proceeding.
