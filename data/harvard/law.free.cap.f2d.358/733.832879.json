The trial court disbelieved her testimony that she fell and injured her back. This disbelief was predicated upon several considerations. The libellant testified that she reported the alleged accident to the cook, the mate and the master. However, each of them denied receiving any such report. The libellant also failed to report the alleged accident to the respondent operator of the ship, although she knew of a rule requiring that such an accident be reported promptly. The libel-lant testified that she had suffered no other back injury. However, there was impressive testimony that she had suffered two earlier back injuries. A doctor to whom libellant had given her history shortly after the alleged accident testified that he did not believe that the libellant\u2019s condition had been caused by the alleged accident in the course of her employment. Thus, the record amply justified the court\u2019s refusal to find that libellant had suffered a shipboard injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-16\">In addition, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s refusal to reopen this case to permit the libellant to attempt to present corroboration of her story, particularly since she admits that no one other than herself witnessed the alleged accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-17\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
