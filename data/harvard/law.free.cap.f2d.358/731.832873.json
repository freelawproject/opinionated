The only question for our decision is whether there exists in the record an adequate evidentiary basis for the decision. Cleveland v. C.I.R., 335 F.2d 473 (3rd Cir. 1964) and the cases therein cited. Upon an examination of the record we are convinced that the Tax Court\u2019s findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence and its conclusion is in accord with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">The decision of the Tax Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
