(See, Memorandum of Decision [on defendant\u2019s motion for separate trial of issues]), filed herein May 19, 1964.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-7\">\u2018Apart from this evidence and this theory of the case, the evidence is further clearly to the effect that Poole was not the inventor of the examples added by the application of December 18, 1959, which form the basis of the specifications of claims 3, 4 and 5.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The evidence also clearly shows that the particular form of the product embodied in these claims is a nonsubstantial varition from Poole\u2019s original specifications of November 12, 1957<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and, further, that any asserted differences between the composition publicly used, on sale, and sold and other claims of the patent are mere improvements or minor variations.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-14\">\u201cWe agree with appellees that these findings are supported by the evidence. \u201cThe judgment of the district court is affirmed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-15\">With this change, the petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"A9I\">.
