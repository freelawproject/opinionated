The defendant has attempted to appeal from that order and from the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion for a directed verdict of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-22\"> We need not detail all of the circumstances which, in the Government\u2019s view, abundantly support an inference that the defendant transported the vehicle in interstate commerce, for we are without jurisdiction to consider the appeal. We are authorized by 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1291 to review final decisions of the District Court. No sentence has been imposed upon the defendant. A new trial having been ordered, the denial of the motion for a directed verdict of acquittal is not now reviewable. United States v. Swidler, 5 Cir., 207 F.2d 47; see also United States v. Brown, 4 Cir., 301 F.2d 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-23\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
