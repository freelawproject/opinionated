This judgment is based upon royalties on a certain \u201cBV\u201d machine manufactured and sold by New Britain, which uses mechanisms covered by U. S. Patent No. 2,872,-853 (application No. 400,531). Plaintiff s-appellees (referred to herein as \u201cYeo et al.\u201d) are a group of twenty-four former stockholders of Hoern &amp; Dilts, Inc., a Michigan corporation which was dissolved in 1955, and are the owners of the aforesaid patent as assignees of this corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-19\">Case No. 16,211 is an appeal by New Britain from an order of the district court dismissing its action against Yeo et al. for the recovery of royalties alleged to have been paid by mistake and without consideration in the amount of $207,193.-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-20\">Jurisdiction in both cases is- based upon diversity of citizenship. This opinion will be devoted to case No. 16,287 except where otherwise indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-21\">\n<em>1) The three contracts at issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b449-22\">This action is for breach of contract. Three contracts are involved, referred to herein as the 1946 contract, the 1950 contract and the 1955 contract. The patent in question, No. 2,872,853, was issued to J. H. Hoern, inventor, February 10, 1959. The application for this patent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>was filed by Mr. Hoern December 28, 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">New Britain is a manufacturer and seller of industrial machines. The machine here in question is of a type known as a rotary-cam actuated boring machine. This type of machine falls generally into one of three classes, namely: (1) \u201cindexing\u201d machines, or (2) \u201ccontinuous\u201d machines, or (3) \u201cnon-indexing, non-eontinuous\u201d machines. The BV machine here involved is of the third class, i. e., \u201cnon-indexing, non-eontinuous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">In 1946 and prior thereto J. H. Hoern and Carl E. Dilts were engaged in business as a partnership designing and building machine tools. Mr. Hoern is now dead and Yeo is the administrator of his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">The 1946 Contract</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">On March 28, 1946, these two individuals entered into a licensing agreement with New Britain. This contract stated that the licensors, Hoern and Dilts, \u201chave been and now are developing cam and pneumatic actuated' type boring machines;\u201d that certain improvements in cam and pneumatic actuated type boring machines were disclosed in patent application No. 642,352 (later granted as Patent No. 2,641,146) and in application for U. S. Patents then in course of preparation (this reference is to application No. 671,477 which was filed May 22, 1946, and for which the patent was issued November 24, 1953, as No. 2,659,961); and that the exclusive right and license to manufacture and sell the said boring machines was granted to New Britain, except in certain particulars therein provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-12\">The pertinent licensing language of the 1946 contract is quoted in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-13\">Additionally the agreement provided that Hoern and Dilts would disclose to New Britain any invention or improvements relating to the said machines, without further royalty payments.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>In September 1946, the Hoern and Dilts Corporation, hereinafter referred to as \u201cH &amp; D, Inc.\u201d, was formed, with Messrs. Hoern and Dilts holding a majority of the stock. H &amp; D, Inc. engaged in the manufacture and sale of \u201cindexing\u201d and \u201ccontinuous\u201d rotary cam actuated boring machines.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The 1950 Contract</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">In 1950 New Britain discovered that H &amp; D Inc. was also engaged in the manufacture and sale of a type -of \u201cnon-indexing, non-continuous\u201d boring machines. New Britain protested to the individuals and the corporation that this action was an infringement of the exclusive rights granted by the 1946 contract. Two new agreements were executed, one between New Britain and H &amp; D Inc., and the other between New Britain and Messrs. Hoern and Dilts as individuals. The agreement between the two corporations provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-7\">\u201c2. H &amp; D agrees to cease forthwith and not to resume the manufacture or sale of Non-indexing Type Boring Machines of the general type heretofore manufactured and sold by it and which New Britain contends are covered by the said exclusive license which New Britain did acquire from Joseph H. Hoern and Carl E. Dilts by agreement of March 28, 1946.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-14\">The new licensing contract which was executed in 1950 between New Britain and the individuals Hoern and Dilts provided that the 1946 agreement \u201cbe amended by substituting therefor\u201d the new agreement. The 1950 contract granted New Britain the exclusive license to manufacture and sell \u201csaid Rotary-Cam Actuated Boring Machines, including machines of the general type shown in Blue Print T-300 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> annexed hereto,\u201d and including improvements thereto described and claimed in patent applications No. 642,352 and No. 671,477 (the same two applications mentioned in the 1946 agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-15\">Pertinent parts of the 1950 agreement, which will be discussed later in more detail, are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>The 1955 Contract</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">In 1955 New Britain purchased the assets of H &amp; D Inc., and that corporation was liquidated. Two new agreements were entered into: (1) covering the purchase and sale of the assets of the liquidated corporation, which expressly-reserved in H &amp; D Inc. title to its patents and patent applications, and (2) a patent licensing agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">In the \u201cRepresentations and Acknowl-edgement\u201d section of the 1955 licensing contract, the parties identified various patents owned by H &amp; D Inc., including the two patents referred to in the 1946 and 1950 agreements; and patent application No. 400,531 (later granted as No. 2,872,853), which is the subject of the present litigation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">The granting clause of the 1955 contract is quoted in the margin.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Under the language of the 1955 contract quoted in footnotes five and six, patent application No. 400,531 (later granted as patent No. 2,872,853) is included within the term \u201cletters patent and patent rights\u201d upon which royalties were to be paid by New Britain, unless excluded by the \u201cspecial acknowledgment\u201d paragraph (footnote 7) which is discussed later in this opinion and unless included in the exclusive license granted to New Britain by the 1950 contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">It is reemphasized that application No. 400,531 referred to in footnote 5 was later granted as Patent No. 2,872,853 on February 10, 1959. It is conceded by New Britain that the mechanisms of this patent are used in the BV machine involved in this litigation. The claim of Yeo et al. for royalties is based upon the use of patent No. 2,872,853 with respect to the BV machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">New Britain contends, however, that the exclusive right to this patent was granted to it by Messrs. Hoern and Dilts under the terms of the 1946 and 1950 contracts and that this patent is excluded by the \u201cspecial acknowledgement\u201d paragraph of the 1955 contract (quoted <em>infra </em>in footnote 7); and it therefore owes no royalties on this BV machine under the 1955 contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">\n<em>2) Holding of district court</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">The case was originally tried at various sittings by the late District Judge Frank A. Picard, who died without announcing a decision. Following the death of Judge Picard the case was assigned to District Judge Stephen J. Roth. Thereupon by stipulation it was agreed that the case would be submitted to Judge Roth upon the transcript of the proceedings, arguments and briefs of counsel, and proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">In rendering a judgment against New Britain, it was the reasoning of the district court that, under the provisions of paragraph (1) (e) quoted in footnote 5, it was stated that at the time of the execution of the 1955 contract H &amp; D Inc. was the owner of patent application Serial No. 400,531, filed December 28, 1953, which was then pending. Judge Roth emphasized that, after listing all the patents and patent applications then owned by H &amp; D Inc., paragraph (1) concluded with this language;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-11\">\u201cAll of the letters patent, patent applications, licenses and other rights referred to in this paragraph (1) shall be referred to hereinafter in the aggregate and for convenience only as \u2018letters patent and patent rights.\u2019 \u201d (See footnote 6).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>The district judge then pointed out that \u201cparagraph 3 provides for the licensing of the \u2018letters patent and patent rights\u2019 \u201d owned by H &amp; D Inc. and payment of royalties thereon by New Britain.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">The court then concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">\u201cThe result urged upon the Court by the defendant would require two things: disregarding the plain and explicit language of the 1955 agreement between the parties and interpolating into the 1950 agreement between them, language which is not there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">\u201cThe Court finds that it was the agreement and the intention of the parties that the defendant pay royalties to Hoern and Dilts, Inc., on the \u2018BV\u2019 contour machine, which admittedly uses mechanisms covered by patent application number 400,531.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">\n<em>8) Is the BV machine within the scope of the 1950 contract?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">New Britain contends that, under the terms of the 1946 and 1950 contracts, it acquired exclusive rights to <em>all </em>\u201cnon-indexing, non-continuous\u201d machines for which Messrs. Hoern and Dilts then had applications pending, and all such machines for which Messrs. Hoern and Dilts thereafter might obtain patents; that the 1946 and 1950 contracts encompassed \u201cnon-indexing, non-continuous\u201d machines broadly as a class; that the BV machine here involved falls within the grant of the 1950 contract, even though the application for the patent whose mechanisms are used in this machine was not filed until 1953 and the patent was not issued until 1959; and that the 1955 contract relates exclusively to \u201cindexing\u201d and \u201ccontinuous\u201d machines, and not to \u201cnon-indexing, non-continuous machines\u201d such as the BV machine here involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">In support of this contention, New Britain relies strongly upon the \u201cspecial acknowledgement\u201d paragraph of the 1955 contract, which is set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">This \u201cspecial acknowledgement\u201d language makes it clear that the 1955 contract was not intended to affect any rights which had been acquired by New Britain under the 1946 and 1950 contracts. If an exclusive license to patent No. 2,872,853 in fact was granted to New Britain by the 1950 contract, it is excluded from the 1955 contract by the terms of the \u201cspecial acknowledgement\u201d paragraph (footnote 7). If New Britain is correct in its interpretation of the \u201cspecial acknowledgement\u201d paragraph and the 1950 contract, it necessarily would follow that it would owe no royalties to Yeo et al. under the 1955 contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-13\">The controlling question to be determined then is whether by the 1950 contract Messrs. Hoern and Dilts relinquished and transferred to New Britain, without payment of additional royalties, exclusive rights to all inventions for which they might thereafter apply and be granted patents relating to \u201cnon-indexing, non-continuous\u201d types of boring machines. More specifically, the question is whether patent No. 2,872,853 whose mechanisms admittedly are used in the BV machines (for which application was filed in 1953, and was pending in 1955, and which was granted in 1959) is nothing more than an improvement on the earlier patents used in the rotary:cam <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>actuated boring machines licensed to New Britain in 1950.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">The rule for interpreting a contract assigning future patents and future improvements is well stated in DeLong Corp. v. Lucas, 176 F.Supp. 104 (S.D.N.Y.), affirmed 278 F.2d 804 (C.A. 2), cert. denied. 364 U.S. 833, 81 S.Ct. 71, 5 L.Ed.2d 58, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-5\">\u201cIt is well settled that an agreement to assign a patent and improvements thereon covers only improvements existing at the time the agreement was entered into unless the language specifically refers to future improvements. The law does not look favorably upon covenants which place \u2018a mortgage on a man\u2019s brain, to bind all its future products\u2019. Aspinwall Manufacturing Co. v. Gill, C.C.D. N.J., 32 F. 697, 700. See, also Monsanto Chemical Works v. Jaeger, D.C. W.D.Pa., 31 F.2d 188; American Cone &amp; Wafer Co. v. Consolidated Wafer Co., 2 Cir., 247 F. 335; Allison Bros. Co. v. Allison, 144 N.Y. 21, at page 29, 38 N.E. 956, at page 958. As was said in Allison, to effect an assignment of future improvements to a patent which the inventor may thereafter produce \u2018the language of the contract must be very plain and evidence unmistakably that such an agreement was in the mind of the inventor\u2019.\u201d 176 F.Supp. at 127.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">In Mullins Mfg. Co. v. Booth, 125 F.2d 660, 663 (C.A. 6), this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-7\">\u201cCourts of equity are loath to give their aid by construction to a contract, the enforcement of which will constitute a mortgage for life on the inventor\u2019s brain, and bind all his future products.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">A contract assigning future improvements and future inventions will be enforced only where the language evidencing such an intention is clear and convincing. In Ogden v. General Printing Ink Corp., 37 F.Supp. 572, 577 (D. Md.), the court quoted with approval the following language from Williston on Contracts, Rev.Ed., vol. 5, \u00a7 1643A, page 6414:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-9\">\u201cThe governing rule in this class of cases is that where the product of an inventive mind is sought to be appropriated under an agreement to assign to another, the language of the agreement must be clear and show an unmistakable intention that the particular matter covered by the invention or patent is within the intention of the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">Such a contract is to be strictly construed against the grant of inventions that may be perfected in the future. Gas Tool Patents Corp. v. Mould, 133 F.2d 815, 818 (C.A. 7); Briggs v. M &amp; J Diesel Locomotive Filter Co., 228 F.Supp. 26, 31 (N.D.Ill.), aff'd, 342 F.2d 573 (C.A. 7); cf. Gonser v. Leland Detroit Mfg. Co., 293 Mich. 196, 291 N.W. 631.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">We hold that the provisions of the 1950 contract are not sufficiently clear and free from ambiguity to meet the test announced and applied in the foregoing decisions; and that the language of this contract is not so specific as to embrace <em>all </em>future inventions that might be perfected by Messrs. Hoern and Dilts relating to the broad class of <em>all </em>\u201cnon-indexing, non-continuous\u201d boring machines. To the contrary, in granting an exclusive license to \u201csaid Rotary-Cam Actuated Boring Machines\u201d and future improvements thereon, the 1950 contract (see language quoted in footnote 4) by its terms includes (1) \u201cmachines of the general type shown in Blue Print T-300 annexed hereto\u201d (which concededly does not embrace Patent No. 2,872,853 here involved) ; and (2) \u201cimprovements thereto, as shown, described and claimed in U. S. applications, Serial No. 642,352, filed January 19, 1946, and Serial No. 671,477, filed May 22, 1946.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">The first \u201cwhereas\u201d clause in the 1950 contract (footnote 4) limits the term \u201cimprovements\u201d on Rotary-Cam Actuated Boring Machines to \u201ccertain improvements on said machines * * * shown, described and claimed in Applications for United States Patent, Serial Nos. 642,352 and 671,477.\u201d The granting clause in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>eludes \u201cany Letters Patent owned or controlled by Licensors, or either of them, which may be granted on applications now or hereafter filed, and disclosing improvements on or relating to said Boring Machines * * * \u201d The term \u201capplications * * * hereafter filed\u201d is limited expressly to applications \u201cdisclosing improvements on or relating to <em>said </em>Boring Machines.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The language of the disclosure clause of the 1950 contract is expressly limited to \u201cany improvements in rotary-cam actuated boring machines <em>of the type herein licensed.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">New Britain relies on both the 1946 and 1950 contracts. The latter is the controlling instrument defining the license granted to New Britain, since it amends the former contract by rewriting it in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">It is of significance that the 1950 contract contains language that is more restrictive than the 1946 contract in several respects:</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">(a) The granting clause of the 1946 contract contained a provision for \u201cdisclosing improvements on or relating to said boring machines <em>and similar machines\u201d. </em>The words \u201cand similar machines\u201d are omitted from the 1950 contract, in which the comparable provision reads: \u201cdisclosing improvements on or relating to <em>said </em>Boring Machines.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) The 1950 contract contains no provision requiring disclosure of improvements on or relating to \u201csimilar machines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">(b) The 1950 Contract used the term \u201crotary cam actuated boring machines\u201d instead of the more general term \u201cboring machines\u201d used in the 1946 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">(c) Another significant change between the 1946 contract and the 1950 contract is found in the disclosure clause. Under the 1946 contract, Messrs. Hoern and Dilts agreed to disclose to New Britain <em>\u2018\u2018any inventions, new designs, or methods of production </em>in or relating to boring machines made or owned or controlled by them or either of them,\u201d (emphasis supplied). Under the disclosure clause of the 1950 contract they agreed to disclose only \u201cany improvements in rotary-cam actuated boring machines <em>of the type herein licensed.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b456-12\">Thus, the scope of the exclusive license granted by Messrs. Hoern and Dilts to New Britain is more restricted under the 1950 contract than under the broader language of the 1946 contract. When the parties undertook to settle their dispute in 1950, they wrote more restrictive language into their revised agreement, indicating an intention not to make the exclusive grant so broad and all-inclusive as now asserted by New Britain.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-13\">In order to sustain its contention that Patent No. 2,872,853 comes within the scope of the exclusive license granted by the 1950 contract and accordingly that the patent whose mechanisms are used in the BY machine here in question is an exception within the special acknowledgement paragraph of the 1955 contract (footnote 7), New Britain must establish that this later patent is an \u201cimprovement on or relating to\u201d the boring machine covered by Patents Nos. 2,641,146 (application No. 642,352) and 2,659,961 (application No. 671,477), which are the only patent applications identified as improvements to boring machines covered by the 1950 contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-14\"> Assuming that there is sufficient ambiguity on this point to permit the introduction of evidence, the burden of proof would be upon New Britain to show that Patent No. 2,872,853, whose mechanisms are used in the BV machine, is an exception under the \u201cspecial acknowledgement\u201d paragraph of the 1955 contract. In this situation, the law as to the burden of proof is that \u201cA party who seeks advantage of an exception in a contractual stipulation as the basis of his claim is charged with the burden of proving facts necessary to bring himself within such exception.\u201d Davies Flying Service v. United States, 216 F.2d 104, 106 (C.A. 6). To like effect see 17A C.J.S. Contracts \u00a7 579, p. 1114.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>While this is a contract case and not a patent case, we have read the language of the claims of Patent No. 2,872,853. These claims do not demonstrate that this patent is an improvement upon the boring machines covered by Patent Nos. 2,641,-146 and 2,659,961, the application for which is referred to in the 1950 contract. The application for Patent No. 2,872,853 makes reference to four earlier United States patents and three foreign patents by number, but no reference is made to the two applications identified in the 1950 contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">New Britain\u2019s own advertising of the BV machine contradicts its contention that this machine is nothing more than an improvement over the boring machines licensed to it by the 1950 contract. The trade magazine \u201cMachinery,\u201d in its November 1960 issue, published an advertisement by New Britain regarding the BV machine, containing the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">\u201cBeyond a certain point, continued refinement of existing designs in machine tools ceases to make an appreciable contribution to performance. Thus in designing our New Series of Vertical Precision Boring Machines, we have incorporated several completely new design concepts to provide improved performance and greatly increase overall usefulness. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">\u201cIn order to take the fullest advantage of the precision inherent in cam control, long linkages between cams and slides have been eliminated. A pair of cams is mounted on a common shaft which is carried within the vertical slide. Since all slide actuating forces are contained in the vertical slide, both cams are directly adjacent to the slides they control and no outside forces are imposed on the slide ways. The result is maximum rigidity for heavy cuts coupled with extreme accuracy for close tolerance work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-9\">\u201cThis unique and eminently workable approach to contour turning and boring results in the highest order of accuracy on even the most complex pieces. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">In the issue of the trade magazine \u201cThe American Machinist\u201d dated January 11, 1960, and March 21, 1960, New Britain described its BV machine in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-11\">\u201cNew Britain Cam Actuated Vertical Precision Boring Machines offer an entirely new principle for more accurate boring and turning, plus compact exterior design and fast tooling. Bough cuts and finish cuts within close tolerances on the same set-up are characteristic. Standard models are available with maximum swing from 12\" to 17%\" in 10 or 15 horsepower.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-12\">\u201cHere are a few of the major new developments incorporated in these unusual machines. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-13\">Brochures issued by New Britain in 1958 and 1959 include the following language in describing the BV machine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-14\">\u201cThis unique captive cam shaft feature, through the elimination of long actuating linkage, has resulted in an extremely compact accessible and simplified design with the obvious important advantages in maintenance and repairs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-15\">New Britain\u2019s president testified as a witness and undertook to establish that the BV machine here involved is an improvement on the boring machines licensed by the 1950 contract. He further testified, however, that New Britain\u2019s above-quoted advertising was correct in describing the BV machine in question as offering \u201can entirely new principle for more accurate boring and tuning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-16\">We reemphasize that the 1955 contract expressly mentioned Patent Application No. 400,531, filed December 28, 1953, upon which Patent No. 2,872,853 thereafter was issued, and listed it among the patents and patent applications owned by H &amp; D Inc. This patent application is included in general terms among the \u201cletters patent and patent rights\u201d (footnote 6) upon which a non-exclusive license was\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>granted to New Britain in 1955 and for which royalties were to be paid. Since express language excluding this patent is not to be found in the \u201cspecial acknowl-edgement\u201d paragraph or elsewhere in the 1955 contract, we cannot assume that the parties intended to make an exception in the \u201cspecial acknowledgement\u201d paragraph as contended by New Britain. This patent application already was in existence at the time the 1955 contract was executed, having been filed two years earlier. If the parties had intended for the \u201cspecial acknowledgement\u201d paragraph to apply to this patent, assuredly they would have said so.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">We hold that New Britain has not established that the BV machine here in question and Patent No. 2,872,853 come within the 1950 contract or the \u201cspecial acknowledgement\u201d paragraph of the 1955 contract. Accordingly we agree with the finding of the district court that New Britain is liable to Yeo et al. for royalties on this machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">\n<em>k) The amount of the judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Under date of December 6, 1963, following the filing of his opinion, Judge Roth entered an order stating that the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-7\">\u201cFinds, in conformity with said opinion, that it was the agreement and the intention of the parties that the defendant pay royalties to Hoern &amp; Dilts, Inc., on the \u2018BV\u2019 contour machine, ' which admittedly uses mechanisms covered by patent application number 400,531;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">\u201cThe Court further finds that the rights of said Hoern &amp; Dilts, Inc., were duly assigned to plaintiffs upon its dissolution and as former stockholders of said company;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-9\">\u201cIt is therefore, ordered that the parties shall forthwith make an accounting between them to determine the amount of royalties due to date, together with interest at the rate of 5% computed from the due date of any royalty found to be due, and this Court retains jurisdiction of this matter pending such accounting and any problems relating to it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">Pursuant to this order, on January 28, 1964, New Britain filed an accounting which was sworn to by its president. This accounting contained the figures upon which the judgment was finally entered, except for minor corrections.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-12\">After a dispute had arisen between the parties concerning the accounting, another hearing was held at which Judge Roth suggested the appointment of a master to take an accounting. Counsel for New Britain responded that \u201cThere is no need for a Master,\u201d saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-13\">\u201cI think you misunderstood me when I said this was a massive job. What I was referring to as a massive job is the report which we submitted last January. This involved going into all transactions under the 1955 contract, all of our varieties of machines, their variations, the patents and patent claims. This job is not called for according to your Hon- or\u2019s rulings you just handed down. The job has been done as a matter of fact, all except for any machines which may have been sold since the end of 1963. As a matter of fact, one entire separate section of our report was plainly identified with BV transactions, so that job was done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-14\">\u201cThere is no need for a Master. If it is your pleasure as you have just stated to have an accounting for the BV machines we even included a schedule of what the interest would be as your Honor requested it and that interest was specific to the BV machines. So that the job is done and we can easily undertake to complete it up to the date of this hearing today.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-16\">It was agreed that plaintiffs would send two men to the Connecticut offices of New Britain in order to facilitate the matter of accounting and avoid the necessity of appointing a master. New Britain\u2019s attorney thereafter wrote a letter to the attorneys for Yeo et al., dated July 8, 1964, stating that only a few minor errors had been found in the previous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>account and \u201cthere would be a great savings of time and effort if the newly presented accounting for BV machines were merely to comprise a reproduction of the previous report.\u201d (This reference is to the sworn accounting filed January 28, 1964.) Thereupon, Yeo et al. made a report to the court as to the purported agreement of the parties in Connecticut and asked that a judgment be entered in the sum of $171,342.42 plus interest in the sum of $28,620.98.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">At a subsequent hearing on September 21, 1964, extended arguments were made as to whether the judgment should be based on (1) the figures set forth in the sworn accounting filed by New Britain January 28, 1964, or (2) on the figures set forth in New Britain\u2019s \u201ccorrected accounting\u201d hereinafter discussed. Yeo et al. contended that royalties on the BV machine should be computed at the rate of <em>five per cent of net sales </em>under Section 4(b) of the 1955 contract, which is applicable to \u201cHoern &amp; Dilts\u201d machines. New Britain contended that the correct basis of computation was <em>five per cent of the cost of mechanisms </em>under Section 4(c), which is applicable to machines other than \u201cHoern &amp; Dilts\u201d machines.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Judge Roth thereupon asked the attorney for New Britain whether, assuming the correct measure of royalties to be five per cent of net sales, as provided in Section 4(b) applicable to \u201cHoern &amp; Dilts\u201d machines, counsel would agree that the figures are accurate as set forth by New Britain in its sworn accounting of January 28,1964, as subsequently corrected by agreement of the parties. The answer of counsel was \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">Thus, the amount of the judgment entered by the district court is based upon figures set forth in a sworn accounting filed by New Britain and thereafter corrected and substantially verified by the parties. We hold that the district court\u2019s finding of the amount of royalties due is supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">\n<em>5) The \u201ccorrected accounting\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">On August 20, 1964, shortly before the judgment was entered, New Britain filed a \u201ccorrected accounting\u201d, alleging that the BV machine here involved was not a \u201cHoern &amp; Dilts\u201d machine, that New Britain had made a mistake by computing royalties at five per cent of net sales as provided under Section 4(b) for \u201cHoern &amp; Dilts\u201d machines, and that the correct amount owing under Section 4(c) of the 1955 contract was in the approximate sum of $7000, rather than the much larger sum indicated in its previous accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-12\">This \u201ccorrected accounting\u201d was not filed until after the ease had been tried over a period of more than four years on the theory that the BV machine in question is a \u201cHoern &amp; Dilts\u201d machine and after the earlier accounting had been submitted by New Britain on this theory. Interrogatory No. 50, which was filed early in the proceedings, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"amo-dedup-0\">\u201cHave you used any of the mechanisms embodying any of the six claims which were allowed in Patent No. 2,872,853 <em>on any other machine other than the so-called Hoern &amp; Dilts machines? </em>If so, state upon what machines they have been used.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-13\">The answer was: \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-14\">Both the original accounting and the \u201ccorrected accounting\u201d were before the district court at the time the judgment was entered. We cannot say that the district judge erred in entering judgment upon the figures set forth in the original accounting as substantially verified by agreement of the parties, rather than accepting the \u201ccorrected accounting\u201d based upon a belated change in New Britain\u2019s contention which was contrary to the positions and conduct of the parties throughout the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-15\">\n<em>6) New Britain\u2019s counterclaim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b459-16\">As a part of its sworn accounting of January 28, 1964, New Britain asserted that it had reexamined the entire history of its operations under the 1955 contract in the light of the opinion of the district court, and found that it had made overpayments of royalties totaling $207,-193.36.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>On April 17, 1964, New Britain submitted a motion for leave to amend its answer and file a counterclaim in the amount of $207,193.36, which was denied by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">The complaint of Yeo et al. was filed March 30, 1960, and New Britain\u2019s motion to amend its answer and file a counterclaim was not filed until April 17, 1964, after the prolonged trial had been completed and a decision on the merits adverse to New Britain had been announced by the district court. The record shows that at a hearing on March 16, 1962, Judge Picard inquired whether or not any counterclaim would be filed and that counsel for New Britain replied, \u201cNo counterclaim.\u201d Under these circumstances we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in denying New Britain\u2019s motion to amend its answer and file a counterclaim so late in the proceedings. Shwab v. Doelz, 229 F.2d 749, 753 (C.A. 7); Runkle v. Nong Kimny, 105 U.S.App.D.C. 285, 266 F.2d 689, 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">\n<em>7) Case No. 16,211</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">In the second case New Britain sued Yeo et al. for the recovery of royalties alleged to have been paid by mistake and without consideration in the amount of $207,193.36. This action concededly is based upon the same contentions as outlined above with respect to its \u201ccorrected accounting\u201d and counterclaim and seeks to recover identically the same amount as asserted in the counterclaim. Yeo et al. filed a motion to dismiss which was sustained by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">We hold that the right of action which New Britain undertakes to assert by its separate action in case No. 16,211 falls within the compulsory counterclaim provisions of Rule 13(a), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The claim: (1) arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the claim of Yeo et al.; (2) was matured (at least in substantial part<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>) and owned by New Britain at the time Yeo et al. served their complaint in case No. 16,287; (3) did not require for its adjudication the presence of third parties of whom the court could not acquire jurisdiction; and (4) was not, at the time the original action was commenced, the subject matter of another pending action. 1A Barron &amp; Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure, \u00a7 394 (Wright Ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">\u201cThis rule is mandatory. It requires that such a counterclaim be pleaded and adjudicated or else all right of action thereon is foreclosed.\u201d Ibid at p. 565.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-12\">In Southern Construction Co. Inc. v. Pickard, 371 U.S. 57, 60, 83 S.Ct. 108, 110, 9 L.Ed.2d 31, the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-13\">\u201cThe requirement that counterclaims arising out of the same transaction or occurrence as the opposing party\u2019s claim \u2018shall\u2019 be stated in the pleadings was designed to prevent multiplicity of actions and to achieve resolution in a single lawsuit of all disputes arising out of common matters. The Rule was particularly directed against one who failed to assert a counterclaim in one action and then instituted a second action in which that counterclaim became the basis of the complaint. See, <em>e. g., </em>United States v. Eastport S. S. Corp., 2 Cir., 255 F.2d 795, 801-802.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-14\">Having failed to file a timely counterclaim in case No. 16,287 until af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>ter the district judge had announced his decision on the merits, New Britain is now foreclosed from asserting the same claim in the form of a separate action. Under the circumstances, we hold that the district court did not err in dismissing the complaint in case No. 16,211.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">New Britain relies upon Rule 13(f).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We previously have held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow the filing of the counterclaim so late in the proceeding, even though earlier filing may have been due to \u201coversight, inadvertence or excusable neglect.\u201d After having heard and disposed of this difficult and protracted case on its merits, the district court was not required to permit New Britain to re-litigate the case, either by a belated counterclaim or by a new and separate action.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">We affirm the judgment in case No. 16,287 and the order dismissing the complaint in case No. 16,211.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b450-9\">. \u201c1.
