The issue is whether such taxes were compelled and paid through an assessment erroneously disallowing a depreciation deduction claimed by taxpayer for the tax year in which an asset was sold for a price greater than its adjusted cost basis at the beginning of such year. Judgment below was for the taxpayer. 227 F.Supp. 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-20\">The government concedes that the issue presented upon appeal is the same as that considered by the Supreme Court in Fribourg Navigation Company, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 86 S.Ct. 862, decided March 7, 1966, and wherein that Court rejected the Commissioner\u2019s contentions as here presented by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-21\">The judgment is accordingly affirmed upon authority of <em>Fribourg.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
