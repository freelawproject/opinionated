Petitioner has been continuously present in this country from that time except that in November, 1961, while living in Santa Paula, California,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he drove to Mexico for a Sunday sightseeing trip, remaining there about two hours, and was then readmitted to this country as a United States citizen. In 1962 he voluntarily appeared before the Immigration and Naturalization Service and confessed he was illegally in the United States. Deportation proceedings were then commenced against him. In these proceedings petitioner admitted deport-ability and applied for suspension of deportation under section 244 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The special inquiry offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>cer held that petitioner was not eligible for suspension of deportation because by reason of the two-hour trip to Mexico he had not been \u201cphysically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than seven years\u201d as required by the Immigration and Nationality Act, \u00a7 244(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a). The evidence of record established also that the petitioner was inducted in the United States Army in California on August 8, 1958, and was honorably discharged on July 30, 1960, after one year, eleven months and twenty-three days of active service. The special inquiry officer also held that this service was not sufficient under \u00a7 244(b) of the act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(b), which provides that the requirement of continuous physical presence in the United States shall not be applicable to an alien who has served for a minimum period of 24 months in an active duty status in the armed forces of the United States and was separated from such service under honorable conditions. The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed the holding of the special inquiry officer. A motion for reconsideration was made, asking the Board to reconsider the case in the light of the decision in Wadman v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 329 F.2d 812 (9th Cir.), decided March 24, 1964, and not mentioned in the Board\u2019s decision which was rendered two months later. After a hearing upon reconsideration the Board of Immigration Appeals declined to alter their prior holding. The Board stated, however, \u201capart from finding the respondent ineligible on the ground that he lacks the required physical presence, we would have no reason to rule the respondent either ineligible for relief or undeserving of relief.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Petitioner\u2019s application for review by this court was timely filed and this court has jurisdiction of said petition. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">In Wadman v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, supra, this court had occasion to consider the case of a petitioner who had spent five days below the border in Mexico. It was on the basis of this five-day absence from the United States that the Board of Immigration Appeals ruled that the petitioner there did not meet the requirement of being physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than seven years immediately preceding his application. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-8\">In Rosenberg v. Fleuti (1963) 374 U.S. 449, 83 S.Gt. 1804, 10 L.Ed.2d 1000 the Supreme Court recently inquired into the circumstances under which absence from the country should affect an alien\u2019s deportability. There the alien had made a visit to Mexico of \u201cabout a couple of hours.\u201d It was held that his return to the United States did not per se constitute an \u201centry\u201d as defined by \u00a7 101(a) (13) of the Act (for purposes of determining whether he could be deported on the ground of being excludable at entry); * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-9\">The court, 374 U.S. at page 461, 83 S.Ct. at page 1811, 10 L.Ed.2d 1000, states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-10\">\u201cIn making such a casual trip the alien would seldom be aware that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>was possibly walking into a trap, for the insignificance of a brief trip to Mexico or Canada bears little rational relation to the punitive consequences of subsequent excludability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGY\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-4\">The Service seeks to distinguish Fleuti on the ground that there the court was dealing with an entry and that her.e we are faced with a concept of continuous physical presence. We do not regard this distinction as at all significant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ar-dedup-0\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-6\">Here there can be no question of the sufficiency of physical presence. The question is whether there was a sufficient continuity. In our judgment the term \u201ccontinuous\u201d is no more subject to a hard and fast construction than is the term \u201cintended.\u201d The question is whether the interruption, viewed in balance with its consequences, can be said to have been a significant one under the guides laid down in Fleuti. (329 F.2d at 815-816)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">In <em>Fleuti, </em>supra, the Supreme Court further stated, referring to the visit by Fleuti of \u201cabout a couple of hours\u201d duration to Mexico:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-8\">We conclude, then, that it effectuates congressional purpose to construe the intent exception to \u00a7 101(a) (13) as meaning an intent to depart in a manner which can be regarded as meaningfully interruptive of the alien\u2019s permanent residence. (374 U.S. at 462, 83 S.Ct. at 1812)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-15\">Similarly, here, the petitioner\u2019s visit of about two hours to Mexico should not be regarded as meaningfully interruptive of his continuous presence in the United States for about ten years. We adhere to our holding in <em>Wadman </em>and hold that petitioner\u2019s brief visit to Mexico did not bar him from consideration for suspension of deportation as a matter of law. In deciding whether to permit an application for suspension of deportation when the issue is physical presence \u201cin the United States for a continuous period of not less than seven years immediately preceding the date of such application,\u201d the Board must determine the significance of an absence from the United States during that time under the standard set down in Fleuti.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b203-16\">In this case the respondent attempts to distinguish the holdings in <em>Fleuti </em>and in <em>Wadman </em>by pointing out that the original entry in <em>Fleuti </em>of the alien was a legal one, whereas in this case the petitioner\u2019s original entry was illegal. The respondent argues that the benefits of the construction given \u00a7 244(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a), by <em>Wadman </em>should be applied only to aliens whose original entry into this country was legal and not to those who entered illegally. There is nothing in the statute or in Wadman<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>which supports such a distinction. In <em>Wadman </em>this court recognized that it would be consistent with the policies underlying this statute not to construe it in a manner which would restrict the ease with which applications for suspension of deportation could be made.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-4\">The apparent purpose of the grant of discretion to the Attorney General is to enable that officer to ameliorate hardship and injustice which otherwise would result from a strict and technical application of the law. A strict and technical construction of the language in which this grant of discretion is couched could frustrate its purpose. A liberal construction would not open the door to suspension of deportation in cases of doubtful merit. It would simply tend to increase the scope of the Attorney General\u2019s review and thus his power to act in amelioration of hardship. (329 F.2d at 817) <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The statute, since it refers only to an \u201calien\u201d, does not permit the respondent\u2019s construction, for it states that discretion may be exercised \u201cin the case of an alien who applied to the Attorney General for suspension of deportation and * * * has been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than seven years * *</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">In view of our opinion as stated above, it is not necessary for us to determine petitioner\u2019s second contention concerning the sufficiency of petitioner\u2019s army service.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">The case is remanded to the Board of Immigration Appeals for action as may be proper in the light of this decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b201-16\">.

In discussing whether an absence indicated \u201can intent to depart in a manner which can be regarded as meaningfully interruptive of the alien\u2019s permanent residence\u201d the Court in <em>Fleuti </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-10\">One major factor relevant to whether such intent can be inferred is, of course, the length of time the alien is absent. Another is the purpose of the visit, for if the purpose of leaving the country is to accomplish some object which is itself contrary to some policy reflected in our immigration laws, it would appear that the interruption of residence thereby occurring would properly be regarded as meaningful. Still another is whether the alien has to procure any travel documents in order to make his trip, since the need to obtain such items might well cause the alien to consider more fully the implications involved in his leaving the country. (374 U.S. at 462, 83 S.Ct. at 1812)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-18\">There is nothing in the record in the instant case from which the inference could be drawn that petitioner Git Poo Wong intended a meaningful interruption of his United States residence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b203-19\">. In <em>Wadman </em>the petitioner\u2019s original entry was illegal and was the basis for his deportation order under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, \u00a7 241(a) (1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a) (1), as one excludable under the act, \u00a7 212(a) (9), 8 U.S.O. \u00a7 1182(a) (9) (a previous conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude). Petitioner Git Poo Wong was deportable under \u00a7 241(a) (1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251(a) (1), as one excludable under \u00a7 212(a) (20), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>(20) (entry without valid immigrant visa). Although there may be differences between the two cases, respondent has not indicated what the differences may be; however, in light of our holding, we need not determine whether the facts in <em>Wadman </em>are on all fours with the facts in the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b204-8\">.
