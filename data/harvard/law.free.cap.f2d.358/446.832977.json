He admitted the distribution of the circular attached to the petition, but denied \u201cthat his present product is either essentially the same product as that previously distributed or that such product is based on essentially the same misrepresentations or on any misrepresentations at all.\u201d He asserted that he lacked notice of the charges against him and was deprived of the opportunity to meet them in the absence of knowledge of the contents of the medical report upon which the general allegations in the petition were based. He requested a hearing, alleging that the difference in the chemical composition of the two products and the effect of \u201cActivators\u201d upon the human body would be established by the testimony of witnesses at the hearing. He stated that he would present testimony of expert witnesses to controvert any such witnesses produced by the General Counsel, and he listed three proposed witnesses by name: one a physician who \u201cwould testify to the chemical content and effect on the human body of [appellant\u2019s] product\u201d; and two who \u201cwould testify as to the efficacy of [appellant\u2019s] product to negate fraud.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">The General Counsel responded by filing a \u201csupplemental petition.\u201d He opposed the hearing requested by appellant. He contended that the advertising circulars which were before the Judicial Officer established that the two products were sold under essentially the same representations. He asserted that the report of his medical expert (a Dr. Campbell), a copy of which was said to be attached to the \u201csupplemental petition,\u201d established that the difference in ingredients had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>no therapeutic significance with respect to the purpose for which the products were offered. He argued that appellant\u2019s answer offered nothing but denials, and that \u201cabsent submission by [appellant] of a medical report or some acceptable medical affirmation tending to establish the alleged dissimilarity of products,\u201d no \u201ctriable issues exist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Five days later, and before the \u201csupplemental petition\u201d had been served upon appellant, the Judicial Officer denied appellant\u2019s request for hearing and issued the order sought by the General Counsel. The Judicial Officer held that under Rule 30 a hearing was discretionary, and that no hearing was necessary in the circumstances of this case. On the merits, the Judicial Officer held that the two products, and the representations under which they were sold, were essentially the same. \u201cLooking at the advertisements for \u2018Stagg Bullets\u2019 and that of \u2018Activators,\u2019 \u201d the Judicial Officer wrote, \u201cone can see that some changes have been made but they are not significant.\u201d As to the identity of the two products, the Judicial Officer continued, \u201cThe formula for \u2018Stagg Bullets\u2019 and that of \u2018Activators\u2019 is the same with the exception of the ingredient \u2018damiana.\u2019 The directions are the same on both bottles.\u201d The Judicial Officer concluded, \u201cThe similarity of the advertisements, those of the formula, and those of the directions show that the present product is so much like the product of \u2018Stagg Bullets\u2019 and the advertisements are so similar that the Judicial Officer hereby issues a supplemental fraud order to cover the name \u2018Eroc Druid\u2019 at Los Angeles, California.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">Appellant petitioned for revocation of the order. He alleged that he was not served with a copy of the General Counsel\u2019s \u201csupplemental petition\u201d until after the Judicial Officer\u2019s order was issued; and was not, even then, furnished with a copy of Dr. Campbell\u2019s report \u2014 notwithstanding the recitation in the \u201csupplemental petition\u201d that a copy was attached. Appellant contended that he was entitled by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and by the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act to notice of the contents of Dr. Campbell\u2019s report, to an opportunity to reply to the \u201csupplemental petition,\u201d and to a hearing on the issues. Appellant\u2019s petition for revocation was denied. A copy of Dr. Campbell\u2019s report was mailed to appellant with the order of denial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">Appellant brought suit in the district court to enjoin the enforcement of the order. Judgment was entered denying relief. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">Postal fraud proceedings under 39 U.S.C.A, \u00a7 4005 must comply with sections 5, 6, and 7 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 60 Stat. 239 (1946), 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1004-1006 [Cates v. Haderlein, 342 U.S. 804, 72 S.Ct. 47, 96 L.Ed. 609 (1951), reversing 189 F.2d 369 (7th Cir.); Olesen v. Stanard, 227 F.2d 785, 788 n.7 (9th Cir. 1955); see also Stanard v. Olesen, 74 S.Ct. 768, 770, 98 L.Ed. 1151 (1954) (Mr. Justice Douglas); Door v. Donaldson, 90 U.S.App.D.C. 188, 195 F.2d 764 (1952); see generally, Comment, 35 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 1201 (1960); Cutler, 47 Nw.U.L.Rev. 72 (1952)]; and we see no basis for distinguishing, in this regard, between initial fraud order proceedings and \u201csupplemental\u201d ones.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>The government argues that the hearing requirement of section 5&lt;b) of the Act was not applicable to the 1964 \u201csupplemental\u201d proceeding because the issues of fraud and identity of the violator had been finally determined in the 1962 proceeding, and the only issue before the Judicial Officer when a \u201csupplemental\u201d order was sought was \u201cwhether the same product or a similar product was being advertised with the same representation and by the same operator of the business.\u201d But even if we assume that the issue of actual intent to deceive [Reilly v. Pinkus, 338 U.S. 269, 276-277, 70 S.Ct. 110, 94 L.Ed. 63 (1949); Brandenfels v. Day, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 374, 316 F.2d 375, 378 n. 4 (1963)] could be decided without a hearing, the issue which the government propounds could be resolved only in accordance with the requirements of section 5 of the Administrative Procedure Act. The burden rested upon the Post Office Department, as proponent of the order (60 Stat. 241 (1946), 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1006(c)), to at least establish that the two products were essentially the same and were offered for sale by appellant on essentially the same representations. And with respect to these issues appellant was entitled to notice of the matters of fact asserted (60 Stat. 239 (1946), 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1004(a) (3)), and, if the facts asserted were in good faith controverted, to an opportunity to submit rebuttal evidence and conduct cross-examination. 60 Stat. 241 (1946), 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1006(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The government contends that summary proceedings are essential to prevent \u201cfly-by-night\u201d operators from evading the statute simply by changing the name, address, and inconsequential details of their fraudulent enterprise. The Department\u2019s claim of necessity has been subjected to searching criticism. See 31 Ind.L.J. 257, 266-68 (1956). Other remedies are available to the government [Hart, 11 Food Drug Cosmetic L.J. 245, 258-60 (1956)], including criminal sanctions. 62 Stat. 763 (1948) as amended, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1341; 62 Stat. 763 (1948), 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1342; see Comment, 35 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 1201, 1204-05 (1960). Moreover, Congress has indicated that the power conferred upon the Postmaster General to refuse to deliver mail to persons conducting fraudulent schemes must be \u201czealously watched and strictly confined\u201d [Hannegan v. Esquire, Inc., 327 U.S. 146, 156 n. 18, 66 S.Ct. 456, 90 L.Ed. 586 (1946); see also Toberoff v. Summerfield, 256 F.2d 91, 94 (9th Cir. 1958)]; and there is substantial evidence that Congress intended to deny the Postmaster General the power, which he now asserts, to base such a final refusal upon a summary determination. In 1960 Congress adopted the provision now found in 39 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4007, authorizing the district court \u201cupon a showing of probable cause to believe the statute is being violated\u201d to enter a temporary restraining order directing the detention of defendant\u2019s incoming mail pending conclusion of administrative proceedings under 39 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 4005 or \u00a7 4006. It is unlikely in the extreme that Congress would have required that a temporary restraining order be conditioned upon a showing of probable cause in a judicial hearing, but at the same time would have intended that an administrative order detaining mail permanently could be issued without any hearing at all.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>We do not mean to suggest that the Postmaster General may never issue a fraud order without first holding a full, trial-type hearing. We do not assume that Congress intended the Postmaster General to perform a useless act [cf. United States v. Storer Broadcasting Co., 351 U.S. 192, 205, 76 S.Ct. 763, 100 L.Ed. 1081 (1956)]; and the Postmaster General would not be without power to dispense with an evidentiary hearing where it clearly appeared from the administrative record that there was no genuine issue of material fact. Cf. Railway Express Agency, Inc. v. CAB, 345 F.2d 445, 120 U.S.App.D.C. 228 (1965); NLRB v. J. R. Simplot Co., 322 F.2d 170 (9th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">But this doctrine cannot justify the action taken here. Perhaps the essential identity of the representations regarding the two products was susceptible of summary determination from the face of the advertising circulars. But the petition, unaided by Dr. Campbell\u2019s report, contained only unenlightening generalizations which failed to disclose the factual basis for the General Counsel\u2019s conclusion that the products were identical in effect, though admittedly different in content. True, appellant\u2019s answer was simply a general denial, but we do not see how more could be required of him in the absence of notice of the specifics of the General Counsel\u2019s case. Thus, as the record stood, the General Counsel alleged that the products were identical and equally inefficacious, and that his medical witness supported this view, while appellant denied that the products were identical and promised expert medical testimony that his present product was both different and effective. On this record the Judicial Officer could not conclude that there were no factual issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">The General Counsel argues, however, that in the course of the 1962 hearing appellant conceded that medical science did not recognize the existence of aphrodisiacs ; and, therefore, as the district court held, \u201cIf we construe plaintiff\u2019s advertising as offering for sale a sex stimulant or aphrodisiac \u2014 and it cannot realistically be interpreted otherwise \u2014 plaintiff is now in the anomalous position of demanding a hearing to determine the value of a product which he himself has, stated is ineffective.\u201d Aside from other difficulties with the argument, appellant\u2019s concession as to the state of medical knowledge in 1962 could not estop him from asserting, as he did, that current scientific knowledge was to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">We have assumed thus far that Rule 30, 39 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.30, establishes a procedure applicable only where there are no&gt; contested issues of material fact, as does: Rule 56, Fed.R.Civ.P. That assumption is doubtful. Rule 30 appears to contemplate adjudication of contested issues of fact without a hearing, in the discretion of the Judicial Officer. As we have indicated, Rule 30, so construed, would be contrary to the Administrative Procedure' Act. If Rule 30 is intended to apply only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>where the record establishes an absence of disputed factual issues, we doubt that it conveys this purpose with sufficient clarity to create a procedure binding upon persons charged in a fraud proceeding, upon publication in accordance with 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1003(a). See Gonzalez v. Freeman, 118 U.S.App.D.C. 180, 334 F.2d 570, 577-578 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b496-12\">.

Notice shall then be given by the Docket Clerk to the person that the order has been requested and that an answer may be filed within ten days of the notice.

Dr. Campbell\u2019s report \u25a0 stated that the formula for \u201cActivators\u201d was the same as that for \u201cStagg Bullets\u201d except for the addition of the botanical ingredient Dami-, ana \u201cwhich would not make for any significant difference between the two formulations.\u201d It was stated that \u201cIn the early 1900\u2019s Damiana was used empirically in the treatment of sexual impotence, but long since has been discarded from the medical armamentarium for such use.\u201d The report summarized the causes and treatment of impotency, and concluded \u201cThe use\u2018of Formula AZ-696 \u2018Activators\u2019 will not be an adequate substitute for the many measures of treatment necessary for the correction of the causes of impotency enumerated above.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b498-10\">.

Earlier legislation permitting summary impounding of allegedly obscene materials did not authorize summary impounding of allegedly fraudulent materials. Act of July 27, 1956, eh. 755, \u00a7 1, 70 Stat. 699. See Greene v. Kern, 174 E.Supp. 480, 484-485 (D.N.J.1959), affirmed per curiam 269 F.2d 344 (3d Cir. 1959). Bills which would have permitted summary impounding of fraudulent as well as obscene material failed of passage in the 82d Con-</p>\n<p id=\"AgX\">gress (H.R. 5850), the 83d Congress (H.R. 569), and the 84th Congress, 1st sess. (H.R. 174).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">Even as to obscene materials, the 1956 statute limited the effectiveness of the summary order to 20 days, unless extended an additional 20 days by a district court upon a showing of probable cause. Moreover, Congress thought it necessary to expressly exempt the proceeding from the Administrative Procedure Act. See \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>1(c), Act of July 27, 1956, supra. In recommending the legislation, the Senate Committee said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-6\">\u201cThe committee recognizes that even in its present form the bill gives the Postmaster General extraordinary and summary powers to impose a substantial penalty by impounding a person\u2019s mail for up to 20 days in advance of any hearing or any review by the courts. Such power is directly contrary to the letter and spirit of normal due process, as exemplified by the Administrative Procedure Act, which requires a hearing before any penalty may be imposed. The Post Office Department has made its case for this legislation on the grounds that a temporary and summary procedure is required to deal with flyby-night operators using the mails <em>to defraud </em>or to peddle pornography, who may go out of business \u2014 or change the name of their business or their business address \u2014 before normallegal procedures can be brought into operation.\u201d (S.Rep..

(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">As will be noticed, the Senate Committee mistakenly supposed that the statute applied to fraudulent as well as obscene materials. The error appears to have been common (H.R.Rep. No. 2073, 84th Cong., 2d sess., pp. 1, 2 (1956); 102 Cong.Rec. 12288, 12289 (1956), (Sen.
