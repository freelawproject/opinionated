The Board\u2019s jurisdiction, however, is not disputed, and rules formulated for the macrocosm control the microcosm as well. Substantial evidence supports the findings that the employer subjected two of the employees, Bell and Martinez, to un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>lawful interrogation as to union sympathies; that, on learning of their.wish to be represented by a union, it discharged them forthwith (although Bell was almost immediately rehired); and that it improperly refused to bargain with the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">The principal attacks on the order are that Martinez was only a -temporary employee and therefore should not have been included in the bargaining unit, and that his discharge was due not to anti-union animus but to lack of need for his services as a shop assistant and his inability to operate the employer\u2019s truck and station wagon for want of requisite driver\u2019s licenses. On the first issue, there was substantial evidence to support the finding that Martinez\u2019 status had not been definitely determined at the time of the union\u2019s demand. On the second, the evidence sufficied to \u201cprovide a reasonable basis for inferring that the permissible ground alone would not have led to the discharge, so that it was partially motivated by an impermissible one.\u201d NLRB v. Park Edge Sheridan Meats, Inc., 341 F.2d 725, 728 (2 Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The employer contends that the provisions of the order concerning reinstatement and back pay endow Martinez, because of his union sympathies, with a permanence which, in view of the seasonal characteristics of the business and his inability to perform the necessary driving, he would not otherwise have had. But these objections do not go to enforcement; the employer\u2019s precise duties as to reinstatement of and back pay for Martinez are matters to be resolved under established principles in -compliance proceedings.
