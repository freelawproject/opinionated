Our review of the record convinces us that the decision of the Secretary was amply supported by substantial evidence and that the district court erred in setting it aside. The judgment of the district court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-19\">The appellee may be entitled to benefits under the 1965 amendments to the Social Security Act, Public Law 89-97, July 30, 1965, 79 Stat. 286, adopted subsequent to the Secretary\u2019s decision. Prior to the amendments, the. law required that an individual\u2019s impairment must be expected to be of long-continued and indefinite duration or to result in death. The amendment establishes a new and less stringent standard; the claimant must have been under a disability which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 calendar months. This cause is remanded to the district court with directions to remand the same to the Secretary for a determination of whether claimant is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity pursuant to the 1965 amendments to the Social Security Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-20\">Reversed and remanded with directions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
