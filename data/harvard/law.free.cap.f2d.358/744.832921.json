At that time we left to the trial court on remand the determination of whether the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) waived or acquiesced in a termination of its rights. While the trial court could make a preliminary interpretation of the contract in order to determine these questions we held that it was for the System Board of Adjustment to construe the contract.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-14\">On remand the trial court found that there \u201cis absolutely no dispute as to the material facts in this case.\u201d Under such circumstances a directed verdict was appropriate. Based on the facts proved the trial court found no \u201cshowing of waiver, abandonment, acquiescence or estoppel\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-15\">No appeal had been taken from the trial court\u2019s previous order requiring the setting up of a System Board of Adjustment and the trial court having found no waiver, abandonment, acquiescence, or estoppel, it ordered the dispute submitted to the Board. The district court\u2019s actions were in accord with the mandate of this Court. We agree with its findings and conclusions. The judgment is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b795-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b795-13\">. By readopting its original findings in so far as they were applicable, the trial court may have made a preliminary construction of the contract. As we view the court\u2019s statements it was able to find that no rights had been intentionally surrendered even without reference to the contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
