Collinson, published at 250 F.Supp. 641, contains a detailed statement of the facts and reflects that the District Court treated all of appellant\u2019s allegations as true.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-19\">We agree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that appellant has misconstrued his remedy in applying for habeas corpus, and on the basis of Judge Collinson\u2019s opinion, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-20\">For authorities supportive of the conclusion reached by Judge Collinson, see Eagles v. United States, 329 U.S. 304, 307, 311, 312, 67 S.Ct. 313, 91 L.Ed. 308 (1946); McNally v. Hill, Warden, 293 U.S. 131, 55 S.Ct. 24, 79 L.Ed. 238 (1934); Williams v.
