BROWN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"aqq-dedup-0\">This is a head-on, but belated, attack on the doctrine of official executive immunity espoused by the Supreme Court in Barr v. Matteo, 1959, 360 U.S. 564, 79 S.Ct. 1335, 3 L.Ed.2d 1434,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and adhered to by this Court in decisions both before<footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and after<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Barr.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Again the attack fails, for the only thing novel about it is an allegation based on Greene v. McElroy, 1959, 360 U.S. 474, 79 S.Ct. 1400, 3 L.Ed. 2d 1377, that appellant was denied pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>cedural due process, a question which we hold is not proper for consideration at this time nor in this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Appellant instituted this suit in the Georgia State Court against employees <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> of the Federal Government seeking a money judgment for libel and slander predicated on acts of these employees which culminated in her involuntary retirement for disability from her position as a secretary with the Vector Control Services Training Section of the Public Health Service\u2019s Communicable Disease Center in Atlanta. The gist of this common-law tort action was that defamatory statements and writings were made by Defendants and sent to appellant and others asserting in effect that appellant was mentally disturbed and unfit for her job, and that Defendants forced her to be examined by a psychiatrist upon pain of being retired if she refused. From the exhibits attached to appellant\u2019s complaint, it is obvious that all of the alleged statements relied upon were contained in official intragovernment memoranda, letters, or reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-18\">The Defendants removed the suit without objection to the Federal District Court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Upon removal, appellant amended her complaint to allege that the same actions constituted a conspiracy to deprive her of civil rights in violation of 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1985. Her principal ground for this allegation was that she was deprived of the right to a hearing and to the confrontation of witnesses prior to her involuntary retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-19\">Defendants, in support of a motion for summary judgment, submitted affidavits and exhibits which showed that all of the acts complained of were performed by them as official duties pursuant to government regulations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Appellant submit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>ted counter affidavits of herself, her husband, and a business acquaintance. But none of these denied factually that the Defendants had acted within the scope of their official duties. Rather, each merely recited facts showing in af-fiant\u2019s view these Government employees had wrongfully and erroneously determined her to be disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Under these circumstances we agree with the District Judge that there was no genuine issue as to the fact that Defendants\u2019 acts were in the performance of official duties, that absolute immunity from personal tort liability shielded these acts, and that there has been no denial of Appellant\u2019s civil rights. We, therefore, affirm the summary judgment entered for Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">Common-Law Action for Libel and Slander</p>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">We need not belabor the rule that Government officials and employees are immune from tort liability for acts committed in the performance of official duties. Barr v. Matteo, supra. Its history, rationale, and scope were thoroughly discussed in Norton v. McShane, 5 Cir., 1964, 332 F.2d 855,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> cert. denied, 1965, 380 U.S. 981, 85 S.Ct. 1345, 14 L.Ed.2d 274. Its acceptance in this Circuit has recently been reaffirmed, but not without some misgivings. Pierson v. Ray, 5 Cir., 1965, 352 F.2d 213; cf. Fowler v. Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 5 Cir., 1965, 343 F.2d 150. Thus we are not writing on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>clean slate.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> First, it is clear at this late date that federal and not state law governs the application of the immunity doctrine to federal officers and employees. Howard v. Lyons, supra note 1; see Wheeldin v. Wheeler, 1963, 373 U.S. 647, 83 S.Ct. 1441, 10 L.Ed.2d 605; Norton v. McShane, supra, 332 F.2d at 860 n. 6.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Second, under federal law as interpreted in <em>Barr </em>there is only one prerequisite for the application of immunity: the action taken must be within the outer perimeter of the executive official\u2019s line of duty. 360 U.S. at 575, 79 S.Ct. at 1341, 3 L.Ed. 2d at 1443.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> That the federal officer acted with malice makes no difference. Barr v. Matteo, supra; see Wozencraft v. Captiva, 5 Cir., 1963, 314 F.2d 288; De Busk v. Harvin, 5 Cir., 1954, 212 F.2d 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">When we apply <em>Barr </em>to the facts of this case, as interpreted most favorably to appellant, it is clear that immunity applies.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Defendants\u2019 actions were clearly within the outer perimeter of their line of duty. Their affidavits and exhibits attached thereto specifically enumerate the administrative regulations and statutory provisions which they followed in taking these actions respecting appellant. See note 6, supra. Their alleged defamatory statements are contained in reports made on official printed forms, in written notices required by the regulations to be given to appellant, and in affidavit evidence submitted by Defendants for use in appellant\u2019s administrative appeals (see 5 CFR \u00a7 772.304(b)). Furthermore, Defendants\u2019 actions involving the employment tenure, and discipline of a federal employee are of a nature which most obviously should be committed to their discretion without fear of vexatious suits for personal liability. See Wozencraft v. Captiva, supra; De Busk v. Harvin, supra; Waterman v. Nelson, 2 Cir., 1949, 177 F.2d 965 (per curiam); cf. Blitz v. Boog, 2 Cir., 1964, 328 F.2d 596, cert. denied, 379 U.S. 855, 85 S.Ct. 106, 13 L.Ed.2d 58 (suit against government physician for damages based on unrequested treatment). Thus, this case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>fits within both the letter and the spirit of the <em>Barr </em>immunity rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Appellant nevertheless contends vigorously that she was entitled to take her case to the jury, that the District Court erred in granting Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Apparently she assumes that the filing of counter affidavits makes it a jury case. But this is not enough, for as the District Court correctly observed, \u201cThe affidavits of the plaintiff, her husband, and a business acquaintance, submitted by the plaintiff in opposition to the defendants\u2019 motion, do not dispute this fact [that Defendants were performing official duties], nor do they appear to have been submitted for that purpose.\u201d Thus, Defendants were entitled to summary judgment on the force of their affidavits.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">Suit Under Civil Rights Act The District Court held (1) that the doctrine of immunity applies even to suit under the Civil Rights Act,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1985, and (2) that \u00a7 1985 applies only where some of the defendants acted under color of <em>state </em>law.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> But in <em>Norton </em>we expressly refrained from deciding either of these propositions.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-12\">We likewise refrain from deciding what <em>Norton </em>left undecided. Instead, for purposes of this case, we shall assume that immunity is not a defense to actions under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1985 and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>it is unnecessary that any of the defendants have acted under the color of state law. These-assumptions bring us to the essence of appellant\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Appellant alleged that the Defendants conspired to and did deny her equal protection of the law by discriminatory application of the Civil Service Commission\u2019s rules and regulations to her case, and further, that they conspired to and did deny her due process of law by adjudging her to be \u201cincompetent\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> without service of charges, without notice and opportunity to be heard, without opportunity to confront witnesses against her, and without the assistance of counsel. However, in her memorandum in opposition to Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and in her argument on appeal, it became apparent that, relying on Greene v. McElroy, 1959, 360 U.S. 474, 79 S.Ct. 1400, 3 L.Ed.2d 1377 [Greene I], and Greene v. United States, 1964, 376 U.S. 149, 84 S.Ct. 615, 11 L.Ed.2d 576 [Greene II], appellant\u2019s principal complaint is that she was unconstitutionally denied a judicial hearing and the confrontation of witnesses.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Assuming that this complaint can be asserted here <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and that a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>spiracy to deprive appellant of due process would support a suit for damages under \u00a7 1985,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> we reject it on the merits. Appellant had no constitutional right to a judicial hearing with the opportunity to confront and cross-examine witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">The starting point is Greene v. McEl-roy, supra. Appellant\u2019s reliance on this case as establishing a constitutional requirement of a hearing and confrontation prior to the discharge of a government employe is misplaced. <em>Greene I </em>decided only that <em>vis-a-vis </em>the Government and the employee in the absence of congressional or presidential authorization, considerations of due process prevent the Secretary of the Navy from revoking the security clearance of an engineer working on government projects without affording him the opportunity to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him. Though constitutional considerations lurked in the background, the case was decided on the narrow ground of authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">Thus, consistent with the approach of the Supreme Court in <em>Greene I, </em>we must first determine whether the procedures followed by the Defendants have been authorized by Congress or the President. The Civil Service Retirement Act, 5 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 2251 et seq., does not provide for any hearing \u2014 yet alone a judicial one with confrontation and cross-examination of witnesses \u2014 in the case of disability retirement. The Civil Service Commission is authorized to enact proper regulations for carrying out the Act. 5 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 2266(a). It is given the power to adjudicate all claims under the Act, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2266(b), and its determination of disability \u201cshall be final and conclusive and shall not be subject to review,\u201d 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2266(c). The Regulations likewise provide that the Commission shall adjudicate all claims, 5 CFR \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>831.101(a), and although there is an appeal to the Commission from an adverse decision by the Bureau of Retirement &amp; Insurance on an agency-initiated application for disability retirement, 5 CFR \u00a7 831.107(a), (c) (2), and each party is allowed to file a brief before the Commission, 5 CFR \u00a7 831.107(c), no hearing as such is provided for. The cases uniformly hold that no hearing is required under the Act or the regulations. Smith v. Dulles, supra; Murphy v. Wilson, supra; Cerrano v. Fleishman, 2 Cir., 1964, 339 F.2d 929, cert. denied, 1965, 382 U.S. 855, 86 S.Ct. 106, 15 L.Ed.2d 93; Rosenblum v. United States Civil Service Comm., W. D.Pa.1963, 224 F.Supp. 281.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We agree.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">This brings us to the constitutionality of the congressional and administrative decision to provide no hearing before retiring a federal employee for disability. The decisive case is Cafeteria and Restaurant Workers Union, etc. v. McElroy, 1961, 367 U.S. 886, 81 S.Ct. 1743, 6 L.Ed. 2d 1230, where the Court reached the constitutional issue avoided in <em>Greene </em>7.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Finding that the applicable regulations and statutes authorized the removal, without a hearing or confrontation, of the identification badge of a civilian cafeteria employee on a military installation for security reasons, the Court held that this did not offend due process. Starting with the proposition that \u201cthe Fifth Amendment does not require a trial-type hearing in every conceivable case of government impairment of private interest.\u201d 367 U.S. at 894, 81 S.Ct. at 1748, 6 L.Ed. 2d at 1236, the Court weighed the private interest impaired with the government interest involved. The private interest impaired was the employee\u2019s loss of a job: she did not lose the right to practice her profession; she was free to work elsewhere; she was not, as in <em>Greene I, </em>bestowed a badge of disloyalty. The government interest was the \u201cpower * * * as proprietor, to manage the internal operation of an important federal military establishment.\u201d 367 U.S. at 896, 81 S.Ct. at 1749, 6 L.Ed.2d at 1236-1237. The Court recognized that \u201cgovernment employment, in the absence of legislation, can be revoked at the will of the appointing officer.\u201d Ibid.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">When we similarly weigh the competing interests in this case, it is clear that no hearing was required. Appellant has not lost the right to work elsewhere as a secretary, retirement is certainly less drastic than outright discharge, and appellant\u2019s retirement for disability, even if interpreted as she does to be a finding of mental incompetence, casts no aspersion on her moral character or loyalty. And certainly the Government has the paramount interest of any employer in securing efficient employees. We, therefore, on the undisputed facts of this rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>ord interpreted most favorably to appellant, affirmatively hold that she has no constitutional rights which were abridged.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b400-14\">.

It is perhaps more precise to say that appellant ignores, rather than attacks, the doctrine of official immunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b401-6\">. The defendant-employees of the United States (appellees) held the following positions: Chief of Vector Control Training Service; Chief of Communicable Disease Center; Personnel Officer of CDC; Personnel Management Specialist of CDC; Acting Chief of CDC; Chief of Military Hospital\u2019s Psychiatric Service; a Psychiatrist under contract with Civil Service Commission; Regional Appeals Examiner of Civil Service Commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b401-9\">. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1442(a) provides: \u201cA civil action * * \u2022 commenced in a State court against any of the following persons may be removed by them to the district court * <em>* *: </em>(1) Any officer of the United States * * * or person acting under him, for any act under color of such office * *</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b401-13\">. It is unnecessary to detail the acts complained of or the duties purported to perform. It is enough to say that the complained of action was part of five processes: (1) the refusal of Plaintiff\u2019s supervisor to recommend her for within-grade salary increase; (2) the insistence by her supervisors that she submit to a fitness-for-duty examination; (3) their suspending her for thirty days and proposing to suspend her for six months; (4) their applying for, and obtaining, on her behalf disability retirement; (5) their requiring her to take leave without pay pending administrative approval of her disability retirement. A simplied chronology of events, including a summary description of these five processes, will demonstrate the official duties performed by Defendants and the administrative remedies utilized or not by Plaintiff. The following is based on the undisputed, uncon-tradicted facts of this record:</p>\n<p id=\"b401-21\"><em>Process (1): </em>Pursuant to the Federal Salary Reform Act of 1962, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1121, a prerequisite of within-grade step-up in compensation for federal employees is the determination by the head of the employee\u2019s department that his work \u201cis of an acceptable level of competence.\u201d In accordance with the regulations of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, HEW, Personnel Manual Circular No. 531-1, and the Civil Service Commission, 5 CFR \u00a7 531.407(a), Plaintiff\u2019s supervisor determined that her work did not meet this standard and notified her in writing of the reasons for this determination. 5 CFR \u00a7 531.407(b) (1). Pursuing the only administrative remedy available (5 CFR \u00a7 531.407(d): \u201cThere is no right to a review by the Commission of a department\u2019s determination\u201d), Plaintiff sought and was denied reconsideration of this determination within HEW. 5 CFR \u00a7 531.407(b) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-22\"><em>Process (2): </em>Plaintiff\u2019s superiors then requested her to take a fitness-for-duty examination pursuant to HEW, Personnel Manual Instruction No. 339-1. See 5 CFR \u00a7 339.101.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-23\"><em>Process (S): </em>Upon Plaintiff\u2019s refusal to submit to such an examination, her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>superiors notified her of their intention to apply for her disability retirement. Civil Service Retirement Act, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2257(a) ; 5 CFR \u00a7 831.501(d) ; Federal Personnel Manual Supplement No. 831-1, \u00a7 S10-2(2), at 29. They then filed such an application on the Commission\u2019s Standard Form SF-2801A. Since a physical examination must accompany this application, 5 CFR \u00a7 831.502(a), and since Plaintiff still refused to take one, Defendants initiated the next process.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\"><em>Process (4): </em>In order \u201cto promote the efficiency of the service,\u201d 5 CFR \u00a7 752.-104(a), Plaintiff was suspended for thirty days and notified of a proposed six-month suspension. She appealed the thirty-day suspension. Under 5 CFR \u00a7 752.-304, appeal from a suspension of thirty days or less (generally known as a \u201cSub-part C\u201d appeal) lies with the Commission only (suspensions for more than thirty days are appealable concurrently to the agency involved and the Commission, 5 CFR \u00a7 771.201 et seq.) and only to review procedural deficiencies. No hearing is required in a Subpart C appeal. While her appeal was pending, Plaintiff agreed to take the medical examination required for disability retirement, so the Defendants cancelled the 30-day suspension (reinstating her with backpay pursuant to 5 CFR \u00a7 752.402) and the notice of the proposed 6-month suspension. Accordingly, her appeal became moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\"><em>Process (S) continued: </em>Upon receiving the report of Plaintiff\u2019s medical examination, the Commission\u2019s Bureau of Retirement &amp; Insurance approved her agency-initiated disability retirement. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2266(d) and 5 CFR \u00a7 831.107, she appealed this decision to the Commission\u2019s Board of Appeals &amp; Review which affirmed. No hearing was held as none seems to be required by the regulations. See Smith v. Dulles, 1956, 99 U.S. App.D.C. 6, 236 F.2d 739, cert. denied, 352 U.S. 955, 77 S.Ct. 329, 1 L.Ed.2d 244; Murphy v. Wilson, 1956, 99 U.S.App.D.C. 4, 236 F.2d 737, cert. denied, 352 U.S. 954, 77 S.Ct. 326, 1 L.Ed.2d 243; Ellmore v. Brucker, 1956, 99 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 236 F.2d 734, cert. denied 352 U.S. 955, 77 S.Ct. 329, 1 L.Ed.2d 244. 5 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 2266(c) provides that the Commission\u2019s decision is final and conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-19\"><em>Process (5): </em>Pending the approval of her disability retirement (Process (3)), Plaintiff\u2019s superiors placed her on leave-without-pay. Such action would normally be appealable to the Commission (5 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 752.203 [Subpart B appeal], 772.301) or within the agency (5 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 771.205, .208), and in either case there would be a hearing (5 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 772.305, 771.214). Plaintiff appealed to the Commission, but its Regional Appeals Examiner (a defendant herein), making the initial decision (5 CFR \u00a7 772.306), determined that there was no right of appeal since the adverse action was taken because of Plaintiff\u2019s disability, not as a disciplinary measure. Plaintiff did not appeal this initial determination to the Board of Appeals &amp; Review. 5 CFR \u00a7 772.307. See generally HEW, Personnel Manual Instruction No. 771-1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b402-21\">. See 332 F.2d at 858 n. 2, 859 n. 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b403-6\">. It may well be that the immunity doctrine has now been extended too far, that the policy of the doctrine as analyzed by Judge Learned Hand in Gregoire v. Biddle, 2 Cir., 1949, 177 F.2d 579, cert. denied, 1950, 339 U.S. 949, 70 S.Ct. 803, 94 L.Ed. 1363, merits reexamination, especially in light of the trend toward contracting other kinds of tort-liability immunity. In Pierson we noted the anomaly resulting from the different protection accorded federal officers and state officers by Norton on the one hand, and by Monroe v. Pape, 1961, 365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492, on the other. But thus far judicial resistance to the immunity doctrine has taken the form of restriction of its scope rather than rejection. In Fowler v. Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 5 Cir., 1965, 343 F.2d 150, noting that the defense of immunity \u201cimposes a drastic impingement on personal liberty,\u201d 343 F.2d at 154, we held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah\">the defense should not be sustained on the basis of technical procedural defaults of the opposing party or in the absence of a clear and specific factual demonstration that the actions of the officers were indeed taken in pursuit of their official duties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b403-15\">343 F.2d at 155. The Ninth Circuit has put a gloss on what constitutes perform-anee of official duties, Hughes v. Johnson, 9 Cir., 1962, 305 F.2d 67, and the First Circuit has refused to follow the broad sweep of <em>Norton, </em>Kelley v. Dunne, 1 Cir., 1965, 344 F.2d 129.

Thus, appellant\u2019s effort to show that the Defendants\u2019 acts were tortious under Georgia law is hardly relevant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b403-21\">. In Norton v. McShane we said that the acts complained of \u201cmust have more or less connection with the general matters committed by law to the officer\u2019s control or supervision, and not be manifestly or palpably beyond his authority,\u201d 332 F. 2d at 859, and further that the acts must be pursuant to \u201ca decision which it is necessary that these officers be free to make without fear or threat of vexatious or fictitious suits and alleged personal liability.\u201d 332 F.2d at 862.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b403-23\">. Here, in fact, the alleged torts of libel and slander are not as grievous as the alleged torts of assault and battery and malicious arrest in <em>Norton. Barr </em>and <em>Lyons </em>both involved charges of libel and slander. See Holmes v.

Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e): \u201c* * * When a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations * * * of his pleading but his response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If he does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against him.\u201d See 3 Barron &amp; Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7\u00a7 1235, 1235.1 (supp. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Because of our view that the supporting and opposing affidavits require a summary judgment in these circumstances, it is unnecessary to decide whether it was proper for the District Court to consider appellant\u2019s failure to oppose removal pursuant to 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1442(a) (1), supra note 6, as a ground for granting summary judgment. Apparently the District Court felt that if Defendants were acting \u201cunder color of office\u201d for the purpose of removal, they were also acting within the \u201couter perimeter of the line of duty\u201d for the purpose of immunity. But see Fowler v. Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">It is also interesting to note, without making it a basis for our decision, the case of Preble v. Johnson, 10 Cir., 1960, 275 F.2d 275. The facts of that case are similar to the facts here, and there also the appellant contended that \u201cthe facts of record dealing with the respective scopes of duty were controverted, and that the cases were therefore not ripe for summary judgment.\u201d To this the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-13\">\u201cThis contention must rest squarely upon appellant\u2019s affidavits * * *. Certainly appellees\u2019 affidavits assert facts showing that the statements were absolutely privileged as being made in the line of duty. They therefore foreclose any genuine issue of fact unless * * * [appellant\u2019s] opposing affidavits affirmatively show that he is competent to testify that the statements were not made in line of duty. * * * The bulk of the averments in all of * * * [appellant\u2019s] affidavits * * * do no more than assert by way of conclusion \u2018that the controverted' statements and publications were not given pursuant to defendant\u2019s official duties * * * and contains no allegation of fact or facts within the plaintiff\u2019s personal knowledge.\u2019 Controverted issues of fact are not thus raised.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-20\">275 F.2d at 279.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b404-21\">.

Of course, as this uncontradieted record reveals, no such adjudication was ever made. See note 7, supra. Although there are statements by Defendants in the record that appellant had a \u201cpersonality disorder\u201d (\u201cpersecution complex,\u201d \u201cdisrupting influence,\u201d \u201cnervous,\u201d \u201cchronic schizophrenic reaction, paranoid type,\u201d \u201cinstability,\u201d \u201cinability to work with others\u201d), all that Defendants finally determined was (1) that appellant\u2019s work was not \u201cof an acceptable level of competence\u201d (5 U.S.C.

Appellant\u2019s Amended Complaint in the trial Court does nothing but repeat the language of all three subsections of 42 U.S.C.A. f 1985. Her allegation that the Commission\u2019s regulations had been dis-criminatorily applied to her was not further pressed at the trial Court and is not pressed here. Although the opportunity was afforded to do so, this contention was never urged on any of. her three administrative appeals. (See note 7, supra, processes 3, 4, and 5.) Indeed, there is not the slightest factual or legal support in this record for such an allegation. Finally, appellant has also abandoned the contentions that she was not given notice of the charges against her and was not assisted by counsel. Here the record clearly demonstrates that she was frequently advised of the reasons for the Defendants\u2019 adverse action (indeed, many of the statements which she contends constitute defamation are contained in written notices of these reasons, attached to her Complaint as exhibits and required by the regulations to be given, e. g., 5 CFR \u00a7\u00a7 531.407(b) (1), 752.202(a), 752.-302(a)), and that she had the assistance of counsel at a very early stage in proceedings against her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b405-13\">. This is a big assumption. Appellant is not now seeking reinstatement to her job or restitution from the Government of wages lost because her retirement was procedurally or substantively defective. At least as to procedural defects, appelpellant could have raised her objections in a District Court suit against the Government officials involved to obtain restoration to her job or in a Court of Claims suit against the Government to obtain damages for an illegal discharge \u2014 assuming, that is, that she had properly exhausted administrative remedies. If the Defendants had failed to follow the procedure specified in the regulations (even though neither the statutes nor the constitution required such procedure), she would prevail in both forums. See, e. g., Williams v. Zuckert, 1963, 371 U.S. 531, 83 S.Ct. 403, 9 L.Ed.2d 486, on rehearing, 372 U.S. 765, 83 S.Ct. 1102, 10 L.Ed.2d 136; Vitarelli v. Seaton, 1959, 359 U.S. 535, 79 S.Ct. 986, 3 L.Ed.2d 1012; Service v. Dulles, 1957, 354 U.S. 363, 77 S.Ct. 1152, 1 L.Ed.2d 1403; Brown v. Macy, 5 Cir., 1965, 340 F.2d 115; Hanifan v. United States, Ct.Cl., 1965, 354 F.2d 358 [Dec. 17, 1965]; Begendorf v. United States, 1965, 340 F.2d 362, 169 Ct.Cl. 293; Kleinfelter v. United States, Ct.Cl., 1963, 318 F.2d 929; Shadrick v. United States, 1960, 151 Ct.Cl. 408. Or if the procedure followed, though consistent with the regulations, failed to comport with due-process requirements, she would like<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>wise prevail in both types of actions. See, e. <em>g., </em>Greene v. McElroy, supra; Greene v. United States, supra; Garrott v. United States, 1965, 340 F.2d 615, 169 Ct.Cl. 186. But appellant desired money damages for defamation and for conspiracy to deprive her of her civil rights. Unable under the Federal Tort Claims Act to obtain such redress from the Government, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2680(a), (h), Radford v. United States, 5 Cir., 1959, 264 F.2d 709, she here seeks to hold Defendants personally liable as Georgia tortfeasors and as \u00a7 1985 conspirators. In De Busk v. Harvin, supra, where similar relief was sought, we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a_p-dedup-0\">\u201cConsiderations of procedural regularity are peculiarly inappropriate and premature for judicial inquiry on this review, and we expressly refrain from any comment thereon, since it appears from the record that the validity of appel-lee\u2019s action in dismissing appellant has been appealed administratively, and is still pending before the Civil Service Commission for final review. * * * We merely hold that, since appellant does not here seek reinstatement to his former job or otherwise attack the legality vel non of his discharge in a manner presently appropriate for judicial review, his petition seeking damages from appellees individually for their official act in discharging him is insufficient to state a claim for relief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">212 F.2d 143, 147. Cf. Wozencraft v. Captiva, supra, 314 F.2d at 288 (\u201cNot here seeking direct judicial review of his discharge, cf., Greene v. McElroy * * * the Plaintiff resorted to an action for libel for his judicial recourse.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b406-13\">. Although she does assert in many ways that the regulations and statutes do not justify the actions of the Defendants, appellant does not contend that the Defendants failed to follow the applicable statutes and regulations in her case. To the contrary, she repeatedly disavows any purpose to rest her claim on violation of these statutes or regulations. Thus not complaining that she was denied equal protection of the law (see note 18, supra) \u2014and, to be sure, not every failure to comply with administrative regulations would constitute such a denial \u2014 she attacks the regulations on due-process grounds. Holding that \u00a7 1985(3) applies only to conspiracies to deprive persons of equal protection, not to conspiracies to deny due process, many cases would make further inquiry unnecessary. See, e. g., Collins v. Hardyman, 1951, 341 U.S. 651, 71 S.Ct. 937, 95 L.Ed. 1253; Lewis v. Brautigam, 5 Cir., 1955, 227 F.2d 124, 55 A.L.R.2d 505; Whittington v.

Nester, 7 Cir., 1955, 217 F.2d 153, cert. denied, 349 U.S. 958, 75 S.Ct. 888, 99 L.Ed. 1281.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b407-5\">. In none of these cases was the constitutional question of due process raised.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b407-6\">. We have not discussed the other action taken against appellant (see note 7, supra) because it was merely a prelude to her disability retirement. Under Process (1) she clearly had no right to a hearing. In Process (4) the only action actually taken against her was suspension for 30 days, and the Bloyd-LaEollette Act \u00a7 6, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 652, provides that in this case \u201cno examination of witnesses nor any trial or hearing shall be required * * In any event, since her 30-day suspension was cancelled and she was reinstated with back pay, she can not complain of any denial of a hearing. In Process (5), if her forced leave-without-pay had been a disciplinary measure, she would have been entitled to a hearing before the Commission. See Exec. Order No. 10988, \u00a7 14, 27 Fed.Reg. 551 (Jan. 17, 1962), making \u00a7 14 of Veterans Preference Act, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 863, applicable to all employeesin, competitive civil service; 5 CER \u00a7\u00a7 772.305, 771.214. But she did not appeal the Regional Appeals Examiner\u2019s decision declaring that the forced leave-without-pay was not a disciplinary measure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b407-15\">. See also Hannah v. Larche, 1960, 363 U.S. 420, 80 S.Ct. 1502, 4 L.Ed.2d 1307, where the Court found that the statutes and regulations governing hearings by the Civil Rights Commission did not provide for confrontation, apprisal, and cross-examination. The Court held that the constitution does not require these accoutrements of a judicial hearing when the Commission is investigating, as distinguished from adjudicating.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
