While it is clear that the plaintiff is convinced that the trial was unfairly conducted and that an inadequate verdict resulted, we find no such error as would warrant our interference with the jury\u2019s decision as to the extent of the injury caused by the accident in suit, particularly since it is clear that much of plaintiff\u2019s admittedly serious disability is the result of natural causes as well as an earlier accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
