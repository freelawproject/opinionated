Appellant United Pacific Insurance Co. furnished a bond, in accordance with the requirements of the Miller Act, providing that Stilwell or United Pacific would pay for any labor or materials supplied in the prosecution of the prime contract. On May 31,1962, Stilwell subcontracted with appellee Air Handler, Inc. to do certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>air conditioning, plumbing and sheet metal work to be done on the building which was the subject of the prime contract. Appellee did work on the construction pursuant to the subcontract but ceased work prior to the completion of its portion under the subcontract. Of the total subcontract price of $103,344.84, appellee was paid all of it except $34,144.06 which Stilwell refused to pay. On May 6,1963, appellee instituted this suit to collect the unpaid sum and interest and attorney\u2019s fees. Appellants answered denying ap-pellee's right to recover and counterclaimed for $100,000.00 as damages arising out of appellee\u2019s alleged breach of contract. The district court\u2019s jurisdiction was invoked pursuant to the Miller Act, 40 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 270a-270d. This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">The court below held that appellee had not abandoned the contract and that ap-pellee had substantially performed which entitled it to recover the unpaid portion of the contract price less appellants\u2019 reasonable expenses incurred in completing appellee\u2019s work. After deducting $1,000.-00 for appellants\u2019 cleaning up expenses and $5,167.24 as the reasonable cost of completing the subcontract (this estimate, which is five per cent of the total subcontract price, was made on the basis of appellants\u2019 construction superintendent\u2019s testimony that the work was approximately 95 per cent complete when appel-lee left the job site) from the unpaid sum, the court added reasonable attorney\u2019s fees of $1,500.00 in accordance with the terms of the contract. Appellee\u2019s total recovery is $29,478.82 plus seven per cent interest per annum on the total sum excluding attorney\u2019s fees. We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Appellants\u2019 contention that appellee is not entitled to recovery because appellee breached the contract and did not fully perform is without merit. There is nothing in appellants\u2019 brief or in the record to contradict the district court\u2019s finding that appellee did not abandon the contract. Furthermore, the record justified the application of the \u201csubstantial performance doctrine.\u201d 3A Corbin on Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 700-712 (1960); 12 Cal.Jur. 2d \u00a7 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Appellants\u2019 next contention is that appellee\u2019s suit is premature. The contract does not obligate the prime contractor to pay the subcontractor until the prime contractor has been paid by the owner. The suit was instituted on May 6, 1963, and the appellants allege that the prime contractor received final payment on August 17, 1964. The district court held that final payment was made prior to May 6, 1963, on or about December 2, 1962. We have examined the record and conclude that this finding is amply supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">The appellants also allege error in the district court\u2019s failure to credit them with certain expenditures allegedly made by the prime contractor in completion of the subcontract, the most significant of which was $18,030.00 spent for concrete footing. Appellants offer no argument to support their contentions. The contract, on its face, does not indicate that the appellee was to provide the concrete footing; therefore, the district court\u2019s finding that appellee was not liable for this expenditure is affirmed. We have examined the record and conclude that the district court\u2019s findings limiting appellants\u2019 deductions for expenditures to complete appellee\u2019s work to five percent of the total contract price and $1,-000.00 are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">The appellants allege that it was error for the district court not to allow evidence on the cross-complaint for alleged damages sustained by Stilwell as a result of appellee\u2019s failure to perform. The damage specifically alleged was Stilwell\u2019s inability to obtain other performance bonds as a result of this suit. The short answer to this contention is that the court did not refuse to admit any competent testimony offered by appellant on this subject, and there is no such competent testimony in the record. Since the district court held that the appellee did not abandon the work and since the appellee can not be liable for consequential damages resulting from the institution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>of a meritorious law suit, there was no error in the district court\u2019s disposition of the cross-complaint. Cf. Shepherd v. Constructora, S.A., 220 F.2d 1 (9th Cir. 1954); Vesper v. Crane, 165 Cal. 36, 130 P. 876, L.R.A.1915A, 541 (1913).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">We have examined appellants\u2019 other contentions and conclude that they are without merit. The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
