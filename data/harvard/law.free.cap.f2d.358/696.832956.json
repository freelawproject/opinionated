United States v. Metz, 312 F.2d 199 (C.A.6, 1963) cert. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>denied, 375 U.S. 817, 84 S.Ct. 53, 11 L.Ed. 2d 52 (1963). There was evidence from which the jury could have concluded that the girl went directly from Metz\u2019s custody into Miller\u2019s brothel. Testimony also indicates that Miller bought her appropriate clothes and other appurtenances of the trade of prostitution and received a part of her earnings from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">Appellant contends, however, that these events must be read separately from the interstate transportation, since it had come to rest before appellant\u2019s new youthful acquaintance went to work. See Twitchell v. United States, 313 F.2d 425 (C.A.9, 1963).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">There is evidence, however, from which the jury could have found that the trip in the instant case was made for the purpose of introducing the girl to appellant\u2019s house of prostitution. Before the all night trip from Newport to Chicago, Metz placed a long distance phone call which the government proofs indicate was to appellant\u2019s number in Chicago. Metz said the call pertained to a billiard match and had nothing to do with prostitution or the girl. But when they reached Chicago and Metz introduced the 14-year-old to appellant, she testified this colloquy followed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-11\">\u201cQ Was anything said upon your entering his hotel room?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-12\">\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-13\">\u201cQ What?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-14\">\u201cA Gene introduced me to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyA\">\u201cQ And how did he introduce you to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-15\">\u201cA He said, \u2018Susie, this is Blackie.* \u201cQ Who said that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-16\">\u201cA Gene said that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-17\">\u201cQ Who did he say it to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-18\">\u201cA Blackie, Kenneth Eugene Miller.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-19\">\u201cQ Blackie Miller?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-20\">\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-21\">\u201cQ This man here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-22\">\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-7\">\u201cQ And what did Blackie Miller say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-8\">\u201cA Said, \u2018She will do fine.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">The District Judge gave a careful instruction dealing with the problems of venue and of conspiracy. Part of it read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-10\">\u201cNow, this is the thing that you must first consider. In the first place, something has to be done in this Eastern District of Kentucky. You must look at the evidence in the light of the locality first, the agreement if there was one between Blackie Miller or Kenneth Eugene Miller and Eugene Donald Metz, if there was an agreement to transport this girl from Newport, Kentucky, or the Eastern District of Kentucky, out of the state, to Chicago, that agreement must have been in effect here in this Eastern District of Kentucky before any act was done to carry it out and some acts must have been done or started here in this district to complete the offense. If you believe that this girl got in a car with Metz and went to Chicago and after she got there, the agreement took place, if there was one, that she was to enter a house of prostitution, then there is no crime, you should find the defendant not guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-25\"> Under this instruction the jury\u2019s verdict must be read as a finding that defendant entered into a conspiracy to violate the Mann Act before Metz and the girl left Kentucky. There was evidence, and permissible inferences from evidence, from which they could properly have reached that conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-26\">\u201cSecrecy and concealment are essential features of successful conspiracy. The more completely they are achieved, the more successful the crime. Hence the law rightly gives room for allowing the conviction of those discovered upon showing sufficiently the essential nature of the plan and their connections with it, without requiring evidence of knowledge of all its details * * Blumenthal v.
