In our judgment, upon consideration of the whole record, including, inter alia, appellant\u2019s thorough statements of her view of the questions involved, the findings of' fact by the trial- court that the vessel and its equipment were in a seaworthy condition at all times throughout the loading operations and that the accident was caused solely by the negligent operation of the stevedoring crew as stated in finding of fact #35, are not clearly erroneous. We find that the error, if any, is clearly not substantial in the references to the signal \u2022 man, Majdowski in the trial findings of fact and conclusions of law. We have examined appellant\u2019s point with reference to the trial court\u2019s reassessment of damages. There is no necessity or use of our passing upon that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-20\">The judgment of the district court will' be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
