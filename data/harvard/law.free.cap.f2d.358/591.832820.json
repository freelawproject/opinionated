NLRB, 1 Cir., 1961, 291 F.2d 128, cert. den. 368 U.S. 926, 82 S.Ct. 360, 7 L.Ed. 2d 190, hereinafter <em>Sylvania, </em>we set aside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>an order of the National Labor Relations Board which required a bargaining employer to disclose to the union the current and past costs of its noncontributory pension and insurance plans. We held that, although the benefits accruing to employees from such plans constituted \u201cwages\u201d that must be precisely disclosed, and as to which the employer must bargain, the cost to the employer was not. In the instant case, in the course of negotiations for a new labor contract, the employer offered the union a \u201cpackage\u201d that included improvements in existing welfare programs. Upon request the employer gave the union information relating to the cost of its current programs, but refused to furnish a breakdown of the cost of its proposed package, and hence of the welfare improvements. The union\u2019s reason for the demand was that it might prefer to retain the existing welfare plan, and opt for a higher wage rate rather than increased benefits. The employer countered that it bargained on the level of benefits, not costs, and that, in any event, it was not obligated to furnish the requested information.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">The Board, adopting the trial examiner\u2019s report, held that by refusing to furnish the requested information the employer had failed to bargain in good faith, in violation of section 8(a) (5). It ordered the employer to furnish to the union \u201cthe costs or estimated costs\u201d of the proposed improvements. In this petition to set aside the Board\u2019s order and cross-petition for enforcement, the Board, and the union, as intervenor, contend alternatively that our decision in <em>Sylvania, </em>supra, is distinguishable, and that it should be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">In <em>Sylvania, </em>supra, the Board reasoned, \u201cAs the premiums paid by the Respondent constitute wages, it logically follows that the premium cost data requested by the Union relates directly to the matter of wages.\u201d We responded that \u201cto define an employer\u2019s contribution to a noncontributory welfare program as \u2018wages\u2019 to the employees * * * would expand the concept of wages so far as to break down if not destroy, the distinction in the Act between \u2018wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment,\u2019 as to which there is a mutual mandatory duty to bargain collectively, and those matters as to which \u2018each party is free to bargain or not to bargain, and to agree or not to agree,\u2019 \u201d citing NLRB v. Wooster Division of Borg-Warner Corp., 1958, 356 U.S. 342, 349, 78 S.Ct. 718, 2 L.Ed.2d 823. The union now takes the same position as the Board in the earlier case, asserting, further, that <em>Sylvania </em>is inconsistent with the Welfare and Pension Disclosure Act of 1959, hereinafter Disclosure Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">We see nothing in the Disclosure Act inconsistent with our earlier view. The Act does not purport to expand the scope of \u201cwages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment\u201d under the National Labor Relations Act. In fact, it does not purport to affect the course of collective bargaining relations at all. Rather, the Disclosure Act seems designed to protect the rights of employees covered by actual, not proposed, welfare programs, by compelling the employer who administers them to make disclosures of the sort owed by a fiduciary to <em>cestuis que trustent.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">The Board takes a narrower view. It now asserts that meaningful bargaining as to \u201cwages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment\u201d may require a party to disclose information on matters that do not themselves fall within that phrase. More particularly, the Board says that a party who withholds information that would significantly aid the bargaining process, only for the sake of keeping the other in the dark, may not be, and is not in this case, bargaining in good faith. We accepted that principle in Boston Herald-Traveler Corp. v. NLRB, 1 Cir., 1955, 223 F.2d 58. See also NLRB v. Truitt Mfg. Co., 1956, 351 U.S. 149, 76 S.Ct. 753, 100 L.Ed. 1027. Its application involves questions of degree, including degrees of relevance.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>An employer is not required to disclose welfare plan cost information for the purpose of bargaining about whether he is receiving the best coverage for his money, because he is not obliged to discuss this matter with the union. <em>Sylvania, </em>supra. However, when the union makes the same demand in order better to evaluate the desirability of an increase in welfare benefits as against an equivalent increase in take-home pay,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> matters as to which the employer must bargain, the Board might properly conclude that the information, though collateral, was so necessary to effective negotiation that withholding it without good reason was inconsistent with the duty to \u201cexert every reasonable effort to make and maintain agreements.\u201d NLRB v. Truitt Mfg. Co., supra, at 152, 76 S.Ct. at 755.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">The order of the Board will be enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b642-6\">. 72 Stat. 997, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 301 et seq.
