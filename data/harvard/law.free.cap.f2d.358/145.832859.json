We grant the motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>leave to proceed on the appeal <em>in forma pauperis </em>and at the same time reverse the order from which the appeal is taken. Our action makes it unnecessary for plaintiff to have counsel assigned for the appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Plaintiff is incarcerated in the New Jersey State Prison at Trenton under a sentence of life imprisonment. He has filed a complaint alleging that the defendant has libeled him and seeking damages for the libel.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">The district court granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground of plaintiff\u2019s incapacity to sue. The district court based its action on New York Penal Law \u00a7 511(1) which provides :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-6\">\u201cA person sentenced to imprisonment for life is thereafter deemed civilly dead.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">Even if the district court was right in holding that incapacity to sue is a necessary incident of the concept of civil death, it was error to apply the law of New York rather than the law of plaintiff\u2019s domicile as required by Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 17(b). There was no showing that under the law of his domicile plaintiff was incapable of suing.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">On the merits we are of the opinion, as was the district court, that the complaint is not so clearly frivolous as to justify dismissal \u201cat this stage of the proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">Application, for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>granted; application for assignment of counsel denied; order reversed and case remanded to the district court with direction to take jurisdiction of the action.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b196-12\">L\u00cdJMBARD, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A3ET\">(dissenting) :</p>\n<p id=\"b196-13\">I disagree with the majority, and in light of the important questions of federal jurisprudence raised by this appeal, I think it necessary briefly to set forth my views.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-14\">Section 1915 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a), states that \u201cAny court of the United States <em>may </em>authorize the commencement, prosecution or defense of any suit, action or proceeding, civil or criminal, or appeal therein, without prepayment of fees and costs or security therefor, by a person who makes affidavit that he is unable to pay such costs or give security therefor.\u201d Subsection (d) of Sec. 1915 provides that \u201cThe court <em>may </em>request an attorney to represent any such person unable to employ counsel and <em>may </em>dismiss the case * * * if satisfied that the action is frivolous or malicious.\u201d (Emphasis added.) It is well settled that exercise of the discretion to grant leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>under this statute involves an assessment of the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s action, e. g., Kinney v. Plymouth Rock Squab Co., 236 U.S. 43, 35 S.Ct. 236, 59 L.Ed. 457 (1915); Richardson v. Hatch, 134 F. Supp. 110 (W.D.Mich.1955) (and cases cited therein), and that the merits of the action will be more carefully scrutinized in a civil case than in a criminal appeal before leave to proceed is granted, see Weller v. Dickson, 314 F.2d 598, 600 (9th Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-16\">The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss on the ground that Ur-bano lacked capacity to sue. N.Y.Penal Law, \u00a7 511. In my opinion, Urbano\u2019s action here is \u201cfrivolous\u201d within the meaning of Sec. 1915(d). Thus, defendant\u2019s motion below to deny leave to proceed and to dismiss the complaint should have been granted, and I would deny Ur-bano\u2019s application to this court in all respects. A statement of the facts is necessary to support this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-17\">On May 19, 1960, Urbano was sentenced to life imprisonment for a murder committed in the course of a New Jersey robbery; he was committed to a New Jersey State penitentiary where he is now serving his life sentence. On or about September 14, 1961, the Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a press release purporting to describe Urbano\u2019s criminal carrier, which had culminated in the robbery-murder for which he was convicted. On December-9, 1962, the defendant newspaper published a feature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>story in its Sunday edition which traced Urbano\u2019s fantastic \u201ctriple life\u201d as a bank and department store robber in Pennsylvania, Maryland and New Jersey, a \u201cContinental playboy and bon vivant,\u201d and a secretive and temperamental vagabond member of a Williamstown, Massachusetts, family. This action for libel grew out of that newspaper feature.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">It seems inconceivable that Urbano could succeed in this matter after a trial on the merits. Defendant claims that its article was based upon, and went no further than the FBI press release and therefore that the article was privileged. Although under New York law this claim depends upon whether the press release was a \u201cjudicial proceeding, legislative proceeding or other official proceeding,\u201d N.Y.Civil Rights Law, \u00a7 74 (McKinney\u2019s Consol.Laws, c. 6, 1965 Supp.), the existence of the report could at least be introduced as \u201cmitigating circumstances\u201d surrounding the sources of defendant\u2019s information and the grounds for its belief in the truth of the article, N.Y.Civil Rights Law, \u00a7 78 (McKinney\u2019s 1965 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Even assuming that defendant\u2019s article went beyond the FBI release and included some material not entirely true, Urbano still must show that he was damaged by the publication. It seems highly improbable that he could show \u201cactual malice\u201d on the part of the newspaper; thus, under New York law he could not recover punitive damages. See Crane v. New York World Telegram Corp., 308 N.Y. 470, 476, 126 N.E.2d 753, 52 A.L.R.2d 1169 (1955). As for compensatory damages, it taxes credulity to assume that one serving a life sentence for robbery-murder could prove that a newspaper article attributing to him other crimes of a like nature either injured his reputation or caused him \u201cpain and suffering\u201d to any meaningful extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">It is true that a libel per se, such as imputation of crime, is actionable without proof of damages. Prosser, Torts 584 (2d ed. 1955). But the question here is not whether the action is cognizable but whether the federal courts should exercise their discretion to permit this suit at the taxpayers\u2019 expense.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">As my brothers recognize, it would be unfair to any attorney to assign him to handle such a trial. I would go one step further and hold that this claim, while technically \u201cactionable,\u201d is so devoid of merit on its facts as heretofore alleged that it should not be permitted to go to trial at the public\u2019s expense. While the federal courts should not permit incarceration effectively to deprive criminals of access to federal diversity jurisdiction to redress wrongs committed against their persons, either in prison or out, it is also important not to encourage suits by inmates that are instituted merely to harass public officials or publishers, to clutter the courts, or to provide a break in the monotony of prison life. Compare Higgins v. Steele, 195 F.2d 366, 369 (8 Cir. 1952); Mattheis v. Hoyt, 136 F.Supp. 119 (W.D.Mich.1955). Therefore, despite Judge Bonsai\u2019s dictum to the effect that if frivolity \u201cwere the only ground, the Court would not dismiss the action at this stage of the proceeding,\u201d I would affirm the lower court\u2019s decision on the ground that this is an inappropriate case for the granting of leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-12\">The above ground being dispositive of the case, I need not reach the difficult question whether Urbano lacks capacity to bring this suit at all. However, I think it important to note the problems raised by an issue so cavalierly treated by the majority. In Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S. 460, 470, 85 S.Ct. 1136, 14 L.Ed. 2d 8 (1965), the Supreme Court noted that the mandate of Erie R. R. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188, 114 A.L.R. 1487, which might here imply that N.Y.Penal Law Sec. 511 is controlling of Urbano\u2019s capacity, has never been invoked to void a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure; . the Court implied that where a Federal Rule was directly applicable to an issue, as Rule 17(b)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>is here, it is to be applied even in a diversity suit. But assuming that Massachusetts laws is therefore applicable,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the majority takes at best a cursory look at that law. .If, as Judge Bonsai concluded, Massachusetts would declare Urbano civilly dead in her own courts, how can the majority conclude that Massachusetts would not intend the same rule to govern this case? And, if Massachusetts would in fact show so little concern for New York defendants, is this not a strong reason for applying the New York law in a federal court in New York, since the New York capacity rules \u201csubstantially affect those primary decisions respecting human conduct which our constitutional system leaves to state regulation\u201d? Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S. at 475, 85 S.Ct. at 1146 (concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Harlan) ; see Hart and Wechsler, The Federal Courts and the Federal System 633-34, 678 (1953). Perhaps ultimately the question is so wrapped up in choice of law problems that Rule 17(b) as applied here runs contrary to the decision in Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487, 61 S.Ct. 1020, 85 L.Ed. 1477 (1941), which held that the choice of law rules to be applied by a federal court in a diversity suit must conform to the rules prevailing in the forum state.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">I am not necessarily willing to conclude, as did Judge Bonsai, that Urbano lacks capacity to bring this suit under New York law, because I am not at all certain that New York courts would consider Section 511 applicable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nevertheless, <em>if </em>under the laws of both Massachusetts and New York Urbano would lack capacity to sue in the courts of either state, a proposition which the majority does not disprove, I do not see how a different result can be justified in a diversity action between a Massachusetts plaintiff and a New York defendant, regardless of how distasteful my-brothers find the concept of \u201ccivil death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">I would deny Urbano\u2019s application in all respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b197-8\">. \u201cThe capacity of an individual, other than one acting in a representative capacity, to sue or be sued shall be determined by the law of his domicile.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b198-5\">. Judge Bonsai held that Urbano\u2019s domicile is Massachusetts, his domicile prior to arrest, rather than New Jersey, the state of his incarceration, because Urbano is not voluntarily residing in New Jersey.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b198-6\">. For one thing, it is not entirely clear that New York would apply Sec. 511 to bar suits by persons serving life sentences in other states. Compare Jones v. Jones, 249 App.Div. 470, 292 N.Y.S. 705, aff'd, 274 N.Y. 574, 10 N.E.2d 558 (1937), with Panko v. Endicott Johnson Corp., 24 F.Supp. 678 (N.D.N.Y.1938). For another, I have some doubt that Sec. 511 was intended to apply to this type of suit since N.Y.Penal Law, \u00a7 512-a provides that \u201cany injury to his [a convict\u2019s] person * * * is punishable in the same manner as' if he were not sentenced or convicted.\u201d Absent further guidance from the New York courts on this matter, I would hesitate to deny inmates access to the courts for redress of tortious .injuries to their persons on the basis of an outdated and inscrutable common law concept. See Comment, The Rights of Prisoners While Incarcerated, 15 Buffalo L. Rev. 397, 398-404 (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
