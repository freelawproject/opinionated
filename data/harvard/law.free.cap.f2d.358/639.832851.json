The spouses thereafter moved into the house and lived there together for some ten years until the death of the husband. The government contends that this property is part of the husband\u2019s gross estate for estate tax purposes, arguing that this is property of which the husband in effect \u201cmade a transfer\u201d to the wife \u201cunder which he retained\u201d for the remainder of his life \u201cthe possession or enjoyment of * * * the property\u201d within the meaning of section 2036 of the 1954 Internal Revenue Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">In the district court, both sides having moved for directed verdicts, the court awarded the husband\u2019s estate the amount of estate taxes that had been levied and collected on the value of the property in question. The government has appealed, arguing that a verdict should have been directed for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">The evidence shows no express agreement that the husband enjoy a posses-sory interest in the property. The government contends that such an understanding must be implied from the circumstances and the conduct of the parties. However, the record shows that the husband expressed a desire that the wife have the property in such a way that her situation would be equivalent to that of a former wife to whom, after his second \u25a0marriage he had transferred exclusive ownership and use of a home which he and she formerly had owned jointly. It also appeared that over the years it was the custom and practice of the husband to make substantial outrights gifts of property to his second wife. The district court concluded that in all of the circumstances of this case a tacit understanding that the husband should retain a posses-sory interest in the property should not be implied. On the facts disclosed by this record we think the decision was a proper one.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
