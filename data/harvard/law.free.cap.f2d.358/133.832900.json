Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 1966, 383 U.S. 272, 86 S.Ct. 862, 15 L.Ed.2d 751. In <em>Fribourg </em>the Supreme Court held that, \u201cas a matter of law, the sale of a depreciable asset for an amount in excess of its adjusted basis at the beginning of the year of sale\u201d does not bar \u201cdeduction of depreciation for that year\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-12\">Here the sole issue, as the parties stipulated, is the question: \u201cWhether Plaintiff (Appellee) depreciated its plant and gathering system below salvage value during the fiscal year ended January 31, 1959\u201d. As of the beginning of the short year here involved \u2014 April 1, 1958 \u2014 the taxpayer had a depreciated basis or un-recovered cost in the depreciable assets of $709,552.23; it claimed $161,921.93 depreciation deductions in the short year \u2014 \u25a0 leaving a depreciated basis or unrecov-ered cost of $547,630.30. According to the undisputed evidence, $150,000 was the salvage value of the assets. We hold therefore that the taxpayer properly depreciated the assets in the year in question; that the assets were not depreciated below the remaining basis at the beginning or end of the year. The taxpayer maintained its burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-14\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
