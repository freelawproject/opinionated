There were two records, the Peter Bent Brigham, and the York. Both contained a statement as to the cause of the accident which conflicted, substantially, with plaintiff\u2019s account. These statements were inadmissible under the Massachusetts hospital record statute, Mass.G.L. c. 233, \u00a7 79, and defendant appellee does not claim that they were otherwise admissible over objection. Plaintiff read the Peter Bent Brigham record to the jury, except for this statement. A recess was then called. The court instructed the witness, who had brought both records, that the Peter Bent Brigham record \u201cbe left.\u201d According to the transcript, it added, \u201cThe York Hospital. Records are also admitted.\u201d After the recess, the plaintiff read the York Hospital record to the jury, except for the statement as to the cause of the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-19\">After a jury verdict for the defendant, and the exhibits were returned to counsel, plaintiff\u2019s counsel discovered, allegedly for the first time, that the York Hospital record had gone to the jury, denominated as a plaintiff\u2019s exhibit, as a result of what the court had said. Counsel asserted to the court, and to us, that he had not heard the court\u2019s use of the words, \u201calso admitted,\u201d and thought it had said, \u201calso left.\u201d We do not doubt that counsel spoke the truth. We assume, of course, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>that the court said \u201cadmitted,\u201d but we cannot think it was other than a slip of the tongue. Neither party had offered the York record. Not only was the court\u2019s word not responsive to a request, but it made no sense to say \u201calso admitted\u201d after saying, correctly, that the other record embraced by the \u201calso,\u201d was \u201cleft,\u201d not \u201cadmitted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Clearly, plaintiff\u2019s 'counsel was, throughout, conscious of the objectionable statements, and carefully read both records, minus the statement, to the jury, instead of offering them himself. Inescapably, he would have reacted if he had heard that this record was being physically marked.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">We do not question but that under proper circumstances, the court may offer its own exhibit. This record was marked plaintiff\u2019s exhibit. Furthermore, at a minimum, a court cannot introduce its own exhibit without giving counsel clear notice that it is doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">The court disposed of plaintiff\u2019s post trial motions by stating that, in its memory, the transcript was accurate, and there was \u201cno error.\u201d We are unable to avoid the conclusion that there was manifest error.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">In an effort to support the court\u2019s denial of plaintiff\u2019s motion for new trial, defendant argues that the court is presumed to have found that the error was \u201cnot prejudicial.\u201d This is not what the court found. It is not to be presumed to have found it because, on its ruling that there was no error, it did not reach that question. While we doubt very much whether the court would have found that the admission of the hospital record contradicting the plaintiff was not prejudicial, we believe it, rather than we, should pass on this question in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">Judgment will be entered vacating the judgment of the district court and remanding the action to that court to set aside the verdict and grant a new trial unless, after hearing, the court should find its error was not of prejudicial consequence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
