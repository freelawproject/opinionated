We have not held, and we are far from holding, that the plea of contributory negligence by a defendant sued for negligence, operates an admission of the negligence charged; nor does the language of our opinion admit of any such construction. We said: \u201cIn alleging contributory negligence, defendant admits that there is an <em>issue </em>of negligence between it and the plaintiff; not between plaintiff and a third party.\u201d The admission that there is an <em>issue </em>of negligence is very different from, and indeed contradictory of, an admission of the negligence itself, which latter admission would eliminate and destroy the <em>issue </em>of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1226-14\">Rehearing refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
