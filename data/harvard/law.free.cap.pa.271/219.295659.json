Reynolds, 23 Pa. 199; Chartiers Block Coal Co. v. Mellon, 152 Pa. 286; Baker v. R. R., 219 Pa. 398; Oberly v.

This rule has at no time been departed from: Jones v. Wagner, 66 Pa. 429; Stilley v. Pittsburgh-Buffalo Co., 234 Pa. 492, 496, 497; Penman v. Jones, 256 Pa. 416, 422, 433, and cases cited. A reservation of \u201cthe usual mining rights and privileges\u201d does not clearly show an intention to waive the right of surface support: Weaver v. Berwind-White Coal Co., 216 Pa. 195, 201, 202; Allshouse\u2019s Est., 23 Pa. Superior Ct. 146. In determining whether the particular words in question are to be construed as necessarily implying a waiver of the right of support, the intention must be gathered from the language used in the conveyance, and parol evidence to aid in its construction cannot be considered: Stilley v. Pittsburgh-Buffalo Co., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">We fully concur in the conclusions reached by the court below and affirm its decree at appellant\u2019s costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
