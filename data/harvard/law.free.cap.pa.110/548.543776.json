C. Golden, <em>Agent.\"</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-6\">The company then, in pursuance of one of the conditions of the policy, demanded that the value of the property, destroyed should be assessed by appraisers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-7\">In pursuance of this demand the assured selected one appraiser and the company named one. These appraisers subsequently met at the house of the assured, a short distance from where the loss occurred. O\u2019Neill gave them a description of the property embraced in the policy, but the appraisers failed to agree as to the value at their first meeting. They adjourned to meet at such other time and place as they might subsequently' agree upon ; but O\u2019Neill, without waiting and without malting further effort in that direction, brought suit. On the trial the plaintiff gave in evidence the proofs of loss, which he served on the company, to show that the conditions of the policy, which requires the assured to furnish such statement within a specified time after the fire, had been complied with as a condition precedent to the right of action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-8\">At the close of the trial, when the jury was about to retire, plaintiff\u2019s counsel proposed to send these proofs of loss out with the jury. This was objected to by defendant\u2019s counsel, but the objection was overruled and the proofs of loss were sent out with the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b567-9\">Verdict for plaintiff for $1,800 and judgment thereon. Defendant then took this rvrit, assigning for error the action of the court in sending out with the jury plaintiff\u2019s proofs and schedule of alleged loss.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b567-10\"><em>Hugh W. Weir </em>( <em>William H. Sechler </em>with him), for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APZ\">\u2014 The sole question here is, whether it was error to send out with the jury the proofs of loss. The proofs were only' offered for the purpose of showing that the terms of the policy, requiring proofs of loss within a given time, had been complied with. By reference to these proofs it will be observed that they consist of an <em>ex parte </em>affidavit and statement of the plaintiff himself, and the certificate of a justice of the peace, as to the description and value of the property destroyed and the <em>bonafides </em>of the loss. The court gave the jury no instructions as to the purpose or effect of these <em>ex parte </em>affidavits and statements. They were sent out with the jury for their -inspection and examination without qualification or restriction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b567-11\">In view of this, it cannot be doubted but that the jury read <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>and considered them as competent evidence in making up their verdict as to the value of the property. This was prejudicial to the defendant and we think contrary to well settled law upon the subject in this and many of the other states of the Union. Com\u2019th Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Sennett, 5 Wright, 161; Lycoming Ins.

J. \u2014 This evidence was offered for a specific purpose. Did you offer it for anjr other purpose ? <em>Ans. </em>No, sir, but it became evidence afterwards.J</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b568-6\">\u201c A jury may take out with them any writings that have been given'in evidence without distinction as to sealed or unsealed, except the depositions of witnesses:\u201d Alexander <em>v. </em>Jameson, 5 Binney, 238. In illustration and accordance with this rule it has been held-that \u201crecords\u201d of court may be sent out: Hendel <em>v. </em>Berks &amp; Dauphin Turnpike Road, 16 S. &amp; R., 92. Also information taken before, a magistrate: Seibert <em>v. </em>Price, 5 W. &amp; S., 438. Patent, title deeds, drafts, and other papers given in evidence at trial: Riddlesburg Coal Co. <em>v. </em>Rogers, 15 Smith, 416. Letters, checks, due-bills, application for insurance papers, etc.: Udderzook <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 26 Smith, 354. Claim filed with bill of particulars in mechanics\u2019 lien case: Odd Fellows\u2019 Hall <em>v. </em>Masser, 12 Harris, 507. Sending papers to jury is a matter of sound discretion of. the court, and not a subject of error: Spence <em>v. </em>Spence, 4 Watts, 165; O\u2019Hara v. Richardson, 10 Wright, 389; Little Schuylkill Navigation Co. <em>v. </em>Richards, 7 Smith, 148.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b568-8\">None of the cases, cited by plaintiff in error, decide that merely sending out proof of loss, properly in evidence, was error calling for reversal. Erroneous instructions as to their effect was the cause for reversal.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Anuc\">Chief Justice Mercur</author>\n<p id=\"A2I\">delivered the opinion of the court, November 2d, 1885.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">The specification of error is to the court sending out with the jury under exception, the paper containing the proofs of loss, and schedule attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\">It is true it has been ruled that in the sound discretion of the court, many papers that have been given in evidence, may be sent out with the jury. This paper however had not been given in evidence generally. It was admitted solely for the purpose of showing that proofs of loss had been furnished as required by the policy. It was therefore for the purpose of showing a condition precedent to a right of action. Being in writing the question of sufficiency for that purpose is to be decided by the court: Commonwealth Insurance Company <em>v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Sennett, <em>et al., </em>5 Wright, 161. They are not even <em>prima facie </em>evidence to the jury of the quantity and quality of the goods lost: Id. The insured cannot thus prove the particulars or extent of his loss by his own <em>ex parte </em>statement even under oath. The correctness of this ruling is affirmed in Lycoming Insurance Company <em>v. </em>Sehreffler, 6 Wright, 188. Nor did the fact that the statement of loss was called for by the company make it evidence for the insured: Id. Nor is the report of loss made out by the agent of the company with the affidavit of the insured appended, evidence to go to the jmy: Same <em>v. </em>Same, 8 Wright, 269. The correctness of excluding such evidence from the jury has been recognized in other states: Ph\u0153nix Insurance Company <em>v. </em>Lawrence, <em>el al., </em>4 Mete., (Ky.) 9; Lafayette, Bloomington &amp; Mississippi R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Winslow, <em>et al., </em>66 Ill., 219.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The statement sent out in the present case contains averments exonerating the insured from all improper conduct, and specifies the amount of his loss and damages. It was clearly improper to send such papers out with the jurors to be examined by them in their deliberations. It would be error to permit the insured to give them in evidence to the jury on the trial, aud the error was greater in permitting the jury to consider the several averments therein without their having been given in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Judgment reversed and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
