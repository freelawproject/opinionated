F. S., 510; Miller <em>v. </em>Hershey, 9 Id., 64; Robinson <em>v. </em>Myers, 17 Id., 9.

An execution may at any time be countermanded by the attorney or party who caused it to issue, and the officer is bound to obey such instructions and suspend.proceedings upon the writ whenever he is instructed to do\u2019so: Herman on Executions, p. 210. When an officer acts in obedience to the orders, agreements and directions of execution creditor, or plaintiff, so that he has no control over property levied on, or of the proceedings, the officer then becomes the agent of the plaintiff and his liability ceases: Herman on Executions, p. 639; Dorrance <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 1 Harris, 163.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b472-6\">The sheriff is but a ministerial officer, with no judicial powers, and cannot prevent the plaintiff from staying his execution if he chooses to do so; but if he does stay it the sheriff is released and the plaintiff takes the responsibility: Milliken <em>v. </em>Brown, 10 S. &amp; R., 188; Allison <em>v. </em>Rheam, 3 S. &amp; R., 139.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b472-7\"><em>Head (James S.

It showed two writs of <em>fi.,fa., </em>returnable 25th August, 1879, bearing a return dated 5th August, 1879, with levies on a very large amount of personal property. These levies were attached by a separate paper to the writs ; and attached to one of these writs, underneath, and therefore prior to the levy, was the notice of the landlord, dated 2d September, 1879.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b472-8\">This was competent testimony to show that the notice reached the sheriff before his writ was <em>actually returned </em>into the office of the prothonotary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b473-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>It was from this evident that the date in the return, to wit, 5th August, 1879, was the date of the levy, not the date the writ was returned to the office. Indeed, the return states this fact: \u201cAug. 5th, 1879, I did levy,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b473-6\">There is no conclusive presumption of law that a sheriff alwaj\u2019s returns his writ on or before the return day. Prior to the Act of 2d July, 1845, real estate was frequently sold long after the return day of the writ, and such sales were recognized as valid by this court: Kelly <em>v. </em>Creen, 3 P. F. Smith, 302.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b473-7\">That Act only applied to real estate, and we believe the practice is almost universal to sell personal property after the return day: Eberle <em>v. </em>Mayer, 1 Rawle, 366; Com\u2019th <em>v. </em>Stremback, 3 Id.. 341; McClure <em>v. </em>Ege, 7 Watts, 74; Earl\u2019s Appeal, 1 Harris, 483.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b473-8\">The 85th section of the Act of 16th June, 1836, provides that \u201c whenever any goods and chattels liable to the payment of rent as aforesaid shall be seized in execution, <em>the proceedings upon such execution shall not he stayed hy the plaintiff </em>therein, without the consent of the person entitled to. such rent, in writing, first had and obtained.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b473-9\">It has been decided in mail}7 cases, beginning, perhaps, with Greider\u2019s Appeal, 5 Barr, 422, that the provisions of 83d, 84th and 85th sections of this Act were intended to make amends to the landlord for taking away his power of distress by a judicial sale of the tenant\u2019s goods. In other words, that the notice required by the Act\u2019 and the decisions thereunder amount practically to a warrant of distress..</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b473-10\">When, therefore, the sheriff receives such notice he is entrusted, as such officer, with the goods of the tenant for the benefit of his landlord, and the execution process, being substituted for the distress, becomes <em>pro hac vice </em>the writ of the landlord as well as of the execution creditor, for the purpose of effecting a sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b473-11\">Hence, the writ shall not be stayed, \u201cwithout the consent of the landlord,\u201d and it becomes the duty of the sheriff to execute the writ, unless relieved both by the plaintiff and the landlord.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b473-12\">Mr. Justice Paxson</author>\n<p id=\"AE6\">delivered the opinion of the court October 19th, 1885.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-13\">Complaint is made in the first specification of error .that the learned judge did not submit to the jury the question wheth\u00e9r Gilmore,- the landlord, had served a notice of his claim for rent upon the sheriff or his deputies.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-14\">As all the evidence in regard to the notice appears of record, it was not error in the court to pass upon its sufficiency. The court deemed it sufficient and gave a binding instruction. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>there was <em>prima facie </em>evidence upon the record of the notice the instruction was right, as no evidence of any kind was offered by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The record evidence consisted of the sheriff\u2019s return to the writ of <em>fieri facias </em>and the paper attached to said writ. The return sets out a levy on August 5th, 1879, on the personal property of John F. Thomas, and that the same property remained in his (the sheriff\u2019s) hands unsold for want of buyers, with a schedule thereof. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">It does not appear when this return was made. Attached to the writ was a notice from Gilmore, the landlord, to the sheriff, that he claimed one year\u2019s rent, six hundred dollars, out of the proceeds of the sale of the personal property. The notice is dated Sept. 2d, 1879. There was no oral testimony to show when or bjr whom the notice was attached, to the return, and the return itself makes no mention of the paper. What is the presumption arising from the face of the papers? Is it that the notice was duly served on the sheriff or his deputy?</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">We think it makes out a <em>prima facie </em>case of notice. Of course there is a possibility of the notice having been attached to the writ surreptitiously by some one other than the sheriff. But this is a matter of defence on the part of the sheriff. The law makes no such presumption. The paper is addressed to the sheriff, and is attached to his return. This is sufficient evidence, in the absence of all opposing proof, to show the receipt of the notice by the sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">The second assignment alleges that the court erred in entering judgment for the plaintiff on the verdict on the reserved question. The reserved question was whether, under the facts as presented by the record, there can be any recovery. We see no error in the ruling upon this point. The record shows the receipt of the notice before the return of the writ. The precise time of the return is not therefore of much importance. In the absence of all proof there is no presumption that it was returned before the return da3r, which it was conceded was on the 25th of August. The record also shows that a <em>venditioni exponas </em>was subsequenth1, issued to sell the property levied upon-under the <em>fieri facias, </em>and the following return to said writ: \u201c November 10th, 1879. After $220 paid to plaintiff the writ was stayed by order of the plaintiff.\u201d It thus appears the sheriff paid no attention to the landlord\u2019s claim, but collected a portion of the money, paid it over to the plaintiff in the execution and returned the writ st.a3red. Whether this was the result of ignorance or design is not material, as the effect upon the rights of the landlord is the same. The sheriff had notice of the landlord\u2019s claim and he disregarded it at his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>peril. It makes but little difference when it was given. Anytime before the return of the <em>vend, ex., </em>and the payment of the money over to the execution creditor would have been sufficient. There was no time when the property was not bound by the lien of the levy after the levy had been made. The <em>venditioni exponas </em>was but a continuation of the <em>fieri facias. </em>The sheriff knew that the landlord claimed his rent out of the proceeds of the sale of the property levied upon, and that is enough to fix his liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">Since the passage of the Act of 16th June, 1836 \u2014 see section 85, P. L., 777 \u2014 a sheriff who returns an execution stayed, after a levy on personal property, and notice of a claim of rent from the landlord of the defendant in such execution, does so at his own risk, unless he has the consent in writing of the landlord. The act prohibits the plaintiff from staying a writ under such circumstances without such consent. This is the compensation which the law gives the landlord whose right of distress is interfered with by the levy.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b475-6\">Mercur, C.
