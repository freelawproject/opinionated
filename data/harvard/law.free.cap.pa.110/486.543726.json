The deed-upon which she relies is dated since her marriage; and before she can defeat a verdict for the plaintiffs in this case she must show affirmatively, that she not only has received money or other property by \u2018 will, descent, conveyance or otherwise,\u2019 but that \u25a0 she actually applied them in payment of the property claimed.\u201d \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-7\">Answer. \u201c This is affirmed. It is hardly applicable to this ease, although in general terms it is. She didn\u2019t acquire it by \u2018will, descent or conveyance,\u2019 b\u00fct she did with the consent of her husband, \u2018 otherwise,\u2019 that is to say, according to the law of their position \u2014 now .1 am not endorsing it, I am only stating it-^-upon the presumption that the husband hadn\u2019t provided for the wife arid she earned the money under the Act of 1855, as her own-; and interpreting it in that way, the point is affirmed.\u201d (Fourth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-8\">5. \u201cThat the evidence in this case is not such as to entitle Jane Anderson, wife of Daniel M.

There was not sufficient evidence of the suspension of the marital rights of the husband to relieve the wife of-marital disabilities.

There is evidence for your consideration upon the question of whether you ought to do that.' When there is no evidence, or a mere spark of evidence, or so little that we would be compelled to set aside the verdict if the jury found a certain way, we feel justified in taking a-case from the jury; but in this case, we think there is evidence here for your serious consideration, that you ought to scan carefully and dosel}\u2019 \u2014 evidence offered on the part, of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>the defendant, here, which if you believe, would not only justify you, but make it your duty to find a verdict for the defendants; and thinking so, we have no right to take the ease from you, but submit it under all the evidence, simply saying that the burden of proof is on the defendant to establish to your satisfaction that she is entitled to the benefits of this Act of 1855, in order to justify you in finding for her.\u201d (Fifth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-6\">6. \u201cUnder all the evidence in this case their. verdict must be for the plaintiffs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-7\">Answer. \u201c This is also refused.\u201d (Sixth assignment of error.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-8\">The court charged the jury, <em>inter alia, </em>as follows: [\u201cThe Supreme Court have held in a ease of this kind whenever it is made to appear to the satisfaction of the jury, that a husband by reason of drunkenness, profligacy or other cause, has failed, neglected or refused to provide for his wife, that is, to give her a reasonable \u2014 I suppose it means \u2014 a reasonable and competent living according to his supposed circumstances, or if without her own assistance she is unable to procure enough to eat'for herself and family, or if she hasn\u2019t sufficient clothing \u2014 the word \u201cprovide \u201d means, shall give her that which shall be reasonable and necessary, I presume \u2014 the construction I would put on it \u2014to keep the soul and body together, at least to keep her from freezing, to do that which is necessary to contribute to her reasonable health and comfort \u2014 or if a man from whatever cause, because it may not necessarily be from drunkenness \u2014 if he stays away from home, preventing him from doing that which he ought to do to maintain his\u2019wife and family. \u2014 if from any cause so neglects his wife that she is unable to live by reason of what he does for her, then the provisions of this Act come into effect, and the law assumes that thereby he has forfeited his right to her labor, and gives her a right to maintain herself.] ....</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-9\">. \u201cA man may make a great deal of money, but if he is drunk a great part of the time, it is not very likely, ordinarily, that much of it will go to the support of Ids family, because drunkenness costs a great deal-; and the evidence of it has a tendency to support the fact that he don\u2019t provid\u00e9 for his family, first, because drunkenness makes men careless1 and indifferent, \u00e1nd they are also apt to be wasteful, and whatever they earn can\u2019t go to the wife and family because it is gone before it gets there... Yet drunkenness may become a habit, and a man provide for his family just as liberally as yon or I, or even more so. So that the matter of drunkenness is only to be looked at as it bears on the question of provision for the family.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-10\">\u201c [If he wasn\u2019t drunk at all, and didn\u2019t provide for the family, she would have a right to purchase the property and pay for it</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>with her own earnings, and in case of a contest with her husband\u2019s creditors, it would be for the jury to determine, as in this Case, whether or not the allegations, taken with the other evidence in the case, were true \u2014 that he didn\u2019t provide for the family.] \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-4\">\u201c Now, gentlemen, whenever a person sets up a defense of this kind, or makes an allegation of this kind to take away the <em>prima facie </em>rights of others, as it is manifestly in the plaintiffs under the record in this case, the evidence should reasonably and fairly satisfy the jury that it is true.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-5\">\u201c [You ought to be satisfied by the weight of the testimony in this case, that Mrs. Anderson was not provided for by her husband from whatever the reason \u2014 the apparent reason, if at all, being that of drunkenness. Now, did she have to support this family, or did the husband do it ? I don\u2019t mean by that, did he not contribute some. I don\u2019t apprehend that that is the meaning of the Act. Did he do it substantially, or was the family thrown into such a position by reason of his refusing to provide for them, whether arising from drunkenness or not, that she had herself to go outside of her ordinary domestic duties as a wife, and resort to her needle to keep the children in clothing and food? If she did, then she had a right, if she could do so, to take those earnings, or some of them, if any were left after providing for the children, to buy property and hold it in her own name, and keep the title for it as against her husband\u2019s creditors. That is the whole - case, gentlemen, as I understand it here. Did the husband provide for the wife, or did he leave her in such a position that she had to resort to her needle to keep herself and children from suffering and perhaps starvation? If he did, then under the Act of Assembly, without any proceedings in court, the law gave her the right from that time to be what we call a <em>feme sole </em>trader\u2014 earn her money for herself, and spend her money for herself and her family; and if the evidence shows that that relation arose before she bought this property, and that she bought it on credit and subsequently paid for it with the product of her own earnings, then this property is hers, and your verdict ought to be for her; that is, the defendant.] If the evidence, however, don\u2019t satisfy you of that fact, and the presumption of the law is the other way, you ought to find for the plaintiffs. [But if the evidence satisfies you fairly and reasonably, that the husband didn\u2019t provide for her \u2014 for we must harp upon that -thing all the time, for that is the question in this case \u2014 then your verdict, if she paid for this property out of her own earnings, should be for her:] \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-6\">At the conclusion of the charge, counsel for plaintiffs made the following request: \u2014 \u201c If your Honor pleases, we would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>like you to instruct-the jury specially on the question of fraud \u2014that even though they believe the evidence is such as to entitle Mrs. Anderson to the benefits of the Act of May 4th, 1855, yet if they believe that the property in dispute was actually paid for with money belonging to Daniel M. Anderson, then their verdict ought to be for the plaintiffs.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-6\">By the Court \u2014 \u201c I thought I had done that substantially.

Not that she paid money, but if clothing was given, that it belonged to her or that she paid for that clothing by means of her own labor. (To counsel.)

It amounts to nothing. It is the most common thing in the world for people not to satisfy mortgages.

A mere failure to support on the part of the husband has never been held .sufficient to entitle the wife to the benefits of this Act: King <em>v. </em>Thompson, 6 Norris, 369.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b507-14\">The Act of 1855 provides, \u201c That whenever any husband from drunkenness, profligacy or other cause, shall neglect or refuse to provide for his wife, or shall desert her, she shall have all the privileges secured to a <em>feme sole </em>trader, under the Act of the twenty-second of February, one thousand seven hundred and eighteen.\u201d The Act does not use the word failed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Out as stated by the trial judge broadly and without qualification in a part of his charge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-5\">Under the construction put upon the Act of 1855 by the court below, any failure upon the part of -the husband to provide for the wife, that renders her aid or assistance necessary, however slight that aid or assistance, to her support, makes him, to use the language- of the Act, \u201c as if he were previously dead.\u201d Such a construction ignores the whole doctrine of the laws of this commonwealth, that a wife shall be a help-meet to her husband, and makes her, as far as he and his creditors are concerned, a mere toy, an ornament and useless thing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-6\">\u25a0 The remarks of the learned judge at the close of the charge were made in the presence of the jury; and the result would have been the same had he given them a binding instruction for defendant: Linn <em>v. </em>Com\u2019th, 15 Norris, 285; Stokes <em>v. </em>Miller, 10 W.

Daniel M. Anderson was the cutter in the shop during these years that Mrs. Anderson paid 'for the property. What would it avail if he earned two or three dollars a day and spent it all at night for whiskey ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-8\">The portions of the charge assigned as error are mere extracts; the whole charge left the case fairly to the jury, and hence error cannot be assigned, because the judge gave his opinion on facts which he afterwards left to the jury: Long <em>v. </em>Ramsay, 1 S. &amp; R., 72.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-9\">The questions.involved in this case are: Did the drunkenness, proven by many' witnesses against Daniel M. Anderson, and the incapacity it produced to provide for his family, proven by as many witnesses, and the arrangement made between the husband and wife, that she should have her earnings, bring her within the provisions of the Act of May 4th, 1885 ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b508-10\">The leading case on this branch of the case is Black <em>v. </em>Tricker, 9 P.

And did the wife pay for the property by her labor? If so, were the questions of fact fairly left to the jury? These are questions that must be decided, by this court on the inspection of the record.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b508-11\">Mr. Justice Clank</author>\n<p id=\"ATE\">delivered the opinion of the court Novem: ber 9th, 1885.</p>\n<p id=\"ALcx\">The .title to the premises described in this writ of ejectment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>it is admitted, was in Samuel Montgomery, who by articles of agreement, in the month of May, 1879, sold and agreed to convey the same to Jane Anderson, wife of Daniel M. Anderson, for a consideration of $500. It is conceded, also, that the purchase was made wholly upon personal credit, and that Jane Anderson was, at the time, possessed of no separate estate, upon the credit of which, as against her husband and his creditors, the purchase could be supported. The purchase money was all afterwards paid, however, and on the 26th January, 1882, Montgomery executed the deed in accordance with the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The plaintiffs claim to have title to the property under and by virtue of a sheriff\u2019s conveyance of the right of Daniel M. Anderson, the husband, under a sale upon a judgment, obtained for a debt contracted in 1874.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">The defendant, Jane Anderson, claims title to herself under the deed from Samuel Montgomery. She alleges that her husband, Daniel M. Anderson, in the year 1878 and in subsequent years, from habitual drunkenness, neglected or refused to provide for her and her children, twelve in number, and that by reason thereof by the provisions of the second section of the Act of 4th May, 1855, she became and was entitled to all the rights and privileges of a <em>feme sole </em>trader, under the Act of 22d February, 1718; that from her separate earnings as a seamstress or vest maker, she was obliged to maintain and support herself and her children ; that from a portion of the said earnings she purchased and paid for the property in dispute, in quarter yearly instalments of $37.50 each, and that the lot of ground, thus acquired by her, thereby became her own absolute estate, which in the language of the law, is \u201c subject to her free and absolute disposal,\u201d without any liability to be interfered with or obtained by her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">If the facts are as thus alleged, on the part of the defendants, it is clear, that, even in the absence of a decree to that effect, the marital disabilities of the wife were to this extent removed; she might trade on her own account independently of her husband, might avail herself of her own earnings, might sue and be sued in her own name, and might acquire and exercise dominion over property in her own right, and that the marital rights of her husband were to the same extent suspended. It follows, also, that if the wife\u2019s acquisitions, under the conditions of the Act just referred to, are her own, free from the interference of her husband, they are also free from the claims of his creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">Those portions of the charge assigned for error in the first four assignments are excerpts or extracts, which, taken out of their proper connection, do not fairly present the views of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>court upon the questions involved. It cannot be pretended upon a reading of the whole charge together, that the learned judge intended to say, or that the jury could have understood him to say, that the failure of the husband, from any cause whatsoever, to support his wife would bring her within the protection of the Act of 1855; the clear reference is to a failure from a wilful non-performance of his marital duties. That part of the charge contained in the first assignment of error, owing to the parenthetic clauses interjected, is perhaps open to the criticism that it is somewhat obscure, but it certainly contains nothing which, taken in connection with the remaining part of the charge, can be considered erroneous. The learned judge says: \u2014 \u201cThe Supreme Court has held, that in a case of this kind, whenever it is made to appear, to the satisfaction of a jury, that a husband, by reason of drunkenness, profligacy or other cause, has failed, neglected or refused to provide for his wife, that is, to give her a reasonable and competent living according to his supposed circumstances;..... or, if a man from whatever cause \u2014 because it may not neces-, sarily be from drunkenness \u2014 if he stays away from home, preventing him from doing that which he ought to do to maintain his wife and family; or,from any cause neglects his wife, that she is unable to live by reason of what he does for her, then the provisions of this Act come into effect,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The meaning of all this is plain and obvious; the failure referred to is such only as results from drunkenness or profligacy, or when the husband is in circumstances to render support, from wilful absence, or from neglect. If the husband\u2019s circumstances, either from sickness or other inability, were such as to prevent him from supporting his wife, his failure of course could not affect his marital rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The second assignment is we think equally without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">. As to the measure of support, which the husband must provide for his wife, exception is taken\u201d to the charge in the third assignment. The learned judge instructed the jury, in substance, that to provide for a wife was to give her a reasonable and competent livelihood, aceofding to the husband\u2019s circumstances, what was necessary to- contribute to her reasonable health and comfort, adding, that it should be enough \u201c to keep her soul and body together at least, and to keep her from freezing.\u201d Of this, we think, the plaintiffs certainly cannot have the conscience to complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">They do complain, however, that the court.in this connection said to the jury that if a wife, through the neglect of her husband, without her own assistance, was unable to procure .enough to eat, for herself and family, or sufficient clothing to wear, she would come within the conditions of the statute. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>husband is bound so far as he is able to support and maintain his wife, to furnish her such necessaries and comforts of life as her condition requires. Her duties are more properly of a domestic nature ; she is not bound, if her husband is able to provide, to engage in business pursuits on her own account, to support herself and family; if she did, the husband being by law entitled to her earnings, the burden of her maintenance must still rest upon him. If therefore the husband, from drunkenness, profligacy, or other cause, neglect or refuse, when able, to provide a support for his wife, the wife is not bound to undertake the burden, or even to assist in the maintenance of herself and family, except upon the terms designated in the Act. If she is to labor on her own account, for her own living, she has a right to her own earnings to that end. For of what avail could her assistance be, if the husband can pocket her earnings, and squander them in a drunken and profligate life? It must of course be conceded that it is the duty of a wife to aid her husband in every reasonable and appropriate way, in the conduct of his affairs, but when from drunkenness, profligacy, or other cause, he refuses or neglects to maintain and support her, or deserts her, that duty is suspended; she is thereby, to this extent at least, relieved of her marital duties and disabilities, and may devote her energy and effort, on her own account, for the support of herself and her children. This and no more is the manifest meaning of the charge of the learned court below, on this branch of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The questions raised, by the third and fourth assignments ignore the effect of the Act of 1855, and are not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">In the fifth and sixth points submitted by the plaintiffs, the court was requested, substantially, to charge the jury, that the evidence was not such as to entitle Jane Anderson to the benefit of the Act of 1855; that she had no claim to the status of a <em>feme sole </em>trader at the time of the purchase of the property in dispute, and that under all the evidence the verdict should be for the plaintiff. Upon a careful examination of the testimony, we are of opinion that the learned court was right in refusing this instruction. In the testimony of Elizabeth Anderson, Ella Engle, Huida Kedman, Emma Huggins, C. E. Bower, David Harman, Dan\u2019l Anderson, Jr., Jane Anderson and others, there is abundant evidence from which the jury might find that from 1876 to 1879 and for some years thereafter, Dan\u2019l M. Anderson was a very dissipated man; that several times during each week he went into a drunken debauch, was often carried home by his sons and his neighbors, to be cared for by his wife; that from habitual drunkenness he neglected his business, and also his wife and family, and failed to provide them with the necessaries of life ; that his wife was com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>pelled to rely iipon her own labor for supportj that she engaged in the business of vest making on her own account, worked early and late, oftentimes until twelve o\u2019clock at night, and by her own earnings, to a great degree, supported herself and her family. The veracity of the witnesses, and the weight and conflict of the evidence were for the jury, but that the testimony referred to was sufficient to justify a submission of the question cannot be doubted.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">The court was, we think, fully justified in saying in answer to the fifth point, \u201c There is evidence here for your serious consideration, that you ought to scan carefully and closely, evidence offered on the part of the defendant, which, if you belieAre it, would not only justify you, but make it your duty, to find a verdict for the defendants ; and thinking so, we have no right to take the case from you, but submit it under all the! evidence, simply saying, that the burden of proof is on the defendant to establish to your satisfaction that she is entitled to the benefits of the Act of 1855, in order to justify you in finding for her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The somewhat spirited colloquy between the plaintiff\u2019s counsel and the court, at the close of the charge, under the circumstances in which it occurred, is not such as to call for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">We find no error in this record; the several assignments of error are not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
