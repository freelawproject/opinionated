Flenniken, cashier of said bank, for 5-20 bonds, to an equal amount, but the original certificate was- not lifted, nor was any other certificate given. John Bell died intestate in October,\" 1866, leaving his wife and five children surviving him. Charles Hughes, the plaintiff in this case, was appointed guardian of Elizabeth, the oldest child, and Samuel Luse and Jesse K. Bailey were appointed guardians of the other four children; and letters of administration upon the estate were issued to his widow and James Bell. In September, 1871, the administrators settled their final account, showing a balance in their hands of about $30,000, which consisted in part of these bonds. In pursuance of an agreement between them, the administrators and guardians met at the bank, on October 2d, 1871, and the certificate of September 27th, 1865, was then surrendered, and other certificates were issued to the guardians \u2014 the one to Charles Hughes, guardian of Elizabeth, being in the following form:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-4\">\u201c First National Bank or Waynesburg.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-5\">Capital Stock $100,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-6\">R.

McVav and Company, their correspondents in Pittsburgh, to secure which government bonds were deposited and when the loans were called the bank was unable to pay and the bonds, in amount sufficient to cover the call, were sold. The bonds thus given as collateral belonged to plaintiff and were given as collateral and sold without the knowledge or authority of the guardian.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-13\">\u25a0On January 14th, 1874, the bank went into voluntary liquidation and shortly afterward the plaintiff called and demanded the bonds. He was informed by B. F. Flenniken, the assistant cashier, that the bonds were not in the bank, but had been sent to Pittsburgh for safe keeping. He said that they were \u201c all right \u201d and that he would have them brought back in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>few days. \u25a0\u25a0 J. C. Flenniken told the same story and made repeated promises to get the bonds from Pittsburgh and return them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-4\">The interest was regularly paid on these bonds until January 1st, 1876, which was some two years after the sale of the bonds. In April of that year the plaintiff first learned that the bonds had been sold by McVay <em>&amp; </em>Co., and at the trial of a criminal prosecution, brought by Hughes and the other guardians, against J. C. Flenniken for embezzlement, it was discovered that they had been appropriated to the use of the bank. Plaintiff, subsequently, on February 18th, 1882, brought this suit against the bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-5\">The d\u00e9fendant requested the court to charge \u201cthat the plaintiff\u2019s claim being barred by the Statute of Limitation he cannot recover.\u201d Answer. \u201cAffirmed.\u201d Exception.

Instead of exercising any diligence the plaintiff has been guilty of the grossest negligence. It was gross negligence not to demand the production of the bonds at the time the certificate was issued; it was gross negligence not to withdraw the bonds when in the fall of 1874, or before that time, he learned that the bank had got into difficulties and had gone into liquidation ; it was gross negligence to repose confidence in the repeated promises of Flenniken, which were always broken ; it was gross negligence not to sue for the bonds when Flenniken failed to surrender them on demand; and it was gross negligence to delay bringing suit nearly twelve years after the embezzlement occurred.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b447-7\">Mr. Justice Paxson</author>\n<p id=\"ANxS\">delivered the opinion of the court, October 19th, 1885.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">The single question presented by this record is whether the learned judge of the court below was correct in holding that the plaintiff\u2019s claim was barred by the Statute of Limitations. The action was assumpsit, and to the defendant\u2019s plea of non assumpsit <em>infra sex annos </em>the plaintiff replied specially that the defendant bank, in violation of the trust and confidence reposed in it, had converted and did convert certain bonds to the amount of $2,400 to its own use, and fraudulently and deceitfully neglected and refused to give information thereof, and kept the.plaintiff entirely ignorant thereof until about the first of January, A. d. 1877, less than six years before the commencement of this suit, when the said plaintiff accidentally discovered said concealment and fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">It may be that in the origin of this transaction the bank was not responsible for the bonds. They appear to have been received for save keeping by B. F. Flenniken, who was the assis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>taut cashier, as an individual transaction, and for the accommodation of the plaintiff. There is no trace of any authority from the board of directors to receive such deposits. But when Mr. Flenniken, as cashier, pledged the bonds for the debt of the bank to Ira B. McVay &amp; Co., the matter became a transaction of the bank; the fraud of Mr. Flenniken became the fraud of the bank, and his concealment of the pledge became the bank\u2019s concealment. The bonds were subsequently sold by McVay &amp; Co., and the proceeds went to pay the defendant bank\u2019s debts. The bank cannot retain the fruits of the crime and repudiate the fraud of its agent. No. authority is needed for so plain a proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"A2G\">The certificate of deposit bears date October 2d, 1871. The suit below was commenced February 18th, 1882. It was not until the month of April, 1876, that the plaintiff was informed that the bonds had been pledged and sold, and the proceeds credited to the bank. It is true the plaintiff called at the bank in 1874, and at several other times subsequently to get his bonds and take them away. But he was always put off with excuses; he was informed that the bonds had been sent to Pittsburgh for safe keeping. In the meantime the bank continued to pay him the interest, even after the bonds had been sold. All this was a fraud and concealment, well calculated to throw the plaintiff off his guard. Repeated promises were made to him bjr the cashier to get the bonds from Pittsburgh and return them. But they never came. Performance of the promise was evaded and fresh promises substituted. It may be that these were circumstances of suspicion, calculated to alarm a prudent man. If we concede this to be so it does not help the defendant bank. It cannot take advantage of its own wrong. Holding the plaintiff\u2019s property and having fraudulently converted it to its own use, and concealed that fact from him, we will not be astute to hold the plaintiff to knowledge which he did not possess. The concealment of the fraud prevented the running of the Statute: Morgan <em>v. </em>Tener, 2 Norris, 305; Wickersham v. Lee, Id., 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">From April, 1876, to the commencement of this suit was less than six years. The jury should have been instructed that if the fraud was concealed from the plaintiff until April, 1876, the plaintiff\u2019s claim was not barred by the Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">The judgment is reversed and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
