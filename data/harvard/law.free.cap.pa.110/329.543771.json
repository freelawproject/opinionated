James Bradley, deceased, from a decree of said court charging the estate of said James Bradley with collateral inheritance tax.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-13\">The facts were as follows: James Bradley, a catholic priest at Newry, Pa., executed bis last will on December 1st, 1881, in which lie bequeathed the greater part of bis estate, consisting of bonds, stocks, etc., to certain of his collateral relatives and for religious and charitable purposes.

Seibert were named as the executors, that be held securities amounting to $49,400, deposited with the Fidelity Insurance Trust and Safe Deposit Company of Philadelphia, for which he held receipt No. 20,192. That he also held thirteen bonds of Blair county, amounting to $2,900, together with other property, and in order to relieve himself of all worldly cares and anxieties, so far as possible, and in consideration of one dollar, he granted and assigned all of said securities, and other property, to them, for their own use and benefit, during bis life, they to receive to their own use the income, to be equally divided between them, and, at his death, to hold the same \u201c for the uses and purposes of bis will then deposited in the First National Bank of Hollidays<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>burg, they to apply the\u201d same, after deducting any expenses of the trust, to the legacies therein mentioned.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-6\">John Bradley and Seibert took possession'of this property under this deed, which was duly acknowledged, and received the income therefrom to their own use until the death of James Bradley, which took place on April 13th, 1883.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-7\">This will, after a citation issued, was duly admitted to probate on November 10th, 1883, and letters testamentary were issued to the executors named.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-8\">On November 19th, 1883, the Register of Wills appointed an appraiser to value the estate so that it might be assessed for collateral inheritance. The appraiser made a return of personal property which he valued at $51,591.50; accompanied with his certificate that \u201c the bonds, stocks, etc., in the foregoing appraisement are claimed by the executors, not under the will of' the decedent, but under a deed made by testator, dated -- 1882, and that the said sums are not liable to a collateral inheritance tax.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-11\">The Register, on the assumption that the appraised property passed by the will, assessed the collateral inheritance tax as provided by law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-12\">From this assessment the executors appealed to the Orphans\u2019 Court.

That this is not necessary has been'recently declared by this court in Reish <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 10 Out. 521. To the same effect is Wright\u2019s Appeal, 2 Wright, 507.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b346-15\">The opinion of the Court was filed October 5th, 1885.</p>\n<author id=\"b346-16\">PeR Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AS9\">\u2014 The intent of the testator is-to be deduced from the language of his will. An examination thereof clearly leads to the conclusion that its main purpose was to prevent his property from liability to a collateral inheritance tax. The property which he sought to transfer was not to take effect in enjoyment until after his death. This clearly subjects the property to a collateral inheritance tax under Section 1 of the Act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>7 tb April, 1826. The deed executed by the testator on the 14th of August, 1882, did not change the time of enjoyment previously designated in his will. It expressly declared the vendees should hold the \u201cproperty in trust for the uses and purposes set forth in the said will.\u201d The learned judge correctly entered judgment in favor of the Commonwealth, and the decreeing accordingly is right: Reish <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 10 Out. 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
