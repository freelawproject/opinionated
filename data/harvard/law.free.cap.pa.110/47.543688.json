Sober and Abigail his wife, in her right, were plaintiffs, and Charles Standart was defendant, to determine the ownership of certain wheat, etc., levied on by the sheriff by virtue of a writ of fi. fa. issued by the defendant against Isaac J. Sober.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-12\">On the trial, before Rockefeller, P. J., it appeared that on March 6th, 1880, Abigail Sober purchased from Vastine and Muencli a tract of farm land containing twenty-five acres, for $2000, securing the whole purchase money by a bond and mortgage, in which her husband joined, no part of which has been paid. The premises were occupied by both husband and wife, who by their joint exertions raised and harvested the wheat, oats and potatoes which were levied on in execution at the suit of Charles Standart, a judgment creditor of the husband, as the property of said husband. It also appeared, inter alia, that Isaac J. Sober was insolvent, and that his wife possessed no separate estate, but had obtained a judgment against him for money loaned him derived from her deceased father\u2019s estate, prior to the entry of defendant Standards judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-13\">There being no dispute as to the facts, the court instructed the jury to find for defendant.

The question of fraud is generally one of fact, upon all the evidence; or one of both law and fact, to be answered by the jury under proper instructions as to the law, by the court.- Rarely,, if ever, is it one of law exclusively for the court, without the aid of a juiy.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b64-6\"><em>S.

F. S., 448; Seeds <em>v. </em>Kahler, 26 Id., 262. It is equally as well settled that when she has no separate estate, and buys property on her personal credit, she cannot so hold it: Baringer <em>v. </em>Stiver, 13 Wright, 129; Brown <em>v. </em>Pendleton, 10 P. F. S., 419; Bucher <em>v. </em>Ream, 18 Id., 421; Seeds <em>v. </em>Kahler, supra; Sixbee <em>v. </em>Bowen, 10 Norris, 149; Lochman <em>v. </em>Brobst, 6 Out., 481. The true intent of the Act of 1848 is to preserve to her and to protect her in the use and enjoyment of her bona fide separate estate, but not to enable her to defraud the. creditors of her husband. In the present case the wife had no separate estate on which a credit could be based. The purchase was solely on the personal credit of herself and of her husband. There is no error in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
