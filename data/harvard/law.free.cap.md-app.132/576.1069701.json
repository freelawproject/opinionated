He was sentenced to consecutive life sentences plus twenty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>years. Appellant appealed to this Court, and we reversed and remanded the case for a new trial. <em>Daniel v. State, </em>No. 183, September Term, 1994, 101 Md.App. 719 (unreported).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Appellant was retried in May of 1996. He was convicted of conspiracy to murder and acquitted of first degree murder. The court sentenced appellant to life imprisonment. Appellant appealed to this Court, and we again reversed and remanded the case for a new trial. <em>Daniel v. State, </em>No. 1062, September Term, 1996, 116 Md.App. 734 (unreported).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">The second retrial took place in December 1998. Appellant was convicted of conspiracy to murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Appellant appeals from that conviction and presents the following questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-7\">1. Did the trial court err in allowing the lead detective to testify that, after he \u201creceived all the information,\u201d he \u201celiminated\u201d Sterling Bailey \u201cas a suspect\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-8\">2. Did the trial court err in allowing the State to comment that appellant\u2019s silence at the time he was apprehended showed consciousness of guilt?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">We answer \u201cno\u201d to these questions and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">In this appeal, both appellant and the State accept the facts as summarized by this Court in <em>Daniel v. State, </em>No. 1062, slip op. at 1-2. In our unreported opinion, we summarized the facts as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-12\">On 19 December 1992, appellant Steven Daniel, Maurice Osborne, and Sterling Bailey attended a party. At the party, Bailey allegedly overheard a conversation between Osborne and appellant in which Osborne stated he was upset with his girlfriend, Chaquista Spriggs, and wanted her killed. Earlier in the day, Spriggs had informed Osborne that she was seeing another man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-13\">Osborne had previously agreed to pick Spriggs up from work and walk her home at 10:00 that evening. Appellant and Osborne planned that appellant would follow as Os<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>borne walked Spriggs home from work. According to Bailey, appellant offered to kill Spriggs and make it look like a robbery gone awry by inflicting a non-fatal gunshot wound on Osborne. At the time of the conversation, Osborne was carrying a .9 millimeter gun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-4\">Appellant left the party some time before 10:00 p.m. Around the same time, Osborne also left the party to pick up Spriggs when she got off work. After appellant and Osborne had left the party, Bailey left with Dorcena Douglas to go to Douglas\u2019s house and check on her children. Bailey stayed at Douglas\u2019s house for about 15 minutes and then returned to the party. At approximately 10:15 p.m., Spriggs was fatally shot in the head; Osborne was shot in the shoulder, but survived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">Although Bailey testified that he believed that Osborne and appellant were joking when they discussed killing Spriggs earlier in the evening, Bailey became concerned when Osborne had not returned to the party by 11:00 p.m. Bailey learned that a shooting had occurred near Spriggs\u2019s place of work and that the victims were taken to Sinai Hospital. Around midnight, Bailey visited Osborne at the hospital and learned that Spriggs was dead. When Bailey returned to the party, he was allegedly told by appellant in detail how he killed Spriggs and shot Osborne. At approximately 2:00 a.m., appellant walked Douglas home from the party and slept on her couch. Douglas testified that she saw a gun in appellant\u2019s coat pocket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">Approximately two months later, appellant was arrested and charged with murder in the first degree, conspiracy to commit murder, and handgun charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">Appellant\u2019s first argument on appeal is that the court erroneously permitted the investigating police officer, Sergeant Thomas Pellegrini, to testify on redirect examination as to his \u201cpersonal opinion\u201d about Bailey\u2019s involvement in the case and his general veracity. Specifically, appellant contends that the officer should not have been permitted to answer the State\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>question regarding Bailey\u2019s \u201cstatus\u201d in the investigation. We disagree and find that Sergeant Pellegrini\u2019s testimony was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">\n<em>Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Generally, the scope of examination of witnesses is a matter left largely to the discretion of the trial court; we will not disturb the court\u2019s determination absent a clear abuse of discretion. <em>See, e.g., Green v. State, </em>127 Md.App. 758, 764, 736 A.2d 450 (1999) (citing <em>Conyers v. State, </em>354 Md. 132, 729 A.2d 910 (1999); <em>Oken v. State, </em>327 Md. 628, 669, 612 A.2d 258 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>507 U.S. 931, 113 S.Ct. 1312, 122 L.Ed.2d 700 (1993); <em>Trimble v. State, </em>300 Md. 387, 401, 478 A.2d 1143 (1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1230, 105 S.Ct. 1231, 84 L.Ed.2d 368 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">The trial judge\u2019s discretion in controlling the scope of redirect examination is wide. <em>See Bailey v. State, </em>16 Md.App. 83, 110-111, 294 A.2d 123 (1972). Even inquiry into new matters not within the scope of cross-examination may be permitted, and a party is generally entitled to have his witness explain or amplify testimony that he has given on cross-examination and to explain any apparent inconsistencies. <em>Feeney v. Dolan, </em>35 Md.App. 538, 371 A.2d 679, <em>cert. denied, </em>280 Md. 730 (1977). The judge\u2019s discretion is particularly wide \u201cwhere the inquiry is directed toward developing facts made relevant during cross-examination or explaining away discrediting facts.\u201d <em>Bailey, </em>16 Md.App. at 110-111, 294 A.2d 123 (citing <em>Mills v. State, </em>12 Md.App. 449, 279 A.2d 473, <em>cert. denied, </em>263 Md. 717 (1971)).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">\n<em>Cross Examination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">In his brief to this Court, appellant asserts that \u201c[t]he State\u2019s theory of the case was that its witness, Sterling Bailey, truthfully recounted Appellant\u2019s participation in the conspiracy and murder of the victim, and the wounding of her jilted boyfriend Maurice Osborne to cover up the conspiracy to murder her.\u201d The defense theory, however, \u201cwas that it was actually Sterling Bailey who conspired with Osborne <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>and committed both shootings.\u201d Consistent with that theory, defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Sergeant Pellegrini primarily focused on his interviews with Bailey. Counsel repeatedly asked the officer whether he believed Bailey\u2019s statements <em>{e.g., </em>\u201c[Y]ou didn\u2019t really believe that, did you?\u201d) and whether Bailey was a suspect in the crime <em>{e.g., </em>\u201c[Y]ou began to say to him that, in fact, he was a suspect. Didn\u2019t you?\u201d). The following excerpts from Sergeant Pellegrini\u2019s cross-examination further illustrate that line of questioning.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: If you\u2019re talking on the 26th, 27 th, now you\u2019re looking for [Bailey] maybe even as a suspect or a participant because you know the two of them are together during the day. I\u2019m not saying he is a suspect\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-6\">[ASSISTANT STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Objection, Your Honor. There\u2019s a question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">THE COURT: Let him answer. Try to keep it at one question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay. You now know that he, Mr. Bailey[,] probably knows something and might be involved. Correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-9\">THE COURT: You need to clarify on what day. I think that\u2019s the problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-10\">[SGT. PELLEGRINI]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: On the 26th or 27th of December. I\u2019m sorry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-12\">[SGT. PELLEGRINI]: Let me try to make this clear. On the 21st, I get the name of Sterling as being with him or at the party or wherever it was. Now I don\u2019t set out immediately to track him down and bring him in\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-13\">Q: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-14\">A: \u2014because as I recall, I\u2019m on my midnight shift, it\u2019s close [to] Christmas\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-15\">Q: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-16\">A: \u2014the 21st I do the interview\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Q: And you\u2019ve got the holiday. I understand all those reasons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-4\">A: \u2014and the next day comes through and I\u2019m trying to locate him. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s a suspect and I have to make an arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-5\">Q: No, I understand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Defense counsel also asked the officer numerous questions that required him to give his opinion of Bailey\u2019s credibility and to speculate about Bailey\u2019s true knowledge of the crime. Defense counsel acknowledged, through his questions, that the officer would be making credibility determinations based on his experience as an investigator.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: . .. you\u2019re an experienced homicide detective, you sat down with him, and you took a statement from him, didn\u2019t you? You questioned him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-9\">[SGT. PELLEGRINI]: Yes, I\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-10\">Q: Interrogated him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-11\">A: I took some notes, yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-12\">Q: Okay. But notes are just as I take notes here, you\u2019re memorializing what someone said. You want them to be accurate, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-13\">A: Well, sure. I don\u2019t want to mislead myself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-14\">Q: Exactly. And you want to get as much information as you can. Correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-15\">A: Yes, Sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-16\">Q: And for two reasons. One, the more information you get from the witness on day one, when you go back on day two, if he says something differently, those are inconsistencies that help you determine their believability and credibility to find out what\u2019s going on. You\u2019re an investigator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-17\">Q: ... Now as you said before, conflicting statements of witnesses make you suspicious of their credibility. Correct? Their believability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-19\">A: Exactly. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Q: Okay. Now it\u2019s fair to say that this statement has a lot of untruth in it. Doesn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-5\">[ASSISTANT STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: It\u2019s a lie, isn\u2019t it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-8\">[ASSISTANT STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-9\">THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-10\">[SGT. PELLEGRINI]: I think the stuff that\u2019s there is true. It\u2019s just not complete with\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Not complete.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-12\">A: with why he knew all the information. It\u2019s just not the full story.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Real simply here. This person did not come forward to you and tell you the truth, did they?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-14\">A: He didn\u2019t tell the whole truth. But the statement is pretty much accurate. And I don\u2019t see a lie in it. I just don\u2019t see\u2014 he didn\u2019t explain how he had all the information that he gave me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-15\">Q: Did you ask him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-16\">A: I wasn\u2019t \u2014 when the one in particular thing about the description of the girl being shot in the head, that troubled me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-17\">A: At that point, I\u2019m beginning to think, you know, how would he know that? There\u2019s a good possibility that he knows it because he was there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-18\">Q: And that he was the shooter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-19\">A: Okay. And then I had to investigate and satisfy myself about that troubling part. And I satisfied myself through my investigation that that was not the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>\n<em>Redirect Examination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">Following defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination, the State conducted a redirect examination of Sergeant Pellegrini. On appeal, appellant challenges the following portion of the State\u2019s redirect examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\">[ASSISTANT STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: I believe [defense counsel] asked you about the 21st of December, when you got Mr. Bailey\u2019s name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-6\">[SGT. PELLEGRINI]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">Q: I believe that\u2019s when you said he was not a suspect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-8\">A: That\u2019s correct. He was a person that was there and had been with Maurice pretty much all day. So he was a crucial source of information. But certainly I had no information that indicated he was a suspect at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-9\">[ASSISTANT STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: Well in terms of your investigation, even after you received all the information that you did, what was Mr. Bailey\u2019s status?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-11\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-12\">[ASSISTANT STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: What was his status?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-13\">[SGT. PELLEGRINI]: He was eliminated as a suspect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-14\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-15\">THE COURT: Come to the bench.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-16\">During the bench conference, the court asked defense counsel to state the basis of his objection to the State\u2019s question. The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-17\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Calls for a conclusion which it\u2019s all based upon hearsay. And it\u2019s a conclusion, I don\u2019t think he can give a conclusion of whether someone committed a crime or didn\u2019t commit a crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-18\">THE COURT: I took his testimony as he can only give it based on him as the investigator. As far as he\u2019s concerned, he was eliminated as a suspect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: But the problem with him being an investigator is it doesn\u2019t just \u2014 things he observes, it\u2019s also information he receives from other people, all of which has a hearsay basis to it, that can be got from [another witness], which means that he\u2019s making a conclusion based upon hearsay. So that conclusion is based upon inadmissible evidence through this witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-5\">THE COURT: What he draws upon to make his decisions as an investigator as to arrest or not arrest, is not to adhere to the same rules that we do here. This is not testimony he relied upon that was inadmissible. He relied upon all kinds of information to make his determination. You can\u2019t put all of that under the hearsay microscope. Not for his purposes,.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">The court permitted Sergeant Pellegrini to testify that Bailey was eliminated as a suspect. On appeal, appellant maintains that the court\u2019s decision to admit that testimony was error. As we begin our analysis, we note at the outset that implicit in appellant\u2019s argument that Sergeant Pellegrini\u2019s testimony was \u201cbased upon hearsay\u201d is the assumption that the basis for the officer\u2019s testimony was apparent. On the contrary, the State did not inquire as to what formed the basis for the officer\u2019s testimony that Bailey was \u201celiminated as a suspect.\u201d At trial and on appeal, appellant assumes that the officer\u2019s testimony was based on his interviews with Bailey. The officer testified on cross-examination, however, that after interviewing Bailey his suspicions were raised and he needed to investigate further. <em>After farther investigation, </em>he was satisfied that Bailey was not a suspect. Therefore, the officer\u2019s own testimony, elicited by the defense, suggests the opposite of appellant\u2019s assumption \u2014 the ultimate \u201cconclusion\u201d that Bailey was \u201celiminated as a suspect\u201d was <em>not </em>based on the officer\u2019s conversations with Bailey. In ruling on the objection, however, the court appears also to have assumed that Bailey\u2019s statements formed the basis for the officer\u2019s testimony. Therefore, we will accept that premise for purposes of our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>\n<em>Hearsay</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Assuming Sergeant Pellegrini\u2019s testimony was based on Bailey\u2019s statements, appellant\u2019s contention that the testimony was \u201cbased upon hearsay\u201d rests on the assertion that Bailey\u2019s statements were \u201chearsay.\u201d This is simply not the case. As the trial court correctly reasoned, what the officer \u201cdraws upon to make his decisions as an investigator as to arrest or not arrest, is not to adhere to the same rules that we do here.\u201d In other words, an interviewee\u2019s statements to an investigating police officer are not \u201chearsay\u201d unless and until they are offered into evidence for their truth. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 5-801. In this case, the objected-to testimony of the officer, that Bailey was \u201celiminated as a suspect,\u201d did not offer even remotely any of Bailey\u2019s statements into evidence. (Indeed, as we have discussed, the testimony may not even have been based on Bailey\u2019s statements.) Because Bailey\u2019s statements were not out-of-court statements \u201coffered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted,\u201d they were not \u201chearsay,\u201d and the officer\u2019s testimony was not \u201cbased upon hearsay.\u201d Therefore, the trial court did not err in overruling defense counsel\u2019s objection on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">\n<em>Officer\u2019s \u201cConclusion\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">We further disagree with appellant\u2019s contention that Sergeant Pellegrini\u2019s testimony was inadmissible because it amounted to \u201ca conclusion of whether someone committed a crime or didn\u2019t commit a crime.\u201d We cannot infer an officer\u2019s ultimate conclusion as to whether a particular individual committed a crime simply from his testimony about the status of an investigation: here, that a witness \u201cwas eliminated as a suspect.\u201d Without more information, such as (1) the basis for eliminating Bailey as a suspect, (2) an indication that the decision was Sergeant Pellegrini\u2019s, or (8) that Sergeant Pellegrini agreed with the decision, drawing such an inference is simply unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">Moreover, even if we could infer that Sergeant Pellegrini was drawing \u201ca conclusion of whether someone commit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>ted a crime or didn\u2019t commit a crime,\u201d we note that appellant provides no support for the assertion that such testimony is improper. Indeed, police officers routinely testify about the conclusions they draw from their investigations that lead them to take various actions, such as making arrests, following \u201cleads,\u201d interviewing witnesses, and eliminating suspects. <em>See, e.g., Jones v. State, </em>310 Md. 569, 588, 530 A.2d 743 (1987), <em>vacated and remanded on other grounds, </em>486 U.S. 1050, 108 S.Ct. 2815, 100 L.Ed.2d 916, <em>sentence vacated on remand on other grounds, </em>314 Md. 111, 549 A.2d 17 (1988) (A detective\u2019s testimony was not inadmissible hearsay because it was not offered as an assertion of truth; rather, the testimony \u201cconcerning his initial interview with [the witness] was offered to explain how it came to be that police concluded [the defendant] was a suspect and included his picture among those in the photo array later shown to [the witness]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">It is elementary that, as long as the officer is able to provide the basis for his testimony, and the testimony is not inadmissible for other evidentiary reasons, an investigating police officer may properly testify about the conclusions he draws in the context of an investigation. This is particularly evident when one considers that <em>even the statements that led him to arrest the individual would be admissible </em>to show that the officer relied on and acted upon those statements. <em>See, e.g., Graves v. State, </em>334 Md. 30, 38, 637 A.2d 1197 (1994) (\u201cIt is well established that a relevant extrajudicial statement is admissible as nonhearsay when it is offered for the purpose of showing that a person relied on and acted upon the statement and is not introduced for the purpose of showing that the facts asserted in the statement are true.\u201d) (and cases cited therein).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">\n<em>\u201cOpen the Door\u201d Doctrine</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">There is yet another basis for rejecting appellant\u2019s argument regarding Sergeant Pellegrini\u2019s testimony about Bailey\u2019s status in the investigation. During cross-examination, defense counsel asked the officer numerous questions about appellant\u2019s status as a suspect <em>(e.g., \u201c... </em>now you\u2019re looking for [Bailey] maybe even as a suspect or a participant ...\u201d; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>\u201cYou now know that he, Mr. Bailey[,] probably knows something and might be involved. Correct?\u201d). In doing so, the defense \u201copened the door\u201d to questions about this issue during the State\u2019s redirect examination of the officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">\u201cUnder the \u2018opening the door\u2019 doctrine, otherwise irrelevant evidence may be admitted when the opposing party has \u2018opened the door\u2019 to such evidence.\u201d <em>Grier v. State, </em>351 Md. 241, 260, 718 A.2d 211 (1998) (citing <em>Conyers v. State, </em>345 Md. 525, 545, 693 A.2d 781 (1997); <em>Clark v. State, </em>332 Md. 77, 84, 629 A.2d 1239 (1993)). The Court of Appeals has described the \u201copening the door\u201d doctrine as \u201ca rule of expanded relevancy that, under limited circumstances, \u2018allows the admission of evidence that is competent, but otherwise irrelevant.\u2019 \u201d <em>Grier, </em>351 Md. at 260, 718 A.2d 211 (citing <em>Conyers, </em>345 Md. at 545, 693 A.2d 781).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-6\">The \u201copening the door\u201d doctrine is really a rule of expanded relevancy and authorizes admitting evidence which otherwise would have been irrelevant in order to respond to (1) admissible evidence which generates an issue, or (2) inadmissible evidence admitted by the court over objection. Generally, \u201copening the door\u201d is simply a contention that competent evidence which was previously irrelevant is now relevant through the opponent\u2019s admission of other evidence on the same issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-7\"><em>Clark, </em>332 Md. at 84-85, 629 A.2d 1239 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">The \u201copen the door\u201d doctrine does not, however, permit the admission of incompetent evidence \u2014 evidence that is inadmissible for reasons other than relevancy. <em>See Grier, </em>351 Md. at 260-61, 718 A.2d 211; <em>Conyers, </em>345 Md. at 546, 693 A.2d 781; <em>Clark, </em>332 Md. at 87 n. 2, 629 A.2d 1239. In this case, the basis for defense counsel\u2019s objection, although somewhat vague, was that the officer\u2019s testimony was <em>based on </em>inadmissible hearsay. The objection was not, however, that Sergeant Pellegrini\u2019s testimony was hearsay itself.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>fore, the only question before this Court as to the \u201copen the door doctrine\u201d is whether the officer\u2019s testimony was \u201cincompetent\u201d because it was \u201cbased upon hearsay.\u201d As we have previously discussed, we answer this question in the negative. Therefore, the hearsay rule was not implicated and did not bar application of the \u201copen the door\u201d doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Finally, we note that in cross-examining the officer, the defense itself had already introduced essentially the same evidence about which appellant now complains. As the Court of Appeals stated in <em>Hillard v. State, </em>286 Md. 145, 156, 406 A.2d 415 (1979), \u201c[T]he admission of improper evidence cannot be used as grounds for reversal where the defendant gives testimony on direct examination that establishes the same facts as those to which he objects.\u201d <em>See also Ball v. State, </em>347 Md. 156, 204-05, 699 A.2d 1170 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1082, 118 S.Ct. 866, 139 L.Ed.2d 763 (1998) (Appellant \u201cintroduced at sentencing substantially the same evidence about which he now complains.... For this reason as well, Appellant\u2019s claim must fail.\u201d). For all of these reasons, we hold that the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Sergeant Pellegrini\u2019s testimony that Bailey was \u201celiminated as a suspect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">\n<em>State\u2019s Closing Argument</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Appellant\u2019s second argument on appeal is that \u201cthe trial court erred in allowing the State to comment that appellant\u2019s silence at the time he was apprehended showed consciousness of guilt.\u201d Specifically, appellant challenges the following portion of the State\u2019s closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-8\">And when [the police] found [appellant], when they stopped him, he didn\u2019t even want to tell them his name. He didn\u2019t say what is this for, he wasn\u2019t shocked. He knew.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">Defense counsel objected to this argument by stating, \u201cObjection. That\u2019s not proper.\u201d The court responded, \u201cArgu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>ment, counsel. Overruled.\u201d After the jury retired, defense counsel reiterated that he \u201cmade an objection based on the argument which had to do with [what appellant] said or did not say at the time of his arrest.\u201d Counsel added, \u201cThe point of the objection is it\u2019s alluding to my client not making a denial,\u201d which \u201cflies in the face of his Fifth Amendment right ... to remain silent.\u201d Counsel then moved for a mistrial. The court pointed out that appellant \u201cmight not have been under arrest, he may not have been in custody, may not have been Mirandized. There are all those things to take into consideration before you start talking about the Fifth Amendment.\u201d The court further stated, \u201cPlus it\u2019s argument. And it has to be egregious, it has to be that higher level for it to be an objection to be sustained at an argument level....\u201d The defense motion for a mistrial was denied.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">\u201cThe permissible scope of closing argument is a matter left to the sound discretion of the trial court, the exercise of which will not constitute reversible error unless clearly abused.\u201d <em>Sowell v. State, </em>122 Md.App. 222, 228, 712 A.2d 96 (1998), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>353 Md. 713, 728 A.2d 712 (1999) (citing <em>Hunt v.

Moreover, \u201cattorneys are afforded great leeway in presenting closing arguments to the jury.... \u2018The prosecutor is allowed liberal freedom of speech and may make any comment that is warranted by the evidence or inferences reasonably drawn therefrom.\u2019 \u201d <em>Degren v.

Counsel is free to use the testimony most favorable to his side of the argument to the jury, and the evidence may be examined, collated, sifted and treated in his own way. Moreover, if counsel does not make any statement of fact not fairly deducible from the evidence his argument is not improper, although the inferences discussed are illogical and erroneous. Generally, counsel has the right to make any comment or argument that is warranted by the evidence proved or inferences therefrom;....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-4\">While arguments of counsel are required to be confined to the issues in the cases on trial, the evidence and fair and reasonable deductions therefrom, and to arguments of opposing counsel, generally speaking, liberal freedom of speech should be allowed. There are no hard-and-fast limitations within which the argument of earnest counsel must be confined \u2014 no well-defined bounds beyond which the eloquence of an advocate shall not soar. He may discuss the facts proved or admitted in the pleadings, assess the conduct of the parties, and attack the credibility of witnesses. He may indulge in oratorical conceit or flourish and in illustrations and metaphorical allusions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-5\"><em>Wilhelm v. State, </em>272 Md. 404, 412, 326 A.2d 707 (1974) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Thus, it is well settled in Maryland that, during closing argument, the prosecutor may draw reasonable inferences from the evidence before the court and/or the jury. In this case, testimony about appellant\u2019s silence was repeatedly elicited by <em>both </em>the State and the defense and admitted into evidence without objection. In particular, the State and defense counsel questioned Sergeant Dennis Reinhard, one of the police officers effecting appellant\u2019s arrest, about appellant\u2019s apprehension and subsequent silence. On direct exami<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>nation, the following colloquy ensued between the State and Sergeant Reinhard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-4\">[ASSISTANT STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: What happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-5\">[SGT. REINHARD]: What I can testify to was that a few minutes after saying that every one was in place, the defendant, Mr. Steven Daniel, seated right there, came running out the back door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-6\">Q: And when you say came running out the back door, what do you mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-7\">A: Like a locomotive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-8\">Q: What happened when you saw him running out the back door?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-9\">A: I had taken a position. The house in question, 4556 Pimlico Road, is the second from the end going north before there is a break. There is like a break for vehicles, like an alleyway. So I had actually taken up a position behind cover of a 4 foot stone wall and I was actually one door up adjacent to the house in question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-10\">So, Mr. Daniel I observed, running straight out the back door. He continued making a left or right immediately,\u2014 had to run the entire length of the yard because of the fence on both sides and the wall, and made a left turn into the alley and proceeded south maybe 20, 30 yards. I immediately gave chase yelling for him to stop, police. I was in full uniform at the time and he did stop.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">Sergeant Reinhard testified that \u201c[ijnstantly, as soon as the chase started!,][a]s soon as I saw him, I started yelling police.\u201d Appellant then emerged from the house and \u201clooked [Sergeant Reinhard] square in the eye and continued straight down the alley.\u201d By the time the chase was over, \u201cMr. Daniel was winded and breathing hard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-12\">Sergeant Reinhard further testified on direct examination as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-13\">[ASSISTANT STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: And then after he was stopped, then what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"axr-dedup-0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>[SGT. REINHARD]: As soon as the chase started, I immediately called for help, and the other officers came to the back. Mr. Daniel did stop. He never did say a word to me. I asked him if his name was Steven Daniel and he wouldn\u2019t say a word. We handcuffed the individual and escorted him to the front of the address. Awaiting the cruising patrol.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-5\">Q: When you say he never said a word, you\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-6\">A: He never uttered one word.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">Q: Officer, can you tell me how many times did you ask him what his name was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection, leading.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-9\">[ASSISTANT STATE\u2019S ATTORNEY]: I said how many times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-10\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-11\">[SGT. REINHARD]: Personally, maybe two or three times, that was it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-12\">While cross-examining Sergeant Reinhard, the defense elicited similar testimony regarding appellant\u2019s silence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-13\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: He never gave you any kind of phony name or false name or anything like that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-14\">[SGT. REINHARD]: Like I said earlier, he never spoke to me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-15\">Q: Never spoke to you at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-16\">A: No, Sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-17\">With no defense objection, the defendant\u2019s silence was clearly in evidence in this case. Accordingly, in this appeal, appellant challenges the propriety of the prosecutor\u2019s comments about the testimony, rather than the admissibility of the testimony itself. We note in passing that, even if the defense had objected to testimony about appellant\u2019s silence, it is not clear that the testimony was improper. Although it is impermissible in Maryland to comment on a defendant\u2019s post-arrest silence, the same is not true for pre-arrest silence. <em>See, e.g., Williams v. State, </em>99 Md.App. 711, 716, 639 A.2d 180 (1994), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number><em>aff'd, </em>344 Md. 358, 686 A.2d 1096 (1996); <em>Wills v. State, </em>82 Md.App. 669, 678, 573 A.2d 80 (1990). As the trial court recognized, the record is unclear as to whether appellant was under arrest when Sergeant Reinhard asked him his name. Therefore, it is unclear whether appellant\u2019s silence was prearrest, and thus properly admitted, or post-arrest, and should have been excluded had there been an objection. Regardless, because appellant did not object to testimony about his silence (and indeed elicited such testimony himself), the distinction is moot in this appeal. Testimony about appellant\u2019s silence was in evidence; as the State is permitted to argue reasonable inferences from the evidence, the State\u2019s comments during closing argument in this case were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">\n<em>Harm</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Finally, we note that, even if the court erred in permitting the State to argue during closing that appellant\u2019s silence amounted to consciousness of guilt, any such error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 350 A.2d 665 (1976). In this case, the court instructed the jury that \u201c[a] person\u2019s flight immediately after the commission of a crime ... may be considered by you as evidence of guilt.... If you decide there is evidence of flight, you then must decide whether this evidence shows a consciousness of guilt.\u201d <em>See Whittlesey v. State, </em>340 Md. 30, 64, 665 A.2d 223 (1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 1148, 116 S.Ct. 1021, 134 L.Ed.2d 100 (1996) (\u201cIt is well settled that evidence of flight is admissible to show awareness of guilt.\u201d) (citing <em>State v. Edison, </em>318 Md. 541, 548, 569 A.2d 657 (1990), <em>Hunt v. State, </em>312 Md. 494, 508, 540 A.2d 1125 (1988)); <em>Huffington v. State, </em>295 Md. 1, 16, 452 A.2d 1211 (1982) (\u201cIn Maryland, flight from justice has always been deemed indicative of consciousness of guilt.\u201d) (citing <em>Jones v. State, </em>242 Md. 323, 327, 219 A.2d 77 (1966); <em>Davis v. State, </em>237 Md. 97, 105, 205 A.2d 254 (1964) , cert. <em>denied, </em>382 U.S. 945, 86 S.Ct. 402, 15 L.Ed.2d 354 (1965) ; <em>Clay v. State, </em>211 Md. 577, 584-85, 128 A.2d 634 (1957)).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>The silence at issue in this case occurred immediately after appellant fled from police. If a juror were inclined to draw an inference of guilt from appellant\u2019s flight, that juror would not likely draw an inference consistent with innocence as to appellant\u2019s silence immediately thereafter, even in the absence of the prosecutor\u2019s comments. We hold that, in light of the court\u2019s flight instruction, the prosecutor\u2019s comments, even if erroneously permitted, were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b613-9\">.
