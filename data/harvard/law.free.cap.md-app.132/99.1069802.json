On September 30, 1994, appellee gave birth to a child following artificial insemination. The parties separated in 1997. This case involves appellant\u2019s right to visitation with the minor child. The circuit court, faced with a difficult question, denied visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">Appellant filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County against appellee, seeking custody of the minor child, or in the alternative, visitation. Appellant, in the portion of her brief setting forth the facts, largely tracks the circuit court\u2019s opinion. We shall do the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">Appellant and appellee began dating each other in 1990 and commenced living together in 1991. Appellant, in 1990, decided she wanted to have a child, but all efforts, including six in vitro fertilizations, failed. Appellee supported appellant in her efforts. Because appellant\u2019s efforts failed, and because the couple wanted to have a child to rear together, appellee decided to become pregnant. Appellant opened a sperm bank account and obtained sperm from an anonymous donor. Appellant, a licensed medical doctor, personally inseminated ap-pellee on several occasions, and ultimately, appellee became pregnant. On September 30, 1994, appellee gave birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">After the birth, the parties jointly participated in rearing the child, including the selection of pediatricians and preschool. Appellant, a psychiatrist, and appellee, an epidemiolo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>gist, arranged their schedules to work out of the home so that one or the other was almost always available to care for the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Appellee was the primary care giver, but for the first three years appellant participated in feeding, playing with, bathing, and holding the child. Appellant developed a bedtime ritual, whereby she would read for one-half hour to forty-five minutes to the child, following which appellee would say good night.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The parties experienced problems in their relationship as early as 1992 or 1993, and they went to therapy on at least two occasions. In September 1997, appellee moved out of the family home and took the child with her. The parties agreed on a liberal visitation schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Beginning in December 1997, according to appellee, the child exhibited changes in behavior. The child had difficulty getting to sleep at night, began clinging to appellee, and was frequently whiny. The child also displayed \u201coppositional\u201d behavior to appellee, and in the Spring of 1998, the child\u2019s teachers reported to appellee that the child was exhibiting \u201ctantrums or meltdowns.\u201d During this time frame, appellee discontinued appellant\u2019s ritual of bedtime reading. Appellee discussed the child\u2019s behavior with appellee\u2019s neighbor and friend, K.H.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, but did not take any other action. Appellant indicated that she did not observe any such symptoms when the child was with her, but acknowledged that appellee told appellant that the child was having trouble sleeping.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">On May 27, 1998, the parties argued over a bicycle, and appellee refused thereafter to let appellant visit with the child. According to appellee, the child\u2019s whiny and clingy behavior stopped within two weeks, and the bedtime problems resolved themselves in three months. After school began in September, there was no abnormal behavior reported by the child\u2019s teachers.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>In December 1998, the circuit court, after a pendente lite hearing, ordered a resumption of visitation between appellant and the child so that their relationship could be evaluated by a court-appointed psychologist, Dr. Benjamin Sch\u00fctz. Within a few weeks of resumption of the visitation, most of the behavior problems returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The case was tried in March of 1999, and following the trial, the circuit court took the matter under advisement. On or about May 7, 1999, appellee terminated all visitation between appellant and the child, claiming that the child\u2019s behavior had worsened. The circuit court ordered a follow-up evaluation by Dr. Sch\u00fctz, and additional testimony was taken on June 8 and July 2, 1999. According to Dr. Sch\u00fctz, the child\u2019s teachers reported that the meltdowns or tantrums had stopped in April or May 1999, and the child had no problems interacting with the child\u2019s peers. There was testimony by appellee; by K.H.; and by Dr. Sch\u00fctz, based on information supplied to him by Dr. Joan Evelyn Kinlan, the child\u2019s psychiatrist, however, that the child had developed a \u201crigid fantasy role-playing wherein [the child] would assume the role of another person or animal and assign roles to people around [the child] and interact only within those roles.\u201d Appellant testified that she did not observe this behavior. According to appellee, when visitation with appellant terminated in May 1999, the fantasy play ceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The circuit court, in its opinion on August 10, 1999, made the following findings and conclusions. First, the court stated that appellant neither presented evidence nor argued that she was entitled to custody of the child. The court stated that the only issue was one of visitation and that the case was to be decided under Maryland law regarding third party visitation rights. Consequently, the court concluded that the standard for determining whether to grant visitation to appellant, a third party, was the best interest of the child. <em>See Evans v. Evans, </em>302 Md. 334, 488 A.2d 157 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Second, with respect to the relationship between appellant and the child, the circuit court found that appellant served <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>\u201cthe functional role of a parent in relation to [the child] for the first three years eight months of [the child\u2019s] life.\u201d The parties lived together as a couple and jointly decided to have a family. Appellant was an integral part of the prenatal care of appellee, and after the child was born, appellant played a significant role in the child\u2019s care, demonstrating above-average parenting skills.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Third, the court found that the relationship between appellant and the child, in the past, had been beneficial to the child. Dr. Sch\u00fctz found nothing inappropriate, detrimental, or negative in appellant\u2019s conduct with the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">Fourth, the circuit court found that appellant was a fit and proper person to have visitation with the child. There was no evidence of any abuse, neglect, or adverse conduct by appellant toward the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Fifth, and determinative of the outcome, the circuit court found that it was not in the best interest of the child to continue a relationship with appellant. The court acknowledged that this was a difficult question, and regardless of the decision, there would be significant adverse consequences to the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">The court concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-9\">If visitation is terminated completely, [the child] will lose a significant positive relationship with someone who has served as a parent for most of [the child\u2019s] life.<footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-10\">This may have a long-term negative effect on [the child] because, according to Dr. Sch\u00fctz, [the child] may have acquired a negative learned response from a beneficial relationship being easily excised and, according to Dr. Pee-bles [the child\u2019s pediatrician], the security of [the child\u2019s] relationship with the defendant may be jeopardized.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b127-11\">On the other hand, the evidence in this case is uncontro-verted that when there is visitation between the plaintiff and [the child] significant behavioral problems emerge in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>[the child], and when the visitation is terminated completely, all of these problems disappear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-5\">It is also uncontroverted that when visitation was terminated with the plaintiff, [the child] expressed no sense of loss, exhibited no signs of depression and did not ask to see the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-6\">When the visitation occurred between December 1997 and May 1998, [the child] had difficulty going to sleep, was clingy, whiny, oppositional, tantrums and checking behavior at school and problems playing with peers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-7\">When the visitation was resumed in December 1998 to March of 1999, the same symptoms reappeared, except for the checking behavior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-8\">In addition, the re-emergence of the symptoms in December of 1998 was unrelated to the frequency or duration of visitation because the later visitation schedule was significantly different than the visitation schedule for the earlier time period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-9\">Dr. Sch\u00fctz did opine that the aforementioned behavior problems of [the child] were stress-related and could be ameliorated by a proper visitation schedule, counseling of the parties to support both relationships and better communication between the plaintiff and the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-10\">However, of greater importance is [the child\u2019s] most recent behavior. In April and May of 1999, [the child\u2019s] temper tantrums and oppositional behavior and peer problems at school disappeared.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-11\">[The child] became [the child\u2019s] old self. At home, though, [the child] began exhibiting a rigid fantasy role play when dealing with [the child\u2019s] mother and [the child\u2019s] neighbor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-12\">In other words, [the child\u2019s] behavioral problems mutated into what Dr. Sch\u00fctz described as a rigid systematic refusal by [the child] to engage [the child\u2019s] mother except through a rigid fantasy role play.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Dr. Sch\u00fctz had never seen a child do this in his career and had never seen the level of intensity so severe as in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-5\">[The child\u2019s] behavior was now clearly dysfunctional. Dr. Sch\u00fctz was also at a loss to explain the cause of [the child\u2019s] behavior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">He could not link the conduct of either plaintiff or defendant to [the child\u2019s] symptomology. Dr. Sch\u00fctz concluded that unless things change, [the child] simply cannot sustain relationships with both plaintiff and defendant at this time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-7\">He was not very hopeful about any change in the current contacts because of two past failed therapies between the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-8\">Finally, when the defendant again terminated the plaintiffs visitation with [the child] in May of 1999, the rigid fantasy role play disappeared.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-9\">Therefore, the Court finds that a resumption of the visitation between the plaintiff and [the child] will have a severe and detrimental effect on [the child] that outweighs the benefits of continuing such relationship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-10\">I must emphasize that nothing the plaintiff has said, done or not done has caused this detrimental effect. Indeed, I can find no fault with the manner in which the plaintiff has conducted herself in her relationship with [the child].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-11\">The plaintiff has acted always as a loving and caring parent toward [the child]. Unfortunately, Dr. Sch\u00fctz was unable to determine the cause of [the child\u2019s] behavior and its change from stress-related to dysfunctional.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-12\">Without the cause identified, the cure cannot be prescribed. Thus, a resumption of visitation will, in all likelihood, result in a return of [the child\u2019s] dysfunctional behavior.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-13\">Accordingly, the Court concludes that it is not in the best interest of [the child] for the Court to order any visitation with the plaintiff, [S.F.].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>The plaintiffs complaint for custody and visitation will be denied. The defendant\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees will be denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-5\">The plaintiffs request for sanctions for contempt will be denied. I have two postscripts. The first, my comments are going to be directed to the defendant, [M.D.].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-6\">Even though, [Ms. D.] or [Dr. D.], you have prevailed in this case, I urge you not to schedule any celebration party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-7\">You have exhibited in my view a trial [sic] that [can] only be described as a pathological hatred for the plaintiff, pathological because it is extreme. In my view, it is not based on reality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-8\">It has also caused you to attempt in your testimony to rewrite the history of your relationship with the plaintiff and the plaintiffs relationship with [the child].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-9\">More seriously, Dr. Sch\u00fctz was unable to identify the cause of [the child\u2019s] behavioral problems, but I strongly suspect, although I cannot find from the evidence that it was your hatred of the plaintiff that leaked out to [the child] and caused [the child] to react in the way [the child] has to the visitation with the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-10\">I hope I am wrong, but if I am right, it is you who has destroyed a positive relationship with the plaintiff and [the child] and caused psychological trauma to [the child].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-11\">I urge you to enter counseling to explore this possibility so there is not a repeat of what has happened here regarding a future relationship for [the child].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-12\">It is for [the child\u2019s] sake that I make these comments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-13\">Question Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b130-14\">Appellant raises one question on appeal, which as rephrased by us, asks whether the circuit court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous and whether it abused its discretion in failing to grant visitation rights to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\"> We are fully aware that the Supreme Court of the United States and the Maryland Court of Appeals have recognized that a natural parent has a fundamental right regarding the care and custody of his or her child. <em>See Wisconsin v. Yoder, </em>406 U.S. 205, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972); <em>Boswell v. Boswell, </em>352 Md. 204, 217, 721 A.2d 662 (1998). Nevertheless, the best interest of the child may take precedence over a parent\u2019s liberty interests in a custody, visitation, or adoption dispute. <em>Id. </em>at 219, 721 A.2d 662. Moreover, this court has held that \u201cwe are uncertain as to the character of the parental right at stake when the issue involves visitation rights rather than custody or the termination of parental rights.\u201d <em>Wolinski v. Browneller, </em>115 Md.App. 285, 302, 693 A.2d 30 (1997).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In any event, a natural parent does not have a constitutional right to deny all visitation, if visitation would be in the best interest of the child. Finally, from our reading of the case law, it is clear that a third party has no fundamental constitutional right to visitation. The issue before us is thus largely governed by family law, not constitutional law.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">In child custody and visitation cases, Maryland appellate courts have identified several factors to be considered by trial courts as appropriate under the circumstances, but the overriding determination is always the best interest of the child. <em>See Boswell, </em>352 Md. at 219, 721 A.2d 662; <em>Wolinski, </em>115 Md.App. at 301, 693 A.2d 30. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>that is the governing standard, and as explained below, presumptions and more specific statements of required showings which might be applicable in other cases are not applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">As appellant is neither a biological nor adoptive parent, the natural starting point for our discussion is <em>Evans, supra, </em>the seminal Maryland case involving third party visitation. In <em>Evans, </em>a stepmother sought visitation with her ex-husband\u2019s son from an earlier marriage. 302 Md. at 335, 488 A.2d 157. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>The Court of Appeals, in answering the question of whether a stepparent has a right to seek visitation, examined whether the grandparents visitation statute, Md.Code (1980 Repl. Vol), \u00a7 3-602(a)(4) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, precluded the possibility of visitation by other third parties. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals held that there was no statutory limitation on the jurisdiction of courts with respect to whom custody or visitation could be awarded. <em>Id. </em>at 343, 488 A.2d 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">The substance of \u00a7 3-602 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, construed in <em>Evans, </em>presently appears in Md.Code (1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 9-102 and 1-201 of the Family Law Article. Section 1-201, dealing with the jurisdiction of equity courts, does not expressly limit to whom a court may award custody or visitation, the same as its predecessor. Additionally, since the <em>Evans </em>decision, by Acts of 1991, \u00a7 2, ch. 247, amending \u00a7 9-102 in a manner not here pertinent, the legislature stated that the grandparents visitation statute should not be construed to deny or limit visitation of other individuals. As a result, in Maryland, petitioners, when seeking custody or visitation, do not have the standing problem that frequently exists in other states. <em>See, e.g., In re Guardianship of Z.C.W., </em>71 Cal.App.4th 524, 84 Cal.Rptr.2d 48, <em>cert. denied by Crandall v. Wagner, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 120 S.Ct. 603, 145 L.Ed.2d 501 (1999)(a non-biological, non-adoptive parent in a same sex relationship lacked standing to seek custody or visitation). <em>Accord In Re Thompson, </em>11 S.W.3rd 913 (Tenn.Ct.App.1999); <em>Titchenal v. Dexter, </em>166 Vt. 373, 693 A.2d 682 (1997). Consequently, appellant in this case had standing to seek visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">As mentioned previously, in custody and visitation matters, the best interest of the child is always determinative. In a custody dispute, however, when the dispute is between a biological parent and a third party, there is a presumption that the child\u2019s best interest is served by awarding custody to the biological parent. <em>See Newkirk v. Newkirk, </em>73 Md.App. 588, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>593, 535 A.2d 947 (1988).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This presumption can be overcome by a showing of the parent\u2019s unfitness or by exceptional circumstance. <em>See Ross v. Hoffman, </em>280 Md. 172, 178-79, 372 A.2d 582 (1977); <em>Tedesco v. Tedesco, </em>111 Md.App. 648, 656, 683 A.2d 1133 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The question then arises as to whether a third party faces the same presumption when seeking visitation rights. The Court of Appeals has held that grandparents do not need to make a showing of exceptional circumstances when seeking visitation, effectively ruling that the presumption does not apply in that situation. <em>See Fairbanks v. McCarter, </em>330 Md. 39, 622 A.2d 121 (1993). We are not aware of any Maryland case that has applied the exceptional circumstances test in a visitation context, and while it may not be free from doubt with respect to third parties other than grandparents, we hold that the presumption does not apply when a de facto parent seeks visitation. In determining whether one is a de facto parent, we employ the test enunciated in <em>In re Custody of H.S.H.-K, </em>193 Wis.2d 649, 533 N.W.2d 419 (1995), and <em>V.C. v. M.J.B., </em>163 N.J. 200, 748 A.2d 539 (2000). Under that test, \u201cthe legal parent must consent to and foster the relationship between the third party and the child; the third party must have lived with the child; the third party must perform parental functions for the child to a significant degree; and most important, a parent-child bond must be forged.\u201d <em>V.C., </em>163 N.J. at 223, 748 A.2d 539. The presumption may be applicable if the issue is the schedule of visitation, <em>see Wolinski, </em>115 Md.App. at 317-19, 693 A.2d 30, but the issue before us is the right to visitation. Consequently, even though appellant, as a non-biological, non-adoptive parent, is in the position of a third party under the Maryland custody and visitation cases, because only the right to visitation is at issue, and she is a de facto parent, she is not required to show <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>unfitness of the biological parent or exceptional circumstances. In other words, there is no presumption that she is not entitled to visitation. On the other hand, as a third party, appellant is not entitled to the presumption that liberal unrestricted visitation with a noncustodial biological or adoptive parent is in the best interest of the child. <em>See Boswell, </em>352 Md. at 221, 721 A.2d 662. From appellee\u2019s perspective, at most, as a biological parent, she would be entitled to a presumption with respect to custody and perhaps as to a schedule of visitation, but custody and scheduling are not the issues before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The case before us is most akin to a stepparent seeking visitation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Monroe v. Monroe, </em>329 Md. 758, 621 A.2d 898 (1993), the biological mother sought custody vis-a-vis her estranged husband, who was the non-biological father of the child, but who acknowledged paternity and treated the child as his own. In that case, the trial court had ruled that exceptional circumstances did not exist as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>at 774, 621 A.2d 898. The Court of Appeals held that the evidence was sufficient to support a determination by the master that exceptional circumstances existed and remanded the case to the trial court to make a factual determination. <em>Id. </em>at 777, 621 A.2d 898. The salient point for the case <em>sub judice </em>is that the Court of Appeals treated the father as a third party for purposes of the custody proceeding. <em>Id. </em>at 773-74, 621 A.2d 898. <em>Accord Tedesco, </em>111 Md.App. at 659, 683 A.2d 1133.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">In <em>Sider v. Sider </em>334 Md. 512, 639 A.2d 1076 (1994), a child was born as a result of an affair between the father and the mother, the latter married to another man. The mother\u2019s husband sought custody of the child, while the mother and the biological father advocated awarding custody of the child to the mother. <em>Id. </em>at 530, 639 A.2d 1076. The mother\u2019s husband was treated as a third party. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>stated that custody disputes between third parties and parents were governed by the <em>Ross v. Hoffman, supra, </em>exceptional circumstances test. <em>Id. </em>at 532, 639 A.2d 1076. The Court of Appeals, in <em>Ross, </em>a case involving parties not related to the child by blood or marriage, identified a non-exhaustive list of factors to be considered in a third party-parent custody dispute that was repeated and expanded in <em>Sider </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-5\">(1) the length of time the child has been away from the biological parent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-6\">(2) The age of the child when care was assumed by the third party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">(3) The possible emotional effect on the child of a change of custody;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-8\">(4) The period of time which elapsed before the parent sought to reclaim the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-9\">(5) The nature and strength of the ties between the child and the third party custodian;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-10\">(6) The intensity and genuineness of the parent\u2019s desire to have the child; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-11\">(7) The stability and certainty as to the child\u2019s future in the custody of the parent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-12\"><em>Sider, </em>334 Md. at 532, 639 A.2d 1076 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-13\">In <em>Fairbanks, supra, </em>the Court of Appeals set forth the following factors and circumstances that should be considered in assessing the best interest of the child in a case in which grandparents sought visitation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-14\">[T]he nature and stability of the child\u2019s relationships with its parents; the nature and substantiality of the relationship between the child and the grandparent, taking into account frequency of contact, regularity of contact, and amount of time spent together; the potential benefits and detriments to the child in granting the visitation order; the effect, if any, grandparental visitation would have on the child\u2019s attachment to its nuclear family, the physical and emotional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>health of the adults involved; and the stability of the child\u2019s living and schooling arrangements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">330 Md. at 50, 622 A.2d 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">We have discovered no Maryland cases involving the fact pattern presented in the case <em>sub judice, </em>i.e., a de facto parent with a significant relationship with the child, seeking visitation. We conclude, however, based largely on stepparent cases, that a de facto parent, such as appellant, is a third party. In our view, however, most of the factors set forth in <em>Ross, Sider, </em>and <em>Fairbanks, </em>stepparent and grandparent cases, have little relevance to the situation before us because in stepparent cases, the factors relate to custody and in grandparent cases the factors assume a relationship that was functionally non-parental. Appellant is a fit de facto parent and seeks visitation. It is the best interest of the child, determined by the effect of visitation on the child, that is relevant and determinative in this case. That was the circuit court\u2019s approach, and it was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">We are limited in our appellate review of visitation and custody orders. If we \u201ceonclude[ ] that the factual findings of the trial court are not clearly erroneous and that sound principles of law were applied, the trial court\u2019s decision will not be disturbed unless there has been a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Boswell, </em>352 Md. at 225, 721 A.2d 662. \u201cIn almost every case, the chancellor\u2019s decision regarding custody and visitation is given great deference \u2018unless it is arbitrary or clearly wrong.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Hanke v. Hanke, </em>94 Md.App. 65, 71, 615 A.2d 1205 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>appellant argues that the circuit court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous because they were \u201cagainst the logic and effect of facts and inferences before the court.\u201d Appellant elaborates by stating that the court found four key facts and that it based its ultimate decision on those facts. The key findings, according to appellant, were (1) that the child\u2019s behavior had become clearly dysfunctional, (2) that Dr. Sch\u00fctz could not link the conduct of either party to the child\u2019s symptomatology, (3) Dr. Sch\u00fctz was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>not hopeful about any change in the current situation, and (4) a resumption of visitation between appellant and the child would have a severe and detrimental effect on the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">We acknowledge the difficulty of the decision before, the circuit court. It seems that custody and visitation cases are rarely, if ever, easy. That is especially true when neither party seeking custody or visitation is fit or, as in the case before us, when both parties seeking custody or visitation are fit. Based on our review of the record, we cannot find that the circuit court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous, or that it abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Three persons testified at the March trial as expert witnesses. Appellant, on her own behalf, testified as an expert; Dr. Paul Peebles, the child\u2019s pediatrician up until March of 1998, testified for appellant; and Dr. Sch\u00fctz, the court-appointed psychiatrist. Appellant\u2019s testimony supported her position. Dr. Peebles testified, based on his review of Dr. Schutz\u2019s report, that it was in the best interest of the child to continue a relationship with appellant. He recognized the gravity of the situation but, in essence, believed that the two adult parties should seek counseling to enable the child to have a relationship with both. Dr. Sch\u00fctz, at the time of trial in March, appeared to be of the view that it was in the child\u2019s best interest to maintain a relationship with appellant, or at least to make a further effort in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">At the time of Dr. Schutz\u2019s testimony on June 8 and July 2, 1999, he had obtained additional information. Specifically, he testified that he had interviewed the child\u2019s psychiatrist, Dr. Kinlan, the child\u2019s schoolteachers, appellant, appellee, K.H., and the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">Dr. Sch\u00fctz concluded that, when the child attempted to forge a relationship with both appellant and appellee at the same time, the relationship with appellee deteriorated. He stated that he did not know why but offered two hypotheses, (1) that the child was angry with the child\u2019s mother for sending the child from where the child wanted to be to a place where the child did not want to go, and (2) that appellee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>conveyed an emotional message to the child that the child should not have a good time with appellant or want to be with appellant and that the child was angry over [the child\u2019s] inability to enjoy time with appellant; and this forced the child into a choice between appellant and appellee. In response to assertions by appellee and Dr. Kinlan that appellant had asked the child to call her \u201cMother,\u201d Dr. Sch\u00fctz also opined that labeling the roles of two persons in a parental relationship and the risk of confounding the roles when they are both contenders for the same role and the same identification is greater than in the case of heterosexual couples.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">With respect to the severity of the child\u2019s problems, Dr. Sch\u00fctz observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-5\">... I have never seen a clinical picture of such intensity like this before in any evaluation I have ever done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-6\">Where this particular picture of a child\u2019s developing these kinds of symptoms of this severity with a context like this.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">In response to an inquiry as to whether Dr. Peebles was correct that the child would master the stress if given an adequate chance, Dr. Sch\u00fctz opined that he could not make that prediction and explained again that he had never seen a child with the cluster of behaviors exhibited. The behavior referred to was as reported by appellee, K.H., and Dr. Kinlan, which Dr. Sch\u00fctz described as \u201crigid, in my mind oppositional, systematic refusal to engage a parent in any way other than through the medium of the role playing.\u201d He concluded that that response was precipitated by a very high level of stress, and it was the stress that made the child \u201cso dysfunctional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">With respect to the ultimate issue, balancing what Dr. Sch\u00fctz described as the negative learning experience of ending the relationship with appellant versus the manifestations exhibited by the role playing, the latter described as \u201can unknown phenomenon,\u201d he could not predict the long term manifestations of the symptomatology.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">At another point, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-10\">Q My final question, doctor, is there any question in your mind that the security of the attachment of [the child] to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>[the child\u2019s] mother is more important than any attachment or any relationship that [the child] may have with [appellee], I mean, with [appellant], if we have to choose?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-5\">I know you don\u2019t want to choose, but if we \u2014 if you have to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">A I feel like Solomon being handed a chainsaw. If there were\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">Q I didn\u2019t think it was quite that loaded a question. I am not asking you to make the decision. It seems obvious to me, and obvious to everything you have said that the attachment to [the child\u2019s] mother, which is under stress, is the more important.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-8\">A It is a significant factor related to long term adjustment for kids.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-9\">Q I think you significantly sidestepped my question, but I will terminate at that point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">In summary, in March Dr. Sch\u00fctz opined that, based on the functionally parental relationship between appellant and the child, the relationship should continue (1) subject to family therapy, (2) visitation of length consistent with the best interest of the child based on observation by a clinician, and (3) establishing communication between appellant and appellee. At the time of the conclusion of testimony in June and July, however, Dr. Sch\u00fctz opined that the situation was much more problematic and severe because of the subsequent symptoma-tology. He also opined that, even with therapeutic intervention, a relationship between appellant and the child would be problematic because the situation had become \u201cvery extreme.\u201d Dr. Sch\u00fctz was also clear that, for whatever reason, the symptomatology was associated with visitation with appellant. The bottom line, according to Dr. Sch\u00fctz, was that the child could not negotiate both relationships at the same time, and the parties had not been successful in enabling the child to do that.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">We end with the observation with which we began, which is that the circuit court had a difficult decision to make. The court applied the applicable law, and the findings of fact were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>not clearly erroneous. Appellant, at oral argument, asserted that an affirmance will reward appellee\u2019s manipulation of the child. If there were a finding of fact in that regard, we might well agree. The circuit court, while expressing suspicion, expressly stated that it could not find as a fact that appellee caused the situation that existed. There is no basis upon which to hold that finding clearly erroneous. Legal disputes in general, and custody and visitation disputes in particular, are fact dependent and must be resolved on a case by case basis. With respect to the circuit court\u2019s disposition, the question is not what we or another court might have done; it is whether the circuit court abused its discretion. We hold that it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-9\">. \u201cK.H.\u201d has been substituted for the neighbor\u2019s given name.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[2]\">\n<p id=\"b127-12\">2. \"The child\u201d has been substituted for the child's given name.
