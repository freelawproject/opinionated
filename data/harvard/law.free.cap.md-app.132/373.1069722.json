The Department charged appellant with eleven violations of the Department\u2019s regulations and of the Prince George\u2019s County Personnel Law. Appellant requested that an Administrative Hearing Board (\u201cthe Board\u201d) review these charges. The Board convened on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>June 26, 29, 30, and July 17, 1998, and found appellant guilty of eight of the charges and not guilty of three. The Board recommended penalties for each of the eight violations; for four of the violations, the recommended penalty was dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Appellant was dismissed by the Department on August 7, 1998. He appealed the Board\u2019s findings to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. Oral argument on the case was heard on May 14, 1999, and the court subsequently affirmed the Board\u2019s findings. Appellant appeals from that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Except for periods from 1980 to 1983, and 1987 to 1990, appellant was employed by the Department from January 1978 to August 7, 1998. Immediately before his dismissal from the Department, he worked at the Prince George\u2019s County Correctional Center (\u201cthe facility\u201d). Appellant\u2019s alleged violations of the Department\u2019s regulations and of the County\u2019s personnel law were:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-8\"><em>Charges 1-3: </em>delivering contraband to inmates Nicole Lancaster, Yassmin Lindo, and Debra Anderson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-9\"><em>Charge </em>J: granting or promising to inmate Nicole Lancaster special privileges or favors not available to all inmates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-10\"><em>Charges 5-7: </em>improper fraternization with inmates Lancaster, Lindo, and Anderson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-11\"><em>Charge 8: </em>committing an act or series of acts which have had or may be reasonably demonstrated to have an appreciable effect on the general public\u2019s confidence and/or trust in the Department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-12\"><em>Charge 9: </em>failure to obey an order of a superior officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-13\"><em>Charges 10-11: </em>making false statements to investigators.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-14\">The Board found appellant not guilty of Charges 2, 10, and 11, but guilty of the other eight violations. Its recommended penalties for those eight violations were: for Charge 1, suspension for ten working days; for Charge 3, suspension for ten working days; for Charge 4, a fine of $150; for Charge 5, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>a f\u00edne of $150; for Charge 6, dismissal; for Charge 7, dismissal; for Charge 8, dismissal; and for Charge 9, dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The Department\u2019s Policy and Procedure Manual, pursuant to the County\u2019s personnel law, provides that the Director of the Department has the authority to make the final determination on all disciplinary actions. The Director issued a Disciplinary Action Memorandum on August 7, 1998. The Director concurred with the Board\u2019s factual findings and acted in accordance with the Board\u2019s recommended penalties, dismissing appellant effective immediately. Because of appellant\u2019s dismissal, the Director set aside the recommended suspensions and fines.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">Issues Presented</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Appellant presents three issues for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\">1. Whether the circuit court erred in affirming the findings of the administrative hearing board as to contraband, fraternization, and an act affecting the public \u2022 trust despite the absence of substantial evidence to support those findings?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-9\">2. Whether the circuit court erred in affirming the decision of the administrative hearing board that George Stover failed to obey a lawful order even though the order violated George Stover\u2019s constitutional rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-10\">3. Whether the circuit court erred in affirming the administrative hearing board\u2019s excessive, arbitrary, disparate and capricious penalties?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">We find no error and shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-12\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b402-13\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-14\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b402-15\">When reviewing a decision of an administrative agency, this Court\u2019s role is \u201cprecisely the same as that of the circuit court.\u201d <em>Department of Health and Mental Hygiene v. Shrieves, </em>100 Md.App. 283, 303-304, 641 A.2d 899 (1994) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>(citation omitted). \u201cJudicial review of administrative agency action is narrow. The court\u2019s task on review is <em>not </em>to \u2018substitute its judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the administrative agency.\u2019 \u201d <em>United Parcel Service, Inc. v. People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County, </em>336 Md. 569, 576-577, 650 A.2d 226 (1994) (quoting <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apts., </em>283 Md. 505, 513, 390 A.2d 1119 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">Rather, \u201c[t]o the extent the issues on appeal turn on the correctness of an agency\u2019s findings of fact, such findings must be reviewed under the substantial evidence test.\u201d <em>Department of Health and Mental Hygiene v. Riverview Nursing Centre, Inc., </em>104 Md.App. 593, 602, 657 A.2d 372, <em>cert. denied, </em>340 Md. 215, 665 A.2d 1058 (1995) (citation omitted). The reviewing court\u2019s task is to determine \u201cwhether there was substantial evidence before the administrative agency on the record as a whole to support its conclusions.\u201d <em>Maryland Commission on Human Relations v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>86 Md.App. 167, 173, 586 A.2d 37, <em>cert. denied, </em>323 Md. 309, 593 A.2d 668 (1991). The court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the agency, but instead must exercise a \u201crestrained and disciplined judicial judgment so as not to interfere with the agency\u2019s factual conclusions.\u201d <em>State Administration Board of Election Laws v. Billhimer, </em>314 Md. 46, 58-59, 548 A.2d 819 (1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1007, 109 S.Ct. 1644, 104 L.Ed.2d 159 (1989) (quoting <em>Supervisor of Assessments of Montgomery County v. Asbury Methodist Home, Inc., </em>313 Md. 614, 625, 547 A.2d 190 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The reviewing court\u2019s analysis has three parts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-6\">1. First, the reviewing court must determine whether the agency recognized and applied the correct principles of law governing the case. The reviewing court is not constrained to affirm the agency where its order \u201cis premised solely upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\">2. Once it is determined that the agency did not err in its determination or interpretation of the applicable law, the reviewing court next examines the agency\u2019s factual findings to determine if they are supported by substantial evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number><em>ie., </em>by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. At this juncture, ... \u201cit is the agency\u2019s province to resolve conflicting evidence, and, where inconsistent inferences can be drawn from the same evidence, it is for the agency to draw the inference.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-5\">3. Finally, the reviewing court must examine how the agency applied the law to the facts. This, of course, is a judgmental process involving a mixed question of law and fact, and great deference must be accorded to the agency. The test of appellate review of this function is \u201cwhether, ... a reasoning mind could reasonably have reached the conclusion reached by the [agency], consistent with a proper application of the [controlling legal principles].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-6\"><em>Comptroller of the Treasury v. World Book Childcraft Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>67 Md.App. 424, 438-439, 508 A.2d 148, <em>cert. denied, </em>307 Md. 260, 513 A.2d 314 (1986) (quoting <em>Ramsay, Scarlett &amp; Co., Inc. v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>302 Md. 825, 834-838, 490 A.2d 1296 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">\n<em>Charges 1 and S</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">The Department\u2019s Policy &amp; Procedure Manual (\u201cthe Manual\u201d) defines \u201ccontraband\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-9\">Any item, material, substance, or other thing of value that is not authorized for inmate possession by the Director or his Designee or is brought into the facility in a manner prohibited by departmental policy and procedure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">Section 3.2(IV)(B)(3) of the Manual provides: \u201cContraband will not be given or made accessible to inmates. Anything not issued to inmates or authorized for them use will be considered contraband.\u201d In this context \u201ccontraband\u201d has no criminal connotation.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">Appellant was found to have violated this provision by handing out certain cards to Nicole Lancaster and Debra Anderson at the facility. Both appellant and appellee describe these cards as \u201cbusiness cards,\u201d but appellant also calls them \u201cministerial cards.\u201d Appellant is a lay minister in his church, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Restoration Temple. The cards, apparently in the size and shape of standard business cards, listed the name of appellant\u2019s church and the phone number that appellant uses for ministerial functions. This number rings at appellant\u2019s home, but it is a different line than that used by appellant and his family for personal calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">At the Board hearing, Nicole Lancaster testified that, while she was an inmate at the facility, appellant gave her \u201ca business card for Minister Stover\u201d with a phone number on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Debra Anderson testified that she was incarcerated at the facility several times during 1997 and 1998. She answered affirmatively when she was asked if appellant gave her \u201ca business card.\u201d She testified that the card had appellant\u2019s name and phone number on it; she did not notice if it referred to him as a minister.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Appellant testified that he has given inmates his business/ministerial cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Based upon the testimony of these witnesses, we hold that the Board had substantial evidence upon which it could find appellant had given inmates \u201ccontraband\u201d as that term is defined in the Department\u2019s Manual.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">\n<em>Charge k</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">Section 3.2(B)(4) of the Manual provides: \u201cPersonnel will not grant or promise to an inmate special privileges or favors not available to all inmates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">At the Board hearing, Ms. Lancaster testified that on the day she was released from the facility, but before her release, appellant allowed her to use an office phone at the facility to call her mother in Utah and a cousin at an undisclosed location \u201cso I could have someone come and sign me out.\u201d Ms. Lancaster testified that appellant used a phone card, apparently his own, to make the call.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">Appellant testified that he allowed Ms. Lancaster to use his phone card so she could arrange for family members to meet her. He testified that at the facility employees of all ranks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>freq\u00faently arrange for phone calls for inmates who are their family members or friends. He testified that there was nothing untoward about the assistance he gave Ms. Lancaster. Indeed, appellee has not alleged any harm that could be attributed to appellant\u2019s actions regarding Ms. Lancaster\u2019s phone calls. Having said that, we hold that there was sufficient evidence presented for the Board to conclude that appellant granted Ms. Lancaster \u201cspecial privileges or favors not available to all inmates.\u201d There was no showing that preferential treatment of inmates by the facility\u2019s employees was pervasive and that it was officially tolerated by the Department. Regardless of whether some other employees may have granted preferential treatment to inmates, the Board did not err by finding appellant violated this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">\n<em>Charge 5-7</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Section 3.2(IV)(C)(3) of the Manual provides: \u201cPersonnel will not establish a personal relationship with an inmate or an inmate\u2019s spouse, relative, or friend, beyond what is required to perform official duties. Personnel will not use their position to become intimately involved with inmates or their visitors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Appellant was found guilty of violating this provision in reference to his interactions with three female inmates: Nicole Lancaster, Yassmin Lindo, and Debra Anderson. At the hearing, Ms. Lancaster testified that after she was released from the facility, she stayed with a cousin in Fort Washington and then moved to appellant\u2019s house, where she and her nine-year-old son had a room in the basement. She testified that \u201cI have never had any romantic feelings or thoughts for Mr. Stover, but he had them for me.\u201d She was aware of appellant\u2019s feelings because he told her he loved her and asked her to marry him. She testified that she was uncomfortable at appellant\u2019s house \u201cbecause of the feelings that he had for [her],\u201d so she left to visit her family in Pennsylvania and to find another place to five. Her departure initially was amicable, according to her, but, when it became apparent that she would not return, her relations with appellant became more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>strained. She testified that, after a fire occurred at appellant\u2019s house while she was visiting her family, appellant put her belongings in storage and had not, at the time of the hearing, returned them to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">Yassmin Lindo testified that she met appellant in 1992 through Restoration Temple. She was incarcerated at the facility in 1997 and 1998, and she testified that appellant arranged with her Probation Officer, John Parrish, for her to be released into his custody. Ms. Lindo testified that appellant, on his own initiative, told Mr. Parrish she was his goddaughter. After leaving the facility she lived at appellant\u2019s house, in her own room, for approximately three weeks. While she was there, appellant gave her gifts: \u201ca bathrobe with matching slippers and perfume set,\u201d as well as \u201ca dress and earrings and shoes.\u201d Ms. Lindo left appellant\u2019s house after three weeks because she felt uncomfortable there. She testified that she did not leave on good terms and that she had not received all of her possessions from appellant\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Debra Anderson testified that she met appellant while she was incarcerated at the facility in 1997. She testified that she placed calls from the facility to appellant\u2019s home. Appellant paid her bond ($110 for a $1,000 bond) and drove her to her parents\u2019 house after her release. Ms. Anderson testified that after that day she saw appellant four or five times. On those occasions, appellant gave her money or flowers. She said he gave her $125 to buy clothes on one occasion, $50 to get her nails done on another occasion, and then $80 or $40 on a third occasion. She stated that they did not see each other socially and had not dated.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Appellant testified that Ms. Lancaster and Ms. Lindo stayed at his house, and that he paid Ms. Anderson\u2019s bond and gave her cash. He denied attempting to have a romantic involvement with any of the women.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Again, we need not decide that the allegations against appellant were true. The Board certainly could have disbelieved the testimony of the witnesses appellee presented, but even appellant\u2019s testimony would support the Board\u2019s position. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>There was sufficient evidence to support the Board\u2019s findings of improper fraternization.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\n<em>Charge 8</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Section 16 \u2014 193(c)(1)(F) of the Prince George\u2019s County Personnel Law provides that, for county employees, an infraction occurs: \u201cWhere an employee commits an act or a series of acts which have had or may be reasonably demonstrated to have, an appreciable effect on the general public\u2019s confidence and/or trust in the operation of the employee\u2019s department, agency, or office and/or the government as a whole.\u201d Both the Board\u2019s Memorandum and the Director\u2019s Disciplinary Action Memorandum cited \u00a7 16 \u2014 193(c)(1 )(F) and stated that appellant was charged with violating the section, without specifying any acts that constituted the violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Appellant argues that appellee has not identified any specific act committed by appellant that violated this provision. At the hearing before the Board, appellant moved to have this charge dismissed for lack of specificity. Counsel for appellee responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">The Disciplinary Action Recommendation contains a narrative that summarizes the facts that are the basis for these charges. Each of the charges beyond Number 8 refer to specific acts. Charge Number 8 refers to those acts, and the charges as addressed to the incidents in matters that are dictated in the narrative of the Recommendation and in the list of all of the individual charges as they are there that is more than sufficient specificity to the Defense to know why they\u2019re here and what we\u2019re here about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-9\">In addition, I would point out that the Defense has received some 43 documents or exhibits that the Department has and will either be using or has as part of the discovery in this case. In short, they received everything the Department has, with the exception of the dictative report from the investigator. So there are no surprises.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">The Board\u2019s Chairman, Captain Alfred McMurray, ruled: \u201c[I]t is my opinion that Number 8 is a general term. General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>term meaning the total effect of all of the charges, and I\u2019m going to overrule your objection to Number 8....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Appellee\u2019s argument on this issue in its brief is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARem\">The Board, upon hearing all the evidence, and using its own particularized knowledge, found that Appellant\u2019s actions would have a negative effect on the public. The testimony of several witnesses indicated that the behavior of Appellant was inappropriate and, in the witnesses\u2019 opinion, a conflict of interest. The Board could take administrative notice of the negative impact of newspaper articles concerning problems at other correctional facilities and determine that fraternization with inmates by officers undermines the trust and integrity the Department desires from the public. No showing that this particular case has generated public mistrust was necessary; the potential for such mistrust is sufficient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The pertinent provision of the county code, quoted above, refers to \u201cacts which <em>have had </em>or <em>may be reasonably demonstrated to have, </em>an appreciable effect.... \u201d (Emphasis added). It seems that appellee has, in effect, conceded that it has not proceeded against appellant under the \u201chave had\u201d portion of the provision, because appellee refers to no evidence demonstrating that appellant\u2019s acts \u201chave had\u201d an effect on the public\u2019s confidence or trust in the department \u201cand/or the government as a whole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">Therefore, we must determine whether the Board was provided with substantial evidence that appellant has committed acts that \u201cmay be reasonably demonstrated to have, an appreciable effect .. .. \u201d on the public\u2019s trust or confidence. The Board heard evidence that appellant gave female inmates a telephone number that rang at his home, that he posted bail for a female inmate, that he arranged to have a female inmate released to his custody, that female inmates came to live at his house after their release from the facility, and that he failed to fully obey an order from a supervisor regarding his interactions with inmates. These actions, even if motivated by good intentions, could reasonably be viewed as a pattern of conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>inappropriate for a correctional officer, especially a male officer dealing with female inmates. Correctional officers inevitably have substantial authority over the lives of the people incarcerated under their control, and actions that may be seen as demonstrating the potential for an abuse of that authority should be of the greatest concern to the public and to the Department. We hold that the Board was presented with sufficient evidence to support its finding that appellant committed acts that could be reasonably demonstrated to have an appreciable effect on the public\u2019s confidence or trust in the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\n<em>Charge 9</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">Section 16 \u2014 108(B)(3) of the Prince George\u2019s County Personnel Law provides that county employees are required \u201c[t]o carry out in an efficient, effective, and timely manner, the lawful order or directive rendered by an employee\u2019s appointing authority or supervisor, and any assignment which is within the scope of the employee\u2019s applicable class standard, except as specifically provided otherwise under the provisions of this Subtitle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">At the Board hearing, Major William Johnson, one of appellant\u2019s supervisors, testified that in 1994 he gave a direct order, both orally and in writing, telling appellant that he was prohibited \u201c[fjrom practicing or providing religious services to inmates while he was on the clock and prohibited from passing out personal cards relating to religion \u2014 to his religious position at that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">The Board also heard testimony, as noted above, from two female inmates who stated that appellant gave them business cards after the date of Major Johnson\u2019s order. Appellant also testified that although he stopped leading bible study classes during his lunch break in response to Major Johnson\u2019s order, he continued to pass out his ministerial cards when inmates asked him a question relating to his identity as a minister. The Board therefore heard evidence sufficient to allow it to find that appellant violated Major Johnson\u2019s order. The cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>cuit court did not err in affirming the Board\u2019s finding regarding Charge 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Appellant argues that his failure to obey Major Johnson\u2019s order was an action protected by his rights under the United States Constitution and under the Maryland Declaration of Rights. In particular, appellant cites the First Amendment to the Constitution, which provides that \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech.... \u201d He also cites Article 36 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights, which provides, in pertinent part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-6\">no person ought by an law be molested in his person or estate, on account of his religious persuasion, or profession, or for his religious practice, unless, under color of religion, he shall disturb the good order, peace or safety of the State or shall infringe the laws of morality, or injure others in their natural, civil or religious rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">In his argument, appellant makes no distinction between the First Amendment and Article 36, and we will proceed on the basis that, in the context of this case, the two constitutional provisions have the same effect. <em>See Supermarkets General Corp. v. State, </em>286 Md. 611, 625, 409 A.2d 250 (1979), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>449 U.S. 801, 101 S.Ct. 45, 66 L.Ed.2d 5 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">Appellee responds that the United States Supreme Court has \u201crecognized a distinction between the freedom of individual belief, which is absolute, and the freedom of individual conduct, which is not absolute.\u201d <em>Bowen v. Roy, </em>476 U.S. 693, 699, 106 S.Ct. 2147, 90 L.Ed.2d 735 (1986). The right to free exercise of religion includes both the \u201cfreedom to believe and the freedom to act. The first is absolute but, in the nature of things, the second cannot be. Conduct remains subject to regulation for the protection of society.\u201d <em>Cantwell v. Connecticut, </em>310 U.S. 296, 303-304, 60 S.Ct. 900, 84 L.Ed. 1213 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>The Supreme Court has recognized three types of government property for First Amendment purposes: (1) places which by tradition or by government fiat have been devoted to assembly and debate, such as streets and parks, where \u201cthe government may not prohibit all communicative activity\u201d; (2) public property which the state has opened for use by the public as a place for expressive activity, such as university meeting facilities and school board meetings, where \u201c[t]he Constitution forbids a state to enforce certain exclusions ... even if it was not required to create the forum in the first place\u201d; and (3) \u201c[p]ublic property which is not by tradition or designation a forum for public communication.... \u201d <em>Perry Education Assn. v. Perry Local Educators\u2019 Assn., </em>460 U.S. 37, 45-46, 103 S.Ct. 948, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983). The correctional facility where appellant worked falls into the third category, i.e., property owned by the government that is not open to the general public and that is subject to restrictive measures for both the employees and inmates. <em>See Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Educational Fund, Inc., </em>473 U.S. 788, 802, 105 S.Ct. 3439, 87 L.Ed.2d 567 (1985). \u201cThe state, no less than a private owner of property, has power to preserve the property under its control for the use to which it is lawfully dedicated.\u201d <em>Adderley v. Florida, </em>385 U.S. 39, 47, 87 S.Ct. 242, 17 L.Ed.2d 149 (1966); <em>see U.S. Postal Service v. Council of Greenburgh Civic Associations, </em>453 U.S. 114, 129, 101 S.Ct. 2676, 69 L.Ed.2d 517 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Courts reviewing the administration of prisons and jails must give \u201cappropriate deference to the decisions of prison administrators and appropriate recognition to the peculiar and restrictive circumstances of penal confinement.\u201d <em>Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners\u2019 Labor Union, Inc., </em>433 U.S. 119, 125, 97 S.Ct. 2532, 53 L.Ed.2d 629 (1977). In a case concerning the disciplining of inmates, this Court stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A88\">[p]rison is a place where \u2018good order and discipline are paramount because of the concentration of convicted criminals.\u2019 ... The adoption and execution of prison policies are \u2018peculiarly within the province and professional expertise of corrections officials\u2019 whose judgment should generally be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>deferred to by the courts. Because prison security and the safety of its population are in their hands, prison officials \u2018must have a wide discretion in promulgating rules.... \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"axn-dedup-0\"><em>Robinson v. State, </em>116 Md.App. 1, 9, 695 A.2d 198 (1997) (quoting, <em>inter alia, Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 547-548, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979); <em>McCloskey v. Maryland, </em>337 F.2d 72, 74 (4 th Cir.1964)). Acknowledging that the present case concerns a jail or correction facility rather than a prison, and the disciplining of correctional officers rather than of inmates, we believe that the principle expressed in <em>Robinson </em>is instructive here: the peculiar demands of penal institutions must be factored into the deference given to their administrators by courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">In <em>De Bleecker v. Montgomery County, </em>292 Md. 498, 438 A.2d 1348 (1982), the Court of Appeals held that, in a wrongful termination suit by a former teacher at a county detention center, it was a question for the jury whether the teacher was dismissed for communicating to inmates his opinions about a guard who he alleged had beaten an inmate or for reporting to detention center authorities his disagreement with the guard\u2019s actions. In <em>De Bleecker </em>the trial court had granted the defendants\u2019 motions for a directed verdict on the grounds that, even though the teacher might have a constitutionally-protected right of free speech in the written report he made to the authorities, the teacher had no such right in the oral comments he made to inmates, because those comments had the potential to endanger the facility\u2019s operation by inciting the inmates. The Court of Appeals in <em>De Bleecker </em>assumed, without deciding, that the trial court was correct in concluding that the teacher\u2019s oral statements were not constitutionally-protected speech; the Court reversed because it was the province of the jury to decide whether the teacher would have been fired even in the absence of the county\u2019s improper retaliation for the written report, which was protected speech. 292 Md. at 510, 438 A.2d 1348.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The Court of Appeals quoted <em>Pickering v. Board of Education, </em>391 U.S. 563, 568, 88 S.Ct. 1731, 20 L.Ed.2d 811 (1968), for the principle that \u201cthe State has interests as an employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>in regulating the speech of its employees that differ significantly from those it possesses in connection with regulation of the speech of the citizenry in general.\u201d <em>De Bleecker, </em>292 Md. at 508, 438 A.2d 1348. The Court also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-5\">On retrial, the question whether De Bleecker\u2019s oral comments [to the inmates] were constitutionally protected will again rise. Manifestly, that determination must be made in view of the competing considerations involved between the interests of citizens in commenting upon matters of public concern and the legitimate governmental interest in order and security essential in the management of a penal facility.... It is, of course, appropriate that the <em>Pickering </em>balancing test be struck in the context of the special factual tableau of a prison facility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">292 Md. at 510-511, 438 A.2d 1348 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">Appellant\u2019s supervisors had some discretion to place limits upon his First Amendment rights when his methods of exercising those rights had a potentially negative impact upon the operation of the facility. Further, the order given to appellant by Major Johnson related solely to appellant\u2019s activities while on duty as a corrections officer. It did not restrict appellant\u2019s freedom of religious belief or unreasonably restrict his ability to exercise his religious beliefs, except to the extent that he was prohibited from distributing his cards or conducting religious classes during working hours. Major Johnson testified that appellant would not have been in violation of his order if appellant responded to a question from an inmate about religious matters, or even if appellant conducted religious activities at the facility after his normal working hours. Major Johnson told appellant that he could request permission from the Department to participate in religious services that occurred during appellant\u2019s non:duty hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">Moreover, in the penal environment, the line between the free exercise of religion and its constitutional sibling, the governmental prohibition against religious establishment, can be easily blurred. Resentment based even on perceived favoritism between guards and prisoners based on religion can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>breed discontent in a diverse population that includes those with different religious beliefs and those who embrace no religion or, in some cases, oppose all religion. A penal institution is a governmental operation in which the population is by its very nature unable to walk away to avoid unwanted exposure to the most sincere and well intended religious zealousness, especially when the evangelist is a correctional officer. Under such circumstances, the administration and staff must be especially vigilant in avoiding the appearance of impropriety and the favoring of one religion over another.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Although the order placed restrictions on appellant, those restrictions were both minimal and integrally related to the operation of the facility. Granting deference to the management decisions made by the administrators of the facility in recognition of the peculiar and restrictive circumstances of penal confinement, we hold that the order given to appellant was a legal one and that disobedience of that order was not protected by the United States Constitution or the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Appellant contends that the penalties the Board recommended for his violations were \u201cexcessive, arbitrary, disparate and capricious.\u201d He argues that their excessiveness constituted \u201clegal error,\u201d and that they should be vacated. Appellant suggests that the penalties were disproportionate to the offense, and that other persons situated similarly were treated differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">Addressing the last argument first, we believe that appellant\u2019s equal protection or selective enforcement argument was not supported by the evidence presented. Appellant presented witnesses who testified that other correctional officers discussed religion with inmates, but none of those officers were said to have conducted religious classes at the facility during their lunch breaks, and none of those officers were reported to have given inmates cards with a telephone number that rings at their home. Other officers testified that, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>following Department rules and reporting the matters to their supervisors, they had assisted relatives who had been incarcerated at the facility and were attempting to be released on bail. None of these other officers testified that they had provided bail for female inmates unrelated to them and then lived with those inmates. There was no testimony about other corrections officers who had fraternized with inmates to a degree equivalent to appellant\u2019s actions, or who had failed to obey an order from a supervisor at the facility. Appellant\u2019s allegations about other officers do not make the Department\u2019s response to his violations any less appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The Court of Appeals has held that corrections facility administrators have the discretion to remove a correctional officer when the past conduct of the officer evidences the potential for serious future problems in the operation of the facility and that such a dismissal is not arbitrary or capricious. <em>Maryland State Department of Personnel v. Sealing, </em>298 Md. 524, 539, 471 A.2d 693 (1984). In <em>Sealing, </em>the Court quoted testimony from supervisors at the corrections facility who stated that the officer\u2019s actions had the potential to be \u201cinflammatory\u201d at the institution; the supervisors testified that no adverse action by the inmates had yet occurred. <em>Id. </em>at 538, 471 A.2d 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Similarly, in <em>Hawkins v. Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services, </em>325 Md. 621, 602 A.2d 712 (1992), the Court of Appeals held that a probationary prison guard\u2019s offensive speech while off-duty and away from the prison gave prison authorities sufficient grounds to dismiss the guard. The guard\u2019s dismissal was justified not by the political incorrectness of his speech, but by the interest that the correctional facility\u2019s administrators had in not employing a person who lost his temper easily and resorted to inflammatory rhetoric. 325 Md. at 638, 602 A.2d 712. \u201cThus, the warden of the House of Correction need not have waited for an actual eruption precipitated by Hawkins. It is not necessary \u2018for an employer to allow events to unfold to the extent that the disruption of the office and the destruction of working relationships is manifest before taking action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 639, 602 A.2d 712 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>(quoting <em>Connick v. Myers, </em>461 U.S. 138, 152, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Except to the extent we have responded to appellant\u2019s constitutional arguments, our decision does not relate to the content of appellant\u2019s speech to inmates. We certainly have no reason or need to doubt the sincerity of appellant\u2019s beliefs and a corresponding motivation for his activities. Much testimony was received regarding appellant\u2019s charitable nature toward inmates and ex-inmates, and his desire to assist those persons in avoiding recidivism. It is quite possible, as contended by appellant and other witnesses, that his religious discussions with inmates had an ameliorative effect on the inmates and on the facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Our references to <em>Sealing </em>and <em>Hawkins </em>should in no way suggest that appellant\u2019s speech and conduct was equivalent to the speech and conduct exhibited by the dismissed correctional officers in those cases. These references simply underscore the fact that the administrators of correctional facilities have some discretion in their management decisions, and that we review those decisions not to decide whether we would have made the same decision, but whether they acted in accordance with the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">As noted above, we grant a great deal of deference to the Department\u2019s presumed expertise in the management of correctional facilities. The nature of the Department\u2019s work, <em>i.e., </em>housing potentially disruptive, and even violent, persons who do not want to be housed, illustrates the importance of the Department being able to employ persons whom it trusts to follow orders and exercise good judgment. Appellant\u2019s failure to obey an order from a supervisor and his ongoing fraternization with inmates are violations that could generate legitimate concern about his ability to perform his duties without disturbing the effective operation of the facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">The fact that appellant\u2019s actions were not shown to have created any disruption in the facility\u2019s operations should not prevent the Department from seeking to avoid future difficulties. Regardless of whether appellant\u2019s intentions were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>admirable, the Department has the authority to dismiss corrections officers whose conduct has led administrators to be concerned that a more significant problem may arise in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Dismissals have been held to be arbitrary and capricious when unsupported by evidence. <em>Zeitschel v. Board of Education, </em>274 Md. 69, 83, 332 A.2d 906 (1975). Appellant\u2019s dismissal was supported by evidence and was not arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED.
