For the reasons that follow, we hold that appellant did not file a timely appeal to this Court, and shall therefore dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">On May 21, 1996, Bob Dutcher, appellee, filed an application with the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission for approval of the preliminary plan of a subdivision. The property, Brooke-Jane Manor, Section 6, is an 8.83 parcel of land located at the end of Brooke-Jane Drive, west of Brandywine Road in Prince George\u2019s. County. , The property lies south of the intersection of Surratts Road and Branch Avenue, the main intersection serving the property. Appellee planned to divide the property into twenty lots for single family homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">Pursuant to Prince George\u2019s County Code (\u201cPGCC\u201d) section 24-124, appellee was required to show the Prince George\u2019s County Planning Board (\u201cPlanning Board\u201d) that there would be adequate access to roads to serve traffic that would be generated by the subdivision, and that the \u201ctraffic generated by the proposed subdivision will be accommodated on major intersections and major roadways ... such that they will be functioning below the minimum peak-hours service levels adopted by the Planning Board....\u201d PGCC \u00a7 24-124(a)(l) &amp; (2). While a traffic study by the Planning Board was not required, the Planning Board determined that \u201cthere is a need to examine current transportation adequacy problems at MD 5/Surratts Road and MD 223/Brandywine Road.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">The major concern with the subdivision was its effect on traffic at the intersection of Maryland Route 5 and Surratts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Road (\u201ccritical intersection\u201d). In determining whether an intersection can satisfy traffic needs, the Planning Board evaluates \u201cLevels of Service.\u201d These levels are measured as A, B, C, D, E, or F, with A being the highest level of service and other grades descending in order. Levels A through D are considered adequate, 'and levels E and F are considered inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The Planning Board\u2019s technical staff (\u201cstaff\u2019) initially recommended disapproval of the subdivision. According to the Staff Report, the subdivision would generate fifteen vehicle trips during the \u201ca.m. peak hours\u201d and eighteen trips during the \u201cp.m. peak hours.\u201d Furthermore, the report indicated that without the subdivision, the critical intersection operated at an acceptable D level of service and, after adding anticipated traffic from the subdivision, a D level still remained. Nevertheless, the Planning Board\u2019s methodology required it to add \u201cbackground traffic\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> into the analysis. After doing so, the level of service at the critical intersection fell below the acceptable D grade during the morning and afternoon peak hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">A hearing before the Planning Board was held on October 31, 1996. At the hearing, the staff indicated that it determined that an unacceptable level of service would be generated at the critical intersection and that appellee had \u201cnot proposed improvements to improve the service levels at this intersection.\u201d The staff and appellee, however, offered what they considered a possible solution for the problem to the Planning Board \u2014 a Traffic Facilities Mitigation Plan (\u201cTFMP\u201d) under which appellee agreed to pay a pro rata share to build a \u201csecond left turn lane southbound approaching Surratts Road\u201d at the critical intersection. The Planning Board did not vote on the proposed TFMP, but rather, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>continued the case in order to have a better understanding of the specifics involved in the TFMP.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">The Planning Board next addressed appellee\u2019s situation on November 7, 1996. At the hearing, a planning staff representative announced that he mis-spoke at the previous hearing when he indicated the TFMP would include a double left turn lane. The staff member explained that the improvements that appellee would bear a pro rata responsibility for were \u201cadditional pavement and striping on the eastbound Surratts Road approach and southbound 5 to provide a free right-turn lane from eastbound Surratts Road to southbound MD 5\u201d and \u201cadditional pavement and striping on northbound MD 5 to provide a free right-turn land [sic] from westbound Surratts Road to northbound MD 5.\u201d Appellee\u2019s pro rata share for these improvements would be $28,333, or approximately $1,166 per unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">The Planning Board issued its conditional approval of the subdivision on December 5, 1996. In its report, the Planning Board noted that no traffic study was done; rather, the mitigation plan was based on a study prepared for a similarly located site that had already been approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Pursuant to PGCC \u00a7 21 \u2014 124(a)(6)(D),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a local citizens group appealed the Planning Board\u2019s decision to the District Council. On May 5, 1997, the District Council remanded the case and ordered the Planning Board to supplement the record with the TFMP and the \u201cagency comments from State Highway Administration and the Department of Public Works and Transportation, to the Planning Board.\u201d The Planning Board supplemented the record, and a second appeal was taken to the District Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">On February 11, 1998, the District Council issued its Notice of Final Decision in which it reversed the Planning Board\u2019s decision and denied the mitigation plan. In doing so, the District Council rejected the Planning Board\u2019s findings of fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>and made its own finding that the mitigation plan was inadequate. Specifically, the District Council found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">1. [T]hat the intersection of MD Rt. 5 and Surratts Road is currently operating at Level of Service \u201cF,\u201d and that mitigation of the traffic at this intersection is required.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-6\"><em>2. </em>[T]hat the proposed provisions of a second southbound left-turn lane from MD Rt. 5 on to Surratts Road, including any improvements to the receiving lanes of Surratts Road deemed necessary by the State Highway Administration, are inadequate to alleviate the Level of Service \u201cF\u201d at the [critical] intersection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">3. [T]hat Planning Board Resolution Condition 1, a formula for the assessment per building permit for a pro-rata share of the construction of improvements to the intersection of MD Rt. 5 and Surratts Road as described above, will not alleviate Level of Service \u201cF\u201d at this intersection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-8\">4. [T]hat the transportation infrastructure (existing and proposed) is inadequate to service the proposed Preliminary Plat of Subdivision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-9\">5. [T]hat the mitigation plan proposed by [appellee] is inadequate to reduce the existing Level of Service \u201cF\u201d at the [critical] intersection ... Therefore, the proposed mitigation is unacceptable and must be denied[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">Pursuant to Md.Code (1957, 1997 Repl.Vol.), Art. 28 (\u201cArt. 28\u201d), \u00a7 8-106(e), appellee appealed the decision of the District Council to the circuit court. In a written order and opinion, the circuit court reversed the decision of the District Council. The circuit court held: (1) that the District Council is required to give deference to the factual findings of the Planning Board; and (2) facts in the record did not support the District Council\u2019s conclusions. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Aoa\">Timeliness of appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b442-12\">Appellee contends that the District Council\u2019s attorney did not have authority to file the instant appeal and that no timely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>appeal was filed. Final judgment in the circuit court was entered on June 9, 1999. This appeal was noted by appellant\u2019s attorney on July 7, 1999. The District Council, however, did not vote to authorize the appeal until July 13, 1999, four days past the expiration of the thirty-day appeal period provided by Maryland Rule 8-202.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellee contends that the appeal must be dismissed because an appeal of a \u201cfinal judgment to which the District Council is a party, is not authorized until such time as a vote to appeal the final judgment is formally taken by the District Council,\u201d and relies on <em>Comm. on Hum. Rel. v. Anne Arundel Co., </em>106 Md.App. 221, 664 A.2d 400 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">In <em>Anne Arundel, </em>this Court addressed the capacity of an administrative agency to seek judicial review. In <em>Anne Arun-del, </em>the petition for judicial review and appeal to this Court was authorized by the agency\u2019s executive director and general counsel. On our own motion, we raised the issue of whether the executive director and general counsel possessed standing to seek judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">In reaching our decision, we observed that an administrative agency does not have the right to seek review of its own final decision absent statutory authority. <em>See id. </em>at 237-38, 664 A.2d 400. Moreover, \u201c[w]e recognizefd] that, where judicial review is provided by statute, the statutory method of review is exclusive ... [and] defines the limits of the court\u2019s power to review the determinations of the agency.\u201d <em>Id,, </em>at 238, 664 A.2d 400. We held that the general counsel and executive director did not have standing to authorize the appeal because the statute granting the agency power to seek judicial review vested that power in the agency, and a vote by the agency\u2019s commissioners was necessary to seek judicial review. In doing so, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">Because the power to authorize judicial review rests exclusively in the \u2018agency\u2019 by statute, the Commissioners them<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>selves must sanction any determination to adjudicate a contested ... case \u2022 beyond the decision of [the agency].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATc\"><em>Id. </em>at 241, 664 A.2d 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">In the instant case, the District Council\u2019s authority to seek an appeal to this Court is found in Art. 28, \u00a7 8-106(j), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-6\">In Prince George\u2019s County, the district council, the applicant, or any party to the circuit court review who is an aggrieved party may secure a review of any final judgment of the Prince George\u2019s County Circuit Court under this title by appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. The appeal shall be taken in the manner provided by law for appeals from law courts in other civil cases. Each member of the district council in Prince George\u2019s County is entitled to vote on whether the district council shall appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, regardless of whether the member participated in the hearing on the matter or in the decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">In analyzing a statute, we must ascertain and carry out the true intentions of the legislature. <em>See Tortuga v. Wolfensberger, </em>97 Md.App. 79, 84, 627 A.2d 56, <em>cert. denied, </em>332 Md. 703, 632 A.2d 1209 (1993). To discern the legislative intent, we look to the plain meaning of the language of the statute. <em>See Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 73, 517 A.2d 730 (1986). \u201cWhere the language is clear and unambiguous, a court may not add or delete words to make a statute reflect an intent not evidenced in that language to avoid a harsh result.\u201d <em>Condon v. State, </em>332 Md. 481, 491, 632 A.2d 753 (1993) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Appellant contends that the statutory language does not require its members to approve an appeal within the thirty-day period, and that the District Council\u2019s vote on July 13, after the thirty-day appeal period, was sufficient to satisfy the section 8-106(j) requirement that each member of the council \u201cis entitled to vote on whether the district council shall appeal.\u201d To accept this argument would be to ignore the teachings of <em>Anne Arundel, </em>in which we held that to be properly noted, the appeal must \u201cbe approved by the ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>group of individuals ... within whom is reposed the ultimate legal authority to pursue such review.\u201d <em>Anne Arundel, </em>106 Md.App. at 241, 664 A.2d 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Appellant further contends that its attorney had \u201cstanding authorization\u201d to file the notice of appeal on behalf of the District Council and \u201cwas authorized to do, by the practice accepted and followed for many years.\u201d Specifically, appellant proffers that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-6\">By prior practice in administrative cases, from about 1982 to the present, the District Council\u2019s standing authorization and instructions to its attorneys have been as follows: First, the attorney is authorized and directed to appear in every case appealing or challenging a District Council decision; second, the attorney is required to defend all actions of the Council, including all findings, orders, and conditions; third, the attorney is authorized and required to preserve all District Council rights in litigation, unless the Council approves a dismissal, compromise, or waiver of rights; and fourth, the Council is to be advised by the attorney of the course of litigation and the need for a decision, whenever required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">It presents affidavits from its Principal Counsel and Council Administrator, which support the proffer in its brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">A similar argument, however, was presented and rejected in <em>Anne Arundel. </em>There, we characterized the customary practice regarding appeals by the Commission on Human Relations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-9\">[Cjounsel for the Commission conceded that the Executive Director of the Commission and the agency\u2019s General Counsel, and not the Commissioners, had made the decision to seek review of the Board\u2019s decision. The Commission\u2019s appellate counsel proffered to us that, at some unspecified time in the past, the Commissioners had delegated to the Executive Director and the General Counsel the authority to determine whether to take an appeal of an appeal board\u2019s action. Counsel conceded, however, that such delegation was merely an unmemorialized internal agency practice that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>had not been authorized by any statute, COMAR rule, or, for that matter, any published rule or edict generally discoverable by the public. Apparently, it has merely been, at best, a policy of some duration within the institutional memory of at least some Commission staff that the Executive Director and General Counsel make the decision whether to seek judicial review in contested cases on an <em>ad hoc </em>basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 240-41, 664 A.2d 400 (bold emphasis added) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The long-standing practice, described in the present case, of having the Principal Counsel and Council Administrator make the decision to file an appeal to protect the interests of the District Council, is not meaningfully different from the longstanding practice of the Commission on Human Relations proffered to and rejected by us in <em>Anne Arundel. </em>We only reiterate the conclusion reached in <em>Anne Arundel, </em>as we conclude that the tradition of allowing Principal Counsel, in conjunction with the Council Administrator, to file appeals is not an effective delegation of the District Council\u2019s right to decide whether to appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">Lastly, appellant contends that the notice of appeal was sufficient because it was ratified by the District Council membership after the thirty-day app\u00e9al time had expired. In support of this contention, appellant cites <em>Switkes v. John McShain, </em>202 Md. 340, 350, 96 A.2d 617 (1953), for the proposition that a client may ratify an appeal after its filing. Appellant\u2019s reliance of <em>Switkes </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\"><em>Switkes </em>involved a lawyer filing an appeal of a workmen\u2019s compensation claim to the Court of Common Pleas on behalf of his client, who had died two days before the notice was filed. After the thirty-day period for filing a timely appeal passed, the deceased widow was substituted as an appellant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>The widow argued that the appeal was properly filed and should not be dismissed because the opposing party had \u201creceived actual notice of the intention to appeal within the prescribed time, [has] not been prejudiced, and the appeal should be considered as having been taken by the widow ... since she ratified the action taken in the name of her dead husband.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 342-43, 96 A.2d 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The Court of Appeals disagreed and held that the appeal was properly dismissed. First, the Court recognized that the death of a client terminates an attorney\u2019s power to act in the name of the client. <em>See id. </em>at 348, 96 A.2d 617. The Court further found that the widow was not substituted as a party within the time prescribed by law to file an appeal. For these reasons, the Court held dismissal was proper because the original appeal was not properly filed and the substitution of the widow came after the time period prescribed by law for noting an appeal. The Court explained that the substitution of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-6\">the widow ... as an appellant .. . conferred no rights upon her . .. since it came too late.... It could not be considered a ratification of the appeal which had been taken earlier, because there was nothing to ratify, that appeal having been a nullity.... \u2018[T]here was no appeal properly made ... and the mere appearance of the heirs ... does not stand in the way of the motion to dismiss; their appearance being without authority, and the case standing, as if no such appearance had been entered.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 350, 96 A.2d 617 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">The concept that ratification of the decision to appeal could occur outside of the thirty-day window was considered and rejected in <em>Anne Arundel, </em>in which we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-9\">[Assuming that the Commissioners did not specifically authorize the Executive Director and General Counsel to file the petition for judicial review that was filed in this case, the Commission Chairperson\u2019s 29 April 1994 execution of the notice to the parties required by Rule 7 \u2014 202(d)(2) is the equivalent of a ratification by the \u2018agency\u2019 after the fact.... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>[For such action to be considered ratification], however, the record would need to disclose, at a minimum, that the execution of the Rule 7 \u2014 202(d)(2) notice by the Commission Chairperson came within the time during which a petition for judicial review could have been filed had the Commissioners themselves actually acted to authorize the seeking of such relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-5\"><em>Anne Arundel, </em>106 Md.App. at 242 n. 9, 664 A.2d 400 (bold emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Appellant\u2019s attorney filed an unauthorized appeal that had no legal effect. After the expiration of the time to file a timely appeal, any appeal by the District Council to this Court is untimely. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 8-202. Therefore, because appellant failed to take proper action and approve the filing of the appeal within thirty days of the final judgment of the circuit court, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Correctness of Planning Board decision</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">Even were we to hold the appeal was timely, appellee would still prevail. Judicial review of an administrative agency decision is narrow. \u201cWhen asked to review a decision of an administrative agency, a reviewing court must give the decision great weight and a presumption of validity.\u201d <em>County Council of P.G. County v. Curtis Regency, </em>121 Md.App. 123, 133, 708 A.2d 1058, <em>cert. denied, </em>351 Md. 5, 715 A.2d 964 (1998). \u201cA court\u2019s role is limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>United Parcel v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>336 Md. 569, 577, 650 A.2d 226 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">In <em>Colao v. Prince George\u2019s County Council, </em>109 Md.App. 431, 675 A.2d 148 (1996), <em>aff'd, </em>346 Md. 342, 697 A.2d 96 (1997), we articulated the following standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-10\">\u2018In regard to findings of fact, the trial court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the agency and must accept the agency\u2019s conclusions if they are based on substantial evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>dence and if reasoning minds could reach the same conclusion based on the record; when reviewing findings of law, however, no such deference is given to the agency\u2019s conclusion.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 458, 675 A.2d 148. (quoting <em>Columbia Road Citizens\u2019 Assoc. v. Montgomery County, 98 </em>Md.App. 695, 698, 635 A.2d 30 (1994)); <em>see also Belvoir Farms v.

St. Mary\u2019s County, </em>99 Md.App. 502, 509, 638 A.2d 1175, <em>cert. denied sub nom., Enoch v. North, </em>336 Md. 224, 647 A.2d 444 (1994). The decision will be upheld when \u201ca reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached; this need not and must not be either judicial fact-finding or a substitution of judicial judgment for agency judgment.\u201d <em>Evans v. Shore Communications, </em>112 Md.App. 284, 298, 685 A.2d 454 (1996). Nevertheless, when an authority\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence, it cannot be said to be \u201cfairly debatable\u201d and \u201c \u2018falls into the category of being arbitrary, capricious and a denial of due process of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>North, </em>99 Md.

The Prince George\u2019s County Council, however, has developed \u201cGuidelines for Mitigation Actions\u201d (\u201cGuidelines\u201d), which provide means for development in areas where the level of service falls below acceptable levels. Particularly, PGCC section 24-124(a)(6)(C)provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\">Where existing traffic service in the service area is at the acceptable peak-hour service level threshold or better, as defined in the \u2018Guidelines,\u2019 and if the total traffic service in the study area is no greater than ten percent (10%) above the acceptable peak-hour service level threshold as defined in the \u2018Guidelines\u2019 and the proposed subdivision generates less than twenty-five (25) A.M. or P.M. peak-hour trips, the Planning Board may require that the subdivider ... shall be responsible for the pro rata cost of the physical improvements necessary to alleviate the inadequacy as defined in the \u2018Guidelines.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">In 1994, the Prince George\u2019s County Council adopted Resolution 29-1994 for \u201cthe purpose of approving the [Guidelines], which are to be incorporated into the subdivision procedures <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>of the Planning Board\u2019s \u2018Guidelines for the Analysis of the Traffic Impact of Development Proposals.\u2019 \u201d The Guidelines define mitigation as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-4\">a process developed by the Prince George\u2019s County Council by which developments in certain areas of the County are allowed to provide roadway improvements (or funding for transportation improvements) which would improve traffic operations at nearby intersections. Mitigation represents a departure from the remainder of these Guidelines in that <em>these improvements need not achieve Levelr-of-Service D operations </em>on the affected links or at the affected interchanges or intersections. These mitigation procedures would allow development to proceed in certain areas experiencing unacceptable transportation service levels; however, the development could occur only if transportation improvements are made which <em>would result in an improvement in traffic operations beyond what would have been expected if the development had not occurred. </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Under section 24-124(a)(6)(C) the subdivision had to meet certain criteria before mitigation could be considered: (1) the existing traffic levels of service at the critical intersection must meet level D standards during the morning and afternoon peak hours; (2) total traffic levels of service at the critical intersection must not be greater than 10% above the acceptable peak-hour service level; and (3) the proposed subdivision must generate less than twenty-five peak hour trips. If the above criteria are satisfied, the subdivision may be approved based on a TFMP provided for under the Guidelines. We, therefore, turn to the record before the Planning Board to determine if the above criteria have been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">During the July 3, 1997 hearing, the staff indicated that the subdivision \u201cappears to meet all of the criteria that are required as a part of the mitigation ordinance and the mitigation guidelines.\u201d According to the Staff Report, the critical intersection is currently operating at a D level of service. Additionally, the evidence is uncontradicted that the subdivision would generate less than twenty-five a.m. and p.m. peak hour trips. Specifically, the Staff Report indicates that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>subdivision.would generate fifteen trips during the a.m. peak hours and eighteen trips during the p.m. peak hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">The Staff Report indicates that the highest acceptable critical lane volume to achieve a D level of service is 1450. In order to meet the mitigation criteria (service levels not greater than 10% above the acceptable peak-hour service level), the total traffic in the critical intersection may not exceed 1595 during a.m. and p.m. peak hours. A staff member testified that the current traffic levels at the critical intersection fell within the requirement, as total traffic in the a.m. peak hours was 1595, with an E level of service, and 1548 in the p.m. peak hours, also with an E level of service. Finally, a staff member testified that the TFMP would improve traffic operations beyond what there would be without development because, \u201cwith the improvements as recommended in the mitigation plan, in the AM the total traffic would be 1540, with a level of service E. And in the PM ... the critical lane volume would be 1524, with a level of service E.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The Planning Board concluded that the TFMP sufficiently addressed the traffic concerns and approved appellee\u2019s subdivision plan. The facts contained in the record provide substantial evidence that the criteria set forth in the Guidelines has been satisfied. Therefore, the decision of the Planning Board is fairly debatable and should not have been reversed by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Appellant further contends that the Planning Board\u2019s decision must be reversed because appellee did not submit a traffic impact study. According to appellant, \u201can applicant must submit a \u2018traffic impact analysis (TIA)\u2019 for a \u2018study area\u2019 staff selects\u201d and must submit a TFMP.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Appellant is correct that the Guidelines contain a general requirement that an applicant must submit a TIA and TFMP. Nevertheless, the Guidelines provide that \u201c[alternative mitigation strategies are allowed for smaller development proposals,\u201d and appellee\u2019s proposed subdivision fell within the category of \u201csmaller developments\u201d. In such a case, the Guidelines provide that the applicant is not required to submit a traffic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>study or TFMP; rather, the Planning Board\u2019s staff \u201cwill prepare a TFMP for the significant transportation facilities) which are proposed as mitigation candidate(s).\u201d The staff followed this procedure, and the TFMP for the critical intersection served as the basis for approval of the proposed subdivision. Moreover, although no traffic study was done, the staffs use of \u201ca review of other traffic-related information in the area, particularly information related to [another subdivision] which was approved by the Planning Board ... conducted by the staff .. . [and] consistent with\u201d the Guidelines, was sufficient to form the TFMP.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">In reversing the Planning Board\u2019s decision, appellant rejected the Planning Board\u2019s findings of fact and made its own findings regarding the proposed subdivision\u2019s eligibility for mitigation and the adequacy of the TFMP. In doing so, appellant overstepped its authority in reversing the Planning Board. <em>See Curtis Regency, </em>121 Md.App. at 137, 708 A.2d 1058 (holding that District Council\u2019s authority is limited to determining whether Planning Board\u2019s decision \u201cwas arbitrary, capricious, discriminatory or illegal\u201d). The Planning Board\u2019s decision was fairly debatable and based on substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">We dismiss the appeal on grounds that it was not timely filed. We conclude, however, that even were the appeal filed timely, the circuit court\u2019s decision to reverse the District Council\u2019s reversal of the Planning Board was appropriate, and we would affirm the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">APPEAL DISMISSED.
