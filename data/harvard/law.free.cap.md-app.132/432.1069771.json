Payne, appellant, and Robert A. Payne, Jr., appellee, concerning child support. After a hearing on June 7, 1999, the Circuit Court for Cecil County suspended appellee\u2019s child support obligation for the six week period of summer visitation, when the father was to have sole physical custody of the parties\u2019 only child, Sonja Marie, who was born on July 17, 1988. Appellant noted her appeal and presents two questions for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-11\">I. Did the trial court err when it made a ruling on the issue of modifying Appellee\u2019s child support obligation where there was no motion or pleading before the Court and there was no material change of circumstance?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-12\">II. Did the trial court err when it deviated from the child support guidelines and modified or terminated the child support for six consecutive weeks that the minor child visited with the Appellee?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-13\">For the reasons discussed below, we shall reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-14\">FACTUAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b456-15\">In November 1993, appellant initiated divorce proceedings that culminated in an award of absolute divorce to appellee, pursuant to a Judgment of Absolute Divorce dated July 31, 1996. The order of that date \u201creserved\u201d as to the issue of custody and visitation, but continued appellee\u2019s child support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>obligation of $124.00 per week, which had been established by a <em>pendente lite </em>order of December 29, 1993. Subsequently, by order dated February 12, 1998, appellant was awarded sole custody of the couple\u2019s child, and appellee was given visitation on alternating weekends.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">In March 1999, appellee filed a Complaint For Modification Of Custody, which he later amended. He alleged that \u201ccircumstances have changed significantly and it is in the [child\u2019s] best interest\u201d to be in his custody. In response, appellant filed a \u201cMotion To Dismiss, Or In The Alternative, Motion For More Definite Statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">On May 14, 1999, following the hearing on appellant\u2019s motion, appellee\u2019s counsel wrote a letter to the court advising that the mother had \u201coffered\u201d to permit the father \u201cto have the parties\u2019 minor child for six (6) consecutive weeks during the summer,\u201d rather than the two weeks that had been anticipated. The letter further stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALu\">Mr. Payne is more than happy and willing to have his daughter for this time frame. However, Mr. Payne has a concern regarding child support during this period. My client currently pays $124.00 per week in child support. He believes that during the six (6) weeks that he has his daughter this summer, his child support obligation should cease, and Ms. Payne should, in turn, pay him the $124.00 per week, as the parties\u2019 incomes are almost identical. Please note that [appellant\u2019s counsel] has done a calculation whereby she included the six (6) weeks, along with my client\u2019s regular visitation, and the total number of overnights does not warrant a shared custody calculation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-7\">However, at the request of my client, I am asking Your Honor to make a ruling regarding the child support matter for the six (6) weeks that the child is with my client.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3W\">Appellant\u2019s counsel responded by letter to the court on June 1, 1999, stating, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-8\">I have received a copy of a letter dated May 14, 1999, as well as, a copy of a letter with your notes dated May 19, 1999. I am presuming that [Y]our Honor has not yet made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>a ruling -without permitting me to respond to this letter, and if appropriate,' having a hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">[Appellee\u2019s counsel] is correct that Mr. Payne is scheduled to have the minor child for a period of six (6) weeks this summer. However, this issue was previously discussed between counsel on the date of our hearing, and at that time, I informed [appellee\u2019s counsel] that I calculated the number of days during the year that Mr. Payne has the child, and that the number was not 128 or above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUOD\">Upon [appellee\u2019s counsel\u2019s] request to terminate the child support for the six (6) weeks during the summer that Mr. Payne has Sonja for visits, I immediately calculated the overnights to determine if there was a shared custody situation. Even with the summer visitation, Mr. Payne has the child only 88 overnights during the year, far short of the 128 overnights required by the statute [for shared custody]. Even if your Honor does not find the statute compelling, there is also another consideration. Specifically, Ms. Payne has made arrangements for the child\u2019s summer day care, and has already become obligated to pay for the care. These arrangements were made before the court date and with the understanding that Mr. Payne would take the child to the summer day camp. Because of this expenses, [sic] Ms. Payne could not go without the child support previously ordered by this Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">At the hearing held on June 7, 1999, appellee\u2019s counsel argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that appellee\u2019s request would enable him to use the child support monies for the benefit of his daughter, adding that he would \u201cbe able to do other things with her as far as activities and vacations and things along those lines.\u201d The father\u2019s counsel further averred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-8\">I think in this particular case ... what Mr. Payne is requesting is in the best interest of the child. It\u2019s going to allow him to better spend his six weeks with his daughter. To provide more activities and things for her to do as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>opposed to paying his ex-wife $124 for those six weeks when she is not even going to have visitation with the child during that time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">Appellant\u2019s counsel noted an objection \u201cfor the record,\u201d asserting that the matter had been improperly raised by letter, rather than by motion. She then proceeded to discuss the merits, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that deviation from the child support guidelines was not warranted under the circumstances of this case, because appellee does not qualify for shared physical custody, even with the extended summer visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Appellee\u2019s counsel countered that the presumption concerning the application of the child support guidelines is rebutta-ble, and argued that deviation was appropriate here because application of the guidelines would be \u201cunjust or inappropriate.\u201d Moreover, appellee\u2019s counsel noted that the father would be \u201ctaking a good deal\u201d of time off from work during the visitation period.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">The court observed that the weekly child support payment of $124.00 was established at a point when \u201cnobody knew about this six weeks,\u201d and \u201c[i]t was not something anticipated and computed into the figures.\u201d The court also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">First of all, I\u2019m not going to deviate from the guidelines in terms of recomputing the set amount of $124 per week by taking into account the six weeks that the father is going to have the child. Therefore, if the support should be recomputed to, let\u2019s say $115 a week. <em>I view this as a situation where I\u2019m not asked to deviate from, the established sum, as mandated by the guidelines. Rather, I\u2019m being asked to suspend that amount. </em>That\u2019s request number one, <em>for the six weeks, accounting from June 21 through July 26th.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-9\">And the second thing that is being asked of me, of course, is not only should that amount be suspended but that the mother should pay unto the father the same amount during that time span.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-10\">What I\u2019m going to do here is not recompute. But, if the natural father has the child for the six weeks span of time, it seems inequitable to me, it seems unjust to me, that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>should still continue paying support to the natural mother while the child is, in fact, in his custody. And that money should be expending, presumably and hopefully, for her benefit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-5\">\n<em>So I feel I\u2019m not going to use the word deviate or recompute. What I\u2019m going to say is that I feel it is equitable and just that the natural father not have to pay that support amount for those six weeks to the natural mother because the child is in his custody. And he is going to be expending monies for her benefit. Therefore, it works out to her best interest.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-6\">However, and I maybe [sic] in trouble here for being chauvinistic, I\u2019m not going to impose any support obligation to the mother. In other words, she will not be required to pay to the father the $124 per week that he is paying to the mother. She will not be receiving any support during this time nor will the natural father. I feel that that\u2019s a fatherly obligation that he should accept as a natural father.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AP-\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Thus, by order dated June 21, 1999, the court suspended appellee\u2019s child support obligation during the six week period of summer visitation. The court did not modify custody, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">We shall include additional facts in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">Appellant alleges that the trial court erred when it modified appellee\u2019s child support obligation because the father did not file a written motion as mandated by statute. She complains that the court was not entitled to modify child support based on written correspondence from counsel, as that did not constitute a \u201cmotion\u201d within the meaning of Md.Code (1999 Repl.Vol.), Family Law Article (\u201cF.L.\u201d), \u00a7 12-104(a). That section provides that the court may modify a child support order \u201csubsequent to the filing of a <em>motion </em>for modification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>and upon a showing of a material change in circumstance.\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">The submission of the letter, in lieu of a formal motion, was not necessarily an appropriate way to proceed. Nevertheless, it has long been recognized in Maryland that \u201csubstance rather than the form of the pleading is the controlling consideration.\u201d <em>Lapp v. Stanton, </em>116 Md. 197, 199, 81 A. 675 (1911) (citations omitted). Moreover, our review of the record suggests that the parties treated the letter from appellee\u2019s counsel as a motion. After appellant\u2019s counsel received a copy of the letter that had been sent to the court by appellee\u2019s counsel, appellant\u2019s counsel responded to the court in like form, without asserting an objection to the form of appellee\u2019s request for modification of child support. Had appellant\u2019s counsel raised her concern at that time, appellee\u2019s counsel undoubtedly would have filed a written motion. Moreover, in her letter, appellant\u2019s counsel asked the court to hold a hearing if the court thought it \u201cappropriate\u201d to do so. Thereafter, a hearing was scheduled. Even when the hearing was scheduled, appellant did not lodge an objection to appellee\u2019s failure to file a formal motion. Instead, it was not until the hearing itself that appellant\u2019s counsel raised an objection to the form of appellee\u2019s request, and then only \u201cfor the record.\u201d Indeed, appellant\u2019s counsel acknowledged that she was aware that the \u201cthe Court\u2019s position has always been that we should take the most expeditious route to resolve matters in an amicable fashion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Additionally, appellant does not refer us to any case that supports her assertion that, under the particular circumstances of this case, the court erred or abused its discretion by treating the letter from the father\u2019s attorney as the equivalent of a motion within the meaning of F.L. \u00a7 12-104(a). Appellant\u2019s reference to <em>Moore v. Tseronis, </em>106 Md.App. 275, 281, 664 A.2d 427 (1995), for example, is not helpful, as it merely stands for the proposition that a court may modify a child support obligation \u201c[u]pon a proper petition. ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 281, 664 A.2d 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Under the circumstances attendant here, we are satisfied that the court neither erred nor abused its discretion by addressing the child support issue on the basis of the attorneys\u2019 cross letters. Appellee\u2019s letter contained sufficient facts to give notice and inform the opposing side of the matter in controversy, including the relief appellee sought to obtain. Appellant was granted a hearing to insure that the issue was fully heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Appellant contends that the trial court erred in modifying appellee\u2019s child support obligation because appellee did not establish a material change in circumstance, nor did the court make a \u201cspecific finding of material change in circumstance.\u201d In effect, we are asked to determine whether the court\u2019s decision to suspend the child support obligation during summer visitation constituted a proper modification of appellee\u2019s child support obligation, or a proper deviation from the child support guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"akl-dedup-0\">In 1989, the Legislature enacted Maryland\u2019s Child Support Guidelines (the \u201cGuidelines\u201d) to comply with federal law and federal regulations. <em>Petrini v. Petrini, </em>336 Md. 453, 460, 648 A.2d 1016 (1994); <em>Voishan v. Palma, </em>327 Md. 318, 322, 609 A.2d 319 (1992). Unless the parents have a monthly combined adjusted income in excess of $10,000.00, use of the Guidelines is mandatory. <em>Wills v. Jones, </em>340 Md. 480, 484, 667 A.2d 331 (1995); <em>Voishan, </em>327 Md. at 331-32, 609 A.2d 319; <em>Horsley v. Radisi, </em>132 Md.App. 1, 23, 750 A.2d 692 (2000); <em>Dunlap v. Fiorenza, </em>128 Md.App. 357, 366, 738 A.2d 312, <em>cert. denied, </em>357 Md. 191, 742 A.2d 520 (1999); <em>see, e.g., Odunukwe v. Odunukwe, </em>98 Md.App. 273, 285, 633 A.2d 418 (1993). In <em>Horsley, </em>we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-8\">The Guidelines carefully prescribe how the \u201cbasic child support obligation shall be determined in accordance with the [statutory] schedule of basic child support obligations\u201d the support obligation is then divided \u201cbetween the parents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>in proportion to their adjusted actual incomes.\u201d F.L. \u00a7 12-204(a)(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-5\">In order to implement the legislative objectives, a schedule in F.L. \u00a7 12-204(e) delineates a numeric calculation of the basic child support obligation, based on the number of children involved and the combined adjusted actual income of the parents. As we noted, this sum is divided between the parents \u201cin proportion to their adjusted actual incomes.\u201d F.L. \u00a7 12-204(a)(Z); <em>see Petrini [v. Petrini], </em>336 Md. [453] at 461[, 648 A.2d 1016 (1994)]; <em>Voishan [v. Palma], </em>327 Md. [318] at 323[, 609 A.2d 319 (1992)]; <em>Reuter v. Reuter, </em>102 Md.App. 212, 235[, 649 A.2d 24] (1994).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">Once the child support obligation is ascertained, the statute permits the addition of certain expenses to the Guidelines obligation. By statute, the judge <em>shall </em>add to the basic child support obligation any work-related child care expenses, pursuant to F.L. \u00a7 12-204(g), and extraordinary medical expenses, pursuant to F.L. \u00a7 12-204(h). The court <em>may </em>also add school and transportation expenses, pursuant to F.L. \u00a7 12 \u2014 204(i). These additional expenses are allocated between the parents in proportion to their adjusted actual incomes. <em>Voishan, </em>327 Md. at 323, 609 A.2d 319; <em>Reuter, </em>102 Md.App. at 235, 649 A.2d 24.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-7\"><em>Horsley, </em>132 Md.App. at 22-23, 750 A.2d 692.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">Under F.L. \u00a7 12-202(a)(2)(i), \u201c[t]here is a rebuttable presumption that the amount of child support which would result from the application of the child support guidelines ... is the correct amount of child support to be awarded.\u201d <em>See Petrini, </em>336 Md. at 460-61, 648 A.2d 1016 (citation omitted); <em>Walsh v. Walsh, </em>333 Md. 492, 498, 635 A.2d 1340 (1994); <em>Dunlap, </em>128 Md.App. at 367, 738 A.2d 312. In order to rebut the presumption, the evidence must show that, in a particular case, \u201capplication of the guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate.... \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>F.L. \u00a7 12-202(a)(2)(ii); <em>see Petrini, </em>336 Md. at 461, 648 A.2d 1016; <em>Dunlap, </em>128 Md.App. at 366, 738 A.2d 312; <em>Reuter, </em>102 Md.App. at 235, 649 A.2d 24. To determine whether application of the Guidelines is inappropriate, the court \u201cmay\u201d consider the terms of any separation agreement, payment of college expenses, and the parental obligation to support other children in the household. <em>See </em>F.L. \u00a7 12 \u2014 202(a)(2)(iii)(l), (2). If the court finds that the application of the Guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case, F.L. \u00a7 12-202(a)(2)(iv) requires the court to make written or oral findings explaining the reasons why it has departed from the Guidelines, and \u201chow this variance serves the best interests of the child.\u201d <em>Wills, </em>340 Md. at 484, 667 A.2d 331; <em>see Walsh, </em>333 Md. at 501, 635 A.2d 1340.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">After the court sets the child support obligation, the trial court may modify the child support payment only if there is an affirmative showing of a material change in circumstances in the needs of the children or the parents\u2019 ability to provide support. <em>See Drummond v. State, </em>350 Md. 502, 509, 714 A.2d 163 (1998); <em>Wills, </em>340 Md. at 488, 667 A.2d 331; <em>Walsh, </em>333 Md. at 497-98, 635 A.2d 1340; <em>Wagner v.

The term \u201c \u2018material\u2019 limits a court\u2019s authority to situations where a change is of sufficient magnitude to justify judicial modification of the support order.\u201d <em>Wagner, </em>109 Md.App. at 43, 674 A.2d 1 (quoting <em>Wills, </em>340 Md. at 489, 667 A.2d 331) (footnotes and citations omitted). A decision regarding modification is left to the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed, unless that discretion was arbitrarily used or the court\u2019s judgment was clearly wrong. <em>Moore v. Tseronis, supra, </em>106 Md.App. at 281, 664 A.2d 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Writing for the Court in <em>Drummond, </em>Judge Cathell explained that there are \u201cvarious ways a change in circumstance could be relevant to the modification of a child support award----\u201d 350 Md. at 509, 714 A.2d 163. One of the \u201cobvious ways\u201d occurs \u201cupon the passage of some event causing the level of support a child actually receives to diminish or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>increase.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 509-10, 714 A.2d 163 (citation omitted). A change may also occur as a result of a change in the parents\u2019 \u201cincome pool.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 510, 714 A.2d 163. <em>See Walsh, supra, </em>333 Md. at 502-03, 635 A.2d 1340 (elimination of non-custodial parent\u2019s obligation to contribute to custodial parent\u2019s mortgage expense required remand to determine whether there was a substantial change in circumstance); <em>Moore, </em>106 Md. App. at 284, 664 A.2d 427 (a father\u2019s relocation to a rural area and subsequent reduction in salary resulting from the relocation constituted a material change); <em>Lieberman v. Lieberman, </em>81 Md.App. 575, 596, 568 A.2d 1157 (1990) (affirming the trial court\u2019s finding of a material change in circumstances because the father\u2019s net income rose from $200,000.00 to $386,800.00).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">In this case, the father\u2019s original support obligation of $124.00 per week was established in accordance with the Guidelines. By authorizing a six-week suspension of appellee\u2019s child support payments, appellee\u2019s total annual support obligation was reduced by $744.00. In its ruling, the court was careful to indicate that it was not deviating \u201cfrom the established sum as mandated by the guidelines.\u201d Instead, the court claimed that it was merely suspending the child support obligation during the six-week summer visitation period. In our view, regardless of the court\u2019s characterization of its action as a \u201csuspension\u201d of support, the net effect of its ruling amounted to a modification of child support, without the requisite material change of circumstances, and a deviation from the Guidelines, which did not comport with F.L. \u00a7 12-202(a)(2). We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">In concluding that no material change in circumstance was established, we observe that the record does not reveal any evidence of a change in parental income. Nor was there evidence that the needs of the child had changed. Moreover, apart from conclusory assertions, appellee did not present evidence of the extent to which his expenses would increase during the relevant period, nor did he establish the extent to which the mother\u2019s financial expenditures for the child would decrease, either in the six-week period or on an annual basis. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>Appellee\u2019s counsel contended generally that the money would be used \u201c[t]o provide more activities and things for [his daughter] to do as opposed to paying his ex-wife $124 for those six weeks when she is not even going to have visitation with the child during that time.\u201d We agree with appellant, however, that appellee\u2019s desire for \u201ca better vacation\u201d does not constitute a material change in circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Moreover, it does not necessarily follow that a custodial parent\u2019s expenditures for a child diminish significantly merely because the child has a lengthy summer visitation with the non-custodial parent. In this case, for example, there was no evidence that, during the summer visitation, the father intended to assume responsibility for the purchase of summer clothes or the school clothes that usually are needed towards the end of summer. Moreover, the mother had already paid for summer child care. In addition, other costs of the custodial parent, such as housing and utilities, are largely fixed, regardless of whether the child is physically present in the home during the visitation period.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">As we see it, the court also overlooked certain economic imperatives. Clearly, some periods of time in the life of a child are more costly for a parent than others. The reality is that all of a child\u2019s financial needs and expenses are not incurred in precise weekly increments, even though child support may be paid on that basis. Therefore, a custodial parent who anticipates receipt of a certain total sum of child support over the course of a year may budget for unusual or costly expenditures that inevitably occur during the year. For example, in a particular period, a parent may incur substantial expenses for such items as uninsured medical prescriptions, school clothes, Christmas presents, the child\u2019s birthday party, or various extracurricular activities. A responsible custodial parent who is fortunate not to live from check to check undoubtedly attempts to prepare for such times by setting funds aside during weeks when the child\u2019s expenses are less than the incoming support. Similarly, appellant may have earmarked a portion of the money she expected to receive during the summer to meet the child\u2019s various needs during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>the year. Therefore, it was erroneous for the court to conclude that appellant, the custodial parent, did not need continuing financial support merely because the child was visiting with the non-custodial parent. That the parties\u2019 daughter resided for six weeks during the summer with appellee did not diminish appellant\u2019s need for the total statutory amount of child support to which she was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">It is also significant that increased summer visitation did not result in a shared custody situation within the meaning of the Family Law Article. Even with the extended summer visitation, appellee was not entitled to the benefit of child support calculated on the basis of shared custody. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">The Guidelines provide for the calculation of child support when parents share physical custody. Sections 12 \u2014 201 (i) \u2014 (k) of the Family Law Article provide, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-7\">(i) <em>Shared Physical Custody. </em>\u2014 (1) \u201cShared physical custody\u201d means that each parent keeps the child or children overnight for more than 35% of the year and that both parents contribute to the expenses of the child or children in addition to the payment of the child support.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-8\">(2) Subject to paragraph (1) of this subsection, the court may base a child support award on shared physical custody: (i) solely on the amount of visitation awarded; and \u00a9regardless of whether joint custody has been granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-9\">(j) <em>Adjusted basic child support obligation. </em>\u2014 \u201cAdjusted basic child support obligation\u201d means an adjustment of the basic child support obligation for shared physical custody.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-10\">(k) <em>Basic child support obligation. </em>\u2014 \u201cBasic child support obligation\u201d means the base amount due for child support based on the combined adjusted actual incomes of both parents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">In this case, the extended summer visitation did not result in the child spending at least 35 percent of the year with appellee. The parties agreed at oral argument that, inclusive of the six-week summer visitation, the child would spend a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>total of 88 nights with appellee during the year. As appellee clearly did not have physical custody of the child at least 35 percent of the time, he was not entitled to the calculation of child support on a shared custody basis. Accordingly, a modification of child support on that basis was not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">To be sure, almost half of the father\u2019s total yearly visitation was to occur in the summer. Although almost half of appel-lee\u2019s total visitation occurred during 42 consecutive days, this does not alter our analysis. Whether a parent has visitation for 88 days spread throughout the year or, instead, during 88 consecutive days, the bottom line is the same: the parent only has 88 days of visitation. As appellee only had physical custody of the child for 88 nights, he fell well short of the 128 overnights required by statute to qualify for calculation of support on a shared custody basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">In this case, the court decreased appellee\u2019s child support obligation by suspending his obligation to pay support during the six week period in the summer when he had physical custody of his daughter. Therefore, the court modified child support and deviated from the Guidelines. On the basis of the \u25a0 record before the trial court, we conclude that the trial court erred in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.
