On appeal, we are presented with the following questions, which we slightly rephrased for clarity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">I. Did the trial court err when it found that the Baltimore City Deferred Loan was a lien of prior encumbrance that triggered the restrictions of the Maryland Secondary Mortgage Loan Act?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">II. Did the trial court err when it held that the borrower\u2019s claims were not preempted by federal law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-10\">III. Did the trial court err when it stripped real estate taxes and other non-interest charges from the loan?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-11\">TV. Did the trial court err when it permitted the borrower to repay the stripped loan over 30 years instead of the schedule contained in the loan\u2019s note?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">We shall answer appellants\u2019 first question in the affirmative, and reverse the judgment of the circuit court. Consequently, we need not consider appellants\u2019 remaining questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-13\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b387-14\">Ms. Pence resides at 1231 Anglesea Street, Baltimore, Maryland, the core of the dispute presently before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-15\">In October of 1984, Ms. Pence entered into a loan agreement with the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore (the City) for a loan of $6265.00 (the City loan). The City loan was titled as a \u201cmortgage,\u201d and on 21 December 1984, was recorded among the land records for Baltimore City. The City made such loans to qualified homeowners as part of the City\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>program to rehabilitate its housing. Under the loan\u2019s terms, Ms. Pence agreed to subject her property to a rehabilitation easement and to the claims of the City. In addition, Ms. Pence was required to repay the City loan, together with interest at 3 per cent per annum, only if Ms. Pence transferred, sold, assigned, or abandoned the property, or if Ms. Pence ceased to own it because of death, condemnation, operation of law or otherwise. The City loan also contained a provision that would enable Ms. Pence\u2019s heirs to assume the loan upon meeting certain conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Sometime in October of 1991, Ms. Pence and her daughter obtained a loan of $30,002.55 from Banker\u2019s First Mortgage, secured by a mortgage on 1231 Anglesea Street (The Banker\u2019s First Mortgage). The loan was brokered by Maryland Financial Resources, Inc. (MFR), and was subsequently assigned to Commercial Credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">In September of 1994, MFR persuaded Ms. Pence and her daughter to refinance the Banker\u2019s First Mortgage with a $38,500.00 loan from First Savings Bank FSB, secured by a mortgage on 1231 Anglesea Street (the FSB mortgage). This loan was originated by MFR, and at settlement, MFR charged Ms. Pence and her daughter a $1540 loan origination fee and a $700 loan discount.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Ms. Pence made monthly payments until September of 1996, when she ceased making payments. Ms. Pence apparently had become disabled in August of 1996 and was no longer employed. Although she eventually received disability benefits, she was still unable to meet her monthly mortgage payment. Consequently, Ms. Pence was warned that the FSB mortgage would be foreclosed if her payments were not made current. Ms. Pence subsequently filed a complaint in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Circuit Court for Baltimore City, claiming the FSB mortgage violated Md.Code (1975, 1990 Repl.Vol., 1999 Cum.Supp.) \u00a7\u00a7 12-401 \u2014 12\u2014415 of the Com. Law II Article (CL), the Maryland Secondary Mortgage Loan Law (SMLL).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">In January of 1998, appellants responded with a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment. After considering oral argument, the motion was denied, and the City loan was declared to be a lien of prior encumbrance. In July of 1998, appellants again filed a motion for partial summary judgment, seeking to limit certain issues, and to dismiss Access as a defendant. The motion was denied without a hearing. In December of 1998, Ms. Pence filed a motion for partial summary judgment. The motion was granted, and final judgment was entered on 13 January 1999. Appellants\u2019 motion to alter or amend was denied, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">\u201cThe standard of appellate review of a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion for summary judgment is whether the trial court was \u2018legally correct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pittman v. Atlantic Realty Co., </em>127 Md.App. 255, 269, 732 A.2d 912, <em>cert. granted, </em>356 Md. 495, 740 A.2d 613 (1999); <em>Heat &amp; Power Corp. v. Air Prods. &amp; Chems., Inc., </em>320 Md. 584, 591, 578 A.2d 1202 (1990). \u201cIn making our analysis, we do not accord deference to the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions.\u201d <em>Lopata v. Miller, </em>122 Md.App. 76, 83, 712 A.2d 24, <em>cert. denied, </em>351 Md. 286, 718 A.2d 234 (1998). \u201c[A] grant of summary judgment is appropriate only when the movant for summary judgment clearly demonstrates the absence of any genuine issue of material fact, and demonstrates that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Pittman </em>at 269, 732 A.2d 912. \u201cIn ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the court must consider the motion and response submitted by the parties in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 270, 732 A.2d 912.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">\u201cIt is ... clear that under Maryland\u2019s summary judgment rule a trial court determines issues of law; it makes rulings as a matter of law, resolving no disputed issues of fact.\u201d <em>Beatty </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number><em>v. Trailmaster Products, Inc., </em>330 Md. 726, 737, 625 A.2d 1005 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Trial courts must be mindful that, \u201c[e]ven where the underlying facts are undisputed, if the undisputed facts are susceptible of more than one permissible factual inference, the choice between those inferences should not be made as a matter of law, and summary judgment should not be granted.\u201d <em>Heat &amp; Power Corp. </em>at 591, 578 A.2d 1202. \u201c[W]hen the moving party has set forth sufficient grounds for summary judgment, the opposing party must show with some precision that there is a genuine dispute as to a material fact.\u201d <em>King v. Bankerd, </em>303 Md. 98, 112, 492 A.2d 608 (1985). \u201cA material fact is a fact the resolution of which will somehow affect the outcome of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 111, 492 A.2d 608. The party opposing the motion bears the burden of showing that material facts are in dispute. <em>Beatty </em>at 737, 625 A.2d 1005. \u201c[T]he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of .the [opposing party\u2019s] claim is insufficient to preclude the grant of summary judgment; there must be evidence upon which the jury could reasonably find for the [opposing party].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 738-39, 625 A.2d 1005.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">As we believe the facts before us are undisputed, our task is to determine whether the trial court was legally correct in granting Ms. Pence\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Appellants contend the trial court erred in determining that the City loan was a lien of prior encumbrance, thus subjecting the FSB mortgage to the SMLL.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">Under the SMLL, a loan secured by a mortgage becomes a \u201csecondary mortgage loan\u201d, subject to the provisions of the SMLL, only if the property securing the loan \u201c[i]s subject to the lien of one or more prior encumbrances.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>of Appeals noted in <em>Chevy Chase Bank, FSB v. Chaires, </em>350 Md. 716, 724 n. 3, 715 A.2d 199 (1998), a lien is defined by the SMLL only by way of inclusion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Consequently, we must determine whether the trial court was legally correct in concluding that the City loan was a lien of prior encumbrance. As we shall explain, we believe that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Ms. Pence asserts a number of grounds for her claim that the City loan constitutes a lien. She first contends the City loan is a mortgage because it is titled as a mortgage, and is recorded among the land records of Baltimore City as a mortgage. We disagree. Although the City loan is recorded among the land records of Baltimore City as a \u201cMortgage from June Lila Pence,\u201d it is clear that it is not a mortgage. The loan simply does not meet the definition of a mortgage. A loan is secured by a mortgage when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">the property is conveyed or assigned by the mortgagor to the mortgagee, in form like that of an absolute legal conveyance, but subject to a proviso or condition by which the conveyance is to become void, or the estate is to be recon-veyed, upon payment to the mortgagee of the principal sum secured, with interest, on a day certain; and upon nonperformance of \u00abthis condition, the mortgagee\u2019s conditional estate becomes absolute at law, and he may take possession thereof, but it remains redeemable in equity during a cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>tain period under the rules imposed by Courts of Equity, or by statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><em>Equitable Trust Co. v. Imbesi, </em>287 Md. 249, 253-54, 412 A.2d 96 (1980)(quoting <em>Bank of Commerce v. Lanahan, </em>45 Md. 396 (1876)). Here, as Ms. Pence neither conveyed nor assigned her property to the City, the City possessed no conditional estate that would become absolute at law, and upon default, permitted the City to take possession of the property in order to satisfy Ms. Pence\u2019s obligation to the City. Furthermore, the City loan lacks a day certain on which it is to become due; instead, the City loan would become due only upon the sale or transfer of the property. Accordingly, despite Ms. Pence\u2019s attempts to characterize it as such, we conclude that the City loan does not constitute a mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Ms. Pence also contends that, even if the City loan is not a formal mortgage, it is at least an equitable mortgage. The Court of Appeals has characterized an equitable mortgage as arising when</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">a party makes a mortgage, or affects to make one, but it proves to be defective, by reason of some informality or omission, such as failure to record in due time, defective acknowledgment, or the like, though even by the omission of the mortgagee himself, as the instrumentas at least evidence of an agreement to convey, the conscience of the mortgagor is bound, and it will be enforced by a court of equity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-7\"><em>Imbesi, </em>287 Md. at 254, 412 A.2d 96 (quoting <em>LeBrun v. Prosise, </em>197 Md. 466, 477, 79 A.2d 543 (1951))(in turn quoting <em>Dyson v. Simmons, </em>48 Md. 207, 214 (1878)). To the contrary, Ms. Pence\u2019s equitable mortgage claim fails for precisely the same reason as did her claim that the City loan constitutes a mortgage. As we have said, the City loan contains no agreement by Ms. Pence to convey her property to the City as security for the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Next, Ms. Pence claims the City loan at least creates an equitable lien. Equitable liens have been held to arise in Maryland \u201cunder circumstances other than ... some defect in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>a mortgage or deed of trust.\u201d <em>Imbesi </em>at 255-56, 412 A.2d 96. The Court of Appeals has said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\">An equitable lien is based on specific enforcement of a contract to assign property as security. The contract need not stipulate for the lien in express terms; it is enough if that is the fair and reasonable implication of the terms employed. A mere promise to pay a debt or obligation does not of itself, however, create a lien unless the intention to create it is apparent from the instrument and circumstances leading to it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-6\"><em>Keyworth v. Israelson, </em>240 Md. 289, 305, 214 A.2d 168 (1965). According to Ms. Pence, she and the City intended that Ms. Pence would assign her property to the City as security for the City loan, and directs our attention to the following provision from the loan agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\">Whereas, the Owner is willing to subject the Property to a rehabilitative easement and to the claim of the City for the repayment of the Loan pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">(Emphasis added.) As Ms. Pence sees it, the highlighted language creates at least an equitable lien and therefore a \u201clien of prior encumbrance.\u201d Again, we do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">To be sure, we recognize that it is not necessary for the agreement to contain the word \u201clien\u201d in order to create an equitable lien. \u201cThe modern conception of a lien is that it is a right given by contract, statute or rule of law to have a debt or charge satisfied out of a particular property.\u201d <em>Chaires, </em>350 Md. at 731, 715 A.2d 199 (quoting 3 Am. Law of Property \u00a7 1320, at 537 n. 4 (A.J. Casner ed.1952)). We are not convinced, however, that the parties intended for 1231 Angle-sea Street to serve as security for the City loan. In the first place, Ms. Pence did not convey the property to the City as security for repayment of the loan, nor does the agreement provide for a power of sale, authorizing the City to sell the property upon Ms. Pence\u2019s default. In fact, it is far from clear what the City\u2019s recourse would be if the City loan were ever in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>default, or even if default could occur.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In Ms. Pence\u2019s agreement with the City, the agreement provides that the City could \u201ctake whatever action at Law [sic] or in equity as may appear necessary or desirable to enforce any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Owner under this Agreement.\u201d Under this provision, we assume that the City could file an action against Ms. Pence personally to satisfy the debt. \u201c[I]t would appear that ... for an equitable lien to exist a specific intent to create a lien must be made manifest....\u201d <em>Imbesi, supra </em>at 260, 412 A.2d 96. This leads us to conclude that the City loan did not create a mortgage, nor did it create an equitable lien. It is not manifest from the agreement that the parties intended for 1231 Anglesea Street to serve as security for the City loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Finally, Ms. Pence correctly asserts that her residence is encumbered by a rehabilitative easement. As appellants point out, however, \u201cthere are many encumbrances, such as easements, that are not liens.\u201d <em>Manor Real Estate Co. v. Joseph M. Zamoiski Co., </em>251 Md. 120, 125, 246 A.2d 240 (1968). The <em>Zamoiski </em>Court quoted with approval the comment of the trial judge that \u201ca lien is always an encumbrance, but an encumbrance need not necessarily be a lien.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, although Ms. Pence\u2019s residence is indeed encumbered by a rehabilitative easement, pursuant to the requirements of CL \u00a7 12 \u2014 401(i)(i), in order for the FSB mortgage to be considered a secondary mortgage, 1231 Anglesea Street must be subject to a lien, not just an encumbrance, and a rehabilitative easement is not a lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Therefore, we conclude that the trial court erred in determining that the City loan constituted a hen of prior encumbrance. Accordingly, the FSB mortgage is not subject to the provisions of the SMLL.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>JUDGMENT REVERSED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b388-8\">. The FSB mortgage ultimately became a part of a package of \u201csecuri-tized\u201d [sic] loans that were owned and serviced by Access. Norwest Bank was the trustee for the securities that were backed by the packaged \"securitized\u201d [sic] loans. The FSB mortgage is presently being serviced by Ocwen Financial, F.S.B.

As we have previously noted, the City loan became due and payable only if the property was transferred, sold, assigned, or abandoned, or if Ms. Pence ceased to own the property. In addition, the City loan could be assumed by Ms. Pence\u2019s heirs if they met certain requirements. Thus, at least in theory, the City loan may never become due.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
