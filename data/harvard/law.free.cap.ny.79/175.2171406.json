A commission was issued on behalf of \u25a0 defendant, to take the testimony of the person who plaintiff alleged forged the release, as to the alleged settlement. Plaintiff after a cross-interrogatory calling for the salary paid to the witness, proposed others, asking the amount of the witness\u2019 expenses per annum, whether he left the place by day or night, by whom he was accompanied, and where he stopped ; also, as to the amount of the debts he left unpaid ; whether before ho loft he purchased an India shawl, and at what price, and whether he borrowed money of certain persons specified.

One of the defenses was that defendant settled With the mother of plaintiff, who was the owner of the premises, at the time of the alleged injuries, and received from said owner a written release of said damages. 'This release, plaintiff claimed, was forged by one Do Pfuhl, who was, at the time, a clerk in defendant\u2019s office, in Albany, and who, subsequently, left that city and went to Chicago. A commission was issued, on behalf of defendant, to take the testimony of said Do Pfuhl. The interrogatories were as to the settlement, and the execution of the release.

Parker, </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AU6\">The proper time to exclude a question, on the ground that it is not competent or relevant, is Avhon it is proposed to read the deposition in evidence at the trial. It cannot be done on the settling of the interrogatories. (Code of Civil Procedure, \u00a7 911; 2 R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>S. [6th ed.], vol. 3, 656, \u00a7 23; <em>Ocean Ins. Co. </em>v. Francis, 2 Wend., 65; 4 M. &amp; Selw., 502; Revisers\u2019 Notes, 3 R. S., 735 [2d ed.].) The officer settling the interrogatories has no power or authority to reject an interrogatory, because it is loading, the party being allowed to make this objection on the trial. (2 Wait\u2019s Pr., 696; <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Hallenbeck, </em>7 Barb., 271; <em>Williams </em>v. Eldredge, 1 Hill, 249; 2 R. S. [5th ed.], vol. 3, 394, \u00a7 15, 675.) It was competent to ask the witness whether he had been arrested and imprisoned, and for what alleged offenses. <em>(Real </em>v. People, 42 N. Y., 270; <em>Brandon </em>v. <em>People, </em>42 id., 265; <em>Connor's Case, </em>50 id., 240; 8 Hun, 562.) The order was appealable. (Code of Civil Procedure, \u00a7\u00a7 1347, 1348.) By section fifty of the Code of Procedure any party affected by an order may enter it with the clerk to enable the party to appeal under section forty-nine. <em>(Nicholson </em>v. <em>Demham, </em>1 Code R., 119; <em>Savage </em>v. <em>Relyea, </em>3 How. Pr., 276; <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Wallis, </em>6 Paige, 371; <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Belden, </em>4 id., 140; 4 Wait\u2019s Pr., 606.) A motion to set aside any proceeding for irregularity' must be made promptly and before the moving party takes any other step in the cause. <em>(Lord </em>v. <em>Graydon, </em>14 Alb. R. R., 444; <em>Persse </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>id., 119; <em>Strong </em>v. <em>Strong, </em>1 Abb. [N. S.], 242; 4 Wait\u2019s Pr., 634-635; <em>Mayer </em>v. Lyons, 2 How. Pr., 280; 1 Daly, 297.) If plaintiff was irregular in entering the order, the defendant\u2019s remedy is not to move to dismiss the appeal, but it would be to move at Special Term to set the order aside. <em>(Bedell </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>3 Code R., 61; <em>Keley </em>v. <em>Thayer, </em>34 How., 163; 4 Wait\u2019s Pr., 236.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b200-4\"><em>Samuel Hand, </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARv\">The interrogatories to be annexed to a commission, if not settled by consent, must be settled by a judge of the court or a county judge. (Code Civil Procedure, \u00a7 891.) It is the duty of the judge to allow either party to insert therein any question pertinent to the issue, which he proposes. (Code Civil Procedure, \u00a7 892.) The question asked the witness on cross-examination as to how many times he had been arrested or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>imprisoned, and as to offenses with which he had been charged, was incompetent. <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>People, </em>8 Hun, 562; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Osborn, 2 </em>Wend., 555; <em>Lipe </em>v. <em>Eisenlerd, </em>32 N. Y., 229, 238; <em>People v. Brown, </em>72 id., 571.) All these questions on cross-examination were in tho discretion of the judge. <em>(Gt. W. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Loomis, </em>32 N. Y., 127; <em>King </em>v. <em>N. Y. C. R. R. Co., </em>72 id., 607.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b201-4\">Earl, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AhH\">Precisely what tho powers of a judge in settling interrogatories to be annexed to a commission are, has not been much considered in reported cases. It is provided in the Code, as it was in the Revised Statutes, that the interrogatories are to bo settled by a judge upon notice. (\u00a7\u00a7 891, 892.) I believe it has been generally understood that the judge has some power to determine what interrogatories may be annexed to the commission, and the form of them. If lie has not such power, then the requirement that the interrogatories \u201c must he settled \u201d has little or no significance ; and if he has no power to decide anything, there certainly can be no reason for troubling him about the matter. <em>(MacDonald </em>v. <em>Garrison, </em>9 Abb. Pr., 178.)</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">The statute provides that either party must he allowed to insert \u201c any question, pertinent to the issue, which he proposes.\u201d That right the judge cannot deny or curtail. Every such question he must allow. Rut he must have authority to disallow questions not pertinent to the issue, and hence to determine whether a proposed question is pertinent or not But as he cannot always foresee precisely what evidence the exigencies of the trial may render proper, and as the statute reserves the right to either party to make at the trial any objection to questions or answers which he could make if the witnesses were testifying there orally, the power to exclude questions should be sparingly exercised. But if questions clearly impertinent or incompetent or immaterial are proposed, he should refuse to allow them ; otherwise the appearance of the parties before him would be an idle ceremony.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>The Code provides that either party may insert any question \u201c pertinent to the issue.\u201d The Revised Statutes provided that either party might insert any question \u201c pertinent to the cause.\u201d (2 R. S., 394.) Both phrases clearly have the same meaning. It was undoubtedly intended that either party should have the right to put every question to a witness by commission which he could put to the witness if he were examined orally at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">The question upon plaintiff\u2019s appeal is whether the judge erred in disallowing the fourth, sixth and eighth cross-luterrogdtories.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The action is to recover certain damages. The defense is that the defendant had settled for the damages, by the payment of $500, and obtained a written release. The plaintiff claims that the release is a forgery, and that the forgery was committed by the witness to be examined, and that if the defendant paid the money, it was taken and kept by the witness. The character and credit of the witness are, therefore, of great importance, and competent evidence, showing what they are, quite material. Questions may, therefore, be put to him, upon his cross-examination, tending to discredit or disgrace him generally ; and he may also be questioned as to his conduct and acts about the time of the alleged forgery, with the view of showing his guilt. Such evidence need not be of a conclusive nature. It is competent if it throws light upon the principal fact to be proved, and if, with other evidence, it would tend to prove that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Suppose it could be shown by the cross-examination of this witness that, at the time of the date of the alleged release he was living upon his salary, and that his family expenses were as much as his salary, or more ; that immediately after this transaction he quit the service of the defendant and left Albany in the night time, leaving his family behind him ; that he left alone, or iii disreputable company; that upon his route to his destination he traveled and behaved in a suspicious or discreditable manner; that just before leaving, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>and in close proximity to this transaction, he created debts, by borrowing money or otherwise, for the purpose of filling his pockets before his departure; that he purchased for his wife an India shawl for just $500, or near that sum, having no honest means wherewith to make the purchase; would mot questions to elicit such facts be competent ? I think they would; and such facts' might have been elicited by these cross questions. The questions were, therefore, pertinent; and being so, the judge could not rightfully exclude them. It was not for him to determine that the questions might not elicit the facts sought, or that the facts would not be very important if elicited. The plaintiff had the statutory right to the questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">It is true that a judge at the trial generally has a discretion as to the extent to which he will permit a cross-examination, for the purpose of merely testing the credit of a witness, and upon matters collateral to the main issue on trial, to be carried ; and the exercise of such discretion, unless- clearly abused, will not be interfered with by a court sitting in review of the trial. That is a discretion to be exercised by the judge presiding at the trial; and in exercising it, he has before him, for his guidance, the appearance of the witness, if orally examined, the evidence he has given upon his direct examination, and all the facts of the case as they then appear; and he is thus able to judge whether a further cross-examination will aid the ends of justice. But a judge in settling interrogatories has no such discretion. He cannot tell what the exigencies of the trial may be, and he cannot determine how far a cross-examination may be required to be carried, nor precisely what facts will become important. He must, therefore, insert all pertinent questions, although a judge sitting at the trial might, in the exercise of his discretion, there exclude them.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">But it is claimed by the learned counsel for the defendant that the plaintiff\u2019s remedy, if any, for the exclusion of his questions was by mandamus to compel their allowance, and not by appeal to the General Term. Without denying that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>the plaintiff might have a remedy by mandamus, I hava no doubt that he could appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">The decision of the judge in settling the interrogatories was required to be in writing and such decision is an order in the action. (Code, \u00a7. 767.) In this case, an order was draAvn up satisfactory to the attorney for both parties and Avas by consent entered in the clerk\u2019s office. So far' as it disalloAved plaintiff\u2019s pertinent questions, it affected a substantial right and was, therefore, appealable under sections 1347 and 1348 of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The General Term did not err in deciding that the ninth cross question should be annexed to the commission. Such questions have frequently been decided competent. An appeal, hoAvever, should not be allowed because an improper question has been ordered to be annexed to a commission <em>-T </em>because it affects no substantial right, as the party can make the objection at the trial and be fully protected there.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Briefly, to some extent, restating my views, I say if the judge, in settling interrogatories to be annexed to a commission, disalloAVS a pertinent question, he commits an error which will be corrected upon appeal, unless it can bo seen that the error can do no harm to the party who complains of it. If he alloAVS an improper question, there is no right of appeal, as such allowance does no substantial harm, the \u25a0party objecting to the question being able to protect himself at the trial by objections there made.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">\u2022 The order of the General Term, so far as the defendant has appealed therefrom, must be. affirmed, without costs to either party upon the appeal to this court, and so far as the pin,inti ft* has appealed therefrom, must be reversed ; and the fourth, sixth and eighth cross-interrogatories must be alloAAed and annexed to the commission; and upon her appeal, the plaintiff must recover costs of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">All concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">Ordered accordingly.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b204-10\"> The remittitur was upon subsequent motion amended so as to give plaintiff costs against the defendant on her appeal to the General Term, and to this courts</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
