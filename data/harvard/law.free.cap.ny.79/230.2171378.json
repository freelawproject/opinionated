Previous to obtaining the insurance R. had discounted drafts, drawn by B. &amp; Co. upon him, receiving as security warehouse receipts of specified quantities of wheat in said elevator. After a loss B. &amp; Co. assigned the certificates to R. In an action thereon defendant set up, as a defense, a breach of said condition. The case on appeal did not contain the evidence, hut simply stated that certain facts were proved. There was no suggestion therein \u25a0as to whether or not any representations were made by B. &amp; Co., as to the nature of their interest, no request to find, and no findings upon that subject; the only exceptions were to the findings as made. The -court, by whom the cause was tried, found that all the conditions of the policy had been duly kept and performed. The General Term reversed the judgment on the ground that there was a breach of this ' condition. <em>Held, </em>error; that it did not appear from the hill of exceptions, that this question was litigated upon the trial, and there was no exception enabling the court to consider it on appeal; that the burden of proving a breach of the condition was upon defendant; that if B. &amp; Co., when the insurance was procured, informed 0. of the nature of their interest, and he omitted to describe it in the policy, defendant would he deemed to have waived the condition, and it conld not he assumed that this was not done.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b252-9\">It was claimed by defendant that B. &amp; Co. had, prior to the insurance, issued warehouse receipts, covering a larger quantity of wheat than there was at the time of the insurance in the elevator, and that they had therefore no insurable interest. No fraud was claimed, and it appeared that the whole insurance was less than the value of the wheat in the elevator. The case stated that it was proved that B. &amp; Co. were the owners of the wheat, and it was so found. <em>Held, </em>that assuming B. &amp; Co. had parted with the title to the wheat by force of warehouse receipts, before the receipts, to R. were executed, they occupied at least the position of warehousemen, and so had an insurable interest; but that the finding of ownership could not be questioned here.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b252-10\">The policy contained a provision avoiding it, in case the assured had at the time of insurance, or thereafter made, other insurance without the consent of the company written thereon. There was, at the time the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>insurance in question was effected, other insurance, which was not consented to in writing. It appeared that the other insurances were effected through 0., and were known to him to be in existence when the insurance in question was made. <em>Held, </em>that, under the circumstances, the issuing of the insurance by 0., without noting a written consent to the other insurance, was a waiver of the provision, binding upon the defendant.</headnotes>\n<history data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b253-6\"><em>Richmond </em>v.

M. Berry <em>&amp; </em>Co. of that place, insuring them against loss by fire on wheat in the Northwestern Agency in that city.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-10\">The facts found by the court are substantially as follows : At and prior to, May 25, 1866, William M. Berry <em>&amp; </em>Co. had in their possession a building known as the Northwestern Elevator, in said city, which they used for the purpose of receiving, storing and transferring grain. At the time of effecting the insurance in question they were the owners, and had in store in said elevator, 15,811 bushels of wheat, of the aggregate value of $26,878.70. On the 14th day of June, 1864, the defendant, the Niagara Fire Insurance Company, and three other insurance corporations, each acting and contracting for itself, issued an open policy of insurance for indorsements, known as an underwriters\u2019 policy, to A. C. Osborn of said city of Oshkosh, whereby, in consideration of one-fourth part of the respective sums to be specified as premiums, and indorsed thereon, they did each insure the said Osborn for account of the respective persons therein referred to as entitled to the benefit of said policy \u25a0against loss or damage by fire to the amount of one-fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>part of the respective sums, which should be indorsed upon, said policy, upon such produce and other merchandise in the-vicinity of Oshkosh, as should be specified thereon, and in. the certificates issued thereunder, for the benefit of the. respective persons whose names should be written thereon,, and to whom a certificate, authenticated by the general agent of said companies, specifying the name of the person insured,, the amount and period of such insurance, the premium therefor, the goods insured and the place of their location, signed, by the said Osborn, should be issued and delivered by him. simultaneous with the indorsements of the risk upon such, policy, in and by which they should be permitted to come in under, said policy. On May 19, 1866, Berry &amp; Co. applied, to Osborn for insurance on wheat belonging to them in. said elevator to the amount of $3,000 ; loss, if any, payable, to whom it might concern ; and thereupon Osborn indorsed upon said policy the insurance asked for, and at the same-time issued and delivered a certificate for the amount, in. which certificate it was written that the loss, if any, should, be payable to whom it might concern. On May 23, 1866,. Berry &amp; Co. applied to Osborn for a further insurance on $2,000 on wheat in said elevator; loss, if any, payable to. Dean Richmond ; and thereupon Osborn indorsed upon said, policy of insurance the sum so applied for, and issued and delivered a certificate of insurance as so applied for. Said Richmond, on the 12th of May, 1866, loaned to Berry <em>&amp; </em>Co. $3,000; and, as security therefor, they issued to-him a warehouse receipt for wheat in said elevator, as follows :.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-6\">\u201c Northwestern Elevator, )</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-7\">\u201c Oshkosh, <em>May </em>12, 1866. )</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-8\">\u201c Received in store from Dean Richmond, twenty-five hundred bushels of wheat, subject to the order of Dean Richmond, upon the surrender of this receipt, loss by fire and heating at owner\u2019s risk.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-9\">\u201c 2,500 bushels.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-10\">\u201c [Signed]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-11\">WM.

Richmond, did not, in fact,* supply the wheat mentioned in the receipt, nor was there any bargain and sale of the wheat to-Richmond as buyer ; but it was understood and intended between Berry <em>&amp; </em>Co. and Richmond that he held it as-security for the money advanced. At the time the receipts were issued Berry &amp; Co. had wheat in said elevator in excess of the amounts mentioned in the receipts issued to Richmond, which was in no manner separated from the bulk of wheat, which they had in store. - On the 25th of May, 1866, aforesaid, the elevator, together with the wheat contained therein, was destroyed by fire.

They were in no sense mortgagors, either with or without an equity of redemption, and having attorned as bailees to Richmond, who had possession, they had not even a leviable interest on execution. <em>(Parshall </em>v. <em>Egert, </em>54 N.

Where a policy is made in the name of an agent to insure another named, none but the person named can prove an insurable interest. <em>(Russell </em>v. <em>N. Y. M. Ins. Co., </em>4 Mass., 82; <em>Graves </em>v. <em>Boston M. Ins. Co., </em>2 Cranch., 213.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b257-7\">Andrews, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Axf\">The General Term reversed the judgment -of the trial court on the ground that there was a breach of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>condition in the policy which declares that \u201c if the interest of the insured in the property be any other than the entire, unconditional and sole ownership of the property for the use and benefit of the assured, it must be so represented to the company and so expressed in the written part of this policy, otherwise the policy shall be void. \u201d The decision of the General Term proceeds upon the ground that the delivery by Berry <em>&amp; </em>Co., to Richmond of the two warehouse receipts, prior to the execution of the contracts of insurance operated to divest the former of the legal title to the wheat embraced therein and to transfer it to the latter as a security in the nature of a pledge or mortgage, leaving in Berry <em>&amp; </em>Co. the equitable right of redemption only on repayment to Richmond of the money advanced by him, and that the interest-remaining in Berry <em>&amp; </em>Co. was not therefore the entire, unconditional and sole ownership of the wheat within the meaning of the condition. This qualified interest of Berry &amp; Co. was not expressed in the policy and the General Term in coming to-the conclusion reached by it, assumes that the nature of the interest of Berry <em>&amp; </em>Co. in the wheat was not represented to-the insurers when the contracts of insurance were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">It is claimed by the plaintiff that the interest of Berry &amp; Co. in the wheat, transferred to Richmond as security merely, was an entire, unconditional and sole ownership within the meaning of the condition in question, and the case of <em>Manhattan Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Weill </em>(28 Gratt. [Va.], 389) is cited in support of the view. But it is unnecessary to pass upon this-question in this case as we are of opinion that it does not. appear from the bill of exceptions that the question upon, which the General Term decided the case was litigated upon the trial, or any exception taken which enables the court to-consider it upon appeal. One of the defenses in the answer-presents this defense. But it does not appear from the: evidence, findings or exceptions, that it was alluded to-on the trial. The case was tried by the court, without-a jury. The judge made specific findings of fact and. law. The case as settled does not contain the evidence: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>in full, but recites that certain facts were proved. There is no suggestion whether or not any proof was made of representations by Berry <em>&amp; </em>Co. as to the nature of their interest, no request to find upon that subject and no finding, and the only exceptions which appear in the case are to the findings of fact and law made by the court. Upon this state of the record the question upon which the court below decided the case, was not, we think, before it. It is quite consistent with the case as presented that Berry <em>&amp; </em>Co. disclosed to the company when the insurance was effected the exact nature of their interest. The underwriter\u2019s policy, upon which the insurance was indorsed, does not contain any reference to or description of the interest or title of Berry <em>&amp; </em>Co. in the wheat. If the insured when the insurance was procured informed Osborn, who was the general agent of the underwriters, of the nature of their interest, and he omitted to describe it in the policy but delivered the certificates to Berry &amp; Co. without having made such entry, the companies would, in accordance with numerous authorities, be deemed to have waived the condition requiring that the interest of the assured, if not an entire, unconditional and sole ownership should be expressed in the policy. <em>(Trustees, etc., </em>v. <em>Brooklyn Fire Ins. Co., </em>19 N. Y., 305; <em>Sheldon </em>v. <em>Atlantic Ins. Co., </em>26 id., 460; <em>Pitney </em>v. <em>Glen\u2019s Falls Ins. Co., </em>65 id., 6; <em>Van Schoick </em>v. <em>Niagara Ins. Co., </em>68 id., 434.) The burden of proving a breach of the condition was upon the defendant. It cannot be assumed that Berry &amp; Co. did not correctly represent the nature of their title in the absence of any proof on the subject, and especially in view of the finding of the judge on the trial that the insured had duly kept and performed all the conditions of the policy on their part.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">But other grounds are insisted upon, as justifying the reversal of the original judgment. It is claimed that Berry <em>&amp; </em>Co. had no insurable interest in the wheat in the elevator. This point proceeds upon the assumption that the insured had, prior to the insurance in question, issued warehouse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>receipts covering a larger amount of grain than was in the elevator when $he insurance was effected, and that their title to the wheat having passed to the holders of the receipts they had no interest left, which was the subject of insurance. The defendant did not claim on the trial that there was any fraud on the part of Berry <em>&amp; </em>Co. which avoided the insurance. It also appears that the whole insurance on the wheat in the elevator was less than its value. Assuming that Berry &amp; Co. had parted with the legal title to the wheat by force of warehouse receipts issued by them before the receipts to Richmond were executed, and that the latt\u00e9i therefore acquired no interest in any of the wheat in the elevator by virtue of the receipts issued to him, it would not follow that. Berry &amp; Co. had no insurable interest in the property. They occupied at least the position of warehousemen, in possession of the wheat, and; as bailees, had duties in respect to the care and custody of the property, and an interest vdiieh was. the subject of insurance. (1 Phillips on Insurance, \u00a7 191.) The insurance was not on wheat owned by Richmond, so that if he owned none, there would have been no insurable subject, but was on wheat in bulk, in the elevator, without my specification of the persons in whom the title was vested. But there is another answer to the objection we are now considering. There is no finding that Berry <em>&amp; </em>Co. were not the owners of the wheat in the elevator when the insurance was effected. On the contrary the case states that it was proved that Berry &amp; Co. were the owners and the finding is that they were such owners, and there is no finding that any receipts had been issued except those issued to Richmond. The defendant did not request any finding in respect to other receipts issued by Berry &amp; Co. and, if we look into the evidence, it does not appear that the other receipts referred to related to the wheat in the elevator at the time of the insurance. But it is sufficient to say that the finding of ownership is supported by the evidence and cannot be questioned in this court, and the point that Berry &amp; Co. had no insurable interest in the property cannot be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>There was, at the time the insurance in question was effected, other insurance on the property which was not consented to in writing by the underwriters on the policy, and it is claimed that this avoids the policy, under the-provision contained therein that it should be void \u201c if the assured shall have, or shall hereafter make any other insurance on the property hereby insured, or any part thereof, without the consent of the company written, hereon.\u201d It was proved and found that Osborn was the general agent at Oshkosh of the defendant and other companies which issued the open, or underwriter\u2019s policy, under which, by indorsements thereon and certificates issued,, insurance was to be effected in favor of persons applying for insurance to the agent in whose name the policy was issued. It also appears that the other insurances mentioned were effected through Osborn as agent for the companies issuing the policies and were known to him to be in existence when the insurance in question was made. Under these circumstances, the issuing by Osborn of the policies sued upon without noting thereon the written consent of the defendant to the other insurance, was a plain waiver by him, binding the defendant, of the provision in question, under the authorities already cited. This case is much stronger than many of the cases where companies have been held to have waived conditions. Here the agent was the person named as the insured in the body of the open policy. It was clearly contemplated that he was to retain the custody of the instrument and create insurances in favor of third persons by issuing certificates of the fact. It was the plain duty of Osborn to have indorsed on the open policy the consent of the underwriters to the other insurance, of which he was advised, and his omission to do this was the omission of the general agent of the defendant and the other companies in whose behalf the insurance in question was made. It would be in the highest degree inequitable to permit the default of the defendant\u2019s agent, under such circumstances, to defeat a recovery in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>There are no other questions requiring examination.
