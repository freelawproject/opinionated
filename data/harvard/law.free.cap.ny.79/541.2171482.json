Y., 392; <em>Goodell </em>v. <em>Harrington, </em>3 T. &amp; C., 345.) It threw the burden on the plaintiff to prove the sanity of the mortgagor. <em>(Goodell </em>v. <em>Harrington, 3 </em>T. &amp; C., 345.) The plaintiff is bound to prove that the mortgagor was sane at the very time the mortgage was given. <em>(Jackson </em>v. <em>Van Dusen, </em>5 J.

The burden is on the plaintiff to show that the corpus of the lunatic\u2019s estate was swelled by the loan. <em>(Lincoln </em>v. Buckmaster, 32 Vt., 652.) In dealing with any person it is the duty of both' contracting parties to use care. They deal at their peril. <em>(Wadsworth </em>v. <em>Sharpstein, </em>8 N. Y., 393; <em>Seaver </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>11 Pick., 304.) The plaintiff could not, by paying a judgment against Miss Hunt, or by paying taxes on her property, without her request or a subsequent promise to repay, constitute themselves in any sense her creditors. <em>(Beach </em>v. <em>Vandenburg, </em>10 J. R., 361; <em>Wallkill v. Overseers of Mamakating, </em>14 id., 87; 2 R. S. [Banks\u2019 6th ed.], 1094, \u00a7 17.) The mortgage was wholly void under the Revised Statutes. (2 R. S.

As to an obligation before inquest found, though the lunatic be found thereby to have been insane without lucid intervals, from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>a period anterior to. the obligation, the finding is presumptive evidence of insanity only, and that it is evidence at all is an exception to the rule, that persons not parties to the proceedings are not affected thereby, being <em>res inter alios acta, </em>the reason of the exception being the supposed publicity of the proceedings. <em>(Jackson </em>v. <em>King, </em>4 Cow., 217; <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Deamer, </em>6 Wend., 497; <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>15 Barb., 520; Willard\u2019s Eq.

The complaint shows that interest ivas paid on the 1st of March, 1871, but default made in September following; that in December, 1871, the defendant Hunt was adjudged a lunatic, and Arnold II. Wagner appointed committee of her person and estate. He was made co-defendant with her; and in her behalf, and by way of defense alleges \u201c that at the time of the execution of the bond and mortgage she was a lunatic, and incapable of making or executing them.\u201d The issue- thus presented was tried before a careful and experienced judge at Special Term and he found as a fact: \u201c That at the time of the execution and delivery of the bond and mortgage, the said Camilla Hunt ivas of sound mind, and was capable of making and executing said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>bond and mortgage,\u201d and ordered judgment in accordance with the prayer of the complaint. The finding is well warranted by the evidence, and upon this ground alone, we should be required to affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">But the learned court at General Term went beyond it, and for the purposes of the appeal assumed, without deciding, the contrary of the finding to be the truth, yet held, that as the case presented a contract executed upon a valuable consideration, of which the lunatic had the benefit, made by the plaintiff \u201c in good faith, without fraud or unfairness, without knowledge of the insanity, and without notice or information calling for enquiry,\u201d that the plaintiff was entitled to recover. The correctness of this conclusion is strenuously assailed by the learned counsel for the appellant, but both upon principle and authority we think it must be sustained. Upon principle because the plaintiff\u2019s money ivas had by the defendant, appropriated to her use, and thus tended to increase the body of her estate, and although in some cases a man may now, notwithstauding\"the old common law maxim to the contrary <em>(Beverly's Case, </em>2 Coke\u2019s R., 568, pt. 4, 123, b), \u201cbe admitted to stultify himself, \u201d yet he cannot do so to the prejudice of others, for he would thus make his OAvn misfortune an excuse for fraud, and against that the doctrine of the maxim stands unaffected by any exception. (1 Story\u2019s Eq. Jurs., \u00a7 226.) In this case the loan Avas made in the ordinary course of business; it was a fair and reasonable transaction; the defendant acted for herself, but with the aid of an attorney; if mental unsoundness existed, it Avas not knoAvn to the plaintiff, and the parties cannot hoav be put <em>in statu quo. </em>The defendant was therefore properly held liable</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">Very much in point, and upon circumstances similar to those above stated, was <em>Molton v. Camroux </em>(2 Exch. [Welsby, H. <em>&amp; </em>G.], 487), affirmed in error, 4 id., 17. Concerning it, the chancellor in <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Ince </em>(7 DeG, M. <em>&amp; </em>G. [56 Eng. Chv.], 487), says : \u201cThe principle of that case Avas very sound, viz.: that an executed contract, when par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>ties have been dealing fairly, and in ignorance of the lunacy, shall not afterwards be set aside; that was a decision of necessity, and a contrary doctrine would render all ordinary dealings between man and man unsafe.\u201d And so it has been held, and like contracts enforced upon the same principle, in repeated instances, in the courts of this and other States. <em>(Loomis </em>v. <em>Spencer, 2 </em>Paige, 153; <em>In the Matter of Beckwith, </em>3 Hun, 443; <em>Canfield </em>v. <em>Fairbanks, </em>63 Barb. 461; <em>Lancaster County Bank </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>78 Penn. St., 407; <em>Wilder </em>v. Weakley, 34 Ind., 181; <em>Matthiessen &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>McMahon, </em>38 N. J. Law, 536; <em>Behrens </em>v. <em>McKenzie, </em>23 Iowa, 333.) These cases stand on the maxim \u201c that he who seeks equity, must do equity,\u201d and it is applicable to the case in hand ; for the defendant seeks to deprive the plaintiff of its remedies to enforce the security while she retains the benefit of the contract. This is so plainly inequitable and unjust as to . render a further discussion unnecessary. Nor does the fact that the borrower was subsequently upon inquisition taken, declared \"to be insane, alter the result. Such proceeding has no effect upon a contract made without notice, and on the faith of the presumption that the person contracted with was of competent understanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">All concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
