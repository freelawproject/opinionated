Plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to show that the engine was infirm and weak, was frequently, and from necessity, taken to the repair shops for repairs; that it was unable to hold water, or sustain a full head of steam. <em>Held, </em>that the question of defendant\u2019s negligence was-one of fact for the jury.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b262-10\">Upon the cross-examination of S., a witness for plaintiff, who had given material testimony for him, and who had been in defendant\u2019s employ, he was asked if he was discharged for inefficiency and drunkenness; if he was discharged at all; and if 0., his \u201c immediate boss,\u201d did not assign these reasons for discharging him, to all of which he answered, \u201cNo.\u201d O. was called by defendant\u2019s counsel, who offered to prove by him, that he became aware that S. was in the habit of being intoxicated, -and neglected his duty, and that he was discharged for that reason. This was excluded. <em>Held, </em>no error; that the fact of his discharge was immaterial ; that if the discharge was for inefficiency or drunkenness, this could not be proved by way of impeachment, and was matter collateral to the issue, as to which the answers of S. were conclusive ; that if such grounds for the discharge were communicated to S., it might lay the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>foundation of an inquiry as to Ms feelings toward defendant; but \"as defendant did not offer to show this, and as it was not disclosed on the trial that the offer was to show a hostile feeling, the question could not be presented here.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b263-5\">(Argued December 2, 1879;</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Ahp\">decided December 16, 1879.)</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-6\">Appeal from judgment of the General Term of the Supreme Court, in the third judicial department, affirming a judgment in favor of plaintiff, entered on a verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-7\">This action was brought to recover damages for alleged negligence on the part of defendant, causing the death of Richard Kirkpatrick, plaintiff\u2019s intestate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-8\">The deceased was killed by the explosion of the boiler of a locomotive, upon which he was employed as a fireman.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-9\">The further facts appear sufficiently in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b263-10\"><em>Frank Loomis, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4y\">It was error to exclude the offer to prove by Overpaugh the facts denied by Scott. <em>(Starks </em>v. <em>People, 5 </em>Den., 106.)

The court properly refused to charge that if the negligence of the engineer merely contributed to the accident, the plaintiff could not recover. <em>(Shauny </em>v. <em>Androscoggin Mills, </em>66 Me., 420, 426; <em>Sprong </em>v. <em>B. and A.

Scott\u2019s testimony was important. He had been in the defendant\u2019s employ, and for a time the locomotive in question was under his care. If his evidence was truthful it was damaging to the defendant, for it showed that the engine was unfit for use, and it was quite reasonable for the defendant\u2019s counsel to test as they best could, hie credibility. For that purpose he was asked on cross-exaini<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>nation, whether he \u201c was discharged by the defendant for inefficiency and drunkenness \u201d\u2014 \u201c whether he was discharged at all\u201d \u2014 whether he had been \u201cguilty of inefficiency,\u201d or \u201c whether his immediate \u2018boss\u2019 Overpaugh did not assign these reasons for dismissing him,\u201d to all of which questions the witness answered, \u201cno.\u201d Overpaugh was called by the. defendant and asked \u201c if at any time he became informed of unfaithfulness, and habits of being intoxicated in Mr. Scott.\u201d On plaintiff\u2019s objection this question was excluded, and properly, for however answered, it would of itself be unimportant. The defendant\u2019s counsel then offered to prove that the witness \u201c Overpaugh became aware that Scott was in the habit of being intoxicated and neglecting duty in his department, and they discharged him for that reason.\u201d This was also excluded, and herein the defendant alleges error. But there is no error. The evidence if received would have shown, 1st, that Scott was discharged; 2d, that he was discharged for inefficiency and drunkenness, but it would not have tended to establish that these reasons had been communicated to Scott. That he was discharged-was so far as his character was concerned, unimportant. It left no stain upon it; for it is impossible not to know that a large corporation whose need of service fluctuates with the general business of the community, may require at one time fewer laborers and servants than at another, but to be discharged on account of intoxication and neglect of duty would be another matter, not to be proved by way of impeachment but if communicated to 'Scott, might lay the foundation for an inquiry as to his present feelings towards the company, and the question addressed to Scott was to that effect, but such was not the question put to Overpaugh, nor did the defendant offer to show that such reasons were communicated to Scott. As to that he would have gone uncontradictod even, and as to the rest, it related to matter collateral to the issue, and the defendant was bound by the answer given by Scott. <em>It is </em>now urged that the evidence would have indicated a hostile feeling towards the defendant, but it was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>so stated at the trial, nor was this object then disclosed. For this reason, if for no other, the objection on that ground is now unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">It is next objected that the court erred in refusing to dismiss the complaint. That the plaintiff\u2019s intestate came to his death by reason of injuries received from the explosion of a locomotive engine belonging to the defendant and while he was in its employ is not denied. It was the duty of the defendant to see to it that the engine furnished the intestate was fit and proper for his use in the performance of the labor he had undertaken. The questions thus involved have been so fully and frequently discussed and passed upon by this court, that their further consideration is quite unnecessary; <em>(Laning </em>v <em>N. Y. C. and H. R. R. R. Co., </em>49 N. <em>Y., </em>521) j and the same case contains an answer to the position of the defendant expressed in various forms, that they \u201chave performed that duty by employing fit and competent agents to supervise the engine and see that it was in fit condition.\u201d Such agents must indeed be employed, but any negligence on their part in respect to the engine was equally the negligence of the defendant. There was in this case evidence proper for submission to the jury, and upon which they might answer whether this duty had been discharged; whether there was such negligence in respect to the engine as would render the defendant liable. It was infirm and weak, it was frequently and from necessity taken to the repair shops for treatment, and whether from natural infirmity or age, or overwork, or the misapplication of mechanical contrivances, it was unable to hold its water, or sustain a full head of steam. It cannot be necessary to itemize or restate the evidence. It was in substance the same as on the former trial. It was then analyzed and examined with great care by the learned Supreme Court at General Term, in determining whether it was sufficient for the consideration of a jury. It has, in consequence of the exception we are now considering, been again criticised and weighed by the same court. Upon each occasion the views of the court have been expressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>in writing, and the conclusion reached, that the evidence presented questions proper to be submitted to the jury, and upon which they might properly find the facts constituting negligence on the part of the defendant. In that conclusion we concur. It is also objected that the court erred in various particulars in its charge to the jury. We have examined each one of them, and find no error. The charge was carefully presented, and is fully warranted by numerous decisions in our courts. To sustain any of the exceptions to it, we should be obliged to abandon principles of law which have hitherto been deemed well settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">All concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
