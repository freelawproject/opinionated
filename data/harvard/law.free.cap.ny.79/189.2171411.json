The acts of the commissioners in respect to the work were communicated to the Legislature, from time to time, in the official reports of the commissioners, which stated the amounts expended and the purposes of the expenditure in accordance with the facts. In 1875 a budget was made up in the auditor\u2019s office of out-standing certificates, issued for work done on the canal, and furnished to the Legislature when engaged in making an appropriation to pay the same ; in which budget the certificates so held by relator were specifically described and included, and an appropriation was made to the precise amount of the budget (\u00a7 1, chap. 268, Laws of 1875).

An alternative writ was issued, to which return was made. The relator traversed the issues tendered thereon, and the matter wits referred to a referee to hear and determine.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-10\">The facts as found by the referee are substantially\" as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b212-11\">Prior to 1848, the State had constructed a canal reservoir and feeder in the town of Nelson, county of Madison, known as the Erieville reservoir, the waters of which passed down Erieville (Nelson) creek into Chittenango creek, the outlet of Cazenovia lake, at a point a few rods from the lake, and thence down the Chittenango creek to the \u201c Rome level \u201d of the Erie canal; a few rods below the mouth of the Erieville creek, there was a dam across the Chittenango creek, owned by individuals, which furnished power to their mills on the banks of the creek. In 1848 the canal commissioners, temporarily appropriated the waters of Cazenovia lake, and its outlet, Chittenango\u2019 creek, to furnish an additional supply of water to the \u201c Rome level,\u201d and for such purposes erected another dam or bulk-head across Chittenango creek, above the mouth of Erieville creek, which was so arranged that when the water of the lake was low, the water of the Erieville reservoir and creek, stopped by the lower dam, could pass through the gate of the upper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>dam back into the lake, and there be stored until needed for the canal. The canal commissioners at the same time caused gates to be constructed in the lower dam, so that they could control the supply of water at that point, and thereafter down to 1854, the State, by means of these dams and the gates therein, continued to control and use the reservoir, lake and creeks, and controlled and regulated the flow and passage of water over the lower dam for the purpose of feeding the canal. On September 13,1854, the canal board, by resolution, authorized the permanent appropriation of the water of Cazenovia lake, and adopted maps, plans and estimates, converting the lake into a canal reservoir, to be used in connection with the Erieville reservoir and the two creeks as a feeder to the Erie canal, and the action of the board was reported to the Legislature ofT855 by the canal commissioners, in their annual report for the year 1854. June 5, 1855, the canal commissioners permanently appropriated the waters of the lake and creeks,' passing over the lower dam, and instituted measures to carry out the plans adopted by the canal board. July 10, 1855, the canal board changed somewhat the original plan, and adopted what is known as the \u201c citizens\u2019 plan,\u201d which retained the lower dam at its original height, instead of lowering it, upon condition that certain owners of the water-power should execute a release to the State for damages, which was done accordingly. The other property owners applied for and obtained their damages in consequence of such appropriation, and ever since that time the State has exercised control over the waters passing over the lower dam and other dams erected on the same site, making the use thereof by the mill owners subordinate to the requirements of the canal. In 1855, the canal commissioners, in pursuance of the plan finally adopted by the canal board, constructed a new dam on the site of the old lower dam, and while the same was in progress reported their action and that of the canal board in reference thereto, and the cost of its construction, to the Legislature of 1856, in their annual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>report for the year 1855; and the new dam remained under the control of the canal commissioners until it was carried away by a flood in 1865. The canal officers declining to build another dam, a new one was built by the mill owners on the same site in which, however, a gate was constructed by the canal commissioners, and by means thereof they controlled the flow of water the same as before, until this dam was also carried away by a flood in March, 1872.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b214-6\">\u201c Tho mill owners having refused to erect another dam, the canal commissioner, then in charge deeming it necessary for the interest of the State, and for the proper use and control of the waters of the Erieville reservoir and of the lake, and intending to appropriate the land or site of the old dam, if such appropriation had not already been made, to the use and benefit of the State, for the purpose of erecting a new dam, Wherewith to control and regulate the supply of water from the reservoir and lake, examined said site and directed the engineer in charge to take possession thereof (which he did) and announced to the property owners interested the appropriation thereof, to which they consented ; and the commissioner caused a map, plan and estimate for the construction of a new dam on the old site, to be made, and presented the same to the canal board.\u201d The canal board shortly afterward, May 8, 1872, \u201cduly adopted the said plan and estimate,\u201d \u201cand authorized the canal commissioners to advertise and enter into a contract for the construction of the dam, provided the property owners should make a release satisfactory to the attorney-general.\u201d The parties in interest \u201c executed and delivered to the canal commissioners a valid release in writing of all' claims against the State, for damages on account of such appropriation and use of the mill site and water power,\u201d which was accepted and placed on file in the office of the auditor of the canal department. The commissioners advertised in the State and local papers the letting of the work for the 21st day of May, 1872, and received various bids for the work, and, among others, one from Henry J. Mowry. The next day, May 22, 1872, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>\u25a0canal board reconsidered the resolution of . May eight, and laid the same on the table. December 18, 1872, the board of canal commissioners assuming to act under \u2022chapter 343 of the Laws of 1872 adopted the same plan, directed the reconstruction of the lower dam on the old site, accepted ,the bid for said work put in by Mowry, and awarded the contract to him; and on the same day made and executed a contract with him for the construction of the dam. The canal board, on the 14th day of February, 1873, appointed a committee to \u201c examine the matter of rebuilding the dam,\u201d and report thereon ; such report was made on the 19th of March, 1873, \u25a0containing a full history of all the previous proceedings of the State officers, the board of canal commissioners and the canal board; said board accepted the report, adopted the recommendation of the committee, and approved the action of the commissioners. The canal commissioner in charge \u25a0on March 3, 1873, in pursuance of the contract, upon the \u25a0estimate of the resident engineer, duly issued his official certificate to the contractor, directed to the auditor, certifying there was due to the contractor the sum of $714 upon the \u25a0contract; and April 7, 1873, in like manner, duly issued to the contractor, another certificate, certifying there was then due to him the further sum of $1,292 ; the auditor refused to audit and allow these certificates, \u201c on the ground that there were no moneys in the treasury applicable to their payment ; \u201d and the contractor was then informed that \u201c there wore no funds to pay him for the construction of the dam under his contract.\u201d He declined to go on with the work, until provision was made for payment as it progressed in accordance with the terms of his contract; and the work was accordingly suspended. The canal commissioner in charge, in October, 1873, applied to the relator and requested him to make provision for advancing the money to the contractor, upon his official certificates under the contract, until provision could be made for the payment thereof at the next session of the Legislature, stating to the relator that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>work was necessary for the interest of the State. In com- \u2022 pliance with such request, the relator and one Eeuben Parsons, obligated themselves to advance and pay to Mowry the-money as earned under his contract with the commissioners, upon the assignment by the contractor to them of the certificates of indebtedness issued by the commissioners under the contract. At the request of the canal commissioner in charge, the contractor then proceeded with and completed the work in pursuance of the contract; and he received the. amount he was entitled to, which was advanced and paid from, time to time as the work progressed, by the 'Bank of Cazenovia, on the promissory notes of the relator and Parsons,. which were subsequently paid to the bank by the relator. About the 25th of July, 1874, and within ninety days after the completion of the work, the resident engineer, in pursuance of the terms thereof, made and presented a final, account to the division engineer, who duly approved and delivered the same to the canal commissioner, and the latter thereupon issued and delivered to the contractor a third certificate for $7,734.61, the balance due upon the contract, in addition to the amounts of the former certificates. , The-three certificates -were duly assigned and transferred to the-relator. \u201c The continuance of the work in the fall of 1873, and the completion of the lower dam was a public benefit and necessary to enable the State to use and control the waters of the Erieville reservoir and Cazenovia lake for the purpose of supplying water to the Erie canal. The work was done in good faith at reasonable prices, and is of great use and benefit to the State ; and the State by means thereof has ever since had exclusive control of the waters passing; over the dam. The relator had no personal interest in firework or the dam, otherwise than under his collateral con- \u25a0 tract made at the request of the canal commissioner, and he \u25a0 procured the money to be advanced and paid to the contractor, simply to forward a public work, at the request of a., public officer, and upon his representation that it was a public benefit and would be promptly repaid by an appropria<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>tian for that purpose, at the next session of the Legislature.\u2019* \u201c The canal commissioner in charge, in his annual report for the year 1872, to the Legislature of 1873, stated the facts as to the carrying away of the old dam, the necessity to the State of the maintenance of the dam, and the action of the canal board and the commissioners in regard thereto, and in reference to contracting for its rebuilding.\u201d And after the completion of the work, the commissioners, in their annual report for the year 1874, to the Legislature of 1875, reported the aggregate amount of the three certificates of indebtedness, as an item of public expenditure as follows : \u201c For rebuilding dam at Cazenovia, $9,740.61.\u201d \u201c The auditor, in 1875, caused a budget to be made of the items for which appropriations were required to be made to pay claims then outstanding in the canal department, and among others for certificates of indebtedness issued for work done on the Erie canal, which amounted, in all, to $107,004.03 ; there was included therein and. specifically stated each of the three certificates in question, and the amounts thereof respectively formed a part of said sum. ' The auditor also caused to be computed the interest due on the certificates of indebtedness, including the three in question, which amounted to $12,973.08, and caused an act to be drawn and presented to the Legislature, containing said two items of appropriation, which was adopted and passed accordingly by the Legislature. (Chap. 263, Laws of 1875.) In reference to the certificates in question, the referee found that \u201cthe act was passed with full knowledge on the part of the Legislature of the facts in reference to the building of the dam, and with intent to ratify the same, and to provide moneys for the payment of the certificates.\u201d The money thus appropriated was collected and paid into the treasury, and thereafter, and before the commencement of this action, the certificates were duly presented to the auditor and demand made that he issue his warrant therefor, which he refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-7\">Further facts appear in the opinion.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b218-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number><em>F.

The Legislature has power to ratify the contract of a municipal corporation which was originally void as <em>ultra vires, </em>and thus to render it valid and effectual. <em>(Nelson </em>v. <em>Mayor of N.

The intention may be ascertained from the language of the statute applied to the subject matter, in view of public and notorious facts at the time, and of all the surrounding circumstances. <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Mayor of N.

The act <em>of an agent may </em>always be presumed to have been ratified by his principal when the acts and conduct of the latter are inconsistent with any other supposition, as where he receives and holds the fruits of the agent\u2019s acts, and a considerable period of time has elapsed without any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>dissent. <em>(Maddock </em>v. <em>Bevon, </em>39 Md., 485; <em>Elwell </em>v. <em>Chamberlain, </em>31 N.

Chapter 263, Laws 1875, was repealed by chapter 425, Laws 1876. <em>(Hadden </em>v. <em>The Collector, </em>5 Wall., 107; <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Abbott, </em>16 Cal., 358; State v. <em>Cazeon, </em>8 La. Ann., 114.) As the law was not in force when the contract was made, and neither the relator nor his assignor did anything in reliance upon its existence, it was competent for the Legislature to repeal the law. (Peo. ex <em>rel. </em>v. <em>Sup. Montgomery Co., </em>67 N. Y., 109.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b221-6\">Rapallo, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aks\">The only ground upon which the majority of the General Term appear to have rested their decision is, that it did not appear that the Legislature at the time of the passage of the act of 1875, (Laws of 1875, chap. 263,) had sufficient knowledge of the facts, to render that act effectual as a ratification of the acts of the canal commissioners in building the dam in question, and issuing the certificates of indebtedness held by the relator.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">The referee found as facts, that the statute in question was passed with full knowledge on the part of the Legislature, of the facts in reference to the building of the dam, and with intent to ratify the same, and to provide means for the payment of said certificates, and that the money to pay said appropriation was collected and paid into the treasury, and, that there remained in the treasury unexpended a sum sufficient to pay the certificates held by the relator, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>legal interest thereon. These findings unless wholly unsupported by evidence must be regarded as establishing the facts of the case. They show a clear right in the relator to payment, and, that it was not the duty of the financial officers of the State to go behind the legislative direction and seek' for technical objections to the validity of the contract under which the work was done, no fraud or imposition of any kind being shown or even alleged. The evidence upon which these findings are based is very voluminous, but it establishes in substance that the money for which the certificates in question were issued, was advanced by the relator at the request of the canal commissioners, for the purpose of expediting a work of public necessity, for which there was-not on hand any unexpended appropriation, and. that the advance was made in reliance upon the future appropriation by the Legislature of money to reimburse the relator. That the acts of the canal commissioners in respect to the particular work in question were communicated to the Legislature from time to time, by the official reports of the commissioners, which stated the amount expended, and the purposes-of the expenditure, in accordance with the facts. Wo suppression or misinformation is charged, except that in the respondent\u2019s points it is alleged that the reports failed to state that-the contract had been executed without the direction of the canal board, and misstated that the plans and estimates had been adopted by the canal board and also omitted to state-that the dam was constructed on plans different from those-adopted by the canal board. It appears however from the-findings, that in March, 1873, the canal board, after a full investigation of the matter and of the action of the commissioners in awarding the contract in question, and with the contract before them substantially approved such action of the-commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">It also appeared that the amount appropriated by the Legislature of 1875 for the payment of outstanding certificates of indebtedness issued for work done on the canal, corresponded \u00a1precisely with the amount of a budget made up in. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>the auditor\u2019s department and furnished to the Legislature-when engaged in making the appropriation, in which budget-the three certificates held by the relator were specifically described and included. We do not think that the referee-went too far in regarding this circumstance as evidence of an intention on the part of the Legislature to provide specifically for the payment of these certificates. The identity of amount, together with the proof that the budget was furnished from the proper office as a basis for the action of the Legislature, afford evidence that the appropriation was. founded upon that budget and was intended to cover it, and. it cannot be said that the finding of the referee is unsupported, that the appropriation was made for the payment of the certificates held by the relator and included in the budget.. TMs fact being established the discussion of the questions of ratification, and of the knowledge of the Legislature of' the-facts relating to the contract, and of the validity of the contract becomes unimportant. The appropriation was an act within the power of- the Legislature, and no inquiry is admissible as to the reasons or information upon which it acted. Acts of the Legislature cannot be invalidated or disregarded, on any such grounds. If the relator had done the work voluntarily, without the authority of any public officer, yet-if the Legislature saw fit to pay for it, or to appropriate, money for such payment, no disbursing officer of the government could refuse to apply the money to the purpose for' which it was appropriated, on the ground that the State was not originally under any legal obligation to make the payment, or that the Legislature was not sufficiently informed of the facts. The only question for such officer to consider would be whether the appropriation was made for the purpose claimed. When that is ascertained his duty is merely ministerial and he has no power to supervise the action of the Legislature, or inquire into the extent or accuracy of the information upon which such action was founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">For the reasons stated by the referee we do not think that the act of 1876 (chap. 425) had the effect of repealing the. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>appropriation, of which the relator claims the benefit. The case is clearly distinguishable from that of <em>People ex rel. Wasson </em>v. <em>Schuyler </em>(69 N. Y., 242).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">The judgment of the General Term should be reversed, and the judgment on the report of the referee affirmed, with \u2022costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">All concur, except Earl,- J., not voting.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
