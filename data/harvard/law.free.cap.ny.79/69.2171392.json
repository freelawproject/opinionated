The petition averred that the petitioner had applied to the Troy and Boston Company to agree on the points and manner of the crossings and the compensation therefor, hut that such an agreement had been refused by said company. No allegation was contained in the petition as to any attempt to agree with the Troy and Bennington Company. The order of Special Term appointed commissioners to determine the points and manner of crossing and the compensation to be made to both the companies named.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b92-9\"><em>Esek Cowen </em>and <em>Samuel </em>Hand, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AG8\">The order of the Special Term is void, because there is no allegation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>iu the petition that any attempt has been made to agree with the Troy and Bennington Railroad Company as to the points and manner of crossing, or the compensation to be made therefor, <em>(N. Y. and Bost., R. R. </em>v. Godwin, 12 Abb. [N. S.], 21; <em>Watson </em>v. <em>N. Y. C. R. R., </em>47 N. Y., 157.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b93-3\"><em>E.

R. R., </em>77 N.

This is a jurisdictional fact. The attempt and failure to agree is a condition precedent to the authority of the court to appoint commissioners, and unless this is averred in the petition, there is no jurisdiction. This point has been ruled by this court in <em>In re the Lockport and Buffalo Railroad Co. </em>(77 N. Y., 527). The appeal of the Troy and Bennington Railroad .must, therefore be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">But wo think the order may be upheld as to the Troy and Boston Railroad. That road is the lessee of the Troy and Bennington Railroad, operating it under a perpetual lease. The Troy and Boston Railroad was a necessary party to a proceeding under the sixth subdivision of section twenty-eight of the general railroad act for the appointment of commissioners. That corporation is a company whose railroad is intersected by the railroad of the petitioner, within the meaning of that section, and I see no reason to doubt that it might have voluntarily agreed with the petitioner in respect to the crossing by the petitioner\u2019s road. Such agreement would not have been binding upon the Troy and Bennington <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>Railroad in respect to its interest as reversioner, but would bind the interest of the lessee. There is nothing in the statute which requires that the proceeding for the appointment of commissioners, in such a case as this, should embrace all parties who, either as lessees or reversioners, have an interest in the railroad which may be crossed by a new line. The proceeding will only affect the parties who are brought in ; and where the lessee is made a party alone the estate in reversion will not be affected by it. The other questions have been determined in the case of this petitioner against the Troy and Boston Railroad Company, just decided. We are of opinion that the order should be affirmed, so far as it provides for the appointment of commissioners, as against the Troy and Boston Railroad, and reversed as to the Troy and Bennington Railroad, withqut costs to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">All concur. .</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
