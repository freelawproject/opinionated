The Form 1040 was attached as an exhibit. The United States filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim or, alternatively, for summary judgment. The district court stated that Madison\u2019s return demonstrated that it was subject to the section 6702 penalty, and thus granted summary judgment on the grounds that his complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-22\">We initially note that the district court erred in granting summary judgment for the defendants rather than dismissing the case under Rule 12(b)(6), Fed.R.Civ.P., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. However, \u201cthe label a district court puts on its disposition of a case is not binding on a court of appeals.\u201d <em>Tuley v. Heyd, </em>482 F.2d 590, 593 (5th Cir.1973). We hold that this complaint should be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6), since it is clear from the face of the complaint that appellant can prove no set of facts that would entitle him to relief. <em>See Milburn v. United States, </em>734 F.2d 762, 765 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Appellant argues that he cannot be penalized under section 6702 because the document he filed was merely a request for refund of taxes erroneously collected, and did not purport to be a tax return. However, it is generally necessary for a taxpayer to file a return in order to obtain a refund. 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.6402-3(a)(l). Furthermore, the documents filed were official tax forms which were completed in detail. Therefore, it is entirely proper to treat the form as a \u201cpurported return\u201d for section 6702 purposes, notwithstanding the disclaimer added by the taxpayer. <em>Davis v. United States, </em>742 F.2d 171, 173 (5th Cir.1984); <em>Holker v. United States, </em>737 F.2d 751, 752 (8th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">It is also apparent from the face of the complaint that the return was frivolous. The return contains information on its face indicating that the self-assessment was substantially incorrect and that taxpayer\u2019s conduct was based on a position that is frivolous within the meaning of section 6702. <em>Davis, </em>742 F.2d at 171; <em>Holker, </em>737 F.2d at 753; <em>see Simanonok v. Commissioner, </em>731 F.2d 743, 744 (11th Cir.1984) (argument that individual wage earners are not persons subject to tax is \u201ccompletely without merit\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">Therefore, in the interests of accuracy, we VACATE the summary judgment granted in favor of the United States and REMAND for the entry of judgment dismissing taxpayer\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b676-12\">. \u00a7 6702.
