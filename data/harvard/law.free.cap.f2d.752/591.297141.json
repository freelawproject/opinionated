Defendant Schmitt was convicted on both counts, Dyer and Lyn on only Count I, the conspiracy count.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">I. Reliance upon the LaRue report</p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">Schmitt's sole defense was that he was insane at the commission of the offense in August and September 1983. His wife testified that he had suffered a severe head injury in 1975. Both she and her daughter testified that they had observed marked differences in his behavior since then, and in their opinion he was insane.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">Dr. Gutman testified for Schmitt that, based on review of Schmitt\u2019s prior medical history and two consultations with Schmitt, it was his opinion that Schmitt was not able to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law. During the direct examination of Dr. Gutman, counsel for Schmitt was allowed to inquire about previous medical treatment and diagnoses of Schmitt rendered by psychiatrists, including Dr. Marianne LaRue. Counsel asked: \u201cWas he [Schmitt] ever found by her [Dr. LaRue] to be legally insane?\u201d The government objected on the ground that this was a conclusion, not a diagnosis. The objection was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-11\">The government\u2019s rebuttal witness, a psychiatrist, Dr. Kirkland, testified that he reviewed Schmitt\u2019s medical records, listened to tapes of Schmitt made at the time of the acts charged in the indictment, and personally interviewed Schmitt, and on the basis thereof concluded that Schmitt was legally sane at the time of the offense. On cross-examination defense counsel questioned Dr. Kirkland about a five-page medical history of Schmitt given by Dr. LaRue and used by Dr. Kirkland in arriving at his opinion. The report described Schmitt\u2019s appearance, reactions, attitude, and Dr. La-Rue\u2019s diagnosis. It contained no opinion by Dr. LaRue of Schmitt\u2019s sanity. The government did not object to this cross-examination. The same applied to the diagnosis in a letter from a Dr. Bailey.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-13\">Dr. Kirkland was then asked whether in arriving at his ultimate opinion in Schmitt\u2019s case he \u201ctook into consideration\u201d a report from Dr. LaRue in a letter dated November 3, 1977. Dr. Kirkland responded affirmatively, and defense counsel then attempted to get into evidence the opinion of Dr. LaRue that Schmitt was insane when he allegedly committed another offense in May 1977. This occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-14\">Q Did you take that [the letter] into consideration in arriving at your ultimate opinion in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-15\">A Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-16\">Q You have a copy of that in front of you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-17\">MR. CALVACCA [prosecutor]: I\u2019m going to object. This report is conclusory in its tone. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-18\">MR. BUONARO [Schmitt\u2019s counsel]: Judge, the Government asked the doctor if he relied on these medical reports.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-19\">MR. CALVACCA: He\u2019s indicated he\u2019s relied on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-20\">THE COURT: You may ask him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-21\">BY MR. BUONARO:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-22\">Q The second paragraph of that it says at the time of the accident, May 25th, 1977\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-23\">MR. CALVACCA: Objection. That is a prior matter not before the Court. He\u2019s referring now to another arrest, and the doctor is finding with respect to that arrest. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s relevant to this trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-24\">MR. BUONARO: Judge, it\u2019s something that the doctor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-25\">THE COURT: Let me see it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>Mark it for identification. Objection sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">The letter, addressed to the attorney representing Schmitt in the present case, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahh\">Dear Mr. Buonauro [sic]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-5\">Re: Robert Schmitt</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AL7\">This letter is in response to the request for information from you regarding the above named patient, and also in response to the patient\u2019s authorization for me to release information to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-6\">At the time of the incident on May 25, 1977, for which charges have been filed against the above named patient, it is my opinion that the patient was unable to tell right from wrong as a result of his emotional illness specifically Psychosis associated with brain trauma, chronic.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Schmitt contends that he was entitled to introduce Dr. LaRue\u2019s opinion, stated in the November 3 letter, that Schmitt was unable to tell right from wrong in May 1977, as impeachment of Dr. Kirkland, because Dr. Kirkland had testified that he relied on the letter. The letter contained both underlying factual data \u2014 Dr. LaRue\u2019s diagnosis in 1977 \u2014 and Dr. LaRue\u2019s opinion on the ultimate question of Schmitt\u2019s sanity in 1977. The question whether Dr. Kirkland \u201crelied on the letter\u201d was sufficient to make the LaRue diagnosis admissible. But the opinion of Dr. LaRue on Schmitt\u2019s sanity was not admissible unless and until Dr. Kirkland testified that in forming his opinion of Schmitt\u2019s sanity in 1983 he relied upon or considered the November 1977 opinion of Dr. LaRue. Medical personnel frequently rely upon the diagnoses of other medical personnel, and if relied upon, they may be admissible in impeachment though hearsay. But it is far less likely that medical personnel, in reaching their own opinions concerning ultimate issues such as sanity, will rely upon opinions reached by other medical personnel on those same legal issues. To ask Dr. Kirkland whether he \u201crelied upon\u201d or \u201cconsidered\u201d a medical report by another doctor without differentiating between the underlying diagnosis described in the report and the opinion on an ultimate legal issue stated in the report was, whether or not so intended, a trap for the witness and court and an inappropriate way in which to present to the jury the opinion of an expert not available for cross-examination. The ruling of the court was correct. <em>Bryan v. John Bean Division of FMC Corp., </em>566 F.2d 541, 546 (5th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">Dr. Gutman was not asked whether he relied upon or considered any LaRue report in reaching his own opinion. The single question asked him was unrelated to any basis for his opinion but was a straightforward inquiry seeking to elicit the opinion of another doctor. The opinion of another cannot be put before the jury in this fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">II. The restricted scope of defendant\u2019s direct and cross-examination</p>\n<p id=\"AIv\">The government played for the jury a tape of a conversation between Schmitt and Agent Ball, a part of which follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXv\">Schmitt: Three people, and you know, that\u2019s what ya\u2019ll don\u2019t want to have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A54\">Ball: No, I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t want to meet a bunch of people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-11\">Schmitt: No, well, you don\u2019t ever want to see people, [three people?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-12\">Then that, that\u2019s conspiracy. When there\u2019s only two people, then you say the other guy conspired and he\u2019ll say he didn\u2019t. It\u2019s equal, see?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-13\">Blount: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-14\">Schmitt: But if you got two against one then, then they got ya. Anytime there\u2019s three people____ (Exh. 3).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-15\">On cross-examination by Schmitt, Ball acknowledged that he recalled the conversation. He was then asked if Schmitt's statement accurately reflected the law of conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-16\">On re-direct of Schmitt's expert witness, Dr. Gutman, the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-17\">Q. Now, if an individual \u2014 the Prosecutor asked you \u2014 understanding of the law \u2014 has an understanding of the law, it may show that he has an ability, a consciousness and ability to distinguish right from wrong?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-18\">A. It can be, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Q. What is the reverse of that coin? What if his understanding of the law is incorrect, if he thinks the conspiracy is something which it really isn\u2019t?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-4\">MR. CALVACCA: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-6\">THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">There was no error in the above rulings. Agent Ball was not competent to testify on whether Schmitt accurately stated the law of conspiracy. The question to Dr. Gut-man, even if otherwise appropriate, depended upon the prior establishment of a predicate that Schmitt\u2019s statement of the law of conspiracy was correct. No such predicate had been laid; it had been attempted in the examination of Ball, and the court correctly declined to permit him to testify on the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">However, there was more to come. Dr. Kirkland, the government\u2019s expert, was cross-examined on his opinion that at the time of the offense Schmitt had the capacity to distinguish between right and wrong. This occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-9\">Q. Did you hear any taped conversations with respect to Mr. Schmitt discussing with the undercover agents, purported to be drug dealers, with respect to what the law of conspiracy entails and how you got to watch out for conspiracy? Did you hear that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-10\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-11\">MR. BUONARO: Your Honor, the Court wouldn\u2019t let me go into that with Dr. Gutman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-12\">THE COURT: I think Dr. Gutman went into all of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-13\">MR. BUONARO: I tried to ask him about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-14\">THE COURT: Found out at length what was on the tape.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-15\">MR. BUONARO: No, sir, the question was about the law of conspiracy. The Court sustained the objection. I\u2019m objecting on the same basis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-16\">THE COURT: Not talking about the law of conspiracy. He\u2019s asking what he suggested. It\u2019s a different point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-17\">You may answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-18\">BY MR. CALVACCA:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-19\">Q. In your opinion as a psychiatrist, what significance, if any, did Mr. Schmitt\u2019s suggestion about conspiracy have with respect to your determination about his knowing right from wrong?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aki\">A. It suggested he clearly understood the law about such matters and was prepared to break them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-21\">Schmitt contends that the government was allowed to do what he was forbidden to do, that is, to utilize Schmitt\u2019s understanding of the law of conspiracy as part of a predicate for an ultimate conclusion on the issue of whether Schmitt understood the difference between right and wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-22\">The court analyzed correctly the matter of the cross-examination of Dr. Kirkland. He was not asked whether Schmitt correctly stated the law of conspiracy but, first, whether he heard what Schmitt said, or as paraphrased by the court what Schmitt \u201csuggested.\u201d The district attorney\u2019s succeeding question was not in terms of the substantive legal correctness of what Schmitt said but of the effect of what he said (without regard to whether or not it was legally correct). Dr. Kirkland\u2019s answer went beyond the question and responded in terms of whether Schmitt <em>did </em>understand the law of conspiracy, i.e., that conspiracy law as Schmitt understood it was correct and that he was prepared to break that law. There was, however, no motion to strike the answer as unresponsive or as beyond the scope of the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-23\">In view of all the other testimony pro and con on Schmitt\u2019s sanity at the time of the offense, Dr. Kirkland\u2019s single expansive answer, related to differences in understanding about the law of conspiracy, was not plain error requiring reversal. Indeed, it is arguable that Schmitt\u2019s comments were really directed to problems of proof of conspiracy at trial; possibly they stated his view that when there is one government witness testifying against the defendant, he may get out, but if there are two witnesses to one \u201cthen they got ya.\u201d So read, Schmitt\u2019s statement would tend to prove sanity rather than lack of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-24\">III. Dyer and Lyn</p>\n<p id=\"b662-25\">The contention by Dyer and Lyn that the evidence was insufficient to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>vict them of conspiracy is frivolous. Nor does their acquittal on the substantive count affect the validity of their convictions on the conspiracy count.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">Admission in the government\u2019s rebuttal case of evidence that defendants say the government had stipulated it would not use was not error. The court did not err in holding that the stipulation permitted use of the evidence in rebuttal and that it was offered for rebuttal purposes. Even if the court had mischaracterized the evidence, a stipulation on the admissibility of evidence concerns a question of law for the court and is not binding on the court. <em>Noel Shows, Inc. v. U.S., </em>721 F.2d 327, 330 (11th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">The court correctly found that there was sufficient evidence of conspiracy to permit statements of co-conspirator Schmitt to be introduced against Dyer and Lyn. The court was not required to make this determination pretrial. <em>U.S. v. James, </em>590 F.2d 575 (5th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 917, 99 S.Ct. 2836, 61 L.Ed.2d 283 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">There was no error in the denial of Dyer\u2019s and Lyn\u2019s motions to sever.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
