It contemplated the payment of money required to keep the bridge in repair, in fixed proportions, in the manner and at the times prescribed by the county commissioners ; and it intended that the whole expense of maintaining the bridge should not be borne by the cities and towns lying contiguous, but that the county should contribute its proportion, to be ascertained and fixed by the commissioners. The proceedings set out in the record were not in conformity with the requirements of the statute. The commissioners laid out the bridge as and for a public highway, and ordered that three fourths thereof in length be maintained, kept in repair and supported by the city of Newburyport, and the remaining one fourth by the town of Salisbury. They have not fixed the relative proportions of expense of the city or town; and they have charged the county with no part of the expense. Whether three fourths of the length of the bridge lies in Newburyport or extends into Salisbury does not appear. The commissioners have omitted to do what they were empowered and required to do, and have undertaken to do what they had no authority to do. It may be much more expensive to keep in repair a given number of feet of one end of the bridge than the same number of feet of the other end. As they have undertaken to impose a burden on the city which they were not authorized by law to impose, their doings are void, and it is not necessary to proceed by <em>certiorari </em>to quash them. <em>Wales </em>v. <em>Willard, 2 </em>Mass 120. <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Hapgood, </em>4 Mass. 117. <em>Sumner </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>7 Mass. 79.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b142-7\"><em>S.

The county commissioners, acting under that authority and direction, have laid it out \u201c as and for a public highway.\u201d The result of these proceedings, if legal and properly conducted, is, to impose upon the city of Newburyport and the town of Salisbury the obligation to maintain and keep in repair so much of this bridge as lies within their respective limits, if \u201c other provision is not made therefor.\u201d Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>44, \u00a7 1. If other provision has been made therefor, then their obligations are modified accordingly ; and each corporation is liable to indictment for neglect to repair any part of the bridge \u201c which it is by law obliged to keep in repair.\u201d Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>44, \u00a7 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Several objections are taken to the validity of these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">1. It is argued \u201c that the legislature intended that the whole expense of maintaining the bridge should not be borne by the cities and towns lying contiguous, but that the county should contribute its proportion.\u201d We do not think this to be the true construction of the statute. There were several bridges, in different parts of the county, to which the same words of the statute applied. The commissioners were empowered to impose some part of the expense of maintaining any of said bridges upon other towns \u201c lying near to,\u201d as well as upon those \u201c contiguous to,\u201d said bridge; or to impose a part thereof upon the county. But they were required only to impose upon such towns, or upon the county, so much of the expense \u201c as, in their 'udgment, may be just and equitable.\u201d And if, in their judgment, it should not appear \u201cjust and equitable\u201d that any part of the expense should be apportioned to a town lying near, or to the county, the statute does not require it to be done as an essential condition of a legal exercise of the power. The judgment of the county commissioners is conclusive upon the pro* <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>portions to be fixed; the statute is imperative only in directing that they shall make the apportionment.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">2. It is contended that the county commissioners have not fixed \u201c the relative proportions,\u201d as required by the statute; and therefore that no legal responsibility results from their action. This argument proceeds upon the ground that such proportion necessarily implies a mathematical ratio, or a comparison of mathematical ratios. We do not think the statute is to be so narrowly interpreted. The \u201c relative proportion \u201d is to be fixed with reference to all the circumstances of benefit to the respective municipalities affected, and to their population, extent, and ability to bear the burden. Such a comparison does not require an absolute mathematical ratio for the other branch of the proportion. We are of opinion that it was within the power of the county commissioners to fix the proportion by assigning to each town a specific part of the bridge, if in their judgment that was just and equitable; and that such an apportionment was proper and reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">3. It is urged that the statute contemplated the payment of money \u201cin the manner and at the times prescribed\u201d by the county commissioners, and not the charging of any city or town with the maintenance of any part of the bridge. This might appear to be so upon the mere letter of the statute. But there is no provision in the statute for the collection and expenditure of the money, and the care of the bridge. It is not charged upon the county commissioners. They are only to prescribe the manner and times of payment; and this is to be done as a part of the adjudication by which they \u201c determine and fix the relative proportions.\u201d They are not to supervise the repairs, nor to sontinue to prescribe the manner and times for contributing to the expenses, from time to time, as occasion shall require. This duty is not imposed upon them by these special statutes, nor is it any part of their official duty under the General Statutes. The statute must fail of effect, if the commissioners may not prescribe the manner of payment by directing that the towns within which the bridge is situated, shall make the necessary expenditures to keep the bridge in repair, receiving from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>county, or other towns near to the bridge, such sums, if any, as may be fixed for their proportion of the expenses so incurred and paid. This we think is clearly within the intent of the statute; and a necessary implication to enable its provisions to have the practical operation it had in view. The order once, made becomes obligatory upon all parties, to define and deter-mine their rights and duties in respect to the maintenance of the bridge. So far as relates to the manner of making the necessary expenditures, this construction makes the statute accord with the provisions of Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>44, \u00a7 <em>2.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">These considerations are sufficient for the determination of the present case. The city of Newburyport and the town of Salisbury are liable to conviction upon indictment, for the want of repair of so much of the bridge as each was bound to repair within their respective limits; and it is admitted that the bridge was so defective throughout its entire length. As the dividing line between them is stated to intersect the bridge, some part of it must be within each. It did not appear that the whole of the three fourths part of the bridge, apportioned to Newburyport, was in fact included within the boundaries of that city. The jury were instructed that it was the duty of the city to keep that part of the bridge described in the indictment in repair. We suppose it was intended to apply this ruling to such part of the bridge as lay without the limits of Newbury' port, as well as that within its limits, if there were any such part assigned by the commissioners to be kept in repair by that city. And we think the ruling was correct in this respect. The duty to keep ways and bridges in repair, imposed by Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>44, \u00a7 1, relates only to such as are situated within the city or town ; but the liability to indictment under \u00a7 24 extends to any of the ways or bridges which the town is by law obliged to keep in repair. Although the general law provides for the maintenance of all roads and bridges, by imposing the duty upon each town to support those that are within its limits, yet the legislature may undoubtedly, by general provision or by special statute, modify this' general rule, in particular cases, in order to make the distribution or the burden more equal than it might other<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>wise prove to be in its operation. This it does by authorizing or requiring the county to assume a part of the expense of certain roads or bridges; thus indirectly imposing upon all the other towns in the county a part of the burden which, by the general rule, would fall upon the town within which the road or bridge was situate; or by authorizing a part of such expense to be imposed upon particular towns near to or benefited by such road or bridge. The power to impose the burden by way of contribution in money involves the right to do so by making it the duty of the town to keep its portion of the way or bridge in repair. And from this duty to maintain and repair flows the liability for defects, whether by action for damages or by indictment. <em>Malden &amp; Melrose Railroad Co. </em>v.
