She had taken a cargo at the Chincha Islands, and was bound to the Canary Islands. The Chincha Islands are a group of three small islands situated in the Pacific Ocean, off the coast of Peru, distant about fourteen miles from the shore; are valuable for large deposits of guano; belong to Peru; but have no port or custom-house, and no clearance can be effected there. Vessels carrying guano from the Chinchas clear from Callao, and when bound to these islands are obliged to call at Callao, enter at the custom-house, and get a permit to load. Callao is on the mainland, and one hundred and twenty miles distaiit from the Chinchas. Vessels on their way to the Chinchas are usually detained at Callao two or three days, during which time the crew almost invariably desert, and it becomes necessary to ship a new crew at Callao to work the vessel to and from the Chincha Islands, and to load her while there. On the return to Callao, these men, usually natives, are discharged, and a crew of seamen shipped for the voyage. Vessels, after loading at the Chinchas, get their supply of water at Callao for the voyage, and are seldom detained there less than two days.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b249-6\">If, upon these facts, the court should be of opinion that the continuation clause in the policy attached, then judgment was to be rendered for the plaintiffs for $315.56 and interest; otherwise, judgment for the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b249-7\"><em>II C.

B. 523. But it by no means follows that while in the port of Callao for that purpose, she was on a passage, within the meaning of the continuation clause in a time policy not mentioning particular ports or voyages.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">A nearer analogy is afforded by the case in which it was held by Lord Ellenborough and the whole court of king\u2019s bench that under a policy of insurance \u201c at and from Portneuf to London, warranted to sail on or before \u201d a certain day, a vessel which had left Portneuf and dropped down the St. Lawrence thirty miles (with a sufficient crew for river navigation, but not for the voyage to London) to Quebec, which was the nearest place at which she could obtain a clearance, had not sailed. <em>Ridsdale </em>v. <em>Newnham, </em>4 Camp. 111; <em>S. C. </em>3 M. &amp; S. 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">But the safest guides in the interpretation of this policy are to be found in the adjudications of this court upon time policies containing words which, if not exactly identical, may for the purposes of this case be deemed equivalent.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">In <em>Wood </em>v. <em>New England Insurance Co. </em>14 Mass. 31, the point adjudged was that a vessel, which at the expiration of the year was actually in a port into which she had been carried by overwhelming force while proceeding oh her voyage on the high <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>seas, was \u201c at sea \u201d within the meaning of such a clause. The authority of the decision has been limited to that point, and the more general <em>dicta </em>of Chief Justice Parker in delivering the opinion disapproved, in the later cases. See <em>Gookin </em>v. <em>New England Insurance Co. </em>12 Gray, 510-514.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">In <em>Bowen </em>v. <em>Hope &amp; Merchants' Insurance Cos. </em>20 Pick. 275, and 12 Gray, 512 note, the vessel which was held to be \u201c at sea,\u201d and \u201c on a passage,\u201d had left her port of lading, fully prepared to proceed to her port of destination, and with a real intent to do so, and had dropped down the straits seven or eight miles, and had then been obliged by head winds to come to anchor, but without relinquishing the intention of proceeding on her voyage as soon as wind and weather would permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">In <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Union Insurance Co. </em>12 Gray, 501, 519, a vessel anchored in the open roadstead at the Chincha Islands, for the purpose of taking in cargo, was held not to be \u201c at sea,\u201d within the meaning of the first part of the continuation clause. And in <em>Gookin </em>v. <em>New England Insurance Co. </em>Ib. 501, 506, a vessel was held to have arrived at a <em>\u201c </em>port of destination,\u201d under the last part of the clause, upon her arrival at a similar open road-stead at Ypala for a like purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">In <em>Wales </em>v. <em>China Insurance Co. </em>8 Allen, 380, it was held that a vessel which was chartered to one port, there to receive orders which should indicate to her within twenty-four hours whether to discharge there or go on to another port, and to be kept at the first port as long, and sent to such other port, as those from whom she was to take her orders might elect; and which did not, within twenty-four hours after giving notice of her arrival at the first port, receive orders to go to another port; had arrived at a port of destination, within the meaning of the last part of the continuation clause. There is no intimation in the opinion that the vessel could be considered as \u201cat sea\u201d or \u201c on a passage,\u201d or as not having arrived at her port of destination, for any longer period than while the port which she entered might be considered as a port into which she had put for orders only.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>The case at bar is less consistent with a continuation of the risk than either of these. At the expiration of the year, the vessel was not in an open roadstead, but in a safe harbor, into which she had put voluntarily, not for orders merely, but to obtain the necessary clearance, water and crew for her further voyage, with none of which had she been previously supplied. The necessary conclusion is that she was not \u201c on a passage.\u201d The policy therefore ended with the year, and the insurers are not entitled to an additional premium.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
