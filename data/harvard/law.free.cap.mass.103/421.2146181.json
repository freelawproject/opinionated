J., who allowed the following bill of exceptions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ae0\">\u201c At the trial but one witness was produced on the part of the Commonwealth, and she said that her name was <em>1 </em>Catherine Mars,\u2019 pronouncing it as one syllable; but she did not say how her name was spelled. She also testified that she was assaulted and beaten by the defendant. The defendant contended, on her testimony, that the proof offered was a variance from the charge, and that evidence of an assault on \u2018 Catherine Mars \u2019 would not sustain a charge of an assault on \u2018 Catherine Marres; \u201d and contended as matter of law that Marres is not <em>idem sonans </em>with Mars. The attorney for the Commonwealth contended that, as there was no question as to the identity of the transaction, or the persons concerned in it, the mistake in the spelling of the name was immaterial, unless there was also a difference in the pronunciation ; and that the word Marres, if accented on the first syllable, did not differ substantially or perceptibly from the word Mars. The court refused to rule on the question of <em>idem </em>sonans; but instructed the jury that, if the charge was in other respects proved, and if they found that in pronunciation the word Marres was substantially identical with the word Mars, they could find the defendant guilty.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number><em>F.

But the judge was in error in instructing the jury that it would be sufficient if they should find that in pronunciation Maraes was <em>\u201c </em>substantia.ly identical \u201d with Mars. They should have been instructed that the name must be strictly and accurately proved as charged. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morse, </em>14 Mass. 217. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Manley, 12 </em>Pick. 173. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blood, </em>4 Gray, 31, 33. The language of the whole instruction, addressed to laymen, unused to the niceties of criminal law, was adapted to induce them to jump over any technicality as immaterial, especially when following such language as was used in argument by the attorney for the Commonwealth.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b432-5\"><em>C.
