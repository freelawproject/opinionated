The Mount Hope Iron Company hereby agree to accept said engine according to the foregoing' description, and pay for the same upon the terms named; to furnish the outboard pillow block, and forging for main shaft; to receive the engine on their dock at Somerset, make no charge for wharfage, do all the dray age, hauling and handling required in transporting from their wharf and setting up, and furnish all necessary facilities and use of machine shop and tools for that purpose free of charge to the Hope Iron. Works; also to furnish the foundation of the engine from plans of the Hope Iron Works, and the long holding-down bolts, and all steam and exhaust pipes; and also to bring the water and connect with the condenser; the Hope Iron Works furnishing at Somerset only the skilled labor required in setting and starting the engine.\u201d It further appeared that the engine was landed at the wharf mentioned in the contract, and was transported thence by the plaintiffs to their works, some rods distant; that the plaintiffs had sent to the Hope Iron Works for men to come and set up the engine, and were preparing the foundation at their own works, when the defendant attached the cylinder and bed piece as the property of the Hope Iron Works ; that, at the time of the attachment, it would have required about four weeks\u2019 labor to set up and start the engine; and that the plaintiffs had paid for the work as it progressed, and had, at the time of the landing and of the attachment, paid the whole price except the twenty per cent, named in the . ontract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-5\">The only question raised in the case was, whether the title to the engine had become complete in the plaintiffs at the time of the attachment; and the judge, being of opinion that upon the foregoing facts the title had vested in the plaintiffs at that time, directed the jury to return a verdict for them, which was done; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b74-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number><em>E.

In that case there was no payment of the purchase money, and, by the terms of the contract, no part of it was to be paid until the machine should be set up at the works of the purchaser, and made to operate to his satisfaction. The purchaser was not to add to the machine any materials or labor of his own, before it was thus completed; and if not completed so as to work to the satisfaction of the purchaser, the seller or manufacturer was to take it away again. The court held th\u00a7t, although the machine was upon the premises of the purchaser and attached to his mill, the legal title and right of possession did not pass until the terms of the contract had been fulfilled, or the purchaser had accepted the machine so as to become liable for the price.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">In the present case, there was, in fact, and by the terms of the contract, payment for the property as the work progressed, reserving a margin of twenty per cent, until the engine should be \u201c started in a satisfactory manner.\u201d The contract provided that the engine should be delivered, at a certain date, on the wharf at Somerset; and thereupon the purchasers were to transport it to their works, prepare a foundation for it, and add to it materials and work of their own ; the sellers being obligated to furnish towards the work necessary to be done in setting up and starting the engine \u201c only the skilled labor required.\u201d It is manifest from the whole tenor and terms of the contract that the delivery provided for, at the wharf in Somerset, was intended to be a delivery which should transfer to the purchasers the possession of the engine, and that it did vest in them the legal right of possession and property. They might perhaps have rescinded the contract and restored the title, upon a subsequent breach of the contract by the other party, or a failure to complete and start the engine in a satisfactory manner. But they might also elect to retain the possession and title, relying upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>their contract, and the margin of twenty per cent, of the price in their hands, for their indemnity. At the time of the attachment, the plaintiffs were in possession of the engine, including the cylinder and bed piece, with a right of possession and property which was valid and sufficient against the Hope Iron Works and their creditors. The ruling of the court below was correct, and the <em>Exceptions must be overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
