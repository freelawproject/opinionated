The judge refused the defendant's request for a ruling that evidence that a man named \u201cWormald \u201d or \u201c Jo \u201d fought with the defendant was insufficient to warrant a conviction, but instructed them that they must be satisfied on the whole evidence that the Wormald with whom the tight occurred was Joseph Wormald; and also declined to direct the jury \u201c to find specially upon the proof as to the Christian name of Wormald.\u201d <em>Hdd, </em>that the defendant had no ground of exception.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-8\">Indictment for prizefighting, charging that Edward O\u2019Baldwin and Joseph Wormald, <em>\u201c </em>by and in pursuance of a previous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>appointment and arrangement made by and between them to meet and engage in a fight with each other, did meet and engage in a fight with each other, against the peace,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-5\">At the trial of O\u2019Baldwin, in the superior court, before <em>Brig</em>ham, C. J., the jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the judge allowed a bill of exceptions of which the following is the material part: \u201c In the argument, the defendant\u2019s counsel contended that there had been no evidence regarding Joseph Wormald; that all the witnesses but one, in speaking of the person with whom O\u2019Baldwin fought, spoke of him as 6 Wormald\u2019 or \u2018Mr. Wormald;\u2019 that the one witness testified that O\u2019Baldwin, on being interrogated how he received a particular injury, answered that \u2018Jo\u2019 gave it to him; and that the foregoing was all the testimony in the case upon the subject of Wormald\u2019s name. And the judge, upon request, referred to his minutes of the trial, and stated that they contained no other evidence, and that he had no recollection of any other evidence and should submit that fact to the memory of the jury. The district attorney contended that there was other evidence, and that one or more of the witnesses for the Commonwealth had spoken of Wormald as Joseph Wormald; and thereupon the question as to such evidence was submitted to the jury upon the claim of the defendant\u2019s counsel, and of the district attorney. No evidence was offered at the trial on the part of the defendant. The defendant\u2019s counsel then asked the judge to instruct the jury that it was incumbent upon the Commonwealth to prove that the arrangement and appointment and the fight alleged in the indictment were made and entered into between Edward O\u2019Baldwin and Joseph Wormald, and if the Commonwealth failed to prove that Joseph Wormald participated in the same the jury could not properly convict the defendant; and that evidence that a man called \u2018 Wormald \u2019 or \u2018 Jo \u2019 participated, without any other evidence of his Christian name, was insufficient, and the jury must acquit. The judge declined so to instruct the jury; and .instructed them that they must be satisfied upon the whole evidence in the case that the Wormald proved to nave participated in the fight was Joseph Wormald. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>judge was requested to direct the jury to find specially upon the proof as to the Christian name of Wormald; but he refused so to direct the jury.

On the claim of the defendant\u2019s counsel, the state of the minutes of the judge, and the judge\u2019s recollection, the defendant was entitled to have the jury instructed that they were not warranted in inferring that the \u201cWormald\u201d referred to by some witnesses, and the \u201cJo\u201d referred to by one witness, were one and the same person, or were Joseph Wormald. \u201cJo\u201d might mean Josiab, Jonah, Joel, Job or Jonas, just as well as Joseph. And \u201c Wormald\u201d only might be any Wormald. There surely was room for a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b222-7\"><em>C.

Evidence that the person proved to have participated with the defendant was called \u201cWormald\u201d or \u201cJo\u201d was sufficient in law to warrant the jury in finding that his name was Joseph Wormald. The question of the amount and weight of the evidence on that point was rightly submitted to the jury. No question appears to have been made at the trial as to the degree to which the jury must be satisfied of the facts which the Commonwealth was bound to prove. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
