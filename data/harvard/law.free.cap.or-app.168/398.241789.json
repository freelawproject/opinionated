Petitioners, the Joint Council of Teamsters #37 and the Oregon, Southern Idaho and Wyoming District Council of Laborers, assert that BOLI\u2019s adoption of various prevailing wage rates was invalid because BOLI exceeded its statutory authority and failed to give notice before adopting the rates. BOLI responds that petitioners\u2019 challenges are moot because the challenged rates have been superseded by rates adopted in July 1999, and are therefore no longer in effect. BOLI argues in particular that, because ORS 279.350(2) would bar petitioners from recouping lost wages even if the challenged prevailing wage rates were invalidated, this court\u2019s decision on the validity of those rates would have no practical effect on the rights of the parties. For the reasons explained below, we agree with BOLI that petitioners\u2019 challenges to the superseded prevailing wage rates are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">In order to best understand petitioners\u2019 challenges and the relevant sequence of events, we begin with a brief description of the purpose and operation of Oregon\u2019s prevailing wage rate statutory scheme. The primary purpose of the prevailing wage law is to \u201censure that contractors compete on the ability to perform work competently and efficiently while maintaining community established compensation standards.\u201d ORS 279.349. ORS 279.359 requires BOLI to \u201cdetermine the prevailing rate of wage for workers in each trade or occupation in each locality * * * at least once each year by means of an independent wage survey.\u201d For purposes of that statute, a \u201clocality\u201d is one of 14 geographical districts identified by statute, ORS 279.348(2), and \u201cprevailing rate of wage\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-6\">\u201cthe rate of hourly wage * * * paid in the locality to the majority of workers employed on projects of similar character in the same trade or occupation, as determined by the Commissioner of [BOLI]. In making such determinations, the commissioner shall rely on an independent wage survey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>to be conducted once each year. However, if it appears to the commissioner that the data derived from the survey alone are insufficient to establish the rate, the commissioner also shall consider additional information such as collective bargaining agreements, other independent wage surveys and the prevailing wage rates determined by appropriate federal agencies or agencies of adjoining states. If there is not a majority in the same trade or occupation paid at the same rate, the average rate of hourly wage * * * paid in the locality to workers in the same trade or occupation shall be the prevailing rate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">Enforcement of the \u201cprevailing wage rates\u201d is effectuated by ORS 279.350, which requires all contractors and subcontractors to pay \u201cworkers upon all public works * * * not less than the prevailing rate of wage\u201d for that occupation in the locality where the labor is performed. Any contractor or subcontractor who violates that requirement \u201cshall be liable to the workers affected in the amount of their unpaid minimum wages * * * and in an additional amount equal to said unpaid wages as liquidated damages.\u201d ORS 279.356.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">With that background in mind, we now turn to the undisputed facts underlying petitioners\u2019 challenges to various prevailing wage rates set by BOLI between February 1998 and January 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">On February 15, 1998, BOLI issued a 70-page publication entitled \u201cPrevailing Wage Rates for Public Works Contracts in Oregon,\u201d which identified specific prevailing wage rates by occupation and district. Five months later, on July 1,1998, BOLI published an updated version of the same \u201cPrevailing Wage Rates for Public Works Contracts in Oregon\u201d pamphlet. On August 28, 1998, petitioners filed a petition for review of the February and July 1998 publications pursuant to ORS 183.400,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alleging that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>the rates published therein were invalidly promulgated \u201crules.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">On October 29, 1998, while the above petition was pending, BOLI adopted Temporary Rule OAR 839-016-0700, which provided that the wage rates published in the July 1998 \u201cPrevailing Wage Rates for Public Works Contracts in Oregon\u201d were the prevailing wage rates for work commenced after July 1, 1998. The rule was to be effective from October 29,1998 to April 27,1999, and was basically a readoption of the wage rates published in July 1998. BOLI\u2019s \u201cStatement of Need and Justification\u201d for adoption of that temporary rule provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\">\u201cIf the appellate court were to hold that the prevailing rates of wage must be established through rulemaking, the challenged [July 1, 1998] rates would be invalid. That situation would create a hiatus in the existence of valid prevailing rates of wage extending forward from July 1, 1998, contrary to the legislative mandate. The hiatus would undermine the legislative policies announced in ORS 279.349. It would also preclude enforcement of those rates through any of the various procedures available under ORS 279.355 and 279.370.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">\u201cTemporary rulemaking is necessary in order to avoid the potential consequences of the invalidation of the July 1, 1998 prevailing rates of wage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Just a few days later, on November 2, 1998, BOLI adopted Temporary Rule OAR 839-016-0705, which provided that the prevailing wage rates for work beginning October 1, 1998, were the rates stated in the July 1998 publication of \u201cPrevailing Wage Rates,\u201d as amended by \u201cOregon Determination 98-02.\u201d This second temporary rule was to be effective from November 2, 1998 through May 1, 1999. BOLI\u2019s Statement of Need and Justification again provided that \u201c[tjemporary rulemaking is necessary in order to avoid the potential consequences of the invalidation of the July 1,1998, prevailing rates of wage as amended by <em>Oregon Determination 98-02, </em>effective October 1,1998.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>On December 29, 1998, petitioners filed two additional petitions for review \u2014 one challenging the validity of Temporary Rule OAR 839-016-0700 and the other challenging the validity of Temporary Rule OAR 839-016-0705.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">On January 6, 1999, BOLI adopted a permanent rule, OAR 839-016-0700, that repealed both of the challenged temporary rules and declared that, for work performed in the period beginning January 15,1999, the prevailing wage rates were those published in a new version of \u201cPrevailing Wage Rates on Public Works Contracts in Oregon,\u201d dated January 15,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">On January 15, 1999, petitioners filed a complaint asking the Marion County Circuit Court to enjoin BOLI from enforcing the Commissioner\u2019s January 6, 1999, prevailing wage rates. Petitioners argued that enforcement of the rule would result in irreparable harm because many of its members would receive lesser wages due to the inaccuracy of the wage rates in the rule. Ultimately, the court dismissed the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the basis that, under ORS 183.400, the Court of Appeals has exclusive jurisdiction to determine the validity of agency rules. A judgment was entered dismissing the case with prejudice, and petitioners immediately filed a notice of appeal from that dismissal. Thereafter, on February 19, 1999, petitioners filed a petition for judicial review of OAR 839-016-0700 pursuant to ORS 183.400.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Thus, by mid-February 1999, petitioners had five separate actions \u2014 four petitions for review of prevailing wage rates and one appeal relating to enforcement of prevailing wage rates \u2014 pending before this court. BOLI moved to dismiss the petitions for review of its July 1998 wage rates and the two temporary rules as moot, arguing that those rates had been superseded by BOLI\u2019s January 15,1999, rule adopting prevailing wage rates.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We denied BOLI\u2019s motions to dismiss petitioners\u2019 rule challenges as moot \u201cwith leave to renew in the briefs,\u201d but granted petitioners\u2019 motion to consolidate all five pending actions for briefing and argument. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>On June 16,1999, while briefing in the consolidated case was pending, BOLI adopted OAR 839-016-0700. That rule became effective on July 1, 1999, and provided that the prevailing wage rates for work performed after that date were those stated in a new July 1, 1999, edition of \u201cPrevailing Wage Rates On Public Works Contracts in Oregon.\u201d There is no indication in the record that petitioners filed a challenge to the July 1,1999, prevailing wage rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">On review of the five consolidated actions described above, petitioners raise 11 assignments of error. Petitioners\u2019 first 10 assignments of error repeat the same two assertions with respect to each of the five challenged wage <em>rates </em>\u2014 viz., the rates published on February 15 and July 1, 1998, the rates adopted by temporary OAR 839-016-0700 on October 29,1998, the rates adopted by temporary OAR 839-016-0705 on November 2, 1998, and the rates adopted by permanent OAR 839-016-0700 on January 15, 1999. Specifically, petitioners contend that, in adopting each of those sets of wage rates, BOLI (1) failed to give notice before their adoption, as required by its own rule, OAR 839-016-0000; and (2) exceeded its statutory authority by</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">\u201ccollapsing occupation classifications, utilizing multi-district averaging, utilizing the 2% or 200 hour policy, averaging the hourly wage rates of workers employed on highway construction projects with the hourly wage rates of workers employed on parking lot construction projects, failing to survey owner-operator trucking firms, and separating occupations in heavy construction with occupations in highway construction.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Petitioners\u2019 eleventh assignment relates only to the circuit court\u2019s dismissal .of petitioners\u2019 request for an injunction barring BOLI from enforcing the prevailing wage rates adopted by rule on January 6,1999. Petitioners assert that the circuit court erred in dismissing their request for injunctive relief for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Before turning to consider whether petitioners\u2019 challenges to the various sets of prevailing wage rates are moot, we first address the separate question of whether the circuit court erred in dismissing petitioners\u2019 Januaiy 15,1999, complaint requesting that BOLI be enjoined from enforcing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>wage rates adopted on January 6,1999. The circuit court dismissed petitioners\u2019 complaint on the ground that, pursuant to ORS 183.400(1), the Court of Appeals has exclusive jurisdiction over challenges to the validity of administrative rules. We conclude that the trial court did not err. Here, petitioners\u2019 request for an injunction barring enforcement of OAR 839-016-0700 was nothing more than a challenge to that rule\u2019s validity, and the trial court therefore lacked subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See Alto v. State Fire Marshal, </em>319 Or 382, 390-95, 876 P2d 774 (1994) (circuit court lacks jurisdiction to enjoin enforcement of agency rules when essence of action is a challenge to the validity of agency rules; pursuant to ORS 183.400, Court of Appeals has exclusive jurisdiction over direct challenges to validity of agency rules); <em>Bartholomew v. Pearce, </em>131 Or App 658, 661, 886 P2d 1060 (1994) (where plaintiffs claim for declaratory relief was, in essence, a direct challenge to agency rules, circuit court lacked jurisdiction; jurisdiction over direct rule challenges lies exclusively with the Court of Appeals).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm the circuit court\u2019s dismissal of CA A105305.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">We now turn to petitioners\u2019 direct rule challenges. As noted, petitioners\u2019 principal assignments of error with respect to the validity of the challenged wage <em>rates </em>\u2014 viz., the rates published in February and July 1998, the rates adopted by temporary OAR 839-016-0700 on October 29, 1998, the rates adopted by temporary OAR 839-016-0705 on November 2, 1998, and the rates adopted by permanent OAR 839-016-0700 on January 6, 1999 \u2014 assert that, in adopting each of those sets of wage rates, BOLI failed to give notice before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>adoption of the rates and exceeded its statutory authority in using certain methods to calculate the rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">BOLI\u2019s threshold response is that we need not reach the merits of petitioners\u2019 procedural and substantive challenges to the various sets of prevailing wage rates because petitioners\u2019 challenges are moot. BOLI points out that <em>none </em>of the prevailing wage rates challenged by petitioners in this case is currently in effect, because the prevailing wage rates adopted on July 1,1999, superseded all prior prevailing wage rates. Thus, BOLI argues, any decision regarding the validity of the prevailing wage rates challenged by petitioners would have \u201cno practical effect on the parties\u2019 rights\u201d and petitioners\u2019 challenges are therefore moot.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For the reasons explained below, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\"><em>Brumnett v. PSRB, 315 Or </em>402, 405, 848 P2d 1194 (1993), prescribes a two-part inquiry into whether a case is justiciable. The first question is whether a case presents an actual and substantial controversy between parties having adverse legal interests. <em>Id. </em>The second question is whether the court\u2019s decision will have a practical effect on the rights of the parties, <em>i.e., </em>whether the case is moot. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court recently summarized the doctrine of mootness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">\u201cAppellate courts are prohibited from deciding abstract, hypothetical, or contingent questions. A court\u2019s decision on a matter must have some practical effect on the rights of the parties to the controversy. Even if a case otherwise is justiciable, if the court\u2019s decision \u2018no longer will have a practical effect on or concerning the rights of the parties,\u2019 then the matter will be dismissed as moot. For example, a case becomes moot when an event occurs that \u2018render[s] it impossible for the court to grant effectual relief.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Hamel v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number><em>Johnson, </em>330 Or 180, 184, 998 P2d 661 (2000) (brackets in original; citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-4\"><em>Barcik v. Kubiaczyk, </em>321 Or 174, 895 P2d 765 (1995), is illustrative. There, several high school seniors challenged school district regulations that authorized school administrators to review and censor student publications and to discipline students who distributed or published material in violation of the regulations. Despite the fact that the seniors had graduated at the time of its ruling, the trial court entered a judgment declaring that the students\u2019 rights to free speech had been violated. The Supreme Court reversed, concluding that, under Oregon law, the plaintiffs\u2019 claims for declaratory and injunctive relief became moot upon their graduation from high school. The court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-5\">\u201cOn the date of the circuit court\u2019s judgment, no Senior plaintiff * * * had any right or claim that would be affected by a declaratory judgment. Senior plaintiffs suffered no continuing harm from the alleged past deprivation of their Article I, section 8, rights. Similarly, because no Senior plaintiff * * * had any right that was being violated at the time the circuit court entered judgment, there was nothing for the circuit court to enjoin with regard to Senior plaintiffs. Senior plaintiffs\u2019 claims were moot[.]\u201d <em>Barcik, </em>321 Or at 187.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Oregon courts have applied the mootness doctrine in challenges to administrative rules on several occasions. For example, in <em>Hay v. Dept. of Transportation, </em>301 Or 129, 719 P2d 860 (1986), the Supreme Court concluded that a challenge to an expired rule was moot regardless of the fact that the agency might readopt the challenged rule in the future. Similarly, we dismissed as moot a challenge to a temporary rule that had been replaced by a permanent rule, reasoning that \u201c[t]he rule petitioners attack is no longer in existence, and our decision would \u2018merely resolve an abstract question without practical effect.\u2019 <em>\u201dMcKnight v. LCDC, </em>69 Or App 642, 687 P2d 170 (1984), <em>rev den </em>299 Or 522 (1985). Citing <em>Barcik </em>and <em>Hay, </em>BOLI argues that, because the challenged rules are no longer in effect, petitioners\u2019 challenges to the validity of the various sets of prevailing wage rates are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Petitioners respond that their rule challenges are not moot. Before addressing the substance of petitioners\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>position, it is useful to clarify what petitioners are <em>not </em>arguing. First, petitioners do not dispute that the various rules that they challenge have been superseded by the July 1, 1999, prevailing wage rates and are thus no longer in effect. Second, petitioners do not dispute that, even if we declared all of the challenged prevailing wage rates invalid, ORS 279.350(2) would bar them from collecting lost wages. <em>See </em>ORS 279.350(2) (\u201cAfter a contract for a public work is executed with any contractor * * * the amount of the prevailing rate of wage shall not be subject to attack in any legal proceeding by any contractor or subcontractor in connection with that contract.\u201d). Thus, petitioners effectively concede that, even if we were to declare any of the challenged wage rates invalid, that determination would not have the \u201cpractical effect\u201d of enabling them to recoup any wages to the extent that past wage rates were erroneously fixed.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">Petitioners\u2019 anti-mootness argument is, instead, that the challenged now-superseded rates have a continuing \u201cripple effect,\u201d skewing the determination of present and future wage rates. In petitioners\u2019 view, the 1998 rates indirectly formed the basis for the July 1999 prevailing wage rates and, consequently, a declaration that the challenged rates were invalid would have the \u201cpractical effect\u201d of enabling petitioners to bring a successful challenge to the July 1999 prevailing wage rates. In particular, petitioners\u2019 position depends on a series of interdependent premises concerning the operation of the prevailing wage rate statutory scheme in general and BOLI\u2019s conduct in adopting the 1999 prevailing wage rates specifically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-5\">(1) In determining prevailing wage rates, BOLI \u201cshall rely on an independent wage survey.\u201d ORS 279.350; ORS 279.359.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">(2) Pursuant to ORS 279.359, BOLI\u2019s independent wage survey entails asking workers in each district and in each occupation how much they are getting paid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">(3) When BOLI did its wage survey for purposes of determining the July 1999 prevailing wage rates, the workers it surveyed were getting paid under contracts that had necessarily incorporated the prevailing wage rates effective at that time, <em>i.e., one of the challenged 1998 prevailing wage rates.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>(4) Therefore, the challenged prevailing wage rates adopted by BOLI in February 1998, July 1998, October 1998, and November 1998 formed the \u201cempirical basis\u201d of BOLI\u2019s 1999 wage survey. Put another way, the challenged prevailing wage rates \u201ccorrupted\u201d the July 1999 wage rates by improperly lowering pay rates that, via the survey results, formed the basis for the July 1999 rates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-4\">(5) Given the \u201cripple effects\u201d that the 1998 rates have had on the current 1999 rates, a declaration by this court that the 1998 rates were invalid would have the \u201cpractical effect\u201d of enabling petitioners to bring a successful challenge to the July 1999 rates. According to petitioners, \u201cthe corruption of the 1999 data due to defects in the 1998 rules can <em>only </em>be addressed through the challenges to the 1998 rules.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">BOLI offers two responses to petitioners\u2019 \u201cripple effect\u201d argument. First, BOLI asserts that nothing in the reviewable record corroborates petitioners\u2019 contention that the July 1999 prevailing wage rates were \u201ctainted\u201d by the 1998 prevailing wage rates. <em>See </em>ORS 183.400(3) (judicial review of a rule shall be limited to examination of the rule itself, the statutes authorizing the rule, and all documents necessary to demonstrate compliance with applicable rule-making procedures). Second, citing <em>Hay </em>and <em>Edmunson v. Dept. of Ins. and Finance, </em>314 Or 291, 838 P2d 589 (1992), BOLI argues that, because the July 1999 rules are not the subject of a challenge, invalidation of the now-superseded challenged wage rates would have no \u201cpractical effect on the rights of the parties\u201d and petitioners\u2019 challenges are therefore moot. In BOLI\u2019s view, even if this court were to declare the challenged prevailing wage rates invalid, such a declaration would not invalidate the existing July 1999 prevailing wage rates, and thus would not redress petitioners\u2019 alleged continuing grievances.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">We agree with BOLI\u2019s second argument. Even assuming, without deciding, that the 1998 prevailing wage rates continue to have some \u201ccollateral effects\u201d on petitioners by virtue of their influence on the current July 1999 rates, we conclude that petitioners\u2019 challenges are moot because it is \u201c Impossible for [us] to grant effectual relief.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hamel, </em>330 Or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>at 184 (quoting <em>Greyhound Park v. Ore. Racing Com., </em>215 Or 76, 79, 332 P2d 634 (1958)). <em>See also Edmunson, </em>314 Or at 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><em>Edmunson </em>is dispositive. There, the petitioner initiated a proceeding in this court, pursuant to ORS 183.400, challenging the validity of two temporary rules adopted by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Division concerning disability rating standards for workers\u2019 compensation claims. The temporary rules were adopted in September and November 1990 as emergency provisions, and both were to expire in May 1991. Petitioner initiated his challenge in December 1990, but on March 26, 1991, before either of the challenged temporary rules had expired by its own terms, the Department adopted the following permanent rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-5\">\u201c(1) These rules apply to the rating of permanent disability pursuant to [ORS] chapter 656 and shall be applied to all claims closed on or after April 1,1991 * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-6\">\u201c(2) For claims in which the worker was medically stationary after July 1, 1990, the Appellate Unit <em>shall apply the disability rating standards in effect on the date of issuance of the Determination Order or Notice of Closure.\u201d </em>OAR 436-35-003 (1991) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Following the promulgation of the permanent rule, the Department moved to dismiss the petitioner\u2019s rule challenges as moot on the ground that the temporary rules had been superseded by the new permanent rule and therefore had no continuing effect of their own. We granted that motion. The petitioner appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-8\">\u201c(1) The permanent rules purport to direct application of the same substantive legal standards that previously were made applicable to claims under the temporary rules \u2014 that is the meaning and consequence of the use of the phrase \u2018in effect\u2019 in permanent OAR 436-35-003(2). (2) But those temporary rules <em>never were \u2018in effect,\u2019 </em>because they were not validly adopted. (3) Thus, a challenge to the temporary rules has continuing validity to the extent that the outcome of the challenge will determine what set of rules is cross-referenced by the pivotal phrase in OAR 436-35-003(2).\u201d <em>Edmunson, </em>314 Or at 295 (emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>The Supreme Court flatly rejected the petitioner\u2019s argument and affirmed our dismissal of the petitions as moot:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-4\">\u201cThat argument demonstrates its own error. Whatever is cross-referenced by the phrase, \u2018in effect,\u2019 in OAR 436-35-003(2), <em>it is that cross-reference in the present rule that establishes the applicable law. </em>That is, <em>all </em>claims are governed by the <em>present permanent </em>rule, not the former temporary ones. If there is an invalid or indeterminate cross-reference in the present rule, that is a problem with the present rule, not with any past rules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-5\">\u201cThe former temporary rules have now passed out of existence, and no one presently purports to be acting pursuant to any power originating in them. A challenge to those temporary rules is, therefore, moot.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">We understand <em>Edmunson </em>to hold that a challenge to the validity of an expired or superseded rule is not \u201ckept alive\u201d for mootness purposes by the fact that the superseded rule may have some continuing effect on the application or validity of a current rule. Rather, under <em>Edmunson, </em>a challenge to a superseded rule is moot even when the superseded rule has some continuing effect on the application of the current rule because any harm allegedly caused by the invalidity of the superseded rule is, in actuality, \u201ca problem with the present rule.\u201d Consequently, in such circumstances, an appellate court can grant \u201ceffectual relief,\u201d <em>Hamel, </em>330 Or at 184, only via a direct challenge to the <em>current </em>rule.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\"><em>Edmunson </em>is controlling here. Even assuming that the challenged rules were invalidly promulgated and that BOLI\u2019s determination of the July 1999 prevailing wage rates was tainted by those \u201cinvalid\u201d rates, petitioners\u2019 challenges are moot. None of the sets of prevailing wage rates that petitioners challenge is currently in effect. Whatever continuing effects the challenged rates have on petitioners arise from the <em>current </em>prevailing wage rates. Accordingly, our consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>of the validity of the prevailing wage rates challenged by petitioners would merely resolve an abstract question without practical effect. <em>See Edmunson, </em>314 Or at 295; <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Holland, </em>290 Or 765, 767, 625 P2d 1318 (1981) (\u201cA case becomes moot * * * when, because of a change of circumstances prior to the appellate decision, the decision would resolve merely an abstract question without practical effect.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Petitioners\u2019 argument that their challenges are not moot because a declaration that the 1998 rates were invalidly promulgated would have the \u201cpractical effect\u201d of enabling them to bring a successful challenge to the July 1999 or current prevailing wage rates is unavailing. The mere possibility that our invalidation of the 1998 rates <em>might </em>have the practical effect of informing another court\u2019s consideration of the validity of the current prevailing wage rates in a future action that petitioners <em>could </em>file, but have not filed \u2014 and may never file \u2014 is not \u201ceffectual relief\u2019 for purposes of mootness. Accordingly, petitioners\u2019 challenges to the superseded prevailing wage rates are dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Judgment of the circuit court in A105305 affirmed; judicial review of A103356, A104745, A104762 and A105386 dismissed as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b436-7\"> ORS 183.400 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-8\">\u201c(1) The validity of any rule may be determined upon a petition by any person to the Court of Appeals in the manner provided for review of orders in contested cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-9\">\u201c(4) The court shall declare the rule invalid only if it finds that the rule: \u201c(a) Violates constitutional provisions;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-10\">\u201c(b) Exceeds the statutory authority of the agency; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-11\">\u201c(c) Was adopted without compliance with applicable rulemaking procedures.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b437-8\"> BOLI does not dispute that the prevailing wage rates adopted in the February 1998 and July 1998 publications are \u201crules\u201d within the meaning of ORS 183.310(8).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b438-7\"> BOLI did not move to dismiss the petition for review of the January 1999 prevailing wage rates because those rates were still in effect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b440-6\"> ORS 183.400 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">\u201c(1) The validity of any rule may be determined upon a petition by any person to the Court of Appeals in the manner provided for review of orders in contested cases. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">\u201c(2) The validity of any applicable rule may also be determined by a court, upon review of an order in any manner provided by law or pursuant to ORS 183.480 or upon enforcement of such rule or order in the manner provided by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">In <em>Alto, </em>the Supreme Court interpreted ORS 183.400 to mean that a case involving a challenge to the validity of an administrative rule may occur in a court other than the Court of Appeals <em>only </em>if it involves the \u201cenforcement\u201d of that rule under ORS 183.400(2). 319 Or at 390-95.
