The complaint averred that the defendants had washed the sand, etc., out of the banks of Knap\u2019s Creek above his land, and caused it to flow down upon his land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-12\">The answer, beside the matters mentioned in the opinion of the Court, averred that the defendants were mining for gold, and that the land was public mineral land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-13\">The jury found a verdict for the defendants, and the Court gave judgment accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-14\">The other facts are stated in the opinion of the Court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b149-15\"><em>D. Belden, </em>and <em>A. C. </em>Niles, for Appellant, in support of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>th\u00e9ir point that the Court erred in refusing the instruction asked by them, cited: <em>Busenius </em>v. Coffee, 14 Cal. 91; <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>29 Cal. 529; <em>Blood </em>v. <em>Light, </em>31 Cal. 117; <em>Fish </em>v. <em>Redington, </em>31 Cal. 185; <em>Leffingwell </em>v. <em>Griffing, </em>31 Cal. 231; <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Calderwood, </em>32 Cal. 109.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b150-6\">A. A. <em>Sargent, </em>and T. B. <em>Reardon, </em>for Respondents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-7\">The pleadings denied plaintiff\u2019s ownership. So the plaintiff and the Court understood them. We wished to admit certain things alleged, and deny others. Plaintiff said we flowed tailings on the land wrongfully. We wished to admit that we ran tailings on a part of the land described, not on all of it, and assert that we did not do so wrongfully, because our claims were older; that we had run tailings just so and just there for twelve years, etc. Under the decision in <em>Busenius </em>v. <em>Coffee, </em>12 Cal. 91, we admitted the fact of running tailings on that part of the land, but asserted our right so to do. Uext, to meet matters of special damage, defendants denied that they had run tailings into the buildings described, and denied that they had covered the land with debris, or injured it for agricultural purposes. Our pleading, in its essential features, may be thus construed : the plaintiff does not own the land; we did not run tailings over the whole tract of land; we did not run any into the buildings described; we did not do certain other special acts of damage alleged; we did run them on a part of the land, hut not unlawfully, because our custom and right so to do continuously, adversely to the plaintiff and all the world, is over five years old; our mining claims were so worked and tailings so run by us twelve years ago, and for years during which the land claimed by plaintiff in this action was vacant and waste.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b150-8\">Will it be considered that the Court erred in refusing, under such pleadings as these, to instruct the jury that we admitted that we \u201c caused tailings to flow on the land of the <em>plaintiff? </em>\u201d and that the jury are to <em>\u201c </em>consider it an admitted fact that defendants did cause tailings to flow on <em>plaintiff\u2019s </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>land?\u201d How could we admit that we flowed plaintiff\u2019s land while denying that he owned the land ?</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b151-6\">By the Court, Sawyer, C. J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">The only point made in appellant\u2019s brief is the refusal of the Court to give to the jury the fourth instruction asked by-the plaintiff, which is in the words following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\">\u201c That the defendants in their answer have not denied the allegation of plaintiff\u2019s complaint, that the defendants caused tailings to flow upon the land of plaintiff, and the jury are bound to consider it as an admitted fact that defendants did cause tailings to flow upon plaintiff\u2019s land.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">The vice in the instruction consists in the use of the words \u201cupon the lands of the plaintiff\u201d and upon \u201cplaintiff\u2019s land.\u201d The answer distinctly takes issue upon the title or ownership of the land. It both denies' the title and ownership of the plaintiff, and alleges title and a right in defendants to flow the tailings upon the land described in the complaint. The answer may be construed, and perhaps intentionally so, as admitting the flowing of tailings upon the land; but it denies that this was wrongfully done. The instruction not only states that the flowage upon the land described in the complaint is admitted, but also assumes, and in terms declares, that the land is the \u201c land <em>of the </em>plaintiff\u201d\u2014\u201c <em>the plaintiff\u2019s </em>land \u201d\u2014and in effect, if literally construed, takes the question of the ownership of the land, the title of the plaintiff, from the jury. The title, however, was directly put in issue, and the instruction, in this particular at least, is objectionable and liable to mislead the jury. We think the Court properly refused the instruction in the form presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">Judgment and order denying new trial affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
