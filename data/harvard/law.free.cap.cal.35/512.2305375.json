HITCHCOCK.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b512-12\">Street Assessment in San Francisco \u2014 Mode of its Authentication. \u2014 An assessment made by the Superintendent of Streets of San Francisco, to cover the sum due for the improvement of a street, is an official act, and must be attested by his official signature.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b512-13\">Idem, as Evidence.\u2014An assessment not thus officially attested, though attached to the diagram and the Superintendent\u2019s warrant, which were in due form and properly attested, does not constitute a valid assessment, and is not admissible in evidence, either by itself or in connection with the warrant and diagram.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b512-14\">Contracts and Assessments for Street Improvements. \u2014 Under the statute regulating street improvements in San Francisco the Board of Supervisors adopted a resolution of intention to grade Clay street from Taylor to Jones and from Jones to Leavenworth streets, and the crossing of Clay and Jones streets, and subsequently ordered said work to be done, and the clerk advertised for proposals for its performance, notifying bidders to put in separate bids for each block and said crossing. The Board awarded a contract for the whole work. The only contract entered into by the Superintendent of Streets, etc., with the successful bidder, was for the grading of one block only\u2014that from Jones and Leavenworth streets. <em>Held, </em>first, that the resolution of intention and its publication constituted the sole authority of the Board to proceed, in the statute mode, to order said work to be done, and that thereby no authority was conferred to act upon any other or different work; second, that the work designated in the resolution of intention constituted one distinct and entire subject matter ; third, that the resolution of award constituted the sole authority to the Super ntendent, who acted ministerially only in making a contract under it, and that the contract, by reason of variance between its terms and the resolution of award, was unauthorized and void; and fourth, that a contract duly authorized under said Act, and executed according to its requirements, is indispensable to the validity of any assessment upon property to pay for street improvements.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b512-15\">Idem\u2014Appeal in, to the Board.\u2014In such case the defect in the contract is not cured by the failure of the lot owners to appeal for its correction to the Board of Supervisors, because, had an appeal been taken the defect could not have been remedied by the Board.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b512-16\">Authority of Board of Supervisors to make Street Improvements. \u2014 Under the provisions of sections three and eight of the Act of 1862, (Stats. 1862, p. 391,) the jurisdiction is vested in the Board of Supervisors to determine whether the whole or a portion, and if a portion what portion of a street improvement shall be done as a single improvement. It is necessary to a proper execution of this important power, and to protect the interests of property owners, that such determination should be distinctly and clearly expressed, so as to enable those interested to act intelligently. When so expressed the subsequent proceedings of the Board must be in strict pursuance thereof as their sole authority, and if not so pursued, such subsequent proceedings will be <em>void\u2014Per </em>Mr. Chief Justice Sawyer.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b512-17\">Appeal from the District Court, Fourth Judicial District, City and County of San Francisco.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b513-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>This was an action to recover a street assessment of the defendant who was a lot owner on Clay and Leavenworth streets, in the City and County of San Francisco.

W. Bingham, Clerk.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-7\">Ho other award was ever made by said Board of any contract for the work mentioned in said resolution, or any part. thereof. The Superintendent entered into a contract with said Griffin for the grading of Clay street from Jones to Leavenworth streets alone, under which contract the plaintiff, as the assignee of Griffin, claimed in this action. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-8\">The foregoing evidence, on the part of the defendant, was received subject to the objection and exception of the plaintiff as to the competency and materiality of the evidence therein contained, the objection being that it related to matters which could not be taken advantage of except on appeal to the Board of Supervisors. The plaintiff had judgment in the Court below. The defendant moved for a new trial, which was denied, and thereupon appealed from both the judgment and the order denying a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b518-9\">The other facts are stated in the opinion of the Court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b518-10\"><em>Cope &amp; Daingerfield, </em>for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-11\">The Court erred in admitting the assessment, diagram, warrant, and return or affidavit of demand and non-payment. The assessment is not authenticated as an official act. It is not signed, and does not appear to have been made by any person having authority to make it. It has none of the requisites of an official document. (Blackw. on Tax Titles, 345.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b518-12\">But it is claimed that the assessment should be considered in connection with the warrant, and that its official character is shown by the latter. The warrant nowhere states by whom the assessment was made, and if any inference on the subject can be drawn from it, it amounts merely to a presumption that the officer who signed it did his duty, and would not have signed it if the assessment had been made by an improper person. This presumption, however reasonable in itself, is wholly unavailing. The plaintiff* is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>asserting a right based, on a special statutory proceeding, and in order to recover he must show that the statute has been complied with. There are no presumptions in his favor. Whatever is necessary to give effect to the proceeding, must affirmatively appear, and no material omission can be supplied by intendment or presumption. The assessment could only be made by the officer designated in the statute, and it is of the essence of the matter that he should appear to have made it. The rule in such cases is too familiar to require discussion. (Blackw. on Tax Titles, 71, 72, and cases cited; <em>Sharpe </em>v. <em>Spier, </em>4 Hill, 86; <em>Varick </em>v. <em>Fallman, </em>2 Barb. 113; <em>Kean </em>v. <em>Cannovan, 21 </em>Cal. 291.) Another answer is that the warrant itself has no effect unless attached to a valid assessment. (Stats. 1862, p. 397.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b519-5\">The proceedings prior to the assessment were not in conformity with the statute, and constituted no foundation for the assessment. The award as well as the preceding resolutions of the Board included the entire grading from Taylor street to Leavenworth, and the only contract authorized was a contract for the whole work. The contract executed was merely for a portion of it, commencing at Jones street, between Taylor and Leavenworth, and extending to the latter. \u00a1No such contract was authorized by the award. The contract was executed by the Superintendent of Public Streets and Highways, and its execution was purely a ministerial act. The Superintendent was the mere creature of the statute, and had uo power except to follow the award. In departing from it, he clearly exceeded his authority, and the case stands precisely as if no contract had been executed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b519-6\">The proceedings presented by the statute are summary, and the rule is universal that a statute authorizing summary proceedings must be strictly pursued. It must be followed step by step, and complied with throughout. A departure at any point is fatal to the jurisdiction; and the same principle applies in all administrative proceedings. (Sedg. on Stat. 347-357; <em>Gregorys. McPherson, </em>13 Cal. 562; <em>Townsend </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>v. <em>Gordon, </em>19 Cal. 188; <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Donner, </em>31 Cal. 480, and cases cited; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>30 Cal. 536.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b520-6\">But it will be said that all these objections relate to matters which cannot be considered by the Court, and could only be taken advantage of by appeal to the Board. But these provisions cannot be regarded as furnishing an exclusive remedy in respect to proceedings invalid for want of jurisdiction. Such a construction would place the Board on a higher footing than any other tribunal in the State, and enable it to act independent of the law from which it derives its power. Its proceedings could never be collaterally assailed, and whatever it chose to do the Courts would be compelled to accept as valid and binding. The objection we make is, not that the Board proceeded irregularly, but that it acted without jurisdiction. .</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b520-7\">The statute provides that an appeal may be taken from the assessment, and such objections made as relate to any of the acts or determinations of the Superintendent, or to the correctness or legality of the assessment. In deciding the appeal, the Board is authorized to correct, alter, or modify the assessment, and require the Superintendent either to correct it, or make a new one in conformity with the decision; and it is provided that the decision shall be final and conclusive as to all errors and irregularities which the Board could have remedied and avoided. (Stats. 1863, p. 530.) In this case the errors complained of were clearly irremediable by the Board on appeal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b520-8\"><em>R. </em>P. &amp; <em>Jabish Clement, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b520-9\">The assessment, diagram, and warrant were attached together. The assessment referred to the diagram; the diagram was without fault; and the warrant referred to the assessment and diagram, and was duly signed and countersigned. The three papers constituted together one document, and the signature of one was the signature of all. They conform exactly to the statute, and sections nine and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>ten (Acts 1862, p. 391) are a perfect answer to the objection that each was not signed. Only one, the warrant, is by the Act required to be signed, (Sec. 10;) and the specification of that one is an exclusion of the others from the requirement.</p>\n<p data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b521-5\">The irregularity or defect complained of, if it is in fact such, is clearly one which might have been remedied and avoided on appeal to the Board. <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Cofran, </em>34 Cal. 310; <em>Beaudry </em>v. Valdez, 32 Cal. 278.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b521-6\">All the objections of appellant to the proceedings prior to the assessment are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Board of Supervisors; and the right to introduce the evidence on which the argument of counsel is based has been expressly denied by this Court. <em>(Nolan </em>v. <em>Reese, </em>32 Cal. 484, and cases there cited.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b521-7\">The property owners certainly had, under the statute, a remedy by appeal upon all the matters to which objection is taken. (Stats. 1862, Sees. 4, 9, 12, p. 391; Stats. 1863, p. 525.) For if the proceedings were not literally and technically correct, the errors or irregularities were such as the Board might easily and would readily have corrected. But the proceedings were absolutely without fault. They were, in regard to the matters objected to, distinctly within the reasoning and the decision of this Court in <em>Emery </em>v. <em>Bradford, </em>28 Cal. 375; and <em>Beaudry </em>v. <em>Valdez, </em>32 Cal. 275.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b521-8\">By the Court, Rhodes, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">It is provided by section nine of the Act of 1862, relative to the improvement of streets in San Francisco, that after the contractor has fulfilled his contract, etc., the Superintendent shall make an assessment to cover the sum due for the work performed and incidental expenses. This is an \u25a0 official act on the part of the Superintendent, and its character and authenticity can be attested in only one manner, and that is the official signature of the Superintendent. Its official character must be made to appear on its face. In <em>Himm</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number><em>elman </em>v. <em>Danos, ante, </em>441, it is held that the copies of the assessment, warrant, and diagram found in the Superintendent\u2019s book could not be considered as a record until signed by the Superintendent, because the making of the record was an official act, and its official character must be made to appear on its face; The document cannot be regarded as an assessment, and, standing by itself, is was clearly inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">But it is contended that it was helped out by the warrant, which was signed by the Superintendent, and countersigned by the Auditor, and was attached to the assessment. This position might be maintained if the two papers constituted only one official document; but they are distinct, and each must be in truth what it purports to be before they can be attached together for the purposes specified in the Act. The position contended for would make a summons without the signature of the clerk valid, if it was attached to the other papers constituting the judgment roll.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">It is further contended, that as the statute, in providing for the assessment, warrant, and diagram, expressly requires only one\u2014the warrant\u2014to be signed by the Superintendent, it was not intended that either of the others should be signed, and the rule, that the mention of the one is the exclusion of the others, is relied upon to sustain the position. There would be great merit in the argument if either of these documents could be regarded as official, in the absence of an official signature. Its application in respect to the signature of th\u00e9 Auditor is very apparent. But the statutory requirement'that the warrant should be signed by the Superintendent was an unnecessary repetition, for the issuing of the warrant as necessarily imports and includes its signature as the averment that a summons was issued by the clerk imports that it received his official signature. This view is illustrated by the positions taken in <em>Himmelman </em>v. <em>Danos </em>in respect to the provisions of the next section of the statute. It is there provided that the Superintendent shall record the assessment, diagram, warrant, and the return, and the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>also, if it has not already been recorded, \u201c and shall sign the record;\u201d and upon the question whether the copies of the first three constituted a record capable of creating the statutory lien, it was held that they did not amount to a record, because the signature of the Superintendent was wanting from the copies.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The street work mentioned in the resolution of intention is the grading of Clay street from Taylor to Jones, and from Jones to Leavenworth streets, and the crossing of Clay and Jones streets. The Board ordered that work to be done; the advertisement for proposals was for the same work\u2014the bidders being notified to put in separate bids for each block and the crossing\u2014and by the resolution of award, the con-, tract for the whole work was awarded to the lowest bidder at specified prices for each block and the street crossing. The contract was entered into between the Superintendent and the contractor for the grading of one block only\u2014that from Jones to Leavenworth streets. It is very apparent from this statement that the contract was wholly unauthorized by the resolution of the Board. The resolution of intention and its publication confer upon the Board jurisdiction to proceed in the prescribed mode to order the proposed work to be done, and in the exercise of the jurisdiction thus acquired the Board has no power to act upon any other or different work. The proposed work is a distinct and entire subject matter. There is a manifest propriety in confining the Board to the specific improvement mentioned in their resolution. The owners of the adjoining lots may be quite willing that the proposed improvement should be made, but they may have well grounded objections to a work either of a greater or less extent. Suppose Clay street had been graded from Kearny to Taylor street. The lot owners might desire that the grading should be continued to Leavenworth street, but if they were sane they would not consent that the block between Taylor and Jones streets should be passed by, and that a vast chasm should be dug in the street by the excavation of about forty thousand cubic yards of earth from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>the block between Jones and Leavenworth streets. The resolution of award is the letter of authority to the Superintendent, and he has no more power to contract for the performance of only a part of the work therein specified than of additional work. The execution of the contract by him was purely a ministerial act, and a contract that does not accord with the award is as destitute of binding force as one executed in the absence of an award. A contract authorized and executed in the mode prescribed by the Act is indispensable to the validity of the_ assessment. This defect is not cured by the failure of the lot holders to appeal to the Board, because had an appeal been taken, the defect could not have been remedied by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b524-7\">Sprague, J., concurring specially:</author>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">I concur in the judgment upon the last point discussed.</p>\n<author id=\"b524-9\">Sawyer, C. J., concurring specially:</author>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">The resolution of intention, the resolution ordering the work, and resolution awarding the contract, do not express the intention of the Board of Supervisors as clearly as they should. The question arising upon the resolutions is, whether the Board designed to make the improvements and let the work out in three separate contracts, or as one\u2014that is to say, whether the work from Taylor to\u2018Jones streets waste be let as one job, the work from Jones to Leavenworth as another, and the crossing of Clay and Jones as another\u2014 or whether the whole was to be done as a single improvement and let in one contract., as one job, and, as a consequence, the expense be distributed equally over the whole. The difference between the two modes of letting may be highly important to property holders, and affect their interests in various ways. It may affect, the right of the Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>to make the improvement at all, or increase or diminish the amount of the assessment on the individual property holders, or affect the right of a majority of the holders of property fronting on the contemplated improvement to take the contract themselves at the lowest bid. For instance, the owners of more than half the frontage on two, three, or more blocks, where the amount and cost of the work varies on each block, might object to the improvements as a whole\u2014as one improvement\u2014the expense to be distributed equally through the whole district to be improved, and, by objecting, prevent the work, while there might be no such objection if the improvement was to be made on each block as a separate work and distinct district, and <em>vice versa. So, </em>a part of the improvement might be made, while the whole might be prevented by objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">So upon the large single contract a majority of the property holders may not desire to unite and take the contract, while, if let in separate contracts and performed as separate works, a majority of the owners on some blocks might desire to take the contract themselves. Unless the intention of the Board is clearly expressed on these points, property holders will be at a loss how to act. They will not be able to determine whether their interests will be best subserved by objecting to or favoring the work. The points made by appellant\u2019s counsel make it necessary to construe the several resolutions referred to, under which the work now under consideration was authorized, if authorized at all. After giving the language of the Board the best consideration I am able, I am compelled to say, that I think the intention manifested in all the resolutions, from the declaration of intention to the awarding of the contract, is to make the improvement as one improvement, and let the whole as a single contract. Resolution Ho. 2,681, awarding the contract, speaks of but one contract, and awards that to Griffin. The price for different portions of the work is different; but this might well be, and it does not affect the question. It was necessary that there should be a separate estimate for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>the crossing, because it is to be assessed in part upon different property. The prior resolutions also seem to contemplate the work as one improvement. The work was, however, let in separate contracts, and the assessments finally separately made, the cost of improving each block on Clay street being assessed upon that block alone, and not the whole extended over the whole as one district. If, then, as I construe the resolution, the improvement was to be made as one improvement, and let as one contract, the authority given was not pursued.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">The contract sued on was, therefore, unauthorized. The defect is not one that could be cured by appeal, for when the time for appeal came the work was done and the mischief past remedy. <em>(Emery </em>v. <em>Bradford, </em>29 Cal. 86.) The contract made, did not pursue the authority, and was, therefore, wholly unauthorized. By the course pursued, the property holders were deprived of an opportunity to avail themselves of important rights, which the statute secures to them as a condition precedent to the levy of a valid assessment upon their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">\u2022Under section three of the Act of <em>1862, </em>(Stats, of 1862, p, 391,) the Board of Supervisors are \u201cempowered to order the whole, or any portion \u201d of a street graded or planked; and by section eight, \u201cthe expense of any work authorized by section three of the Act shall be assessed upon the lots and lands fronting thereon, except as hereinafter specially provided.\u201d The jurisdiction to determine whether the whole or a portion, and if a portion, what portion, shall be done as a single improvement, is vested in the Board of Supervisors. The design is that all improvements of the kind should have some reference to the requirements of the locality, and that the expense should be distributed with some reference to the benefits conferred. In some instances, it would, doubtless, be just, that a single block should be improved, and the expense paid by that block. In others, on a single block the work might be very heavy and expensive, while, for several blocks beyond, it might be extremely light, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>yet the improvement on the single block, where the work is heavy and expensive, might be more advantageous to the other blocks beyond, where the work is light, than to the block itself. In such case, justice would require that the whole work should be made at once, as one improvement, extending over several blocks, and the expense distributed over the whole district or portion of the street thus improved and benefited. And it is with this view that the authority to determine the extent of the improvement is conferred upon the local Board, the members of which are supposed to be able to comprehend the wants of each locality, and merits of each particular ease. It is necessary to a proper execution of these important powers, and to protect the interests of property owners, that the determinations of the Board with respect to these matters should be distinctly and clearly expressed, to enable those interested to act intelligently, and when so expressed, that the proceedings under them should be strictly in pursuance of the authority given to the Boai\u2019d. Unless the authority is pursued the proceedings will be void. The expenses of street crossings are assessed upon different property in part from that for the improvement of the other portions of the street, and for this reason the work must be kept separate, even if embraced in the same contract; and for this reason, also, it would, perhaps, be better to let it as a separate work. But, however this may be, when the Board determines to make an improvement as a single work, the expense to be distributed over the whole, and awards the contract upon that hypothesis, if the contracts are made, the work done in separate contracts, and the assessment made accordingly, the authority is not pursued, and the assessment for the expense is, consequently, invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">On the grounds indicated I concur in the judgment, but I am compelled to dissent as to the other points discussed in the opinion of my associates.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
