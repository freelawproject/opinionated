A. Hogden recovered a judgment against Lewis and others, in the Court of Wm. Hopkins, a Justice of the Peace, for one hundred and seventy-six dollars and fifty cents, and costs taxed at nineteen dollars and seventy-five cents. The defendants took proceedings to appeal to the County Court. The County Court, on motion of plaintiff\u2019s attorney, dismissed the appeal. The ground on which the motion to dismiss was based was, that the appeal was taken upon questions of law alone, and there was no statement. Affidavits upon both sides were filed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b213-13\">The petitioner, Lewis, applied for a writ of mandate to compel the County Court to reinstate the case.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b213-14\"><em>W K. </em>Boucher, and <em>Coffroth Spaulding, </em>for Relator.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b213-15\"><em>W.

The duty to be performed by the respondent in this case was strictly judicial, and there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>no refusal on his part to perform it. He may or may not have erred in the disposition of the case, hut whether he did or did not, his 'action cannot he reviewed by mandamus, nor, indeed, by any other means, for the case is one in which the County Court had final jurisdiction, and if error was committed, there is no remedy. <em>(People </em>v. Sexton, 24 Cal. 78; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>28 Cal. 136; <em>People </em>v. <em>Weston, </em>28 Cal. 669; <em>Cariaga </em>v. <em>Dryden, </em>29 Cal. 307.)</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Counsel for petitioner seem to have relied upon the case of <em>The People </em>v. <em>The County Court of El Dorado County, </em>10 Cal. 19, as authority for this remedy. Ho point was made in that case against the remedy, and the question was not considered by the Court. The writ was denied upon the merits; so neither the opinion nor the judgment of the Court is authority in support of the remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">Mandamus denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">Mr. Justice Rhodes expressed no opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
