Insurance \u2014 successive fires\u2014liability for losses. Where a loss occurs rvithln the terms of a policy against fire, which loss does not amount to the sum insured, the policy will still continue in force, and for a subsequent loss within its terms a recovery may be had not exceeding the full amount of the policy. Arid when loss results by reason of successive fires, and no part is paid, the recovery to be had on the policy by reason thereof is a single sum, constituting one loss.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b298-8\" pgmap=\"298\">2. Same\u2014agreement to arb\u00edtrale\u2014severing claims. Where such successive fires have occurred and the loss has hot been in any manner paid, a provision in the policy that the loss shall be determined by the parties, and that in case of differences arising, then, at the written request of either party, the matter shall be submitted to arbitration, does not contemplate a submission of different items of loss to different arbitrators, or a settlement of a part of the loss by arbitration and a part by the courts.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b298-9\" pgmap=\"298\">3. In such case, a request by the company\u2019s agent for an arbitration, to determine the loss and damage under the first fire, made twenty days after the loss by the second fire, is not such as is contemplated. by the policy, and is one' to which the assured need not accede. He is not bound to split up his cause of action.

Same\u2014waiver of right to arbitration. A clause in a policy of insurance that no suit for the recovery of any claims should be sustained until after an award shall be obtained by arbitration, is one that the parties may waive.

Same\u2014increased hazard\u2014notice to agent. The object of an insurance company requiring the insured to give notice of any increased hazard within his control is to enable the company to take steps to protect its interests; and notice of the facts constituting the increased hazard, to the agent of the company, is the same as notice to such company. When the agent has all the knowledge of increased danger that the assured has, notice to such agent is not required.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b298-12\" pgmap=\"298(23) 299(54)\">6.

An appeal is now prosecuted to this court.</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b299-7\" pgmap=\"299(184) 300(126)\">The evidence shows that at the time of issuing this policy the appellee was a manufacturer of spur wire machines for making fence wire, and his place of business was on the second floor of Burton\u2019s Block, which was on the corner of Clinton and Van Bur\u00e9n streets, in the city of Chicago, appellee being a tenant. Burton\u2019s Block was a brick building six stories high, built for manufacturing. The different parts of this building were let to different persons, each independent and separate manufacturers or in separate business enterprises. On the same floor with appellee were two other tenants, one, Roberts of the spur wire fence company. Other enterprises were conducted on the other floors. This policy was issued on the stock and machinery of appellee situated in that part of the building occupied by him. A fire occurred in that building, greatly damaging it, on June 38, 1889, and appellee sustained damage on his insured property. In July the company was furnished with an invoice of the property of appellee damaged, and on September 7, 1889, proofs of loss were furnished the company. Whilst negotiations for settlement were proceeding, appellee removed certain small articles to-793 Warren street, and took from Burton\u2019s Block, and sold, two spur wire machines for $1600. One Marshall, an adjuster for the company, then said to appellee he must not take' anything from the building until the loss was settled. During, the pendency of negotiations for the settlement of this loss a-second fire occurred, on September 11, 1889, by which all of appellee\u2019s property remaining in the building was destroyed, except as might be its value as old iron. A short time after the fire of June-28, the owner of the building commenced to' repair the same, and work in repairing continued until the time of the second fire.</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-4\" pgmap=\"300\">October 2 and October 31, Marshall, the adjuster, in the name of the two companies that had issued the policies, wrote to Hodge, asking for an arbitration to determine the loss and damage under the fire of June 28, and named one McDonald as their arbitrator, asking the assured also to name one. To these letters Hodge made no reply. On September 18 the company wrote to Hodge, saying that they had learned of the second fire, and that he had machinery in the ruins upon which he claimed a loss, and requesting him to get the property out from the ruins and in shape so that his claim might be definitely arrived at and determined. September 28 the companies wrote to him, that \u201cby reason of the extraordinary work being done on the building lately known as the Burton Block, they denied any liability for loss by reason of the second fire.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-5\" pgmap=\"300\">There'Was evidence tending to show that all the property before there was any fire, was worth $5200.

(Curry v. Commonwealth Ins. Co. 10 Pick. 535 ; Trull v. Roxbury Mutual Ins. Co. 3 Cush. 263; Crombie v. Portsmouth Mutual Ins. Co. 6 Fost. 389.) And where loss results by reason of successive fires, and no part is paid, the recovery to be had on the policy by reason thereof is a single sum, constituting on\u00e9 loss. Where such successive fires have occurred, and the loss has not been in any manner paid, the provisions of a policy providing the loss shall be determined by the agreement between the company and the assured, and if differences arise such differences shall, at the request, in writing, of either party, be submitted to arbitration, do not contemplate a submission of different items of loss to different arbitrators, nor look to the settlement of part of the loss by arbitration and another part to be determined by the adjudication of the courts. The loss to be determined by agreement, or, if differences shall arise, to be determined by arbitration, is the loss sustained by the assured under the terms of the policy. The request of the adjuster asking for an arbitration to determine the loss and damage under the fire of June 28, made more than twenty days after the loss by the second fire, was not a request to submit to arbitration the loss or damage sustained by the assured under the policy. It was not a request that, by the terms of the contract, the insured was bound to accede to. The company would have as much right to insist that each article destroyed was a separate loss, and an arbitration be had before different arbitrators as to each item destroyed. \u201e The company would have no right to place the assured in the position that he must split up his cause of action into several different causes of action.</p> <p id=\"b304-4\" pgmap=\"304\">The second, third and fourth instructions asked by appellant were upon the question of arbitration as to loss by the first fire, and were refused by the court, which refusal is assigned as error. Those instructions sought to state as law that the company, after the second fire, had a right to demand and have an arbitration as to the loss and damage by the first without demanding it as to the second fire. They did not state a correct rule of law, and it was not error to refuse them. And no offer, in writing, was made or requested until after the second fire. The appellee therefore was never placed in a position of declining a reference to arbitration.</p> <p id=\"b304-5\" pgmap=\"304(24) 305(110)\">The proof of loss by the first fire was made within the time required by the terms of the policy. After the second fire, and on September 18, the company wrote appellee, saying they had learned of the second fire, and that he had machinery in the ruins upon which he claimed a loss, and requesting him to get it from the ruins that his claim might be determined. On September 28 the appellee was notified by the companies that \u201cby reason of the extraordinary work being done on the building lately known as the Burton Block, they denied any liability for loss by reason of the second fire.\u201d The company had been notified by letter of the loss consequent on that second fire. The policy contains provisions substantially as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b305-3\" pgmap=\"305\">\u201cA. The assured hereby covenants and agrees to notify the company if the above mentioned premises shall become vacant and unoccupied, and so remain more than thirty days, or of any change in the nature or character of occupation, or of any increase of hazard within the control or knowledge of the assured.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b305-4\" pgmap=\"305\">\u201cB. This policy shall become void and of no effect: 1st, by the failure or neglect of the assured to comply with its terms, conditions and covenants.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b305-6\" pgmap=\"305\">\u201cE. Mechanics\u2019 risk: * * * 1st, mechanics will be allowed to make ordinary alterations and repairs to building, not exceeding fifteen days, during the term of this insurance. Any extension of this privilege must previously be consented to by this company, in writing, on this policy.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b305-8\" pgmap=\"305(110) 306(221)\">It is urged, first, that there was a material increase of hazard, within the knowledge of the assured, by reason of the work in and about repairing the building, and that he failed to notify the company of that increased hazard. The object and purpose of that clause were, that the company should have notice of any increased hazard, and the evidence of James F. Marshall is that he was adjuster for the company. His evidence as abstracted by the appellant is: \u201cA short time after the fire, workmen were sent there to put on a new roof and fire walls and partition and windows. I should say between twenty-five and thirty workmen, and perhaps more than that, were at work in the various parts of the building shortly after' the fire, rebuilding, and repairing the damage done by the fire to the building, and getting it in a tenantable condition. A large number of workmen were there. I was in and out of the building from two to three months. This work commenced three or four days after the fire, and was continuous right along. The effect of a large number of workmen in a building is to increase the hazard. It was a material increase. It was safer with the walls down than with the workmen there. The increase of the risk or haz.ard was considerable\u2014was greater by reason of these alterations and improvements.\u201d The evidence shows that Marshall was at the premises with appellee. Appellee knew that Marshall had all the knowledge in that regard that he possessed. Marshall knew all that appellee was aware of. Marshall represented the appellant. The appellant knew all that was known in that behalf by Marshall. A notice to Marshall would have been notice to the company. To say that appellee must notify Marshall would be to require an absurdity. The object of the clause was that the company should know the circumstances surrounding, and it did know them.</p> <p id=\"b306-5\" pgmap=\"306(133) 307(218)\">By the provisions of. the policy it was provided that \u201cmechanics will be allowed to make ordinary alterations and repairs to building, not exceeding fifteen days, during the term of this insurance. Any extension of this privilege must previously be consented to by this company, in writing, on this policy.\u201d This written clause of the contract for insurance is to be construed to determine its meaning, purpose and intent. In determining and construing this provision of the policy, resort can only be had to the policy itself, and the meaning of' the language used. It will appear from an inspection of the policy that many of its provisions have reference to insurance-of buildings. For instance, the reference to \u201cplans, survey and description,\u201d etc., and \u201cbuildings intended to be secured shall stand on ground owned in fee simple; \u201d \u201cto notify the company if the premises shall become vacant and unoccupied;\u201d \u201cif during this insurance the above mentioned premises be used,\u201d etc.; \u201cfrescoed work, etc., not covered by insurance on the building.\u201d These provisions all form a part of this policy of insurance, and the conclusion results that the same form of policy, in its general terms, is used alike for insurance of personal property or buildings constituting a part of the realty. Such being the case, the provision as to mechanic\u2019s risks may well be construed as applying to cases of insurance of buildings, only,\u2014one of the ordinary printed covenants of a policy, it would appear, whether in the insurance of a building, or of hay in a rick, or lumber piled away from a building, or a stock of goods. No application of the terms. as to mechanics\u2019 risks could be made to the case of lumber not in a building or hay in a rick. Its application, by its very terms, is only to a building insured. \u201cMechanics will be allowed to make ordinary alterations and repairs to building,\u201d etc. This, by its terms, does not apply to personal property, but to buildings, to which ordinary alteration and repairs may be made.</p> <p id=\"b307-4\" pgmap=\"307(153) 308(43)\">Where, as in the city of Chicago, immense buildings are erected and parts pf such buildings leased to different tenants, who do not, in any manner, have charge or control of any part of the building other than the particular room occupied by such tenant, repairs and alterations may be going on on other floors or on other parts of the building, of which a tenant had no notice, and may be continued for more than fifteen days with such tenant ignorant of such work. It may well be held that the object, purpose and intent of that clause were to only apply to the repair or alteration of a building under the control of the assured. Any other construction would be to practically render invalid insurance of personal property under a policy with such a clause, and could not have been the purpose or object of the company,\u2014at least the language used will not admit o\u00ed a construction that such was the purpose. We hold the language as to mechanics\u2019 risk, as used in this policy, was only intended to apply to cases'where buildings were insured under the control of the assured.</p> <p id=\"b308-4\" pgmap=\"308\">The first instruction asked by the appellant was refused, to which the defendant excepted. That instruction was:</p> <blockquote id=\"b308-5\" pgmap=\"308\">\u201cIf the jury believe, from the evidence, that the hazard to the insured property was considerably increased by work and workmen engaged in reconstructing and repairing or altering the building, from shortly after the first fire to'the time of the second fire, and that the plaintiff had knowledge of such facts so increasing said hazard, and that he did not notify the company thereof, and that the consent of the company to the continuance of such work beyond fifteen days was not asked nor obtained and indorsed in writing on the policy, then the policy, by reason of such considerable increase of the hazard, became and was void, even if you believe, from the evidence, that the witnesses Marshall or Hunter saw the progress of said work, and knew of such increase of hazard thereby.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b308-6\" pgmap=\"308\">The instruction sought to state as law that a failure to notify as to the increased hazard,-and the continuance of the. work beyond fifteen days without the consent of the company, rendered the policy void, even though agents of the company saw the progress of the work, etc. We have already held that the agent having knowledge as to the increased hazards was notice to the company, and the policy covering only personal property, the clause as to mechanics\u2019 risk did not apply to it, and it was not error to refuse the instruction.</p> <p id=\"b308-7\" pgmap=\"308\">The fifth instruction asked by appellant was given as modified, as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b308-8\" pgmap=\"308(50) 309(141)\">\u201cIf you believe, from the evidence, that shortly after the first fire, and from that time forward until the second fire, there was a material and considerable increase of hazard from fire to the insured property, occasioned by reconstruction of the premises and building mentioned in the policy, and changes, alterations and repairs of the same, and by the continuous presence during that time in said premises and building of a large number of workmen and mechanics engaged in said work, and that the plaintiff, during all of said time, had knowledge of said continuous work by said workmen, and that the plaintiff did not notify the company of said facts so known to him and so increasing said hazard, and that the agents of the company at Chicago, named in the policy, did not have knowledge of such fact ivhile such work was in progress, then you are instructed that the policy in this case, by reason of said increased hazard, became and was wholly void, and in that ease no verdict can be rendered upon it as to the loss or damage by the second fire.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b309-3\" pgmap=\"309\">The modification, as made by the court, was by the insertion of the words in italics. This instruction proceeds on the theory that the continuous work by workmen increased the hazard, and no notice was given, etc., whereby the policy was rendered void. The modification was in accordance with what we have heretofore said, and it was not error to so modify that instruction.</p> <p id=\"b309-4\" pgmap=\"309\">It is further urged that the clause which provided that no suit for recovery of any claim under this policy shall be sustained until after an award shall have been obtained in the manner provided, is a bar to this action. The parties had a right to waive the clause as to an award, and the plaintiff never requested it, and the defendant never made a request that required the plaintiff to act, and this clause was waived by the parties. The denial of liability under the second fire was a waiver. Williamsburg City Fire Ins. Co. v. Gary, 83 Ill. 453.</p> <p id=\"b309-5\" pgmap=\"309\">Other questions raised are questions of fact, settled by the judgments of the circuit and Appellate Courts.</p> <p id=\"b309-6\" pgmap=\"309\">We find no error in the record, and the judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b309-7\" pgmap=\"309\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
