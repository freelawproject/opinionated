Whitehall, Mich., May 20, 1875.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">\u201c Sixty days after date I promise to pay to the order of Burrows <em>&amp; </em>Jones two hundred and fifty and -f^ths dollars at Lumberman\u2019s State Bank, Whitehall, Mich., for value received with interest after due at ten per cent, per a.rmnm.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Robert Pierson.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">Upon the back of this instrument was indorsed the following: \u201cWe guaranty payment of the within note at maturity without protest. Burrows &amp; Jones.\u201d The evidence showed that this guaranty was indorsed immediately on the making of the note, by the payees mentioned therein, on a sale thereof to the Lumberman\u2019s Bank. The bank subsequently sold the note to the plaintiff, who brought suit, uniting therein the maker and the guarantors.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">Our statute provides that \u201c the guaranty of the payment or of the collection of any promissory note shall hereafter be negotiable, and shall pass to the holder of the note, whether indorsed thereon, or written or printed upon a separate paper; and the assignment, indorsement, or transfer of any promissory note, the payment or collection of which shall have been guarantied, shall operate as, and be an assignment of, all guaranties of any such note; and the holder of such note may maintain an action upon any and all such guaranties, in his own name, subject to all equities existing between the guarantor and the person to whom such guaranty was made.\u201d Comp. L. \u00a7 1564.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-11\">The bank after selling to the plaintiff executed to him a written assignment, but this was not important. <em>Waldron v. Harring </em>28 Mich. 493. The guaranty was an indorsement as well; and the note after the indorsement would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>pass by mere delivery. A joint suit against all the parties is expressly authorized by the statute. Comp. L. \u00a7 5776.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">The circuit court held the action not maintainable.
