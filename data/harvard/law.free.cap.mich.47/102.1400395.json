Jacobs </em>10 Mich. 349; <em>Millar v. Babcock </em>25 Mich. 138; injunction lies to restrain the permanent injury due to the removal of timber: <em>Ryan v.

Since that law became operative, we have held that properly recorded certificates are entitled to the same record privileges with other conveyances of lands, as coming within the meaning of conveyances under the terms of the recording laws. <em>Atwood v. Bearss </em>45 Mich. 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Under the registry laws, where there are two conflicting conveyances, which are otherwise valid, the one which is first recorded has been declared by statute to be entitled to preference. Comp. L. \u00a7 4231. No doubt reasons can be imagined why another rule might in * many cases seem desirable, for the protection of purchasers. But it is for the Legislature and not for the courts to determine the policy of the registry laws, and other reasons have been deemed sufficient to justify the present rule. In the absence of any statute the first grantee would usually prevail, and our own law was undoubtedly designed to make it politic for all land purchasers to record their deeds without delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">So long as sheriffs\u2019 certificates were not entitled to record, they could not come within the statutory priority belonging to the conveyance first recorded. The certificate in the case before us was not recorded either before or after the law of 1875 took effect. We are not therefore required to consider the question whether that statute applies to previous sales. Neither is it necessary to consider the question suggested that the levy was only on such interest as the judgment debtor held.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">The facts shown were such as to entitle complainant to a reversal of the decree below and to a decree in accordance with the prayer of the bill, with costs of both courts.</p>\n<judges id=\"b120-8\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
