Defendant, being arrested on the <em>capias, </em>moved to set aside the proceedings on the ground that the writ was irregularly issued, not being sued out in plaintiff\u2019s name; and supported his motion by an affidavit that her .name was Snell. The motion was granted and judgment was entered against plaintiff for costs.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AKN\">Reversed.</disposition>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b444-4\"><em>God/eoin &lt;&amp; Ea/rle </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5Ie\">' A name voluntarily assumed and recognized by the community becomes to all intents the name of the person adopting it: <em>In re John Snook </em>2 Hilt. 572; <em>Doe v.
