The errors assigned in the affidavit for <em>eertiora/ri, </em>so far as they indicate anything which could be reviewed at all, refer to rulings during a jury trial before the justice. The objection that the evidence did not warrant the judgment is not one which we can consider, as there was proof bearing on the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">The jury disagreed, and this put an end to that trial. After the disagreement the parties submitted the case for decision by the justice on the testimony put in before the jury, which was chiefly oral.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">Having done this they are precluded from complaining of his previous trial rulings. The circuit court should not have reversed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">The judgment of the circuit court must be reversed and that of the justice affirmed with costs of all the courts.</p>\n<judges id=\"b143-11\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
