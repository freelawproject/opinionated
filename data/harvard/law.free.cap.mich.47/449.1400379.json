Bust, Ezra Bust and George M. Stevens, and the assignees join with John J. McTavish, Myron E. David and Orrin J. David in filing the bill. The \u00a1complainants allege the full performance on their part of all -that was required to entitle them to exercise their option .and demand a lease, and they also aver that they elected to -take a lease, and demanded it December 3, 1880.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>Tbe defendants admit the making of the contract and the-demand of the lease, bnt they deny the performance bY complainants of the conditions precedent. \u25a0 They also rely - upon two principles of law as constituting a complete bar to the relief claimed. These principles may be stated as-follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">1. The contract of option was a mere license to David W.. Rust and his associates, and as such was personal and not. assignable, and when David <em>W. </em>Rust deceased, the license-was by implication of law revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">1 2. The contract was not such an one as a court of equity-will specifically enforce. By its terms-the lease to be given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>under it might at any time be terminated by the lessees, as to the whole land or any part of it not less than eighty acres, on their giving thirty days\u2019 notice of intention so to &gt;do. The continuance of the lease, if one should be given, would therefore depend on the will of the lessees, who might immediately elect to terminate it. The contract therefore lacks mutuality and equality; and not being mutual \u2022or equal, lacks equity; and for that reason should not be \u2022enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">The first of these, as a general principle, is no doubt \u2022sound. Its application to this case might perhaps be disfputed by complainants upon the ground that although the \u2022contract was with David W. Rust and his associates only, jet it provided for a lease that should be assignable. Whether they would be correct in this we shall not inquire, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>for the reason that it is unnecessary in this case, which must be governed by other considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">\"When a party to a contract appeals to a court for its specific performance, he addresses himself to the judicial discretion. The relief he asks is altogether exceptional, for the general rule is that the party who complains that another has failed to fulfil his engagements, is supposed to have adequate redress at law in recovery of, damages. The court may therefore refuse to grant specific performance in any ease where in its judgment equity does not require it. <em>McMurtrie v. Bennette </em>Har. Ch. 124; <em>Smith v. Lawrence </em>15 Mich. 499; <em>Blanchard v. Detroit etc. R. R. Co. </em>31 Mich. 43; <em>Berry v. Whitney </em>40 Mich. 65; <em>Willard v. Tayloe </em>8 Wall. 557; <em>Williams v. Williams </em>50 Wis. 311; <em>Mather v. Simonton </em>73 Ind. 595. In a few cases a party is suffered to invoke this extraordinary jurisdiction of a court of equity, when it is manifest that the remedy at law is inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">But when a party comes into equity it should be very plain that his claim is an equitable one. If the contract is-unequal; if he has bought land at a price which is wholly inadequate; if he has obtained the assent of the other party to unreasonable provisions; if there are any indications of overreaching or unfairness on his part, the court will refuse to entertain his case, and turn him over to the usual remedies. Cha<em>mbers v. Livermore </em>15 Mich. 381; <em>Munch v. Shabel </em>37 Mich. 166; <em>Mississippi etc. R. R. Co. v. Cromwell </em>91 U. S. 643; <em>Burton v. Le Roy </em>5 Sawy. 510. If, for example, the contract is so drawn that the vendor has the option to retain the property or to convey it, performance in his behalf will be refused. <em>Maynard v. Brown </em>41 Mich. 298. And in each case the court will consider \u201c whether, in view of all the facts and those doctrines-which are interwoven with the very texture of equity jurisprudence, and in view of the specific peculiarities presented, and the settled principles and maxims of the court, it is-right and proper to entertain the case and administer relief.\u201d <em>Buck v. Smith </em>29 Mich. 166, 170. These are familiar-principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>But the court will also refuse to interfere in any case where, if it were to do so, one of the parties might nullify its action through the exercise of a discretion which the contract or the law invests him with. The refusal in such a case does not depend of necessity upon any illegality, inequality, or unfairness, but it is sufficiently based upon the impropriety of imposing on the judge the labor, and on the public the expense of an investigation of disputes when the circumstances are such as to preclude any judgment that may be rendered from being final. No court can with reason be called upon to do a vain thing. A familiar instance is that of a contract for the formation of a partnership, which, though it is within the power of the court to enforce it, and it may be done under special circumstances when by its terms the partnership is to continue for a definite period, yet in the absence of a provision to that effect performance will invariably be refused, though the terms be in all respects equal, fair and legal. The reason is that the partnership which the court might establish by its decree, the parti\u00e9s or either of them might immediately dissolve; and Lord Eldon says \u201c no one ever heard \u201d of the: court executing an agreement under such circumstances.. <em>Hercy v. Birch </em>9 Ves. 357. See also <em>Scott v. Rayment </em>L. R. 7 Eq. Cas. 112; <em>Meason v. Kaine </em>63 Penn. St. 335; Coll. on Part. 19, 385; Story on Part. \u00a7 189; Pars. on Part. 298; Fry on Spec. Perf. 64, 504; Story Eq. Jur. \u00a7 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">All contracts where the party has reserved to himself, or Where the law gives him the authority to render nugatory any decree that ought to be rendered in their enforcement, rest upon the same principle. This was \u25a0 recognized in <em>Marble Co. v. Ripley </em>10 Wall 339, 359; and more distinctly asserted and decided in <em>Express Co. v. Railroad Co. </em>99 U. S. 191. In this last case the very strong assertion is made that \u201c a court of' equity never interferes where the power of revocation exists.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">It is also assigned as a reason why specific performance should not be decreed in this case, that the terms of the contract as respects the manner of Avorking, the extent to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>operations should be carried on, and the consequent royalty, are such that they cannot be enforced so as to do justice to the defendants after lease given, without the constant supervision of the court so long as the lease shall continue, to compel the lessees to proceed with their operations and to prosecute mining to such an extent as shall be reasonable and just. There are undoubtedly some difficulties in the \u2022case, of much the same nature with those encountered in <em>Blanchard v. Detroit etc. R. R. Co. </em>31 Mich. <em>43; </em>but as we refuse relief on other grounds, their consideration is not important here.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-3\">It is urged on the pai\u2019t of complainants that the recognition and enforcement of these contracts of option is absolutely essential to the development of the mineral resources of the State ; and it may be and probably is the fact that they perform a convenient and useful function. But it does not follow from that fact that the party must have this specific remedy. He is supposed to rely tipon his right to an action for the recovery of damages in all cases where it is not consistent with the principles of equity that he, should have other redress. Denying specific performance does not deny the legality or obligation of the contract: it denies merely that the case is one of equitable cognizance.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">The decree must be reversed and the bill dismissed with costs of both courts.</p>\n<judges id=\"b472-5\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b467-5\">This memorandum of agreement, made and entered into this first day \u25a0of July, A.
