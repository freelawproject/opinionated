Without default on part of plaintiff, defendants converted the piano within two months from the date of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-15\"><bracketnum>(1)</bracketnum> The rule of damages governing the case is the actual value of the piano at the time of its conversion, less the unpaid portion of the price. The value agreed upon by the parties in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>contract was $285.32. The plaintiff was entitled to show actual value in excess of that sum at time of conversion, if such was the fact. But the defendants are estopped from showing that the actual value is less than the sum fixed by them as the value in the contract, except as therein provided by them, viz.: \u201cIn case of any damage to said instrument by fire, water, or any cause other than careful use.\u201d See <em>Woods </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>21 R. I. 540, and 22 R. I. 225. As the plaintiff did not prove that the value of the piano exceeded $285.32, and as the defendants did not prove that the piano had depreciated in value otherwise than by authorized use, the sum of $285.32 was properly taken to be the value of the piano; and as the unpaid portion of the price was $265, the .plaintiff\u2019s interest in the piano was $20.32, which was the amount of the verdict rendered by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The court charged the jury, as follows: \u201cShe had paid $20.32, and that is her interest, gentlemen, at that time, which you are to consider as the rule of damages.\u201d The court arrived at the correct result, although he did not fully set out the rule as above stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\"><bracketnum>(2)</bracketnum> The plaintiff\u2019s second request to charge \u2014 \u201cThat the interest of the plaintiff in the piano in question relates back to the first agreement and is governed by what payments she had made on both agreements, \u2014 -was properly refused. The court had already correctly charged the jury, as follows: \u201cThere is no dispute that in the first place this piano was leased upon a certain lease, that some years after that, the relations of the parties not having been satisfactory, that they entered into a new agreement; and as I take it, gentlemen, while the other agreement is allowed to go in here, as I might say \u2014 has almost crept in \u2014 I think that the rights of the parties must all depend upon this new agreement, if it is a new agreement, which merges everything that went before it' into itself; and you have to look, gentlemen, to this new lease to determine the rights of these parties, and to my mind it wipes out everything that goes before it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s exceptions are therefore overruled, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>case is remitted to the Superior Court with direction to enter judgment on the verdict.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AL7e\"><em>James A.
