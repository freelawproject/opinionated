The action is for negligence, and plaintiff would make the defendant liable for negligence in construction and in maintenance of a bridge in its fire room. There were 12 -boilers in this room, placed in a row, and numbered from 1 to 12. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>and connected by valves with the main steam pipe. The bridge, o\u00a3 iron latticework, was suspended from the ceiling, 30 feet above_ the floor, and ran in front of the boilers. The platform of the bridge ended at some distance beyond boiler No. 4, but the hand rail thereof ran beyond that end. Two ladders, placed at boilers 5 and 6 and at boilers 9 and 10, respectively, gave access from the floor to the bridge. The fire room was lighted by windows, and, when necessary, by electricity. The plaintiff had been employed in that room for four years (three as a fireman, and one as a water tender); and it was his duty, as occasion required, to connect or.to disconnect, by the valves, the boilers and the main steam pipe. About 5 o\u2019clock on the afternoon of January 29, 1899,-there was an explosion at boiler 9. Plaintiff, then on duty, went up the ladder at boilers 4 and 5 to reach the valve. It worked with difficulty, the plaintiff was scalded, the room became dark from vapor, and the plaintiff then began to make his way along the platform, on his hands and knees, towards the ladder between boilers 4 and 5. He testifies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-5\">\u201cI came along on my hands and knees,\u2014crept along,\u2014trying to escape, until I came to the end of the bridge, and there was a hole. I felt that I was falling.\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">No other witness of the accident was called. The part of the platform from which it is alleged the plaintiff fell was never used by the plaintiff or by any of the employ\u00e9s, nor was there occasion to foresee that any one would go there for any purpose. The.plaintiff testifies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-7\">\u201cI never went past No. 5 boiler. Never had any cause to. Didn\u2019t see any use for it. It was not necessary to go on that platform for cutting off of valves beyond boiler 5.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">The construction of boilers 1 to 4, inclusive, was different from that of the others; the valves of the former being reached without going upon the bridge. Plaintiff\u2019s witness Eoarty testifies that the place where plaintiff fell was where the platform \u201cwas not used at all,\u201d and that the end thereof was about 12 feet distant from the top of the ladder, \u201cwhere men would get upon the platform.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">Even assuming that the entire bridge and its platform were used, or were for use, the defendant had the right to construct and to maintain them in the manner in question, provided any danger to its employ \u00e9 was open, and not due to a latent defect. De Forest v. Jewett, 88 N. Y. 264, and cases cited; Robbins v. Paper Co. (Sup.) 65 N. Y. Supp. 955, 962. The plaintiff had been employed in that room for four years. He had seen the construction of the boilers and the bridge from the beginning. He testifies that from the floor of the room one could see the entire platform perfectly apparent. He had occasion to use the bridge sometimes once a day, sometimes once a week, and his witness Eoarty testifies that when one was on the platform the space was just as apparent to anybody \u201cas the presence of the stenographer.\u201d I think that the plaintiff must fail, for the reason that he took the risks which were known, or which were obvious to persons of ordinary intelligence. De Forest v. Jewett, supra; Williams v. Railroad Co., 116 N. Y. 628, 22 N. E. 1117; Crown v. Orr, 140 N. Y. 450, 35 N. E. 648. Boyle v. Construction Co., 47 App. Div. 311, 61 N. Y. Supp. 1043, is distinguishable. In that case it was held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>that a hole used for dumping coal in a trestle but seven feet distant from the place where the plaintiff worked, and where there was loose planking about the hole, to be used as a covering, was a peril to which, without a light, the defendant could not expose its servant while he was working at night; and, even assuming that the plaintiff did see the hole in the light of the one day that he had worked for the defendant, it might fairly be presumed that he perceived its use, and inferred that it might be covered in the night, when not in use, and when he was called upon to work near it without any light of warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">The judgment must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
