Plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to show that it was ordered from another garment as a model, but defendant testified that it was ordered from a fashion plate, and a witness for plaintiff, who identified a garment as the style shown defendant, was asked on rebuttal as to the number of the style she selected. <em>Held, </em>that the exclusion of such evidence as immaterial was not error, in the absence of an explanation by counsel that it was intended to identify the fashion plate as the model from which the garment was selected, since such purpose was not apparent from the evidence.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b1030-9\">3.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEe\">The issue of fact was directed to the plaintiffs\u2019 performance of their agreement to make a fur garment for the defendant according to the style ordered by her, and this appeal is founded upon asserted errors in rulings upon evidence in two instances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>Plaintiffs\u2019 witness Smith, on redirect examination, identified a garment as representing the style or model which was shown to the defendant when she gave her order, and upon being asked, \u201cWhat was the number of the style she selected from?\u201d the question was excluded as immaterial and irrelevant. This testimony was offered in rebuttal, evidence having been given by the defendant that the model from which she gave her order differed from the garment delivered by the plaintiffs; and it did not appear distinctly whether the model thus stated to have been used as the basis of the order was a complete garment or a fashion plate, which last she testified had been shown her. It is claimed for the appellant that the purpose of the question as to the style number was to identify a fashion plate as the model from which the order was given; but this purpose was not suggested by the form of the question nor disclosed at the trial, and, since the plaintiffs\u2019 apparent proof was that the garment itself was the model, testimony as . to the number of a picture of the same model was immaterial, in the absence of some explanation by counsel as to the object of the offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">The remaining point had to do with questions asked this same witness, on cross-examination, based upon models of other furriers. The objections were taken, however, after the questions were asked, without a motion to strike out, and in any event, since the answers were within the scope of the questions, the objection was addressed simply to the discretion of the court below. Moreover, the questions were not incompetent, and were stated by the court to bear only on the qualifications of the witness as an expert. For this purpose the inquiry was relevant, and we must assume that the appellants\u2019 counsel was not apprehensive of the jury\u2019s misunderstanding the restriction, for he requested no instructions to them upon the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
