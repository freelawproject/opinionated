The plaintiff claimed deposit of the clock with defendant as security for a loan. Defendant claimed absolute sale. Upon the trial there was a dispute of fact upon conflicting evidence. There are no exceptions urged before us, and therefore with the court\u2019s determination based upon conflicting testimony we will not interfere. Appellant, however, with his appeal, tenders certain affidavits, and upon them asks this court to order a new trial upon the grojmd of newly-discovered evidence. He cites section 3057 of the Code of Civil Procedure as authority therefor:.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-12\">\u201cWhen an appeal is founded upon an error of fact in the proceedings not affecting the merits of the action and not within the knowledge of the justice, the court may determine the matter upon affidavits or in its discretion upon the examination of witnesses or in both methods.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXjE\">Said section does not apply, because there was no error of fact in the proceedings not affecting the merits of the action, and not within the knowledge of the justice. The term \u201cerror of fact,\u201d as here used, does not refer to any error or mistake of the justice in finding the facts. When applied to proceedings in error, it means such facts as affect the regularity and validity of the proceedings on the record, and still do not appear on it; such as the death, coverture, or infancy of one of the parties. Adsit v. Wilson, 7 How. Prac. 64. Further, the affidavits presented do directly affect the merits. They are offered for the very purpose of establishing the proposition that the judgment was erroneous on the merits by tendering proof in support of the plaintiff and against the defendant. Irrespective of said section, said affidavits are presented to this court to obtain an order for a new trial upon the ground that the municipal \"court is limited in its jurisdiction to the consideration of motions for a new trial upon the grounds set forth in section 999 of the Code, and this motion is not one therein set forth, and therefore to obtain justice appellant is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>compelled to come here. Mr. Justice Bischoff, speaking for this court in Flanagan v. Callanan, 22 Misc. Rep. 139, 48 N. Y. Supp. 708, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1081-5\">\u201cWith regard to the questions of the appellant\u2019s practice there seems to be no statutory provision authorizing this court to grant a new trial upon newly-discovered evidence when the appeal is taken from the judgment, and generally evidence is to be received upon appeal only for the purpose of sustaining a judgment, never for the purpose of reversing it. It would seem, also, that the justice below would have been without power to grant the motion for a new trial upon this ground, since, after judgment was rendered upon litigated issues, his jurisdiction extended only to a motion upon the grounds specified in section 999 of the Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">It is true the opinion proceeded, \u201cIt may be that this court should seek authority to relieve a party thus situated in a proper case,\u201d and we do not now pass upon that proposition, for we are of opinion that the case at bar is not one in which we should seek that authority. The evidence tendered is at most cumulative, and no satisfactory reason is offered why it was not produced upon the trial, and, if tendered, it is not of such a character that we can see that it would have altered the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-7\">Judgment affirmed, with costs, and motion denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
