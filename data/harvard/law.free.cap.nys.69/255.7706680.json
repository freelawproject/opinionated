The appellant, Lyman A. Stevens, a nephew of decedent, and a residuary legatee under the will, interposed an answer demanding a specific performance of a parol contract between his parents and decedent, by which, as a condition of his leaving home at the age of 10 years, and residing thereafter with his unde as if an adopted son, he was to share equally with the latter\u2019s two daughters in their father\u2019s estate. The case was tried at special term. The evidence presented on behalf of appellant was ample, if believed, to establish a contract sufficiently clear, certain, and definite, founded upon a valid adequate consideration, and performance thereof by appellant and his parents, to authorize its enforcement by the court. Healy v. Healy, 31 Misc. Rep. 636, 66 N. Y. Supp. 82, affirmed in 55 App. Div. 315, 66 N. Y. Supp. 927; Gates v. Gates, 34 App. Div. 612, 54 N. Y. Supp. 454; Godine v. Kidd, 64 Hun, 591, 19 N. Y. Supp. 335; Todd v. Webber, 95 N. Y. 181. At the time it is claimed that this contract was made decedent resided at Syracuse, N. Y., and appellant lived with his parents upon a farm in Huron county, Ohio. The principal testimony in favor of appellant on this branch of the case was given by his mother. According to her evidence, the agreement, which was subsequently ratified by her husband, was made between her and decedent at her house on two occasions when he was visiting there; the one in the autumn of 1868, and the other in the month of January or February, 1869. The latter of these two interviews is the more important, as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>is doubtful whether the former alone was sufficiently definite to constitute a contract enforceable in equity. This evidence was contradicted by the testimony of decedent\u2019s widow to the effect that he was at home ill in January and February, 1869, and did not go to the state of Ohio after the fall of 1868. Respondents also contend that the testimony of appellant\u2019s mother was inconsistent with a letter written by his father, and with certain letters of decedent to appellant\u2019s parents, which were received in evidence. At this stage of the proofs appellant was called to the stand, and testified, without objection or exception, that in January or February, 1869, he saw his uncle at their house in Ohio. Thereupon counsel for plaintiff objected to this \u25a0evidence as incompetent, improper, and inadmissible under section 829 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The court sustained the objection, and struck the evidence out, saying that it called for a personal transaction, within the meaning of the Code. To this ruling appellant\u2019s counsel excepted. We think this evidence was competent. It was no part of any conversation or personal transaction with decadent. Cowan v. Davenport, 30 App. Div. 130, 51 N. Y. Supp. 478; Greer v. Greer, 58 Hun, 251, 12 N. Y. Supp. 778; McKenna v. Bolger, 37 Hun, 526; Id., 49 Hun, 259, 1 N. Y. Supp. 651; Pinney v. Orth, 88 N. Y. 447; Abb. Sel. Cas. Ev. 227; Boyd v. Boyd, 164 N. Y. 234, 58 N. E. 118; O\u2019Brien v. Weiler, 140 N. Y. 281, 35 N. E. 587; Walsh v. McArdle, 78 Hun, 415, 29 N. Y. Supp. 169; Oliver v. Freligh, 36 Hun, 633; In re Brown (Sup.) 14 N. Y. Supp. 122; In re Callister, 153 N. Y. 294, 307, 47 N. E. 268; Lewis v. Merritt, 98 N. Y. 206; Wing v. Bliss (Sup.) 8 N. Y. Supp. 500. It was relevant and material as it tended to contradict the testimony of decedent\u2019s widow, and incidentally to corroborate the testimony of appellant\u2019s mother to the extent that testator was at her house, and an opportunity was afforded for the interview narrated by her. McKenna and Boyd Cases, supra; Tomlinson v. Seifert, 2 N. Y. St. Rep. 287. The decision contains a specific finding that decedent visited appellant\u2019s parents in the fall of 1868, and as to what took place between them at that time; but there was no finding that he was there again in January'or February, 1869, as testified to by appellant\u2019s mother, although the decision purports to recite the entire history of events leading up to appellant\u2019s coming to live with his uncle. The court found that no contract by which appellant was to share in decedent\u2019s property was made. It thus appears that the evidence erroneously excluded had an important bearing upon the material issue in the case, and, if retained and considered, it might have induced belief in the testimony of appellant\u2019s mother as to the second interview, and have led to a finding in favor of appellant. For this error the judgment appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur, except ADAMS, P. J., and WILLIAMS, J., who dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
