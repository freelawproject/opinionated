Under the agreement between the plaintiffs and Heer &amp; Co., the plaintiffs were entitled to \u201c50$ of all amounts hereafter collected, whether remittance is made direct by Pleitmann &amp; Co. and Dreyfus, Kohn &amp; Co., or the United States government, to Heer &amp; Co., or through Blumenstiel &amp; Hirsch.\u201d This contemplated that Heer &amp; Co. were not to become liable to the plaintiffs until after the amount which had been collected from the United States government had actually been remitted to and received by Heer &amp; Co. This being so, manifestly the plaintiffs have no right to prevent Pleitmann &amp; Co., as the agents and representatives of Heer &amp; Co., from remitting to that firm whatever sums they have collected or may collect from the United States government.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-13\">The order appealed from is right, and must be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
