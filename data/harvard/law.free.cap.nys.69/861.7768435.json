McBratney, on or about the 20th day of June, 1898, but which said conveyance was without consideration, and was wholly voluntary upon the part of the defendant Mary Jane Munroe, and was accepted by the said defendant Lorena M. McBratney with full knowledge of the rights and interests of this plaintiff, and without paying any consideration whatsoever for said conveyance. Plaintiff further alleges that said conveyance by the said defendant Mary Jane Munroe to the defendant Lorena M. McBratney was made for the purpose of embarrassing-this plaintiff, and to cheat and defraud her of her rights and interests in said property, and was made and accepted with full knowledge that in truth and in fact this plaintiff was the owner of the said premises, and entitled to a conveyance of the same. Wherefore plaintiff demands judgment that the conveyance heretofore made on the 20th day of June, 1898, by the defendant Mary Jane Munroe to the defendant Lorena M. McBratney, be canceled and set aside, it being in fraud of the rights of this plaintiff; that defendants be directed to convey said premises to the plaintiff; with such other and further relief as may be just and proper in the premises, together with the costs of this action.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b894-4\">Argued before PARKER, P.

Kellogg, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b894-6\">George E.

In this we think he was clearly in error. The complaint alleges an agreement; it does not say it was an oral agreement. Nor does it say it was in writing, but, upon a motion of this nature, it must be assumed that the agreement was in such form as to be provable. If the alleged agreement was in fact evidenced by a writing-, so as to relieve it from any infirmity which the statute of frauds imposes, without doubt the alleged agreement would not only be provable, but enforceable. The agreement itself was a lawful agreement, and supported by a sufficient consideration. The complaint does not stand upon the old common-law right by implication that where the conveyance of title in land is to A., and the consideration is paid by B., A. must be deemed in law only a trustee of the title for B., until A. proves some better right. That mischievous implication has been abolished by this statute against such implied resulting trust. The complaint places plaintiff\u2019s right to recover upon an express contract, with which the statute of uses and trusts has-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>nothing to do. And whether plaintiff can recover will depend wholly upon her being able to establish a legal contract or a contract supported by the subsequent facts which shall be deemed in equity sufficient. It is not necessary to allege in a complaint that such a contract was in writing; indeed, it will not be necessary on trial to show that it was in writing. Under the common law, such a contract was-good if verbal, and if the defendants wish to avail themselves of the statute of frauds, requiring better proof, they must plead the statute as a defense or they will be deemed to have waived it. This is plainly declared in numerous cases as the rule of practice in this state. Matthews v. Matthews, 154 N. Y. 288, 48 N. E. 531; Honsinger v. Mulford, 157 N. Y. 675, 51 N. E. 1091, affirming same case reported in 90 Hun, 589, 35 N. Y. Supp. 986; Sanger v. French, 157 N. Y. 213, 51 N. E. 979; Crane v. Powell, 139 N. Y. 379, 34 N. E. 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">We express no opinion as to the ultimate effect of the statute of uses and trusts upon the facts which may be disclosed in this case-upon trial, since it appears to us that at this time the force of that statute is not involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">The judgment is reversed, the referee discharged, and a new trial\u2019 granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
