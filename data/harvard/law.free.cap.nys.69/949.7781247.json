This testimony was uncontradicted, and entitled the plaintiff to recover, at least, the reasonable value of that work. As there must be a reversal on this ground, we deem it unnecessary to weigh the evidence, although we believe that the plaintiff sustained the burden, and that justice required a proportionate recovery in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-16\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
