The ground stated in the order for -striking out a portion of the answer as sham or frivolous is quite indefinite. The relief on account of a frivolous answer is an application for judgment, under section 537, Code Civ. Proc. The court, however, can afford this relief only where the whole answer is frivolous; the theory being that there is in effect no answer at all, and therefore the plaintiff should have judgment as for failure to answer. \"There is no provision for striking out an answer, or any part thereof, as frivolous. Clearly, the order appealed from cannot be sustained as directing judgment on account of a frivolous answer. The answer denied material allegations of the complaint, and alleged payments other than those stated and allowed by the complaint. Such \u00bf\u25a0an answer cannot be regarded as frivolous. A sham answer or defense may be stricken out by the court, upon motion, under section \u25a0 538, Code Civ. Proc. A sham answer is a false answer. The answer 'here denied, in the form provided by the Code of Civil Procedure, that the bond and mortgage in suit had been assigned to the respondent, and it alleged payments other than those stated and allowed by the complaint. The order was made upon the basis that the allegation as to payments was true, and therefore the answer in that respect was not sham or false. The denial as to the transfer of the \u25a0bond and mortgage to the respondent was a denial of knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief. Such a denial was proper, \u25a0under section 500 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and there is nothing in the record to show that the appellant wffien he made such denial had any knowledge or information on the subject, or that the .allegation was in any way sham or false. It may well be that such transfer had in fact been made. The proof given on the motion very . satisfactorily showed the respondent was the owner of the bond and mortgage when the action was commenced, but the falsity of the denial in the answer was not thereby established. The remedy afforded by this order was unauthorized. The case should have been tried -on the pleadings, and determined in the ordinary way.</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-10\">The order must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements.
