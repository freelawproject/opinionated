Their single request to charge, which is herewith set forth in full on account of its significant bearing on the appeal, was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-16\">\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 Attorney: Will .your honor charge the jury that the defendant, in order to recover for that one hundred and fifty dollars, must prove by a preponderance of evidence a counterclaim for that amount of money. The Court: Certainly, I so charge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-17\">The controversy being over the counterclaim in question, and the jury having found in favor thereof, the appellants now ask a reversal of that judgment upon the ground that absolutely no damage was proven. We agree with, them that a novel method was adopted in reaching the damages found, and no doubt, if objection thereto had been made at the trial, the justice would have ruled out the testimony in reference thereto. The attitude, however, of the appellants\u2019 counsel at the trial was a concession that there were questions of fact to be passed upon by the jury, and, further, that the measure of damages adopted was acceptable, as evidenced by his request to charge above mentioned and failure to move at the close of the evidence for a direction of a verdict in his favor. It is too late now to assert error on the grounds stated, and the judgment, therefore, must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
