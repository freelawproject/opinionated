From a decree overruling a demurrer to the complaint, defendant appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AXSb\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b182-21\">The following is the opinion of the court below (DWIGHT, J.):</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b182-22\">The action is to foreclose two mechanics\u2019 liens filed by the plaintiffs Porter and Chamberlain &amp; Phillips, respectively, for materials furnished by such plaintiffs respectively, to the principal contractor, Freese, in the erection of a building for the defendant, Avery. The complaint alleges a balance of the contract price due to Freese from Avery, and ^mounts severally due to the material men, aggregating less than the amount alleged to be due' as above to the principal contractor. The demurrer is for (1) misjoinder of parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>plaintiff, in that Freese was not a proper party plaintiff; (2) defect of parties defendant, in that Freese was a necessary party defendant; (3) improper joinder of causes of action, in that a cause of action in assumpsit in favor of Freese is joined with causes of action for the enforcement of liens in favor of the other plaintiffs, respectively; (4) failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, in that there is no allegation that the contractor, Freese, has not paid the claims to the other plaintiffs. I think the demurrer is not well taken on either ground specified.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-5\">First. It is contended by the demurrant, in his second specification, that Freese was a necessary party, but, as he says, party defendant; and he was undoubtedly a proper, if not necessary, party to the action. Hilton Bridge Const. Co. v. New York Cent. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 145 N. Y. 390, 40 N. E. 86. Such being the case, it is of little moment, in an equity action, whether he be a party plaintiff or defendant. Simson v. Satterlee, 64 N. Y. 657. If he desires or consents, as he has done in this ease,' to be a party plaintiff, there can be no doubt of the propriety of making him such. Indeed, the attitude of. plaintiff seems much more consistent with his relation to the other parties, and to the subject-matter of the action, than that of defendant. His claim against the defendant, Avery, must be established as the basis of the cause of action of the other plaintiffs; and it seems more appropriate that he should be associated with the plaintiffs, who are interested to establish his claim, rather than with the defendant, who is interested to defeat it. As a plaintiff, he is before the court for the adjudication of whatever rights or interests he may have in respect to the matters at issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-6\">Second. What has so far been said disposes equally of the second ground of demurrer. Freese being properly made a party plaintiff, there is no defect of parties defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-7\">Third. The objection of an improper joinder of causes of action is not well taken. Although the allegations of the complaint in respect to the amount due from the defendant to Freese would be appropriate to a cause of action in assumpsit, they are not necessarily to be construed as so intended. They are equally appropriate as allegations constituting the necessary basis of a cause of action in equity for the enforcement of a lien of subcontractors or material men. Their lien applies only to the extent of the amount due from the owner to the principal contractor, and their first task is to establish that amount. To prove it, they must allege it, and this they have done in the allegations objected to under the third specification of the demurrer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-8\">Fourth. I suppose the allegation that certain amounts specified are due from Avery to plaintiffs, other than Freese, respectively, is quite sufficient, without alleging that those amounts have not been paid by Freese. The money could not be due from Avery if it had been paid by Freese; and the affirmative allegation of the facts upon which the indebtedness arose, and that such indebtedness still exists, is sufficient without the negative allegation of nonpayment. The demurrer will be overruled, with costs to the plaintiffs to abide the event of the action, but with leave to the defendant to withdraw the demurrer and answer over within twenty days.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b183-9\">Argued before ADAMS, P.
