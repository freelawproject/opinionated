J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAQ\">The appellant produced no evidence, and the record discloses no exceptions, other than those taken to the denial of the motion for the dismissal of the complaint, and to the refusal to withdraw from the jury the claim for loss of earnings and expense incurred for medical attendance. The evidence amply supports the cause of action for negligence, based upon the act of the defendant in causing its car to be started while the plaintiff\u2019s wife was attempting to board it, after it had come to a stop for the purpose. The circumstances negative the presence of contributory negligence sufficiently for the finding of the jury, and, upon the record, the plaintiff was properly allowed to recover for the loss of his wife\u2019s earnings and for medical expenses. From our examination of the case, we conclude that the appeal is without merit, and that argument is wholly unnecessary to sustain the judgment, in assailing which the appellant has deemed it inexpedient to submit a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-14\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
