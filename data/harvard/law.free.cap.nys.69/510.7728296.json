The defense was that the defendant\u2019s indorsement was procured by false representations made to him by the plaintiff. The question in regard to the fraud was submitted to the jury, and they found in favor of the plaintiff. There is some criticism made in regard to the charge of the trial judge, but no exception seems to have been taken thereto. We feel that the verdict of the jury was right, and the judgment and order appealed from is therefore affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
