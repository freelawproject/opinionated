Mr. Upson testifies that the action is actually entitled, \u201cWilliam Ford Upson; Receiver of Engel, Heller &amp; Co., Plaintiff, against Simon Hesselson, Defendant,\u201d and that he has brought the suit in his own right individually, and not in his right as receiver. That being so, the defendant clearly was not entitled to an order requiring the plaintiff to give security for costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-14\">For that reason, this order must be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
