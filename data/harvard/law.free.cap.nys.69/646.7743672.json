The stay was for 30 days, and after 20 days the execution was issued. The appellant raises the point \u201cthat a justice of the city court is without jurisdiction to grant a stay after rendition of verdict without an undertaking, and such a stay when granted is a nullity.\u201d This point is untenable. This court has such jurisdiction. Granger v. Craig, 85 N. Y. 619; Carter v. Hodge, 150 N. Y. 532, 537, 44 N. E. 1101; Alfaro v. Davidson, 39 N. Y. Super. Ct. 408. The power of a court to stay the execution of its own judgments is recognized by the Code. See sections 772 and 1005. Both sections are made applicable to the city court by section 3347, subds. 4, 6, 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-15\">Order appealed from is affirmed, with costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
