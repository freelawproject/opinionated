That defense assumed to plead the two-years statute of limitations to the plaintiff\u2019s action. Defendant argues that this plea was properly interposed, under section 384 of the Code, as a sufficient defense to plaintiff\u2019s cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-13\">The substance of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint is that Margaret R. Currie was the wife of the plaintiff, and that the defendant maliciously alienated her affections, and debauched and carnally knew the said Margaret R. Currie. The plaintiff then alleges \u201cthat, in consequence and by reason of said criminal relations, the affections of the said Margaret R. Currie became alienated, and the said Margaret R. Currie was wrongfully induced and enticed by said defendant to leave this plaintiff and his and her then residence in said .town of Sehodack.\u201d In the third paragraph of the complaint it is alleged that \u201cby reason of the premises the affections which the said Margaret R. Currie theretofore had for the plaintiff were alienated and destroyed, and the plaintiff was thereby deprived of the comfort, society, aid and assistance, and affection which he otherwise would have had from the said Margaret R. Currie, and plaintiff has suffered great distress of body and mind in consequence thereof, to his damage ten thousand dollars ($10,000).\u201d We think that this complaint states a cause of action for criminal conversation, and that no other cause of action is therein stated. It is true that it is alleged that the defendant alienated the affections of the plaintiff\u2019s wife, and enticed her from his home. It is further alleged, however, that such affections were alienated and such enticement was caused by reason of the criminal relations existing between her and the defendant. The alienation of affections, therefore, and the enticement, appear to be alleged as part of the damages caused by the defendant\u2019s wrongful debauchery of plaintiff\u2019s wife. To this cause of action we think that the two-years statute of limitations was properly pleaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>This' case does not come within the decision of Levy v. Harris, reported in 29 App. Div. 453, 59 N. Y. Supp. 963. In that case two distinct causes of action were stated, and the enticement of plaintiff\u2019s wife was alleged to have occurred two years before the criminal relations thereafter charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The interlocutory judgment should be reversed, and the demurrer overruled, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Interlocutory judgment reversed, and demurrer overruled, with costs in this court and in court below.
