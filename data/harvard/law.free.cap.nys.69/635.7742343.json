J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2G\">It does not seem to be in harmony with the provisions of the Code in regard to discovery that in this proceeding the books of a corporation can be produced for the purpose of inspection by the adverse party. It is true that the seventh paragraph of section <em>872 </em>of the Code speaks of an examination and inspection of books; but it is clear, in view of the other provisions of the Code in regard to the discovery of books and papers, that this was infelicitous language, and that all that the provision was intended for was to compel the production of the books of a corporation, which might be used in connection with the examination of a witness, who would be able to testify from the books, and who would not be able to thwart the purposes of the examination by claiming that he could not give the information without having his recollection refreshed by an inspection of the books. We think, therefore, that the order should*be modified by adding thereto the following words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-9\">\u201cSuch production of the books being only for the purpose of refreshing the recollection of the witness, and aiding his memory in the oral examination; such books not being produced for the purpose of examination or inspection by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">As so modified, the order should be affirmed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
