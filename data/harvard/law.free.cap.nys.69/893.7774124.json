Defendant claimed that the assignment to the plaintiff in foreclosure expressed the consideration of a certain sum, \u201cthe face value of said mortgage,\u201d and that the receipt of this sum terminated the trust.

The submission provides that, if the title is <em>not </em>clear, the plaintiff shall have judgment for damages and other appropriate relief; while, if the title is found to be clear, the parties shall \u201cbe left in their present condition.\u201d The submission is defective as to facts. The defendant-acquired by purchase at a foreclosure sale, the mortgage foreclosed probably being a purchase-money mortgage executed to Joseph E. Van Mater, August 7, 1869. At all events; the submission states that the complaint in the action \u201cshows\u201d this mortgage, and no other mortgage is referred to; but there is no statement showing what the action was brought for. Assuming that this is the mortgage foreclosed, it appears that it was assigned March 80, 1870, to James E. Mallory and Wilson H. Blackwell, by an instrument also assigning 12 other mortgages in trust to collect the interest and principal, and pay over all moneys to Joshua B. Washburn on account of $24,250 owed by Van Mater to Washburn. The mortgage was thereafter assigned by these assignees to one Von Oehsen, and by him to Andrew J. Smith, the plaintiff in the foreclosure suit. The plaintiff claims that the assignment to Mallory and Blackwell was coupled with an express trust, of which their assignee was aware, and to which he took subject, and that the rights of the cestui que trust are an outstanding cloud on the title. He further claims that the evidence was insufficient to justify a finding that the plaintiff was entitled to judgment in the foreclosure suit, inasmuch as \u201cthe mortgage was over twenty years overdue,\u201d and there is no proof of payment of principal or interest to rebut the presumption of payment. The defendant insists that the assignment by Mallory and Blackwell to Von Oehsen expresses the consideration of \u201cfour hundred and forty-one dollars, the face value of said mortgage,\u201d and that on the receipt of that sum the trust terminated as to this mortgage; and that, as to the statute of limitations, certain evidence given before the referee to compute amount due served to rebut the presumption of payment arising from the.lapse of time. The submission, however, does not show how long the mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>gage in question was drawn for,\u2014that is to say, what was the date of its maturity; nor does it show the amount for which the mortgage was given. $441 was found to be due for principal \u00e1t the time of the foreclosure, but this does not tend to prove that that amount constituted the entire original principal, nor does any allegation in the complaint so tend. The submission is equally silent as to the consideration expressed in the assignment from Mallory and Blackwell, and as to how much in fact Von Oehsen paid on the transfer of the mortgage. The court is consequently not in the possession of any facts by which the claim of either party can be .verified.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">The submission is further defective in not providing for judgment in defendant\u2019s favor in case of a decision favorable to her. Upon submission the controversy becomes an action, pursuant to section 1280' of the Code of Civil Procedure, \u201cand each provision of law relating to. a proceeding in an action applies to the subsequent proceedings therein.\u201d The action accordingly, however decided, should terminate in a judgment, and the condition in the submission that judgment may only be rendered in case of a decision in the plaintiff\u2019s favor is irregular. ' \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">The submission should be dismissed, without costs to either party. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
