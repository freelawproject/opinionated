The justice in charging the jury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>after staung the versions of the respective parties, limited his-instructions on the law to the statement that it was incumbent on the plaintiff to satisfy the jury, by a preponderance of evidence, that her injuries were occasioned solely by the negligence of the defendant, without any negligence on her part. Thereupon this colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1013-5\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s Attorney: I ask your honor to charge, if upon the whole ease-the evidence is equally balanced, either upon the question of the defendant's negligence or the plaintiff\u2019s freedom from contributory negligence, they must find a verdict in favor of the defendant. The Court: I will let the jury say. Defendant\u2019s Attorney: Will your honor charge that as requested? The-Court: I decline. Defendant\u2019s Attorney: To your honor\u2019s refusal to charge as requested the defendant excepts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">.There is nothing in the very brief charge that can be deemed to-have covered this request. It was sound in law, and the defendant was entitled to have the jury so instructed. Brockman v. Railway Co., 32 Misc. Rep. 728, 66 N. Y. Supp. 339; Newcomb v. Same (Sup.) 68 N. Y. Supp. 780. The unqualified refusal, as well as the misleading inference involved in the statement, \u201cI will let the jury say,\u201d\u2014implying that they were to determine the consequence attending evenly balanced testimony,\u2014was certainly prejudicial to-' the defendant, and constitutes reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
