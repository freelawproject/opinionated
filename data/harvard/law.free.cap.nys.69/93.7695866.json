J.</author>\n<p id=\"AoD\">The relator applied for a peremptory writ of mandamus, but an alternative writ was issued. An amended return to the writ was filed by the respondent board, and the relator demurred to two of ten separate defenses of the return. The court overruled the demurrer, with $10 costs, and directed judgment, and. an interlocutory judgment was entered accordingly. The board of commissioners appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-18\">Five briefs have been submitted by the two- counsel; and, while-other matters are argued, the real contention seems to be on the-question of costs,\u2014whether they should have been $10, or costs as-upon the trial of an issue of law. We think the interlocutory judgment should be modified so as to direct the taxation of' a bill of costs as upon a trial of an issue of law. While the- award of costs: in such case is within the discretion of the court, yet when that is exercised, and the award made, the costs are to- be such as are allowed upon the trial of an issue of law.

Y. 396.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The interlocutory judgment should be modified in accordance with this opinion, and, as modified, affirmed, with costs. All concur, except SEWELL, J., taking no part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
