Upon this issue the affirmative was supported by the testimony off Laski and of the plaintiff\u2019s assignor, and there are no extraneous circumstances whatever from which the court should necessarily infer that the defendant\u2019s denial was more probably true. There was no-error in the exclusion of the defendant\u2019s check books, offered in evidence to corroborate his testimony that he never paid his business-expenses except by check; this testimony being opposed to the state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>ment of the plaintiff\u2019s assignor that the defendant had made payments, on account of the goods, in cash. Certainly, the fact that the defendant drew checks in payment of his bills, to whatever number, could not bear upon the question whether, in a particular instance, he did or did not pay cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.
