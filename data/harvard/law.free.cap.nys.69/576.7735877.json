Hunt, by lease under seal, let certain premises to O\u2019Reilly, who never took possession, but let defendant into possession by what O\u2019Reilly claimed was a lease from month to month. In August, 1899, O\u2019Reilly sought to dispossess the defendant as a hold-over, but defendant had judgment. Subsequently O\u2019Reilly proceeded to dispossess the defendant for nonpayment of rent, but the defendant had judgment that he was the equitable assignee of the lease. While these proceedings were being tried, and while defendant was in possession, O\u2019Reilly paid to the landlord the rent of the premises for August, September, October, and Rovember, 1899. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s assignee has recovered this judgment for the amount thus paid. The sole contention of the appellant is that O\u2019Reilly was a volunteer, and that, therefore, this action did not lie. If O\u2019Reilly was lawfully answerable to the landlord for the claim' paid by him, then he was not a volunteer. Koehler v. Hughes, 148 N. Y. 507, 511, 42 N. E. 1051, citing Sanford v. McLean, 3 Paige, 117, 122. Whether O\u2019Reilly was answerable or not depends upon\u2014First, whether the defendant was liable to the landlord; second, whether O\u2019Reilly was liable to the landlord; and, third, whether he was justified, under the circumstances, in making the payments which are at the basis of this action. First. The defendant in possession as assignee of the term was liable to the landlord. McAdam, Landl. &amp; Ten. (3d Ed.) \u00a7 242; Sayles v. Kerr, 4 App. Div. 150, 38 N. Y. Supp. 880, citing Frank v. Railroad Co., 122 N. Y. 197, 25 N. E. 332; Dolph v. White, 12 N. Y. 296, 300. Second. O\u2019Reilly, being lessee, was liable for the rent to the landlord. McAdam, Landl. &amp; Ten. (3d Ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 238, 242; McKeon v. Wendelken, 25 Misc. Rep. 711, 714, 55 N. Y. Supp. 626, and authorities cited. And Judge McAdam lays down the rule that the lessor may pursue his remedy against both the lessee and assignee at the same time, though he can, of course, have but one satisfaction. Section 239. Third. 1 think that on the evidence O\u2019Reilly was justified in making his payments under the circumstances. It was the tenant\u2019s duty to seek out the landlord, and to pay to him his rent, and, if he failed so to do, then a default occurred; a right of action in the landlord accrued immediately as against O\u2019Reilly as surety, and it was not necessary for the landlord to prove, as against the surety, a demand upon the assignee of the lease, or notice of default by such assignee. Brandt, Sur. \u00a7 201; Cass v. Shewman, 61 Hun, 472, 16 N. Y. Supp. 236; Turnure v. Hohenthal, <em>4 </em>Jones &amp; S. 79; Donaldson v. Neidlinger (City Ct. N. Y.) 2 N. Y. Supp. 737. So far as the defendant is concerned, all that appears is that in two of the months, and also for two of the months, he offered to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>the rent to the landlord, who declined it. He offers no testimony that he offered to pay the rent at the instant it fell due. I think, in the absence of all evidence contra, it\" may be inferred against defendant that the landlord^only accepted the rent from O\u2019Reilly as it fell due, and that O\u2019Reilly, as surety, paid the rent only when it was due. Wylde v. Railroad Co., 53 N. Y. 156, 163; McGuire v. Insurance Co., 7 App. Div. 575, 589, 40 N. Y. Supp. 300. Moreover, the surety may, without request of the principal, pay the debt before it is due, and after it is due sue the principal for indemnity; and the cause of action accrues when the debt becomes due. Brandt, Sur. \u00a7 205, citing authorities. I think that the action lies (McKeon v. Wendelken, supra; Jackson v. Port, 17 Johns. 479; Id. 239), and that the judgment must be affirmed. The judgment must be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
