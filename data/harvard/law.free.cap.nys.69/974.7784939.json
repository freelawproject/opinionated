On February 3, 1900, the latter writes to the defendants as-to whether they could sell for him a lot of shop-worn children\u2019s suits, saying: \u201cThey ought to net us $2.00, but, rather than not sell them, would take <em>10fo </em>less.\u201d In reply to this, the defendants wrote: \u201cWould advise you to ship the children\u2019s suits by express on receipt of \u25a0this, and we will place them in this week\u2019s special sale, and we will no doubt obtain satisfactory prices.\u201d The suits were forwarded together, with a letter which read: 'We have this day sent you by N. Y. &amp; B. Ex. 165 suits, as we received yours in reply to ours of February 3d. Please do the best you can, and oblige,\u201d etc. It is clear from the foregoing that the tentative terms of the plaintiff\u2019s assignor were not accepted. The defendants had \u201cno doubt\u201d they could obtain \u201csatisfactory prices,\u201d but did not bind themselves to realize 10 per cent, less .than two dollars. The plaintiff\u2019s assignor forwarded the suits on the strength of the defendants\u2019 letter, and must be deemed to have waived their original terms by expressing a willingness to' abide by the best terms the defendants could get. In any event, there-was no meeting of the minds of the parties on the first proposition, submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-17\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
