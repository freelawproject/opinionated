It appeared, however, that he had given bail, and that, having given bail, he had been \u201cdischarged from arrest,\u201d as it is expressed in section 573 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Clearly, having been discharged from arrest, he cannot legally be said to be imprisoned under an order of arrest, and for that reason the preference should have been denied. The plaintiff cites the case of Knox v. Dubroff, 17 App. Div. 290, 45 N. Y. Supp. 271, as authority that the action should have been preferred; but it appeared in that case that the plaintiff had obtained an attachment upon the defendant\u2019s property, and the action was held to be preferable upon that ground. The question discussed in Refining Co. v. Taussig, 19 Abb. N. C. 57, has nothing to do with the case at bar. The order therefore should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
