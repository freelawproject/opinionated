Said sum is to be held by me as security for damages which I may sustain by reason of a levy and execution on the clothing store No. 85%. Baxter street, N. <em>Y. </em>City, and to be returned within twenty days from date hereof, unless a suit is begun for said clothing within said time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-21\">\u201cDated Nov. 10th. 1896.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"An9X\">Henry Lowey, Marshal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-22\">It is alleged in the' complaint that Lowey did not return the $250' upon demand, after the expiration of 20 days, no action having been begun against him as marshal, and that he has wrongfully converted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>the money to his own use. The complaint also contains allegations \u2022of the recovery of a judgment against Lowey, the issuance of an execution, which was returned unsatisfied, and the granting of leave to the plaintiff to sue upon the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">The contention of the appellant is that the surety is liable upon the marshal\u2019s bond because his act in receiving the deposit of money was done by him under color of office, if not by virtue of office. We have been referred to cases in other jurisdictions in which the courts have held that sureties upon official bonds are liable for acts done by their principals colore officii, but we are of opinion that the test \u25a0of liability in this case is whether the act of the marshal in receiving the deposit was an official or purely an individual one. In the \u2022cases in which the surety has been held liable for acts of a principal done under color of office, there was present an element of trespass or wrongdoing as against third parties. There was no such element in the receipt of the money by the marshal in this case. He and the plaintiff entered into an agreement by which the former deposited with him a certain sum of money as indemnity. The marshal had no power to exact it. He had no authority to demand any other indemnity than that provided by the statute, namely, a bond. But it was not a wrongful act on his part to accept other indemnity if it were tendered or furnished him by the plaintiff. The furnishing of that indemnity, however, was a matter resting in contract between himself and the plaintiff. The liability of a surety upon a mar.shal\u2019s bond does not extend to making good defaults of the marshal upon special contracts which may be made by him with persons for whose benefit he is charged with the execution of legal process. Those contracts are not made, officially, and, while the officer may be liable personally upon them, they are not within the obligation of an official bond, such as that upon which this action was brought. The condition of that bond related to the marshal well and faithfully executing the duties of his office. It did not apply to .any act of his that was not really or ostensibly connected with that duty. The making of a special private contract with a particular plaintiff in an execution is no part of the marshal\u2019s duty. There does not appear to have been any fraud, deceit, oppression, or coercion -on the part of the marshal in taking the deposit, but the entire arrangement was one of a private contract, a liability for which could not have been within the contemplation of the surety, either actually \u25a0or by intendment, at the time he became a party to the official bond. We are therefore of opinion that the determination of the appellate term should be affirmed, with costs. All concur, except O\u2019BBIEN, J., who dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
