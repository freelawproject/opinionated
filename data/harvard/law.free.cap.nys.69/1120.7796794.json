The article purchased, it appears, was a dry granulated mixture of a yellowish color. Both the box and the circular bear pictures of cut lemons, and upon the circular are the words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1153-6\">\u201c38 Millions of Messina Lemons (the finest lemons the world produces) were used- last year in the manufacture of Eiffel Tower Lemonade. It is by-concentrating the lemons in the orchards where they are grown that the Eiffel Tower Lemonade can be supplied at this remarkable price. 10 pints for 10c. The Medical Magazine says: The simplicity of this preparation is its great recommendation. In a very short period of time, and with a minimum of trouble, we have before us a 'delicious drink for summer use. A lemonade as refreshing and pleasant to the most critical taste, and as harmless, as it is possible to obtain. We can cordially commend it to the notice of the medical profession, as well as to the general public.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1153-7\">These latter words appear also upon the box, which further says, \u201cDirections must be followed to malte a perfect lemonade;\u201d which directions are: \u201cPlace the contents of this bottle in a jug; add | lb. granulated sugar; pour over the whole 1 pint of boiling water; stir till dissolved; when cold it is ready for use. This will make syrup for 10 pints.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s chemist testified that the preparation\u2014 which he purchased in the rear of the defendant\u2019s store, and not at the soda fountain\u2014contained, according to his analysis, about 49 per cent, of tartaric acid, 44 per cent, of cane sugar, 5 per cent, oil of lemon and coloring matter, and 2 per cent, of water; that tartaric acid is a vegetable acid, obtained from the grape, and that the oil of lemon, which was the only product of the lemon found, comes from the yellow portion of the rind of the lemon. The defendant showed that his formula for the mixture was about 48 per cent, sugar, 35 per cent, tartaric acid, 12 per cent, citric acid, and 5 per cent, oil of lemon. It was testified that, although lemon juice contains citric acid, \u201cconcentrated lemon juice differs from * * * pure citric acid, in that it contains all the ingredients of the original lemon juice except the water, while citric acid is citric acid alone,\u2014a pure chemical substance.\u201d From the testimony of the defendant, it appears that the article in question was manufactured in this city of tartaric acid and citric acid purchased here, and his claim is that the oil of lemon (not the citric acid) came from a place near Messina, Italy, and that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>took over 52,000,000 of lemons to make the oil of lemon required and used in the Eiffel Tower Lemonade for the year past. The defendant\u2019s attorney upon the trial attempted to define the word \u201cconcentrated\u201d as meaning gathered together, and to show that the lemons were thus \u201cconcentrated\u201d in the orchards of Italy. And the claim also was made that the box and circular advertised \u201ca lemonade,\u201d not lemonade, and that \u201ca lemonade\u201d could be made with nothing' but acids, and no lemons whatever. In connection with this point, the plaintiff gave testimony that tartaric acid was cheaper than citric acid or lemon juice itself.,</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-4\">The appellant\u2019s claim is that he did not sell, nor purport to sell, lemonade, but \u201cEiffel Tower Lemonade,\u201d which, as the court charged, was a \u201cdistinctive arbitrary name\u201d; that no liquid was sold, and no one could possibly think he wras buying ordinary lemonade, but \u201ca lemonade\u201d; and that 38,000,000 of lemons were needed, as matter of fact, in the manufacture of the article, and there was no deception whatever. We think it is evident that the defendant was selling a preparation which the public would, from the advertisements, take to be made from lemons, containing not only a part of the yellow rind, but the juice as well. It was therefore being \u201csold under the name of another article.\u201d Moreover, the evidence shows that tartaric acid, which formed the greater part of the acid used, was a substance cheaper than lemon juice or the acid in lemon juice, so that, under both subdivisions of the law, the defendant was clearly liable for the penalty. It is evident that the word \u201cconcentrated\u201d should be taken in its ordinary sense, and, as here applied, was intended to convey the meaning and impression that the lemons were squeezed, and the juice concentrated to form the article sold. In this sense, the preparation was not concentrated lemon juice. We think that there can be no possible escape from the conclusion that the article was held \u2022out to the public as made from lemon juice, and that the beverage formed by its admixture with water was lemonade. As neither representation was true, and the product was but an imitation or simulation of lemonade, the verdict is amply sustained. We have examined the exceptions taken to the rulings upon evidence and to the judge\u2019s charge, and none of them require discussion. Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
