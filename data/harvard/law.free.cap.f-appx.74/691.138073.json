The government contends the Attorney General is authorized to continue Agyeman\u2019s detention during the pendancy of his removal proceedings pursuant to INA \u00a7 236(a). We have jurisdiction over this timely appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253 and, after de novo review, we affirm. Even though Agyeman has been detained by the INS for over six years, his detention is constitutionally valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-13\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b718-14\">A. <em>Mootness</em></p>\n<p id=\"b718-15\">As a preliminary matter, the government argues that Agyeman\u2019s petition should be dismissed as moot. It asserts that Agyeman\u2019s habeas petition challenged only his detention under the post-removal order detention provisions of INA \u00a7 241, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231, which no longer govern his detention since this court vacated and remanded the board\u2019s decision on September 17, 2002, in <em>Agyeman v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 871 (9th Cir.2002). This argument is merit-less; \u00a7 241 never governed Agyeman\u2019s detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>INA \u00a7 241(a)(2), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-5\">Detention</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-6\">During the <em>removal period, </em>the Attorney General shall detain the alien.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-7\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(2) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-8\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(1)(B) provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYS\">Beginning of period</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">The <em>removal period </em>begins on the latest of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-10\">(i) The date the order of removal becomes administratively final.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-11\">(ii) If the removal order is judicially reviewed and if a court orders a stay of the removal of the alien, the date of the court\u2019s final order....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-12\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(1)(B) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-13\">Agyeman has been detained by the INS since early 1997, during the pendency of his deportation proceedings. On March 16,1999, he was subject to a final administrative order of removal. However, we stayed his deportation pending review of the BIA\u2019s decision on June 18, 1999, and then vacated the BIA\u2019s order on September 17, 2002. <em>Agyeman, </em>296 F.3d at 887. Thus, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231 never applied to Agyemen\u2019s detention. His detention has always been pursuant to INA \u00a7 236(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(a), discussed below.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-14\">B. <em>Legality of Detention</em></p>\n<p id=\"b719-15\">At present, the IJ has ordered that Agyeman be released from custody upon posting of a $5,000 bond. The government asserts that his detention is valid under INS \u00a7 236(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(a), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-16\">Arrest, detention, and release</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-17\">On a warrant issued by the Attorney General, an alien may be arrested and detained pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the United States____[T]he Attorney General\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-21\">(1) may continue to detain the arrested alien; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-22\">(2) may release the alien on\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-23\">(A) bond of at least $1,500 with security approved by, and containing conditions prescribed by, the Attorney General; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-24\">(B) conditional parole ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b719-25\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b719-26\">Thus, in the case of non-criminal aliens subject to removal proceedings, the Attorney General retains discretion to decide whether they should be detained, released on bond, or released on conditional parole. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(a). The issue raised by Agyeman\u2019s petition is whether his continued detention under INA \u00a7 236(a) is constitutionally permissable.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-27\">The Due Process Clause applies to all \u201cpersons\u201d within the United States, including aliens, whether their presence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary, or permanent. <em>Zadvydas v. Davis, </em>533 U.S. 678, 699, 121 S.Ct. 2491, 150 L.Ed.2d 653 (2001) (authorizing potentially permanent or indefinite detention of aliens subject to a final removal order beyond 90 days only as long as is reasonably necessary to secure removal). The Due Process Clause contains both a substantive and procedural component. <em>United States v. Salerno, </em>481 U.S. 739, 746, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-28\">Recently, the Supreme Court reaffirmed that \u201c[detention during removal proceedings is a constitutionally permissible part of that process.\u201d <em>Demore v. Kim, </em>\u2014 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>\u2014, 123 S.Ct. 1708, 1721-22, 155 L.Ed.2d 724 (2003) (mandatory detention of criminal aliens during removal proceedings under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(c) is constitutionally valid even where there has been no individualized finding that the alien is unlikely to appear for his deportation hearing). The Court in <em>Kim </em>distinguished between the valid detention there, and that at issue in <em>Zadvydas, </em>noting that in <em>Zadvydas </em>\u201cremoval was no longer practically attainable\u201d and that \u201cthe period of detention at issue in <em>Zadvydas </em>was indefinite and potentially permanent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1719-20 (internal quotations omitted). Agyeman has made no showing that his removal is not practically attainable. While Agyemaris detention has been lengthy, its length is attributable to several factors, including: 1) the IJ\u2019s grant of continuances so that Agyeman could hire a lawyer; 2) the IJ\u2019s grant of continuances so that Agyeman might possibly present the evidence necessary to his adjustment of status; 3) Agyemaris appeal of the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA; and 4) Agyemaris appeal of the BIA\u2019s final removal order and this court\u2019s reversal and remand to the BIA. Moreover, his detention has a definite termination point. Thus, his detention meets substantive due process requirements. <em>See Ma v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1095, 1099 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Moreover, Agyeman\u2019s detention has been implemented in a fair manner. Following his arrest, Agyeman had an individualized bond determination. His custody status has been reviewed at least eight times, five of which were at his request. Thus, his detention does not violate procedural due process requirements. <em>See Kim, </em>123 S.Ct. at 1720.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b718-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b719-18\">. Even if Agyeman posted bond and were released, he would still be in the constructive custody of the INS. <em>Contreras v.
