Panova concedes that she is removable but argues that the IJ erred in denying her contested motion to terminate the removal proceedings to allow her to apply for an adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">On a petition for review of a BIA decision, we review factual findings for substantial evidence and questions of law <em>de novo. Lopez-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>263 F.3d 442, 444 (5th Cir.2001). <em>\u201cWe </em>accord deference to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of immigration statutes unless the record reveals compelling evidence that the BIA\u2019s interpretation is incorrect.\u201d <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). Under this standard, we shall not substitute our judgment for that of the BIA, but we must reject any interpretation by the BIA that is arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to a statute. <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, </em>467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). We generally review the decision of the BIA, but when, as here, the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, we review the decision of the IJ. <em>Mikhael, </em>115 F.3d at 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">The BIA has consistently held that \u201cso long as the enforcement officials of the Service choose to initiate proceedings against an alien and to prosecute those proceedings to a conclusion, the immigration judge and the Board must order deportation if the evidence supports a finding of deportability on the ground charged.\u201d <em>In re Yazdani, </em>17 I. &amp; N. Dec. 626, 630, 1981 WL 158801 (BIA 1981); <em>see also In re Singh, </em>21 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 427, 435, 1996 WL 411837 (BIA 1996); <em>In re Wong, </em>13 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 701, 703, 1971 WL 24404 (BIA 1971). Panova\u2019s argument to the contrary is without merit. It is true that the BIA terminated removal proceedings after aliens were found to be removable by immigration judges in the two cases Panova has cited, <em>In re Rodriguez-Ruiz, </em>22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1378, 2000 WL 1375514 (BIA 2000) and <em>In re Perez, </em>22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1325, 2000 WL 726849 (BIA 2000), but the terminations in those cases were not discretionary. Rather, they were based on BIA determinations that the aliens in question were not, in fact, removable. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">Under the ubiquitous <em>Chevron </em>analysis, the BIA\u2019s position is entitled to deference. Nothing in the relevant statutes and regulations gives immigration judges or the BIA the discretionary authority to terminate removal proceedings when the alien is determined to be removable on the grounds charged by the INS. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a; 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.1-1003.109. Immigration law on this point is mandatory. \u201cAt the conclusion of the [removal] proceeding the immigration judge <em>shall </em>decide whether an alien is removable from the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(l)(A) (emphasis added). The Attorney General is given wide discretion to decide whether to prosecute removal proceedings. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(g). Immigration regulations give enforcement officials, not immigration judges or the BIA, discretionary authority to terminate removal proceedings or move for the termination of removal proceedings. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1239.2; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number><em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1239.1. In particular situations, the regulations allow immigration judges to terminate removal proceedings when an alien has a pending naturalization application, but provide that \u201cin every other case, the removal hearing shall be completed as promptly as possible.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1239.2(f). Accordingly, the BIA\u2019s position is not arbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute and is entitled to deference. <em>See Lopez-Telles v. INS, </em>564 F.2d 1302, 1304 (9th Cir.1977); <em>see also Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 844. As the IJ did not have discretionary authority to terminate the removal proceedings against Panova, he did not err in denying her motion to terminate them.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Panova\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b451-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
