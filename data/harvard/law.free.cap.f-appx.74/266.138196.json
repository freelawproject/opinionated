Ajebon challenges the BIA\u2019s conclusion that her asylum application failed to demonstrate either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution driven by the imputed political opinions of her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-19\">We find no basis to overturn the BIA\u2019s decision, however. The evidence in the record indicates that the examples of past discrimination on which Ajebon relied were not driven by imputed political opinion. <em>See M.A. v. INS, </em>899 F.2d 304, 307 (4th Cir.1990) (en banc). Likewise, the record indicates that changed circumstances undermine Ajebon\u2019s assertion that her fear of persecution should she return to Nigeria is well-founded. <em>See Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 201-02 (4th Cir.1999); <em>Gebremichael v. INS, </em>10 F.3d 28, 37 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-20\">Accordingly, we deny Ajebon\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-21\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
