Mr. Koskey was sentenced to 24 months of imprisonment, three years of supervised release, and was ordered to pay restitution of $33,511. On appeal, Mr. Koskey argues that the district court incorrectly applied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1 (Nov.2000) in computing the amount of loss from the fraudulent scheme. Specifically, Mr. Koskey argues that the district court calculated his sentence based upon an eight-level upward adjustment for the amount of loss ($306,222) when the correct adjustment should have only been four levels corresponding to an amount of loss of $33,511. Mr. Koskey does not contest $31,222 of the loss amount resulting from fraudulent benefits received from the Social Security Administration; rather, his contention is that even though the face value of the counterfeit checks was $275,000, the district court should have only added $2,289 to the uncontested portion of loss, for a total loss of $33,511 ($31,222 + $2,289). The district court relied upon the uncontested portion of the loss plus the face value of the counterfeit checks resulting in a loss of $306,222 ($31,-222 + $275,000).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-15\">We review the district court\u2019s factual determination of a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2F1.1 loss for clear error, but the factors the district court may properly consider are reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Banta, </em>127 F.3d 982, 983 (10th Cir.1997); <em>see also United States v. Galbraith, </em>20 F.3d 1054, 1058 (10th Cir.1994). Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-16\">Section 2F1.1 applies to crimes involving fraud and deceit, including violations of 42 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 408(a)(7)(B). Under this guideline, the offense level is calculated based in part on the dollar value of the loss involved in the criminal conduct. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(l). If an intended loss can be determined and it exceeds the actual loss, the court should use the intended loss to calculate the defendant\u2019s offense level. <em>See id. </em>cmt n. 8 (\u201c[I]f an intended loss that the defendant was attempting to inflict can be determined, this figure will be used if it is greater than the actual loss.\u201d); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>951 F.2d 1164, 1166 (10th Cir.1991). Indeed, the commentary provides a very pertinent example: \u201c[I]f the fraud consisted of ... representing that a forged check for $40,000 was genuine, the loss would be $40,000.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Fl.l(b)(l) cmt n. 8. Note 8 also refers to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1, wherein application note 2 plainly states: \u201cIn the case of a theft of a check or money order, the loss is the loss that would have occurred if the check or money order had been cashed.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. n. 2. The reason the intended loss figure is used, even if it is significantly greater than the actual loss, is to measure the magnitude of the crime at the time it was committed. <em>United States v. Janusz, </em>135 F.3d 1319, 1324 (10th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Mr. Koskey contends that the economic reality doctrine precludes the district court\u2019s determination as to the amount of the intended loss. <em>See United States v. Santiago, </em>977 F.2d 517, 524 (10th Cir.1992) (holding that intended loss under \u00a7 2F1.1 cannot exceed the loss a defendant \u201cin fact could have occasioned if his or her fraud had been entirely successful\u201d). The rationale of <em>Santiago </em>does not apply here given the clear direction of the Sentencing Guidelines and the sums certain appearing on these instruments. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Haber, </em>251 F.3d 881, 892-93 (10th Cir.2001) (holding that an intended loss is economically feasible and thus appropriate under \u00a7 2F1.1 if the defendant was \u201ccapable of inflicting the loss and had some reasonable prospect of success\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">In the course of their misfeasance, Mr. Koskey and his wife made two separate fraudulent deposits of counterfeit checks into an account at TCF National Bank: one for $25,000 (of which $2,289 was withdrawn) and another for $250,000. After the second check for $250,000 was deposited, the bank placed a hold on all uncollected funds in the account. Mr. Koskey argued that this was normal commercial practice, but the district court rejected this contention for lack of evidence. Instead, the court found that the bank became suspicious.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">Even though the bank acted, the economic reality doctrine does not require a different result when it comes to intended loss. Here, the funds became \u201cunattainable\u201d because the bank grew suspicious and put a hold on Mr. Koskey\u2019s uncollected funds, not because it was not \u201crealistically possible\u201d for Mr. Koskey to inflict that amount of loss. <em>See </em>Aplt. Br. at 7. Here, we are dealing with sums certain on the face of would-be commercial instruments tendered to the bank for deposit. We agree with those courts that have relied upon the face value of such instruments in determining intended loss. <em>See United States v. Kipta, </em>212 F.3d 1049, 1052 (7th Cir.2000) (holding that even though only $38,219 had been actually withdrawn, the district court correctly sentenced the defendant based upon the total amount of the fraudulent deposits, calculated at $171,355); <em>see also United States v. Higgins, </em>270 F.3d 1070, 1074-75 (7th Cir.2001). The district court\u2019s finding \u2014 that had the scheme operated as was planned the intended loss would amount to $306,-222 \u2014 is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>AFFIRMED.
