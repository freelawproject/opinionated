Evans was convicted of conspiracy to distribute and possess with the intent to distribute cocaine base, possession with intent to distribute and distribution of cocaine base, aiding and abetting the possession with intent to distribute and distribution of cocaine base, and using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug-trafficking crime. Evans argues that he was entitled to a sentence reduction based upon the retroactive application of Amendment 505 to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). Evans also argues that he is entitled to relief pursuant to Amendment 487 to the notes following U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-17\">Reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is discretionary, and this court reviews a district court\u2019s refusal to lower a defendant\u2019s sentence for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir.1994). In exercising its discretion, the district court should \u201cconsider the sentence it would have originally imposed had the guidelines, as amended, been in effect at the time.\u201d <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1009 (5th Cir.1995) (quoting \u00a7 lB1.10(b) (internal citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-18\">Amendment 505, which does apply retroactively, amended U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 to establish level 38 as the highest category of the drug quantity table. Evans contends that had Amendment 505 been in effect at the time of his sentencing, his base offense level would have been 41 and he would have faced a sentence of 10 years to life imprisonment. Because the district court gave due consideration to Evans\u2019 motion, the record, and the applicable authorities, and because in its two previous orders denying Evans\u2019 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions the district court stated that had Amendment 505 been in effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>at Evans\u2019 sentencing the court would have imposed the same sentence, the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that Amendment 505 had no effect on Evans\u2019 sentence. <em>See id. </em>at 1010.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines may not be applied retroactively upon a motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) unless they are specifically set forth in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a), p.s. Amendment 487 is not listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c) and therefore may not be applied retroactively under Evans\u2019 motion. <em>See United States v. Drath, </em>89 F.3d 216, 218 (5th Cir.1996)(amendment not listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c) \u201ccannot be given retroactive effect in the context of a 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b394-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
