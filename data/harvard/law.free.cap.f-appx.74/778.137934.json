Only a federal arrest, in which the defendant is detained pursuant to federal charges, triggers the running of the speedy trial clock. <em>See United States v. Benitez, </em>34 F.3d 1489, 1493 (9th Cir.1994). Bordonici has offered no reason why this rule should not apply in his case. Nor did the time Bordonici spent in INS custody prior to his federal arrest start the speedy trial clock; the district court did not clearly err in concluding that there was insufficient evidence of collusion between the federal government and INS. <em>See United States v. Cepeda-Luna, </em>989 F.2d 353, 354 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">We reject Bordonici\u2019s allegation that the district court\u2019s discovery ruling violated due process.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s decision to allow the government to screen Bordonici\u2019s INS file for the evidence requested by Bordonici, rather than admit the entire file into evidence, did not violate Bordonici\u2019s right to due process. There is no legal basis for Bordonici\u2019s assertion that it is a <em>per se </em>due process violation to entrust to a party the responsibility of disclosing evidence that could potentially damage that party\u2019s case. We note that the government, without prior request, produced the only evidence supporting Bordonici\u2019s allegation of collusion between federal and INS officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b805-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"Agd\">.
