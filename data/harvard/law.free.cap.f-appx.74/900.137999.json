Quickie Mfg. Corp., </em>No. 00-CV-2279 (C.D.Ill. Sep. 30, 2002). Because the trial court correctly construed the claims, this court <em>affirms.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">Libman and Quickie manufacture push brooms. Push brooms often feature a handle with threads on one end to attach the brush. To prevent the handle from unscrewing during use, the technology in this case features a hexagonal locking bracket that prevents the handle from twisting loose.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">Libman markets the Sure Lock bracket. This product bolts the handle to the brush with a \u201cbig red bolt\u201d that passes through the bracket into one of two opposing threaded holes that appear at the top of most broom brushes. Figs. 1 and 9 of U.S. Patent No. 6,393,647 (issued May 28, 2002) depict the Sure Lock bracket:</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b927-17\">In Libman\u2019s Sure Lock bracket, the \u201cbig red bolt\u201d 18 passes through aperture 60 and threads into the unused brush hole to secure the bracket to the brush. The broom handle fits into the notched opening opposite aperture 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-18\">Quickie owns the \u2019862 patent covering a bracket that attaches to the top of a broom brush. The bracket has an opening that surrounds the broom handle\u2019s hexagonal section to lock the handle. Figs. 2 and 8 of the \u2019862 patent show an embodiment:</p>\n<p id=\"b928-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">Claims 1-6 of the \u2019862 patent are at issue. Claim 1, the only independent claim, is representative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-5\">1. A handle locking bracket for use on a hand cleaning implement having a separable elongated handle with a radially positioned, multi-sided section located adjacent to attachment means at the end of the handle, and a cleaning head member with receiving means to accept and form a joint with the handle end attachment means, said bracket comprising:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-6\">a. an integral unitary bracket body;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-7\">b. <em>means for attaching the bracket </em>body in an upright position to the cleaning head member;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-8\">c. <em>multi-sided bracket opening means </em>through the bracket body, said multi-sided opening means being exactly sized to receive, geometrically conform with, and <em>surround </em>the multisided section of the handle, whereby upon positioning of the multi-sided opening means over the multi-sided section of the handle, the sides of the multi-sided opening means surround, conform with, and are in close proximity to the sides of the multisided section of the handle to form a static lock means which retains in place and <em>completely immobilizes </em>the joint between the cleaning head member and handle end attachment means. \u2019862 patent, col.' 7, II. 43-65 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-10\">In September 2000, Quickie wrote Lib-man stating that Libman\u2019s product infringed the \u2019862 patent and asking Libman to \u201ccease and desist\u201d from further manufacture and sale of the Sure Lock product. Libman sued for a declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity. Quickie counterclaimed for infringement, seeking injunctive relief, damages, and attorney fees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-11\">In a bench trial, the district court construed the claims of the \u2019862 patent. The district court construed \u201cmeans for attaching the bracket body in an upright position\u201d to mean that, when attached, the bracket opening lines up with the broom brush\u2019s threaded hole. The district court construed \u201csurround\u201d to mean that the bracket encloses the broom handle on all sides.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b928-12\">Based on that construction, the district court found that Sure Lock did not infringe literally, because the \u201cbig red bolt\u201d did not maintain the bracket in an upright position and the bracket did not enclose the broom handle on all sides. Thus, Sure Lock did not satisfy part (b) of claim 1, which recites a \u201cmeans for attaching the bracket body in an upright position\u201d and did not satisfy part (c) of claim 1, because of the limitation \u201csurround.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b929-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>Under the doctrine of equivalents, however, the district court found that Lib-man\u2019s Sure Lock infringed. The district court rejected Libman\u2019s arguments that the \u2019862 patent was invalid, and granted a permanent injunction to halt the infringement. The district court found no willful infringement and denied attorney fees (Quickie had waived its damages claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">Libman appealed to this court. Quickie cross-appealed, challenging the district court\u2019s construction of the term \u201csurround\u201d and its denial of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s claim construction without deference. <em>Cybor Corp. v. FAS Techs., Inc., </em>138 F.3d 1448, 1454 (Fed.Cir.1998) <em>(en banc). </em>Infringement under the doctrine of equivalents is a question of fact. <em>J &amp;M Corp. v. Harley-Davidson, Inc., </em>269 F.3d 1360, 1366 (Fed.Cir.2001). Willful infringement, which must be proven by clear and convincing evidence, is a question of fact that this court reviews for clear error. <em>Stryker Corp. v. Intermedies Orthopedics, Inc., </em>96 F.3d 1409, 1413 (Fed.Cir.1996). Although the determination of whether a case is exceptional is a question of fact reviewed for clear error, this court reviews a district court\u2019s decision to award attorney fees in an exceptional case only for abuses of discretion. <em>Cybor Corp., </em>138 F.3d at 1460.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">Libman does not appeal the district court\u2019s claim construction and its finding of no literal infringement. Libman only appeals the district court\u2019s finding of infringement under the doctrine of equivalents, and its finding that the \u2019862 patent is not invalid over the \u2019540 patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">The district court considered that the \u201cmulti-sided bracket opening means\u201d of part (c) of claim 1 contained the word \u201cmeans.\u201d The district court correctly concluded that the claim recited sufficiently detailed structure that the term was not a means-plus-function term under the sixth paragraph of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112. <em>See Rodime PLC v. Seagate Tech., Inc., </em>174 F.3d 1294, 1304 (Fed.Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-12\">The district court found that Sure Lock\u2019s notched opening would not completely \u201csurround\u201d the multi-sided section of a broom handle, and thus would not literally meet the limitations of part (c) of claim 1. But the district court reasoned that the notched opening performs substantially the same function in substantially the same way to achieve substantially the same result as structure corresponding to the \u201cbracket opening means\u201d of part (c) disclosed in the \u2019862 patent. The district court concluded that Sure Lock\u2019s notched opening met the limitations of part (c) under the doctrine of equivalents.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-13\">Libman contends that the Sure Lock bracket has no equivalent to the bracing function expressed by the term \u201ccompletely immobilizes\u201d in part (c). Specifically, claim 1 requires that the opening means \u201ccompletely immobilizes the joint between the cleaning head member and handle end attachment means.\u201d According to Lib-man, Sure Lock\u2019s notched opening operates in a substantially different way to achieve a substantially different result, because the bracket goes only partway around the broom handle and leaves the handle unsupported in the direction of sweeping during use. Libman contends that the district court did not consider the word \u201ccompletely\u201d in the phrase \u201ccompletely immobilizes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b929-14\">To the contrary, the district court specifically addressed this point in its opinion, stating that Libman presented no evidence in support of its \u201ccompletely immobilizes\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>contention. Moreover, in its capacity as a fact-finder, the district court noted that the Sure Lock broom included as demonstrative evidence in the case did not bend under pressure. Thus, the district court specifically considered and rejected Lib-man\u2019s argument. Because the record contains no evidence that Sure Lock\u2019s bracket does not completely immobilize the broom handle joint, the district court did not clearly err. This court therefore affirms the district court\u2019s conclusion that Sure Lock meets the limitations of part(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">Libman next argues that the \u2019862 patent is invalid over U.S. Patent No. 3,183,540 (the \u2019540 patent) (issued May 18, 1965). Libman contends that if the \u201copening means\u201d of the \u2019862 claims encompasses a U-shaped opening under the doctrine of equivalents, the \u2019540 patent\u2019s bracket meets all limitations of the claims of the \u2019862 patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">In its opinion, the district court stated that it did not admit the \u2019540 patent into evidence. Libman has not specifically appealed that ruling and has not argued that the district court abused its discretion, <em>Kearns v. Chrysler Corp., </em>32 F.3d 1541, 1547 (Fed.Cir.1994), in doing so. The district court also noted that Libman did not argue at trial that the \u2019540 patent disclosed all limitations of the \u2019862 patent\u2019s claims as required for anticipation. <em>See Glaxo Inc. v. Novopharm Ltd., </em>52 F.3d 1043, 1047 (Fed. Cir.1995). Because invalidity over the \u2019540 patent was not properly raised with the district court, this court need not consider the issue. <em>See Viskase Corp. v. Am. Nat\u2019l Can Co., </em>261 F.3d 1316, 1326 (Fed.Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-7\">Quickie\u2019s cross-appeal challenges the district court\u2019s construction of the term \u201csurround\u201d and its denial of attorney fees. The district court construed \u201csurround\u201d to mean enclosing the broom handle on all sides. The district court determined the plain meaning of \u201csurround\u201d based on a definition in the 1995 edition of Webster\u2019s II New College Dictionary, contemporaneous with the June 26, 1995, filing date of the \u2019862 patent. That dictionary defined \u201csurround\u201d as to \u201cencircle on all sides of simultaneously.\u201d The district court found no other definition in the disclosure of the \u2019862 patent and construed \u201csurround\u201d to mean enclosing on all sides. Quickie argues that the district court ignored Quickie\u2019s alternative definition of \u201csurround\u201d as meaning \u201cto cause to be encircled on all or nearly all sides\u201d in a 1984 edition of the New World Dictionary.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-9\">Although a dictionary is only one tool among many that informs the meaning of claim terms, this court detects no error in the district court\u2019s construction of \u201csurround.\u201d In this case, the district court properly used a dictionary definition as one indicator of claim meaning. <em>Tex. Digital Sys., Inc. v. Telegenix, Inc., </em>308 F.3d 1193, 1202-03 (2002). More important, the context of the claim supports the district court\u2019s construction. Claim 1 states that \u201cthe sides of the multi-sided opening means surround, conform with, and are in close proximity to the sides of the multisided section of the handle.\u201d By specifically referring to \u201cthe sides,\u201d claim 1 suggests enclosure of all sides of the multisided section. The disclosure of the \u2019862 patent further confirms the district court\u2019s interpretation by exclusively disclosing opening means that completely surround the broom handle. <em>See, e.g., </em>\u2019862 patent, col. 3, II. 16-19 (\u201cthe multi-sided bracket opening ... can be of triangular, rectangular, or even oval configuration\u201d); <em>id., </em>Figs. 2-4, and 8 (showing embodiments with bracket openings that completely surround the broom handle). The record supports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>the district court\u2019s construction of \u201csurround.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">The district court also did not clearly err in finding no willful infringement and that the case was not exceptional, which is a prerequisite to awarding attorney fees. <em>See 35 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 285 (2000). The record does not show clear and convincing evidence of willful infringement. Instead, the record shows that Libman attempted to design around the \u2019862 patent. For example, on the advice of a patent attorney, Libman modified the bracket opening to a U-shape from its original form completely surrounding the broom handle. With ample support from the record, the district court correctly found the case was not exceptional and denied attorney fees.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
