Counsel for Mr. Tapia filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967) and moved for leave to withdraw as counsel. Although Mr. Tapia was afforded 30 days within which to raise any challenges to his conviction or his sentence, he failed to do so within the time period provided. Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we dismiss the appeal and grant counsel\u2019s request to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Mr. Tapia was charged with possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute (\u201cCount I\u201d), possession of firearms in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime (\u201cCount II\u201d), and maintaining a place for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing and using methamphetamine (\u201cCount III\u201d). I R. Doc. 11. Mr. Tapia thereafter entered an unconditional guilty plea to Count II and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 120 months followed by 60 months of supervised release. The district court thereafter dismissed Counts I and III at the government\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">In his <em>Anders </em>brief, counsel for Mr. Tapia states that after diligently reviewing the case he could find \u201cno issue which can arguably support an appeal.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 7. The certification of service indicates that Mr. Tapia was served with a copy of the brief and motion to withdraw; he has not responded. <em>See </em>10th Cir. R. 46.4(B)(2). In <em>Anders, </em>the Supreme Court held that if appointed counsel \u201cfinds his case to be wholly frivolous, after a conscientious examination of it, he should so advise the court and request permission to withdraw.\u201d 386 U.S. at 744. Where counsel has filed an <em>Anders </em>brief, we must conduct a \u201cfull examination of all the proceedings\u201d to determine if the appeal is \u201cwholly frivolous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If we concur in counsel\u2019s evaluation of the case, we may grant the request to withdraw and dismiss the appeal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">After a thorough review of the record we conclude there are no meritorious issues for appeal. As to Mr. Tapia\u2019s conviction, we note at the outset that because a defendant who pleads guilty waives all non-jurisdictional challenges to his conviction, his \u201conly avenue for challenging his conviction is to claim that he did not voluntarily or intelligently enter his plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Wright, </em>43 F.3d 491, 494 (10th Cir.1994) (citing <em>Mabry v. Johnson, </em>467 U.S. 504, 508-09, 104 S.Ct. 2543, 81 L.Ed.2d 437 (1984)). However, Mr. Tapia has not argued that his plea was involuntary or unknowing, and nothing in the record suggests that it was. As to the validity of his sentence, the record reveals that the sentence imposed was within the applicable guideline range, that the guideline range was correctly determined, and that the district court did not exceed the statutory maximum sentence for the offense of conviction. In fact, Mr. Tapia received the lightest allowable sentence given the applicable mandatory minimum.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>Accordingly, we DISMISS the appeal and GRANT counsel\u2019s request to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b891-8\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
