Richardson contends on appeal that the district court erred at sentencing by assessing a four level enhancement under United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5). For the following reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">\n<em>I. BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b592-10\">Richardson seeks reversal and remand of the district court\u2019s November 2001 judgment sentencing him to 92 months in prison. Richardson contends that the district court: (1) erred in its determination under section 2K2.1(b)(5) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d or \u201cGuidelines\u201d) as to the commission of \u201canother felony offense\u201d; (2) erroneously concluded that he possessed a firearm \u201cin connection with\u201d a drug trafficking felony; and (3) impermissibly considered unreliable hearsay evidence in making its determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-16\">On March 13, 2000 officers obtained a search warrant for Richardson\u2019s residence on information from a confidential informant that Richardson was storing drugs at the apartment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The informant purportedly overheard Richardson\u2019s wife express concern over Richardson storing approximately three one-quarter kilogram packages of cocaine at their residence. The informant also indicated that Richardson utilized a Mercury Sable, as well as a Nissan Maxima, in his drug trafficking activities. Upon execution of the warrant the following day, officers conducted a knock and announce, to which there was no response. Officers thereafter forced their way into the apartment with a two-man ram. The apartment door apparently was barricaded on the inside with a couch, and officers continued to batter at the door until it was separated from its hinges.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-17\">Once inside the apartment the officers found Richardson and his co-defendant wife, Katana Richardson, in sleeping attire. Officers informed the Richardsons that they had a search warrant for the residence and handcuffed Richardson and his wife. During the search officers did not find any drugs, but did find a .380 caliber semi-automatic pistol next to $7,000 in cash under a mattress in the bedroom. An additional $949 in cash was found in the pocket of a pair of blue jeans lying on the floor of the master bedroom. A wallet was found in the blue jeans which contained a driver\u2019s license in the name of Cedric Woods, with Cedric Richardson\u2019s photograph. Officers also recovered some unspecified documents and a shoe box containing eight .357 caliber rounds of ammu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>nition. Officers further had previously confirmed that a vehicle matching the description given by the informant was parked near the residence. Neither Richardson nor his wife were arrested that day, but they were later indicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">In July 2000 a grand jury returned a two-count indictment against Richardson and his wife for being felons in unlawful possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After the district court denied Richardson\u2019s suppression motion, Richardson entered a guilty plea. The presentence report prepared after this plea calculated an offense level of 28, based in part on a four-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) for use or possession of a firearm in connection with another felony offense, although the report did not specify the relevant felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">At sentencing the district court indicated that it presumed the felony referenced in the presentence report was a drug trafficking felony. Operating from that presumption, the court assessed an upward adjustment of Richardson\u2019s Guidelines offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), which provides for a four-level enhancement if the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense. However, the court also granted a downward departure based on the Government\u2019s U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 substantial assistance motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">At the sentencing hearing the district court heard argument from both Richardson and the Government. The Government asserted primarily the information contained in the presentence report, emphasizing the proximity of the gun to the cash, which the Government characterized as drug proceeds. Richardson argued that while the confidential informant may have been reliable, the informant\u2019s sources \u201cmay have either been misunderstood [or] misapprehended.\u201d J.A. 61-62. Richardson further called into question the source of the money, asserting that the money could have a source other than drugs, and also argued that \u201chearsay upon hearsay\u201d was an insufficient basis on which to predicate a four-level enhancement. Although given the opportunity to do so, Richardson did not call any witnesses or submit any evidence in support of his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">The district court ultimately determined that there could be \u201cno possible alternative source of [the] money\u201d other than drug trafficking and concluded that Richardson had possessed a firearm in connection with a drug trafficking felony. In assessing the four-level enhancement, the court noted Richardson\u2019s prior convictions for unlawful possession, as well as the presence of a large quantity of cash in the Richardson household. The Court also considered Mrs. Richardson\u2019s hearsay statement about her husband storing cocaine at their residence, Richardson\u2019s history of only sporadic and short-term employment in low-wage hourly jobs, the proximity of the cash to the gun, and the smaller amount of cash found in the blue jeans. The court further generally cited the remaining evidence proffered in support of the search warrant, which had previously been found to be supported by probable cause, as well as Richardson\u2019s current status as a parolee.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Richardson filed a notice of appeal on October 18, 2001 challenging the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the district court\u2019s enhancement determination. The court entered judgment on sentencing on November 2, 2001.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">On appeal Richardson challenges not only the district court\u2019s determination as to whether he committed a predicate felony, but also whether the gun found in Richardson\u2019s apartment was possessed in connection with the felony. Although Richardson notes that he has waived his rights to appeal the district court\u2019s suppression ruling, he nonetheless challenges the evidence, particularly Katana Richardson\u2019s hearsay statement, utilized to procure the warrant. Richardson further argues that there is insufficient evidence to establish that he was involved in drug dealing; the government failed to produce any proof that the recovered firearm was connected to any drug activity; even if the money was in fact drug proceeds, the evidence does not establish that the firearm was employed during the illegal activity; and the \u201cfortress theory\u201d does not apply to this case because no drugs were recovered from the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Richardson submits that he \u201cdoes not contest the factual findings of the district court; rather, he challenges whether the facts as found by the court are legally sufficient to justify the four-level enhancement.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">\n<em>II. DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AqI\">\n<em>A. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">As Richardson challenges the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e)(2)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> governs our review of this case. We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines de novo, and its factual findings for clear error, giving due deference to the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Ennenga, </em>263 F.3d 499 (6th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Hardin, </em>248 F.3d 489 (6th Cir.2001) (discussing <em>Buford v. United States, 532 </em>U.S. 59, 121 S.Ct. 1276, 149 L.Ed.2d 197 (2001)); <em>see also United States v. Brown, </em>314 F.3d 1216, 1222 (10th Cir.2003). \u201cThe deference that is due depends on the nature of the question presented.\u201d <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 98, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996). We conduct a de novo review where a matter presents strictly a question of law concerning the application of the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Canestraro, </em>282 F.3d 427, 431 (6th Cir.2002). However, the more fact bound the application inquiry, the more deferential our standard of review. <em>See United States v. Humphrey, </em>279 F.3d 372, 379 n. 4 (6th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">Consonant with <em>Buford v. United States, </em>532 U.S. 59, 121 S.Ct. 1276, 149 L.Ed.2d 197 (2001) (affirming appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>court\u2019s deferential review of \u201cwhether a particular set of individual circumstances demonstrates \u2018functional consolidation\u2019 \u201d), we have previously suggested that de novo review is no longer appropriate when inquiring as to whether uncontested facts support application of a particular Guidelines provision <em>See United States v. Hardin, </em>248 F.3d 489 (6th Cir.2001). Based on the discussion in <em>Hardin </em>as to the proper standard of review for \u201capplication of uncontested facts to guideline language.\u201d 248 F.3d at 493, we find it appropriate to employ a deferential standard of review in the instant case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, that determination made, we must still determine the appropriate level of deference due.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">While no published case in this Circuit directly addresses the matter in the context of \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) determinations, decisions dealing with other Guidelines provisions in fact-bound circumstances suggest that the clearly erroneous standard applies. <em>See United States v. Jackson-Randolph, </em>282 F.3d 369 (6th Cir.2002) (applying clearly erroneous standard when reviewing a \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement where the sole issue before the court was \u201ca fact-bound application of the guideline provision\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Garcia-Morones, </em>No. 01-2442, 2002 U.S.App. LEXIS 22020, 2002 WL 31367169, 49 Fed.Appx. 556 (6th Cir. Oct. 18, 2002) (applying clearly erroneous standard to heavily fact-dependent \u00a7 3B1.2 determination); <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>Nos. 01-1937/01-1938, 2002 U.S.App. LEXIS 16062 (6th Cir. Aug. 5, 2002) (utilizing clearly erroneous standard for \u201cfact-specific nature of the determination that [the defendant\u2019s] conduct meets the requirements of USSG \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2) [use of a firearm]\u201d). Because the relevant determinations in this case implicate intensely fact-bound inquiries, we find it appropriate to review the district court\u2019s determination for clear error. Under this standard, we must affirm unless, after reviewing all the evidence, we are \u201c \u2018left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Latouf, </em>132 F.3d 320, 331 (6th Cir.1997) (quoting <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">\n<em>B. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2E2.1(b)(5)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b595-12\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) instructs \u201cif the defendant used or possessed any firearm or ammunition in connection with another felony offense ... increase by 4 levels.\u201d A \u201cfelony offense\u201d \u201cmeans any offense (federal, state or local) punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, whether or not a criminal charge was brought, or conviction obtained.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n. 7. This section is applicable to increase a defendant\u2019s sentence only if the Government establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant possessed or used a gun in connection with another felony. <em>Hardin, </em>248 F.3d at 495.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-13\">In the instant action, although we do not necessarily agree with the district court that there could not have been an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>other possible source for the cash in Richardson\u2019s apartment, we are not firmly and definitely convinced that the district court erred in determining that Richardson committed a drug trafficking felony. Viewing the evidence as a whole, it is not implausible to conclude that Richardson was involved in drug trafficking, notwithstanding the fact that no drugs were recovered pursuant to the March 14, 2000 search.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">We note that Richardson challenges the district court\u2019s consideration of Katana Richardson\u2019s statements as impermissible hearsay and unreliable testimony. However:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-5\">We have repeatedly held that hearsay is permissible at a sentencing hearing so long as it has some minimum indicia of reliability. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>170 F.3d 617, 622 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 U.S. 861, 120 S.Ct. 151, 145 L.Ed.2d 129 (1999); <em>United States v. Polselli, </em>747 F.2d 356, 358 (6th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1196, 105 S.Ct. 979, 83 L.Ed.2d 981 (1985). Federal Rule of Evidence 1101(d)(3) provides that the rules of evidence are \u201cinapplicable\u201d to \u201cmiscellaneous proceedings,\u201d including sentencing hearings. Fed.R.Evid. 1101(d)(3).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-6\"><em>United States v. Darwich, </em>337 F.3d 645, 656, 2003 U.S.App. LEXIS 14750, at *24 (6th Cir. July 24, 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">To the extent that Richardson challenges the actual reliability of his wife\u2019s hearsay statements, even excluding these statements from consideration, we would not be left with the firm and definite conviction that the district court erred. \u201c[A] large sum of unexplained cash in connection with other evidence of drug trading is probative of the previous occurrence of drug transactions.\u201d <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>994 F.2d 417, 421 (8th Cir.1993) (internal quotation and citation omitted). The confidential informant\u2019s reference to two specified vehicles used in the alleged drug trafficking, the established reliability of the confidential informant, Richardson\u2019s criminal background and sporadic employment history, this court\u2019s and others\u2019 acknowledgment that \u201cguns are the \u2018tools of the trade\u2019 in drug transactions,\u201d <em>Hardin, </em>248 F.3d at 499; <em>United States v. Wyatt, </em>102 F.3d 241, 248 (7th Cir.1996), and the remaining factors cited by the district court lead us to affirm the court\u2019s felony determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">As to whether the recovered firearm was used in connection with a drug trafficking felony, we interpret the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d as equivalent to the term \u201cin relation to\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1). <em>See Hardin, </em>248 F.3d at 498 (noting consensus of First, Fourth, Seventh, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits). \u201cIn relation to\u201d in \u00a7 924(c)(1) means that at a minimum, \u201cthe firearm must have some purpose or effect with respect to the drug trafficking crime: its presence or involvement cannot be the result of accident or coincidence.... Instead, the gun at least must \u2018facilitate, or <em>have the potential of facilitating, </em>\u2019 the drug trafficking offense.\u201d <em>Smith v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 223, 238, 113 S.Ct. 2050, 124 L.Ed.2d 138 (1993) (citation omitted) (emphasis added). The Supreme Court has interpreted \u201cin relation to\u201d expansively, <em>see id. </em>at 237, to cover not only direct use or possession, but also circumstances in which \u201c \u2018guns are used as the medium of exchange for drugs sold illegally or as a means to protect the transaction or dealers.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 239 (citation omitted); <em>see also United States v. Peterson, </em>233 F.3d 101, 111 (1st Cir.2000) (\u201cAlthough there must be a \u2018causal or logical relation or sequence between the possession and the related offense,\u2019 and \u2018mere coincidental possession\u2019 is insufficient .... we will find that a firearm has been used \u2018in connection with\u2019 an offense \u2018if the possession has \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>potential to aid or facilitate\u201d the other crime.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Richardson complains that the government did not adduce any proof that the firearm was used \u201cin connection with\u201d the asserted felony. However, based on the foregoing standard and in light of the facts as set forth above, we cannot say that the district court clearly erred. Although Richardson argues that the fortress theory is inapplicable because no drugs were found during the search, application of the theory merely requires that the Government demonstrate a sufficient connection between a firearm and drug offense. Such a connection is established where \u201c \u2018it reasonably appears that the firearmf ] ... [is] to be used to protect the drugs or otherwise facilitate a drug transaction.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Trotter, </em>No. 02-1468, 2003 U.S.App. LEXIS 11848 at *4, 2003 WL 21375475, 69 Fed.Appx. 239 (6th Cir. June 12, 2003) (quoting <em>Ennenga, </em>263 F.3d at 503). We cannot say that the district court clearly erred in finding such a connection.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Richardson also asserts that the evidence does not establish that the firearm was \u201cemployed\u201d during the asserted felony. However, this is not the showing that the Government must make. We have previously explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">Section 2K2.1(b)(5) does not require that a defendant have used the gun: it is enough that a defendant possessed the gun in connection with any felony. Possession can be actual or constructive. Constructive possession occurs when a person \u201c \u2018knowingly has the power and the intention at a given time to exercise dominion and control over an object, either directly or through others.\u2019 \u201d <em>[United States v.] Covert, </em>117 F.3d [940,] 948 [(6th Cir.1997)] (quoting <em>United</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\"><em>States v. Beverly, </em>750 F.2d 34, 37 (6th Cir.1984)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-10\"><em>Hardin, </em>248 F.3d at 498.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">\n<em>III. CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">Based on the foregoing, we are not definitely and firmly convinced that the district court erred in finding that Richardson committed a drug trafficking felony and possessed a firearm in connection with that felony. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b592-14\">. This informant apparently had previously provided information leading to the seizure of large amounts of narcotics and the arrests of numerous individuals. On appeal, Richardson does not contest the reliability of this informant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b593-8\">. Richardson\u2019s prior convictions include possession of a controlled substance with intent to sell and solicitation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b593-9\">. \u201cUnder \u00a7 5K1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines, a defendant may receive a sentencing reduction if he substantially assists the government in its prosecution or investigation of other individuals.\u201d <em>United States v.

We note that Richardson\u2019s notice of appeal was filed prior to the district court\u2019s entry of judgment on November 2, 2001. However, Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(2) \"permits certain premature notices of appeal to ripen.\u201d <em>Good v.

As amended April 30, 2003, the statute provides for de novo review of determinations under subsections (3)(A) and (3)(B), but does not alter the \"due deference\u201d standard applicable to subsection (2) inquiries. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b595-9\">. We note that Appellant has presented ostensibly conflicting authority as to the appropriate standard, submitting that we should undertake a de novo review. <em>E.g., United States v. Lawson, </em>266 F.3d 462 (6th Cir. 2001); <em>United States v. White, </em>270 F.3d 356 (6th Cir.2001). The Government asserts that our review should be deferential, but does not further suggest what level of deference is appropriate. As to the authority cited by Richardson, we note that these cases rely upon <em>pre-Buford </em>Sixth Circuit precedent and do not address the standard of review as a disputed matter. Moreover, we do not regard these cases as necessarily employing a wholly contradictory standard, as these cases undertake inquiries that are more legal than fact-bound.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b597-13\">MOORE, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A8U\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-14\">The majority here concludes that the district court did not clearly err in its determination that Richardson had committed another felony offense, triggering an enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) of the Guidelines.

Joint Appendix at 24. While this certainly amounts to circumstantial evidence of wrongdoing, it does not come near to meeting the Government\u2019s burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a particular felony offense was committed. Even if we accept the supposition that the money in question was the proceeds of drug trafficking, rather than of any other legal or illegal activity, we do not know which drugs the court found Richardson to have trafficked in, nor what quantity he possessed, nor when he was in possession of them, nor where he kept them. As a result, we additionally have no way of gauging whether the firearm was used in eonnec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>tion with this phantom offense.
