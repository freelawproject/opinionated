The pain prevented him from returning to work as a truck driver and also contributed to his struggles with alcoholism and depression, which partly are attributable to deaths in his family and the financial strain of a failed business venture. In July 1997, Greathouse applied for Supplemental Security Income, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1602, 1614(a)(3)(A), alleging that his back pain prevented him from working entirely. The Social Security Administration denied his application initially and on reconsideration, and Greathouse requested a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge. After a hearing at which Great-house was represented by counsel, the ALJ adjudged Greathouse \u201cnot disabled\u201d because, according to the testimony of a vocational expert (\u201cVE\u201d), there are a significant number of jobs in Illinois that Greathouse could perform despite the physical limitations engendered by his injured back and the mental limitations caused by his depression and alcoholism. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(A),(B) (claimant \u201cnot disabled\u201d if he or she can perform work that exists in national economy). The Administration\u2019s Appeals Counsel denied Greathouse\u2019s request for review of the ALJ\u2019s decision, terminating the Administration\u2019s decision-making process. Great-house sought review in the district court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>but a magistrate judge-to whose jurisdiction Greathouse and the Commissioner of Social Security consented-upheld the ALJ\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Now acting pro se, Greathouse appeals from the magistrate judge\u2019s decision. His appellate arguments do not, however, cause us to second-guess the reasoned and thorough opinion of the magistrate judge. Notably absent is any attack on the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Greathouse could perform the jobs the VE said he could. That conclusion is the central fact in this case; we will reverse an ALJ\u2019s disability determination only if it is based on a misapprehension of the law or is not supported by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d and a VE\u2019s opinion that a claimant could perform a significant number of jobs in the national economy constitutes substantial evidence if it is grounded in a fair reading of the record evidence. <em>See, e.g., Sims v. Barnhart, </em>309 F.3d 424, 432 (7th Cir.2002) (holding that vocational expert\u2019s testimony that there were jobs claimant could perform constituted substantial evidence); <em>Donahue v. Barnhart, </em>279 F.3d 441, 444, 446-47 (7th Cir.2002) (holding that VE\u2019s unchallenged testimony was substantial evidence supporting ALJ\u2019s decision). Here, the ALJ queried the VE whether there were jobs that a hypothetical claimant with Great-house\u2019s impairments could perform. The VE responded affirmatively, and described the jobs. As Greathouse does not contend that the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical misconstrued or overlooked some or all of his impairments-and our review of the record reveals that it did not-the VE\u2019s testimony constituted substantial evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s determination that Great-house was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
