Los Angeles Unified Sch. Dist., </em>228 F.3d 1003, 1005 (9th Cir.2000), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Posenjak\u2019s claims depend on his membership in the Snoqualmoo Tribe.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Snoqualmoo Tribe may have rights under the Point Elliott Treaty if its members are \u201cdescended\u201d from treaty signatories, and if it has \u201cmaintained an organized tribal structure.\u201d <em>United States v. Washington, </em>641 F.2d 1368, 1372 (9th Cir.1981). \u201cFor this purpose, tribal status is preserved if some defining characteristic of the original tribe persists in an evolving tribal community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1372-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">At the time summary judgment was granted to the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife (\u201cFish <em>&amp; </em>Wildlife\u201d), Fish &amp; Wildlife Director Jeff Koenings, Fish <em>&amp; </em>Wildlife Officer Ralph Downes, and Washington State Park Ranger Ken Hageman, the record contained very few allegations relevant to whether the Snoqualmoo Tribe has \u201cmaintained an organized tribal structure\u201d since the time of the Point Elliott Treaty.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Those allegations that it did contain were too conclusory and too vague to defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). We therefore affirm summary judgment for Fish <em>&amp; </em>Wildlife, Koenings, Downes, and Hageman, on the ground that Posenjak failed to plead facts sufficient to establish that the Snoqualmoo Tribe has rights under the Point Elliott Treaty.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-11\">Before the district court granted summary judgment to Island County and Island County Commissioner Mike Shelton, Posenjak supplemented the record with facts relating to the history of Snoqualmoo Tribe. However, Posenjak failed to allege any facts to support a claim that Shelton was involved in any violation of Posenjak\u2019s rights. Posenjak did allege that other Island County employees were involved in the incidents of September 4, 2001, but he did not allege either that the events on September 4, 2001 were a result of a \u201cpolicy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated by [Island Countyj\u2019s officers,\u201d or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>that Island Coirnty has \u201ccustoms or policies that amount to deliberate indifference\u201d and that those policies were \u201cthe moving force behind\u201d a county employee\u2019s violations of Posenjak\u2019s rights. <em>Gibson v. County of Washoe, </em>290 F.3d 1175, 1187, 1194 (9th Cir.2002) (discussing liability under <em>Monell v. New York City Dept. of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978)). We therefore affirm summary judgment for both Shelton and Island County.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b771-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b772-6\">. Posenjak also alleges that the defendants violated his federal constitutional rights. We have reviewed the record and find these allegations to be without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b772-7\">. Posenjak claims treaty rights as a member of the Snoqualmie Tribe as well, but such claims are foreclosed by <em>United States v. Washington, </em>476 F.Supp. 1101, 1108-09, 1111 (W.D.Wash.1979) (holding Snoqualmie Tribe is not entitled to exercise treaty fishing rights), <em>affd </em>641 F.2d 1368 (9th Cir.1981). Posenjak also claims treaty rights as an individual, but the Point Elliott Treaty reserves rights to tribes as communities, not to American Indians as individuals. <em>United States v. Washington, </em>520 F.2d 676, 688 (9th Cir.1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b772-8\">. The only allegations bearing on whether the Snoqualmoo Tribe has \u2018\u2018maintained an organized tribal structure\u201d were Posenjak's unelaborated claim that: \"We [the Snoqualmoo Tribe] have adopted to this Society while retaining our Identity, Rights and beleifs. [sic]\u201d Supplemental Excerpts of Record at 6; and his unelaborated claim that: \"The Plaintiff, Snoqualmoo tribal members have Continually Hunted and Fished Indian Way (Law), [sic]\u201d Supplemental Excerpts of Record at 37. Additionally, scattered through Posenjak's pleadings were assertions that Whidbey Island is a traditional Snoqualmoo fishing location.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"Aan\">. Given our holding, we do not reach the question of whether Posenjak could properly establish treaty rights on behalf of the Snoqualmoo Tribe in a case such as this one, in which neither the Snoqualmoo Tribe, nor any of the tribes that are parties in <em>United States v. Washington, </em>are parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
