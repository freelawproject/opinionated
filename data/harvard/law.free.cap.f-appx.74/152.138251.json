Although \u201cactual intent\u201d to defraud is rarely sufficiently proven to warrant summary judgment, <em>Cadle Company v. Newhouse, </em>2002 WL 1888716, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Aug.16, 2002) (citing <em>Golden Budha Corp. v. Canadian Land Co. of America, N.V., </em>931 F.2d 196, 201-02 (2d Cir.1991)), in this case no genuine issue of fact exists as to whether the conveyance was made with \u201cactual intent\u201d to \u201chinder, delay, or defraud\u201d creditors within the meaning of section 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">Case law under section 276 identifies five circumstantial indicators of \u201cactual intent\u201d to defraud, termed \u201cbadges of fraud,\u201d <em>see RTC Mortgage Trust 1995-S/N1 v. Sopher, </em>171 F.Supp.2d 192, 201 (S.D.N.Y.2001), all of which exist in the instant case: First, no consideration was offered by Avrohom Newhouse for the transfer of funds, and the funds came from his mother, a close relative who was indisputably insolvent. Moreover, as the District Court observed, there is no dispute that the \u201ccircumstances of the transfer were highly unusual,\u201d <em>Cadle Company, </em>2002 WL 1888716, at *7, involving a one-day trip from New York to Chicago and a wire transfer into a newly created bank account in the defendant\u2019s name. Finally, Mrs. Newhouse retained control over the funds after conveying them to her son by means of a power of attorney to withdraw funds from the bank account. <em>See id. </em>at *5, *7 (applying <em>RTC Mortgage Trust, </em>171 F.Supp.2d at 201). Given these strong indicators of fraudulent intent, the District Court correctly concluded that a reasonable jury could only find that this conveyance was made with \u201cactual intent\u201d to \u201chinder, delay or defraud\u201d creditors for the purposes of section 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">Section 273 prohibits constructively fraudulent conveyances, which include \u201c[ejvery conveyance made ... by a person who is ... insolvent ... without regard to his actual intent if the conveyance made ... without a fair consideration.\u201d D.C.L. \u00a7 273. The District Court correctly concluded that no genuine issue of fact exists as to the existence of the conveyance, the transferor\u2019s insolvency, or the lack of consideration paid by the defendant-appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-13\">\u201cUnder New York law, a creditor may recover money damages against parties who participate in the fraudulent transfer and are either transferees of the assets or beneficiaries of the conveyance.\u201d <em>RTC Mortgage Trust, </em>171 F.Supp.2d at 201-02. The District Court rightly recognized that defendant-appellant\u2019s argument that he was a \u201cmere conduit\u201d for the transferred funds, rather than a transferee, relies on case law that is factually and legally inapposite. <em>Cadle Company, </em>2002 WL 1888716, at *6 &amp; n. 6. Therefore, the defendant-appellant, as transferee of a conveyance that was both actually and constructively fraudulent under New York law, is liable under D.C.L. \u00a7\u00a7 273, 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
