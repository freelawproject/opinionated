Godwin argued in the district court that the defendants denied him medical care, failed to protect him from harm suffered at the hands of other inmates, and interfered with his right of access to courts by opening his mail and confiscating his legal materials. Godwin now argues that the district court erred in granting the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment because he submitted an affidavit that raises genuine issues of material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Duckett v. City of Cedar Park, Tex., </em>950 F.2d 272, 276 (5th Cir.1992). Summary judgment is proper when, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Amburgey v. Corhart Refractories Corp., Inc., </em>936 F.2d 805, 809 (5th Cir.1991); Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). The affidavit on which Godwin relies is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact with respect to Godwin\u2019s claims. Accordingly, Godwin has not shown that the district court erred in granting the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-14\">Godwin also lists several other issues in the statement of issues in his opening brief, including challenges to the district court\u2019s denial of his discovery motion and motion for the appointment of counsel. However, Godwin has not addressed these issues in his opening brief. Accordingly, we will not address these issues. <em>See Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United Paperworkers Int\u2019l Union v. Champion Int\u2019l Corp., </em>908 F.2d 1252, 1255 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-15\">Godwin has shown no error in the district court\u2019s judgment. Accordingly, that judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b411-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
