Plaintiff alleged that defendants committed these violations by terminating him from a work-release program, transferring him from a minimum-security facility to a medium-security facility, and denying his request for cardiac physical therapy.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-22\">In a Memorandum and Order dated November 21, 2000, the District Court granted defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss plaintiffs claims under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), with the exception of plaintiffs Eighth Amendment claim against defendant Mitchell, which the District Court denied without prejudice to a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56, in order that the Court may have the benefit of affidavits establishing plaintiffs medical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-23\">The District Court found that plaintiff failed to assert that he had a disability that \u201csubstantially limits one or more of the major life activities\u201d for the purposes of the ADA. <em>See Alvarez v. Ruddock, </em>No. CV-99-5452 (ERK), at 4-6 (E.D.N.Y. Nov. 21, 2000) (applying 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(2)). The Court further held under the Fourteenth Amendment that plaintiff had no right to challenge his transfer between prisons, and that he received adequate due process in conjunction with his removal from work release. <em>See id. </em>at 9-11. For substantially the reasons stated by the District Court, we agree that plaintiffs\u2019 claims should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>After further discovery, on August 20, 2002, the District Court issued a second Memorandum and Order granting summary judgment in favor of defendant Mitchell on plaintiffs \u00a7 1983 claim under the Eighth Amendment, holding that the submitted affidavits established that \u201cplaintiffs need for therapy was not sufficiently serious to support a 1983 cause of action.\u201d <em>Alvarez v. Ruddock, </em>No. CV-99-5452 (ERK), at 2 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 20, 2002). For substantially the reasons stated by the District Court, we agree that summary judgment should be granted in favor of defendant Mitchell.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">We have considered all of the plaintiffs arguments. The judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
