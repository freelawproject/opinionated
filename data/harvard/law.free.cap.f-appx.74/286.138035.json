Bailey appeals his convictions and sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-23\">First, Bailey asserts the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions. We review this claim to determine whether, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, any reasonable trier of fact could have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). Bailey\u2019s claim is meritless. The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, proved each element of Bailey\u2019s offenses. <em>See In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-24\">Second, Bailey asserts the district court erred in enhancing his sentence for obstruction of justice, based on Bailey\u2019s testimony regarding several deposits he made. We review a district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines enhancement for obstruction of justice for clear error. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number><em>United States v. Puckett, </em>61 F.3d 1092, 1095 (4th Cir.1995). The district court did not clearly err in determining Bailey\u2019s testimony was false on material matters or that it supported an enhancement for obstruction of justice. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.4(b)) (2002); <em>United States v. Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 92-98, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993); <em>United States v. Jones, </em>308 F.3d 425, 428 n. 2 (4th Cir.2002), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1241, 123 S.Ct. 1372, 155 L.Ed.2d 211 (2003); <em>United States v. Hairston, </em>46 F.3d 361, 375 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Bailey\u2019s convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid in the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
