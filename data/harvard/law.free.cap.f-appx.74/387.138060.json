Teixeira contends that he exhausted his administrative remedies and would have produced copies of his grievances if the district court had ordered prison officials to provide the documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-25\">Teixeira\u2019s pleadings reflect that he may have exhausted some but possibly not all of his claims through the administrative remedies process. The district court did not address the issue whether Teixeira had actually exhausted his administrative remedies, but dismissed the complaint because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>Teixeira had not attached written proof of exhaustion. The dismissal on that basis was erroneous because Teixeira was entitled to rely upon his pleadings in asserting exhaustion. <em>See Underwood v. Wilson, </em>151 F.3d 292, 296 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">The judgment of the district court dismissing the complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies is VACATED and the case is REMANDED to the district court for further consideration of the exhaustion issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b413-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
