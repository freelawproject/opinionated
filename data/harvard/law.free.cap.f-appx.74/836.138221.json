Boyd, a Washington state prisoner, appeals pro se the district court\u2019s summary judgment in his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging retaliation, interference with free exercise of his Muslim religion, violations of due process and deliberate indifference to his medical needs. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Lopez v. Smith, </em>203 F.3d 1122, 1131 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc), and we affirm for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s November 7, 2002 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Boyd\u2019s motion to appoint an expert on Islamic practices because the services of an expert were unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-13\">Judge McDonald did not err by deciding Boyd\u2019s motion for recusal in the first instance because a recusal motion may be decided by the very judge whose impartiality is being questioned. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>455; In re Bernard, 31 </em>F.3d 842, 843 (9th Cir.1994) (holding that a motion for recusal must be decided by the very judge whose impartiality is being questioned). Furthermore, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion because Boyd\u2019s conclusory allegations of bias failed to establish legally sufficient grounds for recusal. <em>See Yagman v. Republic Insurance, </em>987 F.2d 622, 626 (9th Cir.1993) (concluding that mere speculative assertions of invidious motive are insufficient to show judicial bias).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-18\">We have considered Boyd\u2019s remaining contentions and find them unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b863-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
