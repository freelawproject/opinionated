Because Jolicoeur has been deported, we can no longer grant him the relief he requests. Therefore, we must dismiss his claims as moot. <em>See Quezada v. I.N.S., </em>898 F.2d 474, 477 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-26\">Jolicoeur\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED AS MOOT, and his motion for stay of deportation pending appeal is DENIED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b336-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
