Li argues that the immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cU\u201d) finding that he is ineligible for asylum is not supported by substantial evidence. Li contends that this court should not defer to the IJ\u2019s finding that he was not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-24\">The IJ\u2019s determination that Li was not credible is \u201ca reasonable interpretation of the record and therefore supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>See Chun v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 76, 79 (5th Cir.1994). \u201cWithout credible evidence, the BIA had no basis upon which to grant asylum or withhold deportation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Li was not denied due process based on any translation problems at his asylum hearing. Li\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b429-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
