She argues 1) that the BIA should have liberally construed her motion and should have forgiven her failure to serve the Office of the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>Counsel and to include the appropriate application for relief and 2) that her situation warranted equitable tolling of the limitations period for filing a motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">We \u201cwill defer to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of immigration regulations if the interpretation is reasonable.\u201d <em>Lopez-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>268 F.3d 442, 444 (5th Cir.2001). Motions to reopen immigration proceedings are disfavored. <em>Lara v. Trominski, </em>216 F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir.2000). \u201cThere is no statutory provision for reopening; the authority to reopen derives solely from regulations promulgated by the Attorney General.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWe therefore apply a highly deferential abuse of discretion standard in reviewing the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Raziuddin\u2019s motion to reopen did not include an application seeking a change of status or the documentation demonstrating her entitlement to such relief. See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 3.2(c)(1), 3.23(b)(1) (1997) (renumbered 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1003.2 and 1003.23(b)). She did not serve the District Counsel with the motion, and the INS filed an opposition to the motion. See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 3.2(g)(2) (1997). The BIA\u2019s dismissal of Raziuddin\u2019s appeal of the Immigration Judge\u2019s denial of her motion to reopen was not an abuse of discretion. See <em>Matter of Yewondwosen, </em>21 I &amp; N Dec. 1025, 1025-26 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b446-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
