The transitional rules of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 apply, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). <em>See Kalaw v. INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997). We review the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding for substantial evidence. <em>Lopez-Reyes v. INS, </em>79 F.3d 908, 911 (9th Cir.1996). We grant the petition, and vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">The IJ erroneously concluded that Zhe Xiao Zhou was not credible because he testified to certain details regarding his alleged persecution by local communist officials that were not included in his asylum application. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cIt is well settled that an applicant\u2019s testimony is not per se lacking in credibility simply because it includes details that are not set forth in the asylum application.\u201d). Moreover, the IJ failed to provide an adequate reason for rejecting Zhe Xiao Zhou\u2019s explanation for the omissions. <em>See Garrovillas v. INS, </em>156 F.3d 1010, 1014 (9th Cir.1998) (\u201cinconsistencies of less than substantial importance for which a plausible explanation is offered[ ]\u201d are improper bases for an adverse credibility finding).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">PETITION GRANTED; VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b836-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
