We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, <em>Lopez v. Smith, </em>203 F.3d 1122, 1131 (9th Cir.2000) (en banc), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-25\">The district court properly granted summary judgment as to Snow\u2019s equal protection claim because he offered no evidence that the modified lockdowns were undertaken for a discriminatory purpose and were not reasonably related to legitimate penological interests. <em>See Johnson v. Cal</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number><em>ifornia, </em>321 F.3d 791, 798-99 (9th Cir. 2003) (applying <em>Turner v. Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987), to equal protection claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">The district court properly granted summary judgment as to Snow\u2019s due process claim because a prisoner is not entitled to a hearing before being placed on lockdown during a prison emergency, and Snow failed to raise a genuine issue of fact as to whether a state of emergency existed. <em>See Hayward v. Procunier, </em>629 F.2d 599, 601-03 (9th Cir.1980). Snow\u2019s contention that his continued segregation violated his constitutional rights fails because a two-week modified lockdown does not implicate a protected liberty interest under <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995); such confinement does not impose an \u201catypical and significant hardship on [Snow] in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">To the extent Snow alleged an Eighth Amendment violation based on denial of access to the prison yard during the modified lockdowns, the district court properly concluded such a claim is foreclosed by <em>Hayward. See </em>629 F.2d at 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">To the extent Snow alleged that the lockdowns also interfered with his access to the prison law library, his claim is foreclosed by <em>Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 361-62, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b841-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
