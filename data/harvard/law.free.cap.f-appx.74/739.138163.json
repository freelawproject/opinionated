We agree with the district court that the placement of restrictions in the right of way permits was within the authority of the Forest Service, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">Whatever questions exist as to the standing of the various appellants, they are represented by the same counsel and make the same arguments, and the Early Winters Ditch Company as a permit holder indisputably has standing. We accordingly proceed to the merits. <em>See Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., </em>429 U.S. 252, 263-64 &amp; n. 9, 97 S.Ct. 555, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (holding that where one plaintiff has standing, \u201cwe need not consider whether the other individual and corporate plaintiffs have standing to maintain the suit\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-12\">At bottom, appellants argue that the Forest Service does not have the authority to condition the use of the rights of way in a national forest on the maintenance of instream flows because such restrictions deny them their vested water rights under state law. The ditch rights of way granted over federal land, from their inception, were subject to termination at the discretion of the federal government through its designated agent. The more recent permits expressly state that they do not convey water rights and are subject to amendment \u201cwhen, at the discretion of the authorizing officer, such action is deemed necessary or desirable to incorporate new terms, conditions and stipulations as may be required by law, regulation, land management plans, or other management decisions.\u201d The ESA and regulations promulgated thereunder require federal agencies to consult with designated consulting agencies whenever a federal action \u201cmay affect\u201d a threatened or endangered species. <em>See </em>50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.14(a) (2002). The regulations provide that such consultation is required for \u201call actions in which there is discretionary Federal involvement or control,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 402.03, including the granting of permits or rights of way, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 402.02(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>Appellants do not argue on appeal that the Forest Service or the other federal agencies violated any of the requirements or protocols of the ESA. Instead, they in effect argue that compliance with the ESA was not authorized because such compliance would deny them their vested water rights under state law. We cannot agree with this argument for several reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">There is authority that the ESA does not grant powers to federal agencies they do not otherwise have. The Supreme Court has stated that section 7 of the ESA \u201camplifies the obligation of federal agencies to take steps <em>within their power </em>to carry out the purposes of this act.\u201d <em>Tenn. Valley Auth. v. Hill, </em>437 U.S. 153, 183, 98 S.Ct. 2279, 57 L.Ed.2d 117 (1979) (emphasis added, brackets omitted) (quoting 119 Cong. Rec. 42913 (1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">However, we are of the view that the Forest Service had the authority to restrict the use of the rights of way to protect the endangered fish. The permits themselves, from their inception, provided the government with unqualified discretion to restrict or terminate the rights of way.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) authorizes the Secretaries of Interior and Agriculture to \u201cgrant, issue, or renew rights-of-way over\u201d public lands for \u201cditches ... for the ... transportation ... of water.\u201d 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 1761(a)(1). Such rights of way \u201cshall contain ... terms and conditions which will ... minimize damage to ... fish and wildlife habitat and otherwise protect the environment\u201d and that will \u201crequire compliance with applicable ... water quality standards established by or pursuant to applicable Federal or State law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1765(a). In addition, the National Forest Management Act requires the Forest Service to specify guidelines for land management plans that \u201cprovide for ... watershed, wildlife, and fish\u201d and \u201cprovide for diversity of plant and animal communities.\u201d 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604(g)(3)(A) &amp; (B). The Organic Administration Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 475, provides that \u201c[n]o national forest shall be established, except to improve and protect the forest within the boundaries, or for the purpose of securing favorable conditions of water flows____\u201d The Multiple Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 (MUS-YA), 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 528, provides that \u201c[i]t is the policy of the Congress that the national forests are established and shall be administered for outdoor recreation, range, timber, watershed, and wildlife and fish purposes.\u201d These statutes, in our view, give the Forest Service authority to maintain certain levels of flow in the rivers and streams within the boundaries of the Okanogan National Forest to protect endangered fish species.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">The FLPMA provides that \u201c[njothing in this Act ... shall be construed as terminating any valid lease, permit, patent, right-of-way, or other land use right or authorization existing on the date of approval of this Act,\u201d and that \u201c[a]ll actions by the Secretary concerned under this Act shall be subject to valid existing rights.\u201d Pub.L. No. 94-579, \u00a7 701(a) &amp; (h), 90 Stat. 2743, 2786-87, <em>reprinted in </em>43 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1701 historical note. Under this savings clause, the government could not under the FLPMA divest a private party of an existing \u201cland use right\u201d or other \u201cvalid existing rights,\u201d but as described above, the plaintiffs\u2019 rights of way were always, by their written terms, revocable at the discretion of the federal government. Appellants did not establish that they had vested rights to use the ditches to supply their water needs prior to the enactment of the FLPMA in 1976. On the contrary, the 1901 Act under which the permits were earlier granted provided that right of way permits did not grant vested property rights. The 1901 Act stated that the Sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>retary of Interior could grant rights of way through forest reservations for ditches, but that \u201cany permission given by the Secretary of the Interior under the provisions of this section may be revoked by him or his successor in his discretion, and shall not be held to confer any right, or easement, or interest in, to, or over any public land, reservation, or park.\u201d Act of Feb. 15, 1901, ch. 372, 31 Stat. 790 (codified at 43 U.S.C. \u00a7 959) (repealed 1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Appellants rely on <em>United States v. New Mexico, </em>438 U.S. 696, 98 S.Ct. 3012, 57 L.Ed.2d 1052 (1978) <em>(\u201cUS v. NM\u201d). </em>This case held that under a longstanding \u201cimplied-reservation-of-water doctrine,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 701, Congress did not, in enacting the Organic Administration Act and the MUSYA, intend the federal government to reserve water rights for wildlife preservation purposes when it set aside lands for national forests. <em>US v. NM </em>did not address the power of the Forest Service to restrict the use of rights of way over federal land. As discussed above, the FLPMA specifically authorizes the Forest Service to restrict such rights of way to protect fish and wildlife and maintain water quality standards under federal law, without any requirement that the Forest Service defer to state water law. To quote another Supreme Court case, the pending case \u201cis not a controversy over water rights, but over rights of way through lands of the United States, which is a different matter, and is so treated in the right-of-way acts before mentioned.\u201d <em>Utah Power &amp; Light Co. v. United States, </em>243 U.S. 389, 411, 37 S.Ct. 387, 61 L.Ed. 791 (1917).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b766-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Cir.
