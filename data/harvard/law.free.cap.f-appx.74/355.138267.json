He asserts that his sentence is invalid in light of <em>Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999). Because Montgomery is challenging the method by which his sentence was calculated, rather than the execution of his sentence, the district court correctly construed his petition as a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 U.S. 1001, 122 S.Ct. 476, 151 L.Ed.2d 390 (2001). Montgomery has not established that his <em>Jones </em>claim satisfies the test for filing a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition under the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Jones, </em>526 U.S. at 251 n. 11, 119 S.Ct. 1215; <em>see also Wesson v. U.S. Penitentiary Beaumont, Tex., </em>305 F.3d 343, 347-48 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1241, 123 S.Ct. 1374, 155 L.Ed.2d 212 (2003); <em>In re Tatum, </em>233 F.3d 857, 859 (5th Cir.2000). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b381-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
