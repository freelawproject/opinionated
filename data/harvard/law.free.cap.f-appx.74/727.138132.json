We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we reverse and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">Due process requires a sentencing court to put a criminal defendant on notice of the evidence it will consider, and afford her a meaningful opportunity to contest it. <em>See United States v. Notrangelo, </em>909 F.2d 363, 365 (9th Cir.1990); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(c)(1) (2001) (\u201cAt the sentencing hearing, the court must afford counsel for the defendant ... an opportunity to comment on [the pre-sentence report] and on other matters relating to the appropriate sentence .... \u201d). It is unclear from the record what evidence the district court relied upon in determining Jackson\u2019s \u201crelevant conduct\u201d for sentencing under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B). The district court stated that in determining Jackson\u2019s \u201crelevant conduct\u201d it had reviewed its trial notes and trial exhibits \u2014 without specifying exactly which ones \u2014 from Jackson\u2019s co-defendants\u2019 trial (in which she did not participate). Although the court went on to state its \u201cbelie[f]\u201d that the information in the presentence report fully documented all of its findings, in fact, Jackson\u2019s pre-sentence report and addendum contained abstract and vague references to \u201ctestimony\u201d and \u201cdiscovery and trial exhibits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b754-11\">As a result of the murky state of the record, we have no choice but to reverse Jackson\u2019s sentence and remand the matter to the district court for resentencing. If in resentencing Jackson the district court intends to rely on testimony or exhibits from the co-defendants\u2019 trial (or on the portions of the pre-sentence report that reference such evidence), it must identify them with specificity, in order to provide Jackson with the constitutionally requisite \u201cmeaningful opportunity to comment on [them] at sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Nappi, </em>243 F.3d 758 (3d Cir.2001). And because Jackson has not yet had the opportunity to cross-examine any trial witness upon whose testimony the Probation Officer or court may have relied, the district court shall have to determine whether to do so if their testimony is to be used as support for the relevant conduct determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-12\">We reject Jackson\u2019s assertion that the district court should have employed a heightened standard of proof for its factual determination. <em>United States v. Johans</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number><em>son, </em>249 F.3d 848, 855 (9th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>United States v.
