We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Valdez v. Rosenbaum, </em>302 F.3d 1039, 1043 (9th Cir.2002). We affirm, in part, and reverse and remand in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">The district court properly granted summary judgment to defendants on Auer\u2019s claims alleging denial of access to court in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments and the ADA because Auer\u2019s allegations were insufficient to establish a claim for relief. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 348, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996) (access to \u2019courts); <em>Duvall v. County of Kitsap, </em>260 F.3d 1124, 1138-40 (9th Cir.2001) (ADA); <em>Lee v. City of Los Angeles, </em>250 F.3d 668, 686-87 (9th Cir.2001) (equal protection).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">With respect to Auer\u2019s excessive force claim, we affirm the district court\u2019s summary judgment to defendants Vanacore, Smith, Lopez, Neven, Donat, Endel, McDaniel and Slansky because Auer failed to show that these defendants were personally involved in the alleged use of excessive force. <em>See Taylor v. List, </em>880 F.2d 1040, 1045 (9th Cir.1989) (holding that section 1983 action requires a showing of defendants\u2019 personal participation in alleged constitutional violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">The district court properly granted summary judgment on Auer\u2019s retaliation claim because Auer failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>See McKinney v. Carey, </em>311 F.3d 1198, 1199-1200 (9th Cir.2002) . We are not persuaded by Auer\u2019s arguments on appeal regarding his inability to exhaust his claims. We construe the district court\u2019s order as dismissing the retaliation claim without prejudice. <em>See Wyatt v. Terhune, </em>315 F.3d 1108, 1120 (9th Cir.2003) (dismissing without prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">However, we reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the remaining defendants based on Auer\u2019s purported failure to exhaust administrative remedies. We conclude that Auer exhausted the administrative process by filing grievances complaining about defendants\u2019 alleged excessive force and by appealing through all available levels of administrative review. <em>See Booth v. Churner, </em>532 U.S. 731, 740, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001) (holding that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) requires prisoners to exhaust a process and not a remedy). Moreover, the district court erred by ruling Auer had \u201cavailable\u201d an administrative remedy under Nev.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 209.243 which he was required to exhaust before bringing his section 1983 action. <em>See Rumbles v. Hill, </em>182 F.3d 1064, 1070 (9th Cir.1999) (concluding that prisoners do not have to exhaust state tort claim procedures before bring section 1983 action), <em>overruled on other grounds by Booth v. Churner, </em>532 U.S. 731, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM summary judgment on Auer\u2019s claims brought under the First and Fourteenth Amendments and ADA. We AFFIRM, in part, the district court\u2019s summary judgment on Auer\u2019s excessive force claim. We REVERSE the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Auer\u2019s excessive force claim against defendants Hammock, Zamora, Monroe, Nickel, Jones, Hendrix, Huston, Holt and Axtel and REMAND for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-12\">The parties shall bear their own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-13\">AFFIRMED, in part, REVERSED, in part, and REMANDED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b842-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b843-15\">.
