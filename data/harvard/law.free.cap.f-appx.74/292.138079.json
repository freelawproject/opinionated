The decision to grant or deny asylum relief is conclusive \u201cunless manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D) (2000). We conclude that the record supports the immigration judge\u2019s decision that Bassant failed to establish her eligibility for asylum. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b) (2003); <em>Gonahasa v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 538, 541 (4th Cir.1999). As the decision in this case is not manifestly contrary to law, we cannot grant the relief Bassant seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-24\">The standard for gaming withholding of removal is \u201cmore stringent than that for asylum eligibility.\u201d <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999). An applicant for \u25a0withholding must demonstrate a clear probability of persecution. <em>INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). As Bassant failed to establish she is eligible for asylum, she cannot meet the higher standard for withholding.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Accordingly, we deny Bassant\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
