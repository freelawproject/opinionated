We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo both summary judgment and dismissal. <em>Barnett v. Centoni </em>31 F.3d 813, 815-16 (9th Cir.1994) (per curiam). We also review de novo the denial of a request for a jury trial. <em>United States v. California Mobile Home Park Mgmt. Co., </em>107 F.3d 1374, 1377 (9th Cir.1997). We affirm the summary judgment and dismissal orders, vacate the bench trial verdict, and remand for a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-11\">Summary judgment was proper on McClure\u2019s claims against Catherine Knox in her supervisory capacity because McClure presented no evidence that Knox\u2019s alleged failure to supervise medical personnel resulted in a constitutional violation. <em>See Quintanilla v. City of Downey, </em>84 F.3d 353, 356 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-17\">Dismissal of McClure\u2019s claims against a deceased party was proper, because McClure failed to move to substitute parties within ninety days of receiving notice that the party had died. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 25(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-18\">McClure\u2019s contention that the district court- impermissibly interfered with his Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial has merit. Federal courts \u201cmust indulge every reasonable presumption against the waiver of the' jury trial,\u201d <em>United States v. Nordbrock, </em>941 F.2d 947, 950 (9th Cir.1991), and this is particularly true where a party is appearing pro se, <em>Lawson v. Kolender, </em>658 F.2d 1362, 1371-72 (9th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-19\">Compelling McClure to choose between consenting to a bench trial, or waiting until the end of his period of incarceration to try his case before a jury, rendered his waiver of the right to jury trial less than voluntary. <em>See United States v. California Mobile Home Park Mgmt. Co., </em>107 F.3d 1374, 1379-80 (9th Cir.1997) (holding the right to jury trial is not waived where party objects to bench trial). The district court\u2019s error was not harmless, <em>see Fuller v. City of Oakland, </em>47 F.3d 1522, 1532 (9th Cir.1995), because a reasonable jury could have found for McClure on his Eighth Amendment claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, as well as his ADA and RA retaliation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-20\">Because we remand for a trial by jury, we do not reach McClure\u2019s contentions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>regarding evidentiary and other rulings affecting the bench trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Summary judgment is AFFIRMED; the bench trial verdict is VACATED and the case REMANDED for jury trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b864-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
