Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-24\">On appeal, Kukash contends the district court improperly admitted irrelevant testimony from prosecution witness Sandra McCoy. We review for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Queen, </em>132 F.3d 991, 995 (4th Cir.1997). Because we find the testimony was relevant under Fed. R.Evid. 402, we find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-25\">Kukash also contends the district court improperly excluded exhibits regarding the behavioral problems of one of his clients. We find the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing these exhibits, as Kukash failed to lay a proper foundation for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-26\">Kukash next contends the trial court abused its discretion by limiting the testimony of defense witness Berkeley Alexander. We find the district court did not err in sustaining the Government\u2019s objection to the proposed testimony, as its probative value, if any, was outweighed by its tendency to create confusion and to mislead the jury. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-27\">Kukash next contends the district court erred by allowing the Government to introduce evidence of his past crimes and to question him regarding that evidence. Although Kukash properly objected to the line of questioning, he failed to object to the introduction of the evidence itself. Thus, review of the district court\u2019s decision to admit those records as evidence is for plain error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 103(a). We find no error, plain or otherwise, in the district court\u2019s admission of the records or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>its decision to allow the questioning. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 609, 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Finally, Kukash contends the court erred by giving the jury a confusing instruction on the elements of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1320a-7b(b) and by refusing to give his own proposed instructions. In general, the decision to give a jury instruction and the content of that instruction are reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Burgos, 55 </em>F.3d 933, 935 (4th Cir.1995). Because we find the district court\u2019s instruction properly stated the law, while Kukash\u2019s did not, we find the district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Kukash\u2019s convictions. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
