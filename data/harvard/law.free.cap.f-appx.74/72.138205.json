Poissant has appealed a district court judgment affirming the decision of the Commissioner of Health and Human Services (\u201cCommissioner\u201d) which denied the claimant\u2019s applications for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income payments. The claimant\u2019s only argument on appeal is that the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) failed to sufficiently support his finding that the claimant\u2019s subjective complaints of pain were \u201cnot entirely credible.\u201d One of the reasons the ALJ partially discounted the claimant\u2019s testimony was because of \u201cdiscrepancies between the claimant\u2019s assertions and information contained in the documentary reports.\u201d While a more detailed explanation of the discrepancies would have been preferable, <em>see Frustaglia v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>829 F.2d 192, 195 (1st Cir.1987), we have examined the record and find substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s finding of discrepancies between the claimant\u2019s testimony and the objective medical evidence. These discrepancies are significant and major. They amply support the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that the claimant was not entirely credible in respect to his subjective complaints of pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-22\">The judgment of the district court is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
