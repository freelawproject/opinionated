After killing Patrick Hall, William DeLoach was convicted of voluntary manslaughter. The California courts held that, by his cross-examination of prosecution witness Darbyshire, DeLoach\u2019s trial counsel \u201copened the door\u201d to evidence of De-Loach\u2019s bad character and Hall\u2019s good character under Cal. Evid.Code \u00a7 1103. While this ruling may have been a mistake under California law, <em>see People v. Gin Shue, </em>58 Cal.App.2d 625, 137 P.2d 742, 474-48 (1943), a mistake of state law does not create grounds for granting a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. We may grant a habeas writ only if a state court\u2019s determination is contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">DeLoach credibly argues that the California courts allowed DeLoach to be tried partly on the basis of propensity evidence. But the Supreme Court has specifically left open the question of whether a state law allowing the use of propensity evidence would violate the Due Process Clause. <em>See Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 75 n. 5, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991). We therefore cannot say that the California courts\u2019 evidentiary rulings in this case were contrary to or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-12\">2. DeLoach also argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for \u201copening the door\u201d to character evidence. Once the prosecutor had elicited testimony regarding Hall\u2019s character from Darbyshire, De-Loach\u2019s trial counsel may have had a plausible tactical reason for attempting to impeach Darbyshire rather than objecting to the prosecutor\u2019s questions. DeLoach\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s failure to anticipate the California courts\u2019 (somewhat puzzling) evidentiary ruling does not show that his performance fell below standards of competent professional assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-13\">3. DeLoach contends that prosecutorial misconduct denied him his right to a fair trial. During pre-trial conference the prosecutor was less than forthcoming about her plans to use character evidence. But prior to the pre-trial conference, the prosecutor had already disclosed the statements of Michael Moore to the defense. Because Moore\u2019s testimony about De-Loach\u2019s bad acts was the primary means by which the prosecution attempted to show DeLoach\u2019s bad character at trial, the trial was not infected with unfairness by any failure to disclose. Nor did the prosecutor\u2019s questioning about the presence of LSD so infect the trial with unfairness that DeLoach was denied his due process right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-14\">4. Finally, DeLoach argues that his due process rights were violated by the trial court\u2019s failure to give his requested jury instructions. A defendant is entitled to jury instructions that present the crux <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>of his defense, but he is not entitled to specific instructions that pinpoint certain aspects of the defense or that suggest conclusions from certain pieces of evidence. <em>See Bradley v. Duncan, </em>315 F.3d 1091, 1098-99 (9th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Del Muro, </em>87 F.3d 1078, 1081 (9th Cir.1996). In this case, the trial court presented adequate instructions regarding DeLoach\u2019s theory of self-defense. The trial court\u2019s failure to present the specific instructions requested by DeLoach does not constitute a basis for federal habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision to deny DeLoach\u2019s petition for writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b723-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
