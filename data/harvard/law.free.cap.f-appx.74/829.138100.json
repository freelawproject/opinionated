California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Salas-Carpintero\u2019s counsel has submitted a brief stating that he has found no meritorious issues for review. No supplemental pro se brief has been filed. The government did not file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">Because Salas-Carpintero knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal and was sentenced within the terms of the plea agreement, we lack jurisdiction to consider his appeal. <em>See United States v. Nunez, </em>223 F.3d 956, 958 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201cGenerally, courts will enforce a defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal if (1) the language of the waiver encompasses the defendant\u2019s right to appeal on the grounds claimed on appeal, and (2) the waiver is knowingly and voluntarily made.\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b856-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
