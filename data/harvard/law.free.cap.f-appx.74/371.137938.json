In her action, Hoover challenged the termination of her employment by WWOZ, a New Orleans not-for-profit radio station, as an underwriter who sold airtime and as an on-air host. Also made a defendant was appellee Dolores Lindsey, who was WWOZ\u2019s underwriting manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The district court dismissed the following claims alleged by Hoover: (1) sex discrimination claims against WWOZ and Lindsey; (2) a race discrimination claim against Lindsey; (3) an age discrimination claim against Lindsey; (4) Fourteenth Amendment equal protection claims against WWOZ and Lindsey; (5) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims against both, for mail fraud and/or tampering; and (6) claims against both under the Equal pay Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d). After a hearing, the court dismissed Hoover\u2019s remaining race and age discrimination claims against WWOZ, on grounds that the court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>See Greenlees v. Eidenmuller Enterprises, Inc., </em>32 F.3d 197, 198\u2014 99 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">To be entitled to proceed IFP in this court, Hoover must show that she is a pauper and that she will present a non-frivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982). Although it appears that Hoover is financially eligible to proceed IFP, she has not identified a nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Nor has she set forth factual allegations and legal arguments to demonstrate that she will raise nonfrivolous issues on appeal. Accordingly, Hoover\u2019s IFP motion is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">Hoover is not entitled to transcripts at government expense because she has not been granted leave to proceed IFP and she has not shown why she needs the transcript. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(f); <em>Harvey v. Andrist, </em>754 F.2d 569, 571 (5th Cir.1985). Accordingly, her motion for transcripts at government expense is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-12\">Because we have concluded on this review that the appeal is frivolous, IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-13\">MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b398-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
