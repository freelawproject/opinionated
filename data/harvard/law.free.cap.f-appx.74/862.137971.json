R.App. P. 34(a); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The cause is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b889-15\">ORDER AND JUDGMENT <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-16\">Defendant-Appellant Jesus Osuna-Cervantes appeals following his conviction pursuant to a guilty plea for unlawful reentry of a deported alien in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). He was sentenced to a term of 57 months imprisonment (the low end of the guideline range) and two years supervised release. Counsel for Mr. Osuna-Cervantes filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and moved for leave to withdraw as counsel. The certificate of service on the brief and motion indicate that Mr. Osuna-Cervantes was served with copies; he has not responded. <em>See </em>10th Cir. R. 46.4(B)(2). Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we dismiss the appeal and grant counsel\u2019s request to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-17\">In the motion to withdraw, counsel for Mr. Osuna-Cervantes states her belief that the appeal is frivolous, having reviewed the applicable law and the record. In <em>Anders, </em>the Supreme Court held that if appointed counsel \u201cfinds [her] case to be wholly frivolous, after a conscientious examination of it, [she] should so advise the court and request permission to withdraw.\u201d 386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396. Where counsel has filed an <em>Anders </em>brief, we must conduct a \u201cfull examination of all the proceedings\u201d to determine if the appeal is \u201cwholly frivolous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If we concur in counsel\u2019s evaluation of the case, we may grant the request to withdraw and dismiss the appeal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b890-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>After a thorough review of the record we conclude there are no meritorious issues for appeal. As to the conviction, we note at the outset that because a defendant who pleads guilty waives all non-jurisdictional challenges to his conviction, his \u201conly avenue for challenging his conviction is to claim that he did not voluntarily or intelligently enter his plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Wright, </em>43 F.3d 491, 494 (10th Cir.1994) (citing <em>Mabry v. Johnson, </em>467 U.S. 504, 508-09, 104 S.Ct. 2543, 81 L.Ed.2d 437 (1984)). However, Mr. Osuna-Cervantes has not argued that his plea was involuntary or unknowing, and nothing in the record suggests that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">As to the sentence, the record reveals that the sentence imposed was within the applicable guideline range, that the guideline range was correctly determined, and that the district court did not exceed the statutory maximum sentence for the offense of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">The argument that the district court should have sua sponte departed downward from the applicable guideline range based upon a discouraged factor, specifically recent employment history, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.5, is rejected. Given the discretionary nature of a decision not to depart (a decision that ordinarily cannot be appealed), there is no plain error in this situation. Moreover, Mr. Osuna-Cervantes\u2019 recent employment history would not constitute an exceptional circumstance that might furnish a basis for departure. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>158 F.3d 492, 498 (10th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">The argument that the district court should have taken evidence after Mr. Osuna-Cervantes abandoned his objection to a criminal history point used to determine his sentence is also rejected. When confronted with fingerprint evidence concerning the underlying conviction, Mr. OsunaCervantes folded, and the district court could then rely upon the presentence report without the taking of evidence. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(3)(A) (court \u201cmay accept any undisputed portion of the presentence report as a finding of fact\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">Accordingly, we DISMISS the appeal and GRANT counsel\u2019s request to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b889-18\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
