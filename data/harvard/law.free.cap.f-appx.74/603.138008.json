This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>Herndon filed his civil rights complaint against several employees of the Michigan Department of Corrections (\u201cMDOC\u201d), alleging that MDOC employees retaliated against him for his appearance as a witness in another case against MDOC by issuing misconduct reports, which resulted in loss of privileges. On June 30, 2000, the district court adopted a magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation that Herndon\u2019s claims against all defendants, except Herndon\u2019s access-to-the-courts claim against defendant Steve Niemi, be dismissed as frivolous or for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2), 1915A(b), and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Herndon asserted due process and First Amendment access-to-the-courts claims against defendant Niemi. Specifically, he alleged that defendant Niemi destroyed a motion for relief from judgment, as well as caused Herndon to miss his chance to appeal a major misconduct ticket. Defendant Niemi filed a motion for summary judgment on Herndon\u2019s claims. The magistrate judge recommended that summary judgment be granted in favor of Niemi on Herndon\u2019s due process claim. However, the magistrate judge recommended that summary judgment for defendant Niemi be denied on Herndon\u2019s access-to-the-courts claim. On March 11, 2002, the district court issued an order limiting Herndon\u2019s access-to-the-courts claim solely to the issue of whether he was denied the right to appeal his misconduct convictions (access to courts claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Thereafter, defendant Niemi filed a second motion for summary judgment on the remaining access-to-the-courts claim. The magistrate judge recommended that defendant Niemi\u2019s motion be granted. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation over Herndon\u2019s objections. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Upon review of the briefs and the record, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. Because the magistrate judge articulated, and the district court adopted, specific and thorough reasons for the decision, the issuance of a detailed written opinion would be duplicative and would serve no useful purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">Accordingly, we deny the motion for counsel and affirm the district court\u2019s judgment for the reasons stated and adopted by the district court in the judgments filed on June 30, 2000, March 11, 2002, and September 27, 2002.
