Having carefully reviewed the record, we conclude summary judgment was proper \u2014 for the reasons explained in the district court\u2019s order \u2014 as to Mr. Evans\u2019s claims that he was unconstitutionally exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS); that he was subjected to retaliatory cell searches, a disciplinary, and transfer; and that his legal papers were destroyed. We thus affirm the dismissal of these claims. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">However, Mr. Evans\u2019s claim that defendant Patricia Houseman threatened to send him to segregation if he did not stop filing complaints about ETS warrants remand. <em>See Burgess v. Moore, </em>39 F.3d 216, 218 (8th Cir.1994) (threat of retaliation is sufficient injury if made in retaliation for inmate\u2019s use of prison grievance procedure); <em>Madewell v. Roberts, </em>909 F.2d 1203, 1206 (8th Cir.1990) (actions taken by prison officials against prisoner which would otherwise be proper become unconstitutional when taken in retaliation for prisoner\u2019s exercise of constitutional right). Accordingly, we reverse the dismissal of this retaliation claim against Ms. Houseman and remand for further proceedings; in all other respects, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-12\">A true copy.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
