Beistline, United States District Court Judge for the District of Alaska, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b802-8\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">Larry Evans was convicted after a jury trial in Nevada state court on charges of first degree kidnapping, sexual assault of a minor, and possession of a stolen vehicle. He timely appeals from the district court\u2019s decision to deny a second amended petition for habeas corpus, seeking relief from the state court conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Evans raised a number of alleged constitutional violations with respect to his conviction below, each of which were considered and rejected by the district court, and he renews the same arguments on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">After careful consideration of the issues presented on appeal, both in the briefs and in oral argument, and having conducted a de novo review of Judge Hogan\u2019s order denying the habeas petition, we agree with the analysis and conclusions reached by the district court in its order entered June 5, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-11\">We supplement the opinion of the district court by expressly rejecting Evans\u2019s argument that a standard of materiality different from the one employed by the district court should be used to assess the prosecutor\u2019s alleged failure to disclose evidence favorable to the defendant, a failure which would result in a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 86, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). Evans contends that \u201cthe prosecutor knew or should have known\u201d that the testimony given by D\u2019Aprile, purportedly a key prosecution witness, \u201cwas false,\u201d and thus the \u201cprosecutor\u2019s knowing use of perjured testimony or, equivalently, the prosecutor\u2019s knowing failure to disclose that testimony used to convict the defendant was false\u201d should have resulted in \u201ca materiality standard under which the fact that testimony is perjured is considered material unless failure to disclose it would be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 678-80, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985). However, this definition of materiality remains unavailable to Evans, as there never has been a finding of perjury nor a showing that the prosecution knew or should have known D\u2019Aprile fabricated her testimony. Counsel acknowledged as much at argument. The district court applied the correct standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-16\">Furthermore, even assuming the prosecution had known D\u2019Aprile\u2019s testimony amounted to perjury (and was, in fact, false), failure to disclose it would have been \u201charmless beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>doubt.\u201d First, most of the information withheld by the government was known to the defense prior to trial. Moreover, that D\u2019Aprile may have been untruthful about what transpired prior to the offense does not mean she lied about Evans\u2019s actual criminal conduct; indeed, testimony corroborating her account was introduced at trial. <em>See Belmontes v. Woodford, </em>335 F.3d 1024, 1045 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201c[W]e do not believe that Bolanos\u2019 false testimony regarding the absence of prior arrests could have affected the judgment of the jury. As we explained, his testimony regarding the events surrounding the murder was in most respects corroborated by independent witnesses.\u201d). Viewing the evidence cumulatively, there is no \u201creasonable likelihood that the false testimony could have affected the judgment of the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 103, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">The judgment is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b802-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b802-14\">. We review the district court\u2019s decision de novo. <em>See Dows v. Wood, </em>211 F.3d 480, 484 (9th Cir.2000). We may not grant Evans relief unless we conclude that the state court\u2019s adjudication of his claim \"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
