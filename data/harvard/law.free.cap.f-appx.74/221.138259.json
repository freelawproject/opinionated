Three years later, Lavanture pleaded guilty in state court to having committed real estate securities fraud. After holding a hearing and finding Lavanture\u2019s state court conviction violated a condition of his probation, the federal District Court revoked his probation and resentenced him to imprisonment. Lavanture appeals the District Court\u2019s decision. We affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-19\">On February 18, 1998, Lavanture pleaded guilty to Count Three of an indictment filed in the District of New Jersey that charged on or about March 24, 1997, he used an unauthorized Visa credit card in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1029(a)(2) and (b)(1). On April 21, 1999, the District Court sentenced Lavanture to five years probation and a $10,000 fine. As a condition of his probation, Lavanture was instructed: \u201c[wjhile on probation, you shall not commit another Federal, state, or local crime.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>On July 18, 2001, a grand jury in the County of New York indicted Lavanture on 23 counts of real estate securities fraud, committed \u201con or about and between November 18, 1997 and April 6, 2001.\u201d Lavanture pleaded guilty to two of these counts on April 9, 2002. The State moved to have Lavanture sentenced as a predicate felon, citing his prior conviction for federal wire fraud. At Lavanture\u2019s sentencing on June 5, 2002, the New York Supreme Court denied the State\u2019s motion, finding the state court indictment alleged a scheme to defraud over a period of time and that some of the conduct occurred prior to the federal conviction. The Supreme Court imposed concurrent sentences of one to three years imprisonment on the first count and two to six years on the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">On August 9, 2001 \u2014 after Lavanture had been indicted by the state grand jury but prior to his guilty plea and sentencing in state court \u2014 the United States Probation Office petitioned the District Court for a warrant to arrest Lavanture for violating his federal sentence. The District Court held a hearing on November 25, 2002, and found Lavanture\u2019s conviction in New York state court violated a condition of his probation. Accordingly, the District Court revoked Lavanture\u2019s probation and sentenced him to 24 months imprisonment, to run consecutively to his state court prison sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">Lavanture challenges on three grounds the District Court\u2019s decision to revoke his probation. None of the arguments is persuasive, and we address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-12\">Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3565(a) provides a District Court may revoke a sentence of probation \u201c[i]f the defendant violates a condition of probation at any time prior to the expiration or termination of the term of probation....\u201d Lavanture argues that because the criminal conduct giving rise to his guilty plea in state court occurred prior to the date he was sentenced to probation in federal court, the District Court erred in revoking his probation. The Government responds that the decision was appropriate because the District Court based the revocation on a state crime that continued for approximately two years after Lavanture was sentenced to probation. We review a District Court\u2019s order to revoke a defendant\u2019s probation for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gov\u2019t of the Virgin Islands v. Martinez, </em>239 F.3d 293, 297 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-13\">Lavanture\u2019s argument is based almost exclusively on the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Twitty, </em>44 F.3d 410 (6th Cir.1995).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In that case, the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>dant pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud in federal court in October 1992. In December 1992, while awaiting sentencing, the defendant cashed checks while posing as her deceased sister. The federal District Court sentenced her to probation in January 1993, and in October 1993 she pleaded guilty in state court to check fraud. The District Court revoked her probation in May 1994. However, the Sixth Circuit reversed. It noted that many circuits \u201chave held that the statutory language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3565 and its predecessor statutes authorize the revocation of probation for conduct occurring after imposition of the probationary sentence but before commencement of probation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 412 (citing, <em>inter alia, United States v. Camarata, </em>828 F.2d 974 (3d Cir.1987)). In those circumstances, a defendant has fair notice, consistent with due process, of what conduct may result in the revocation of probation. The same is not true, according to the Sixth Circuit, \u201cfor conduct which occurs prior to the date on which the defendant was sentenced to probation.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">But <em>Twitty </em>is inapplicable here, where the District Court did not revoke Lavanture\u2019s probation for presentenee conduct. He argues the New York Supreme Court\u2019s refusal to sentence him as a predicate felon demonstrates the criminal conduct on which his state court conviction was based-according to the indictment, committed \u201con or about and between November 18, 1997 to April 6, 2001\u201d \u2014 occurred prior to the date he was sentenced to probation in federal District Court \u2014 April 21, 1999. This is correct, but only partly so. While the state court did find Lavanture\u2019s securities fraud scheme had begun before the date of his wire fraud conviction in federal court, it also found his criminal conduct was an ongoing enterprise that continued after his federal conviction. More specifically, the state court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">With respect to count 1, it seems to me that the allegation in count 1 is that basically it was a scheme to defraud over a period of time. Some of that period is before the federal conviction, <em>some of it is after the federal conviction, </em>so it seems to me under the circumstances I can\u2019t really make a finding that the crime was completed prior to his plea in this case because it really isn\u2019t worded that way and that\u2019s my ruling.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">App. at 88 (emphasis added). Indeed, during his state court plea colloquy Lavanture himself acknowledged that he continued to engage in criminal activity for almost two years after he was sentenced to probation on April 21,1999.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>In sum, unlike in <em>Twitty, </em>where the criminal offense involved discrete events (fraudulent check cashing) completed prior to sentencing, Lavanture\u2019s multiyear real estate fraud was an ongoing violation of a condition of his probation, committed \u201cpri- or to the expiration or termination of the term of probation.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3565(a). Accordingly, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in revoking Lavanture\u2019s probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">As instructed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3565(a)(1), the District Court held a hearing to consider whether Lavanture\u2019s probation should be revoked. Lavanture argues the District Court\u2019s questioning of him at this hearing \u201cdisclosed bias against the defendant, requiring reversal on grounds of excessive judicial intervention.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 12. We have recognized, as have other circuits, that a \u201ctrial judge may elicit germane facts through interrogation of witnesses on his own initiative,\u201d but also cautioned the court \u201cmust not \u2018abandon [its] proper role and assume that of an advocate.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. </em>Wilensky, 757 F.2d 594, 597 (3d Cir.1985) (internal citations omitted). Lavanture contends the District Court\u2019s questioning in this instance was \u201cinappropriate and served no purpose,\u201d and \u201cfell below established standards of fairness.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 16, 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">This claim is not well-founded. Lavanture raised no objection at the revocation hearing, and thus we review the District Court\u2019s questioning of him for plain error. <em>See United States v. Vazquez, </em>271 F.3d 93, 99 (3d Cir.2001) <em>(en banc). </em>Under the plain error standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-9\">before an appellate court can correct an error not raised at trial, there must be (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affect[s] substantial rights. If all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously a\u00a3fect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-10\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 466-67, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997)). Here there was not even an error. First, as <em>Wilenksy </em>and related decisions emphasize, excessive questioning of a witness may especially be prejudicial where the bench influences the jury toward a conviction. <em>See Wilensky, </em>757 F.2d at 598 (\u201cIn order to reverse on grounds of excessive judicial intervention, the record must either \u2018disclose actual bias on the part of the trial judge (or) leave the reviewing court with an abiding impression that the judge\u2019s remarks and questioning of witnesses projected <em>to the jury </em>an appearance of advocacy or partiality.\u201d \u2019) (emphasis added) (quoting <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number><em>Beaty, </em>722 F.2d 1090, 1093 (3d Cir.1983)). Lavanture\u2019s probation revocation hearing did not involve a jury. While it may be possible a District Court\u2019s questioning in these circumstances could be so unfair as to violate a probationer\u2019s due process rights, we are mindful that \u201cin non-jury proceedings, questioning by the judge will rarely be prejudicial to the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Webb, </em>83 F.3d 913, 917 (7th Cir.1996) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Moreover, the District Court\u2019s inquiries in this case were entirely justified. Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3565(a) mandates the sentencing judge first hold a hearing to determine whether a probationer has violated the terms of his sentence and, if so, whether to resentence him pursuant to the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), including \u201cthe need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A). Having reviewed the record, we believe the District Court\u2019s questions were intended to satisfy this purpose and well within acceptable bounds. Judge Ackerman asked Lavanture about the nature and extent of the actions that comprised his state court offenses and whether he had paid fully the restitution and fines imposed for both his state and federal offenses. This was not error, much less plain error that affected Lavanture\u2019s substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">Lavanture\u2019s final claim is that the representation provided by his former lawyer constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. Lavanture argues that the former counsel\u2019s performance was deficient in failing to object to the District Court\u2019s allegedly excessive questioning at the probation revocation hearing. Lavanture also alleges that in October 2002 he paid the lawyer $3000 to represent him at the probation hearing, but the lawyer ignored his case. When Lavanture stated he would retain new counsel and seek a refund, his then-counsel threatened to justify the fee by fabricating his hours. Lavanture also claims he and his lawyer argued repeatedly over the lawyer\u2019s recommendation to accept a plea offered by the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">An ineffective assistance of counsel claim requires Lavanture to demonstrate his attorney\u2019s representation was both professionally unreasonable and prejudicial to the outcome of the proceeding. <em>See United States v. Roberson, </em>194 F.3d 408, 418 (3d Cir.1999) (citing <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 689, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984)). We typically will not entertain an ineffective assistance of counsel claim raised for the first time on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Haywood, </em>155 F.3d 674, 678 (3d Cir.1998). \u201c[T]he proper avenue for pursuing such claims is through a collateral proceeding in which the factual basis for the claim may be developed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). But there is a \u201cnarrow exception\u201d to this rule: \u201c[wjhere the record is sufficient to allow a determination of ineffective assistance of counsel, an evidentiary hearing to develop the facts is not needed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">We agree with the Government the record is sufficient to rule on Lavanture\u2019s first allegation, but not the second. As discussed in the preceding section, we are unpersuaded by Lavanture\u2019s argument the District Court\u2019s questioning of him at the probation revocation hearing was excessive. Thus, his attorney\u2019s failure to object to this questioning was neither unreasonable nor prejudicial. The record contains no information, however, as to Lavanture\u2019s claim that the attorney collected payment for work he had not performed and that he pressured Lavanture to take a plea. These claims are more properly pursued in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>a collateral proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">#</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">For the reasons stated, we shall affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b248-10\">. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(1) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b249-6\">. Indeed, this section of Lavanture\u2019s brief is five pages, and more than half of the text appears to have been cut and pasted directly from <em>Twitty, </em>with almost no alteration or attribution. In so doing, Lavanture\u2019s counsel ill-represents his client\u2019s interests and for several reasons we note our strong disfavor of the practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">First, it is certainly misleading and quite possibly plagiarism to quote at length a judicial opinion (or, for that matter, any source) without clear attribution. For example, at pages seven and eight of Lavanture\u2019s brief his counsel has copied, nearly verbatim, extended passages from <em>Twitty </em>\u2014 including string cites and the Court\u2019s summation of the cases\u2019 holdings \u2014 but <em>Twitty </em>is not cited for the first time until page nine. And upon introducing <em>Twitty, </em>the brief reproduces the Sixth Circuit\u2019s language almost word-for-word until page eleven, again without adequate citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-15\">Second, by simply reprinting the Sixth Circuit\u2019s work out of its original context, certain statements in Lavanture\u2019s brief are inaccurate. For example, it is common and correct for the Sixth Circuit in its opinion to refer to \"this Circuit,\u201d or to describe Twitty\u2019s rights in the present tense; the same is not true for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>brief filed in the Third Circuit eight years after <em>Twitty </em>was decided. To cite another example, the Sixth Circuit's statement \u2014 \"We fail to see how one can violate a condition of probation before it exists,\u201d 44 F.3d at 413\u2014 has been changed in Lavanture's brief to: \"One can violate a condition of probation before it exists.\u201d Appellant's Br. at 10. Deleting the clause \"we fail to see how,\u201d without modifying the auxiliary verb \"can,\u201d obviously changes the meaning of the sentence, an error overlooked by Lavanture\u2019s counsel. In fact, the entire paragraph in <em>Twitty </em>where this sentence appears is included in Lavanture\u2019s brief without any citation to <em>Twitty </em>and without any changes save two instances where the Sixth Circuit stated \"[w]e fail to see\u201d and \"[a]s we have said.\u201d <em>Compare </em>44 F.3d at 413 (first full paragraph), <em>with </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 10 (second full paragraph).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b250-10\">. <em>Id. </em>at 413. The Sixth Circuit noted its disagreement with <em>United States v. James, </em>848 F.2d 160 (11th Cir.1988), which it described as \"[t]he only case holding that probation is revocable for presentence conduct.\u201d <em>Twitty, </em>44 F.3d at 412. Because Lavanture's probation was not revoked for presentence conduct, we express no opinion on this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b250-11\">.
