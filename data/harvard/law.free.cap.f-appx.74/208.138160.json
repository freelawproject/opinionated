Irenas, Senior United States District Judge for the District of New Jersey, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b235-12\">OPINION OF THE COURT</p>\n<author id=\"b235-13\">SMITH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b235-14\">On January 14, 2001, Appellant Nizim Darwish and four other individuals were charged with eight counts of defrauding financial institutions by depositing checks which were either counterfeit, forged, unauthorized or for which there were insufficient funds in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1344 and 2. Following dismissal of counts seven and eight, a jury convicted Darwish of each of the remaining six counts of bank fraud. At trial, several of Darwish\u2019s codefendants testified that Darwish supplied the fraudulent checks that they deposited in their bank accounts and that Darwish demanded payment from them of a portion of the amount of each check.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-18\">On February 15, 2002, Darwish filed a <em>pro se </em>appeal from the jury\u2019s verdict even though he had not yet been sentenced. His appeal \u201cwas treated as filed\u201d after his sentencing on June 6, 2002. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(2). The District Court had jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We exercise jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-19\">After we appointed Darwish\u2019s trial counsel to represent him, counsel moved to withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and Local Appellate Rule 109.2(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>Anders, </em>the Supreme Court stated that the \u201cconstitutional requirement of substantial equality and fair process\u201d means that appellate counsel must act as an advocate for the defendant. 386 U.S. at 744. Thus, counsel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>role as advocate requires that he support his client\u2019s appeal to the best of his ability. Of course, if counsel finds his case to be wholly frivolous, after a conscientious examination of it, he should so advise the court and request permission to withdraw. That request must, however, be accompanied by a brief referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\"><em>Id. </em>As we explained in <em>United States v. Youla, </em>241 F.3d 296, 300 (3d Cir.2001), the <em>Anders </em>brief must demonstrate that counsel has \u201cthoroughly examined the record in search of appealable issues,\u201d and it must \u201cexplain why the issues are frivolous.\u201d Accordingly, our inquiry is twofold: (1) whether counsel adequately fulfilled the requirements of <em>Anders; </em>and (2) \u201cwhether an independent review of the record presents any nonfrivolous issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Marvin, </em>211 F.3d 778, 780 (3d Cir.2000)); <em>see also Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744 (explaining that the court must proceed, \u201cafter a full examination of all the proceedings, to decide whether the case is wholly frivolous.\u201d). If review fails to reveal any nonfrivolous issues, the court \u201cmay grant counsel\u2019s request to withdraw and dismiss the appeal.\u201d <em>Anders, </em>386 U.S. at 744.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">After considering counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief, we are satisfied that he thoroughly examined the record for issues of arguable merit and fulfilled the requirements of <em>Anders. </em>Counsel summarized the testimony of the various witnesses, including that of Darwish\u2019s coconspirators who described the extent to which Darwish participated in the fraudulent scheme. This damaging testimony, counsel acknowledged, established Darwish\u2019s culpability in the scheme, leaving no issues of arguable merit for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Counsel also addressed Darwish\u2019s contention, raised both in conference with counsel and in his own <em>pro se </em>informal brief submitted to this Court, that he was not guilty and that the jury erred because it credited the testimony of his coconspirators. Counsel recognized that Darwish\u2019s argument was meritless inasmuch as a jury is free to credit or to reject, in whole or in part, the evidence admitted at trial. In this ease, the jury obviously rejected Darwish\u2019s testimony and credited that of his coconspirators.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">We agree with counsel\u2019s assessment of Darwish\u2019s appeal. Our own independent review of the record fails to reveal any nonfrivolous issues for appeal. Accordingly, we will grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and affirm the judgment of the District Court entered on June 7, 2002. We certify that the issues presented in the appeal lack legal merit and thus do not require the filing of a petition for writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court 3d Cir. LAR 109.2(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b235-16\">. Rule 109.2(a) of the Third Circuit states:</p>\n<p id=\"AWt\">Where, upon review of the district court record, trial counsel is persuaded that the appeal presents no issue of even arguable merit, trial counsel may file a motion to withdraw and supporting brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), which shall be served upon the appellant and the United States. The United States shall file a brief in response. Appellant may also file a brief in response <em>pro se. </em>After all the briefs have been filed, the clerk will refer the case to a merits panel. If the panel agrees that the appeal is without merit, it will grant trial counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>motion, and dispose of the appeal without appointing new counsel. If the panel finds arguable merit to the appeal, it will discharge counsel, appoint substitute counsel, restore the case to the calendar, and order supplemental briefing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
