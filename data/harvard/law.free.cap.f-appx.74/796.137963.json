The Panel unanimously finds this case suitable for decision without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 34(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b823-12\">. Honorable Charles R. Weiner, Senior United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b823-6\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">The issue raised in this appeal is whether Section 521 of the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1831d(a), completely preempts state law claims for breach of contract and fraud arising from appellant\u2019s credit card policies. This case was originally set for argument on February 11, 2003. That argument date was vacated pending the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Beneficial Nat\u2019l. Bank v. Anderson, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 123 S.Ct. 2058, 156 L.Ed.2d 1 (2003). After the decision was handed down, we invited supplemental briefing to address the impact of that case on our decision. Having reviewed the parties\u2019 submissions, we find it appropriate to remand the case to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">The district court based its decision that Klussman\u2019s claims were not completely preempted by Section 521 \u2014 and that federal question jurisdiction therefore did not exist to support their removal \u2014 upon the opinion of the Eleventh Circuit which the Supreme Court reversed in <em>Anderson. </em>That case involved a related statute, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 86, governing usury claims against federally chartered banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-11\">The substantive factual allegations against CCB, stated succinctly, are that the bank</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-14\">1. automatically, and without prior consent, enrolls customers in its Applied Advantage Program for which it charges a fee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-15\">2. charges an interest rate (alleged to be excessive) that is not disclosed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-16\">3. charges customers, without prior authorization, fees for an illusory credit account protection service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-17\">4. has engaged in a fraudulent \u201clate fee scheme\u201d whereby it purposefully mails its bills late, and fails to promptly credit payments as they are remitted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-18\">5. deceptively notifies customers that they have been pre-approved for an increase in their available credit line, without notifying the customers they will be charged a fee for the increase.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-19\">6. debits customer accounts without authorization, inadequately discloses fees and APRs applicable to cash advances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-20\">7. misrepresents its service as a credit repair service, rather than high interest card.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-21\">8. fails to give its customers the disclosures required by Cal. Civil Code \u00a7 1789.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-22\">While it appears that the rationale of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Anderson </em>would extend to usury claims against state chartered, federally insured banks such as CCB, we do not decide this question. Instead, we remand to the district court for it to consider and decide, in the first instance, whether and the extent to which any of these allegations are preempted under <em>Anderson </em>and applicable law, providing a basis for federal jurisdiction. The district court is also instructed to consider the impact, if any, of federal regulations, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>such as 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 7.4001(a), on the issue of whether the charges at issue in the complaint constitute \u201cinterest\u201d or are otherwise of a nature as to require preemption of state law challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s prior opinion and remand the matter for further proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b823-23\">. This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
