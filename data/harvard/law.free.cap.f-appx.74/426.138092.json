In response, he petitions for review of a final order dismissing the appeal from the Immigration Judge\u2019s order denying his applications for asylum and withholding of deportation under \u00a7 208(a) and \u00a7 243(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158, issued by the BIA. In response, Ibrahim filed a petition for review of his BIA removal order in this court, challenging the BIA\u2019s determination that Ibrahim is removable as an aggravated felon based on his 1986 conviction for possession of stolen mail. Ibrahim argues that his conviction for possession of stolen mail under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1708 is not a \u201ctheft offense\u201d as defined by section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act. We reject this argument, and we therefore dismiss his petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Under the transitional rules promulgated under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (the \u201cIIRIRA\u201d), Pub. L. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009, we have no jurisdiction to consider appeals from final orders of deportation that are issued \u201cby reason of [an alien] having committed an [theft and forgery] offense covered in [S]ection 212(a)(2).\u201d IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4)(G). We may, however, consider whether Ibrahim\u2019s conviction for \u201cpossession of stolen mail\u201d is a theft offense as defined by 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">Ibrahim is a native and citizen of Nigeria. He came to the United States in 1981. On September 20, 1984, Ibrahim became a lawful permanent resident of the United States. On May 5, 1987, he was convicted in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, of the offense of \u201cpossession of stolen mail,\u201d in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1708, committed on or about March 1986. He was sentenced to a two-year term of imprisonment for this offense. On August 10, 1990, he was convicted in the 230th District Court of Harris County, Texas, for the offense of \u201cforgery,\u201d committed on or about March 28, 1990. He was sentenced to a three-year term of imprisonment for this offense. On January 31, 1997, he was convicted in the Superior Court of Washington for King County, Washington, for the offense of \u201ctheft in the second degree,\u201d in violation of RCW 9A 56 040 1A, committed on or about July 30,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>On August 4, 1997, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) served an amended Order to Show Cause on Ibrahim, charging him with being subject to deportation pursuant to INA \u00a7 241(a)(2)(A)(ii), 8 U.S.C. 1251(a)(2)(A)(ii) (1996), as an alien who, at any time after entry, has been convicted of two or more crimes involving moral turpitude, not arising out of a single scheme of criminal misconduct. On March 19, 1998, an immigration judge found Ibrahim deportable as charged, denied his applications for INA \u00a7 212(c) relief, asylum and withholding of deportation, and ordered him deported to Germany. On August 8, 1999, the BIA issued a decision finding Ibrahim statutorily ineligible for INA \u00a7 212(c) relief and asylum, but finding that the immigration judge erred in pretermitting Ibrahim\u2019s application for withholding of deportation. Thus, the Board ordered Ibrahim\u2019s case remanded to the immigration judge for a full hearing on his application for that relief, and noting that the immigration judge was to first determine whether Ibrahim had been convicted of a particularly serious crime prior to ruling on the application for withholding. On January 21, 2000, the immigration judge issued an oral decision in which he found Ibrahim ineligible for withholding of deportation because his conviction constituted particularly serious crimes. The immigration judge also found that Ibrahim failed to show that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if he returned to Nigeria, and, consequently, denied deferral of removal under Article III of the Convention Against Torture. Thereafter, the immigration judge ordered Ibrahim deported to Nigeria.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">On April 14, 2003, the Board dismissed Ibrahim\u2019s appeal. In its decision, the Board found Ibrahim ineligible for a waiver under INA \u00a7 212(c) based on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001). Additionally, the Board affirmed the immigration judge\u2019s finding that Ibrahim\u2019s conviction for possession of stolen mail in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1708 is a \u201ctheft offense (including receipt of stolen property)\u201d so as to constitute an aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43)(G) of the Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The Board rejected Ibrahim\u2019s contention that \u201creceipt of stolen property\u201d was not akin to \u201cpossession of stolen property\" based on its precedent in <em>Matter of Bahta, </em>22 I. &amp; N Dec. 1381, 2000 WL 1470462 (BIA 2000). The Board found that Ibrahim\u2019s convictions constituted aggravated felonies for which he received an aggregate term of imprisonment of at least five years. As such, the Board affirmed the immigration judge\u2019s finding that Ibrahim could not apply for withholding of deportation. This petition for review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">II. Standard of Review and Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">The issue to be decided is whether this court has jurisdiction to consider the claims presented in Ibrahim\u2019s petition for direct review of the BIA\u2019s final order of removal. The IIRIRA deprives us of jurisdiction to hear petitions for review filed by aliens who are deportable for having been convicted of an aggravated felony. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1) and (b) (\u201cnotwithstanding any other provision of law, no court shall have jurisdiction to review any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed a criminal offense\u201d including those covered by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (aggravated felony)); <em>Flores-Garza v. Ashcroft, </em>328 F.3d 797, 801 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Jobson v. Ashcroft, </em>326 F.3d 367, 371 (2d Cir.2003); <em>Randhawa v. Ashcroft, </em>298 F.3d 1148, 1151 (9th Cir.2002). We retain jurisdiction, however, to determine wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>er IIRIRA\u2019s jurisdictional bar applies. <em>Florez-Garza, </em>328 F.3d 797 at 801-02; <em>Gousse v. Ashcroft, </em>339 F.3d 91, 95, 2003 U.S.App. LEXIS 16056 at *8 (2d Cir.2003); <em>Ming Lam Sui v. INS, </em>250 F.3d 105, 110 (2d Cir.2001). We have jurisdiction to review jurisdictional facts and to determine the proper scope of our own jurisdiction. <em>Flores-Garza, </em>328 F.3d at 802; <em>Gousse, </em>339 F.3d 91 at 95, 2003 U.S.App. at *8; <em>Ming Lam Sui, </em>250 F.3d at 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Specifically, to determine whether we are precluded from reviewing this petition, we must inquire, first whether Ibrahim is an alien and then, if he is, whether he is removable for having committed a crime covered by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(A)(iii).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because we must review whether Ibrahim\u2019s offense qualifies as an aggravated felony, the jurisdictional inquiry and the analysis on the merits merge. The BIA\u2019s interpretation of the INA is, however, subject to established principles of deference. <em>United States v. Aguirre-Aguirre, </em>526 U.S. 415, 424-25 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">In this appeal, Ibrahim seeks review regarding whether or not Petitioner\u2019s convictions are of a nature that would ultimately preclude jurisdiction in this court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While Ibrahim fails to advance any specific argument as to why his theft and forgery offenses are not aggravated felonies under INA \u00a7 241(a)(2)(A)(iii) as defined at INA \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G) and (R),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> we will address the argument he made before the BIA\u2014 that Ibrahim\u2019s conviction for \u201cpossession of stolen goods\u201d is not akin to \u201creceipt of stolen goods\u201d as defined by INA \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-13\">Ibrahim was convicted of possession of stolen mail in violation of Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1708. We hold that a conviction obtained under \u00a7 1708 is categorically a \u201ctheft offense\u201d \u2014 and therefore an aggravated felony \u2014 within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-14\">The BIA found Ibrahim deportable because his conviction for possession of stolen mail was a \u201ctheft offense\u201d as defined by 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43)(G). In determining whether an offense qualifies as an aggravated felony, we look to the statute under which the person was convicted and compare its elements to the definition of an aggravated felony in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). <em>See Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990); <em>Randhawa, </em>298 F.3d at 1152; <em>United States v. Corona-Sanchez, </em>291 F.3d 1201, 1205 (9th Cir. 2002). We must therefore determine whether \u201cpossession of stolen mail\u201d is a \u201ctheft offense\u201d and thus an aggravated felony under the 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-15\">In our determination, we apply the categorical approach. <em>Gousse, </em>339 F.3d at 95-96, 2003 U.S.App. at *9-10; <em>Randhawa </em>298 F.3d at 1152. The categorical approach analysis asks whether the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>definition of the offense of conviction is any broader than an offense defined as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under federal law. <em>Gousse, </em>339 F.3d at 96, 2003 U.S.App. LEXIS 16056 at *10. <em>See Jobson, </em>326 F.3d at 371-72 (applying categorical approach to determining whether offense is removable \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 16); <em>Dalton v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 200, 204 (2d Cir.2001) (same); <em>Ming Lam Sui, </em>250 F.3d at 109, 116-18 (applying categorical approach to whether offense is a removable offense that \u201cinvolves fraud or deceit in which the loss to ... victims exceeds $ 10,000\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i)); <em>Michel v. INS, </em>206 F.3d 253, 263 (2d Cir.2000) (applying categorical approach to whether offense is crime involving \u201cmoral turpitude\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii)). Unless the offense of conviction is broader, the petitioner has committed an \u201caggravated felony\u201d irrespective of the particular circumstances of his crime. <em>Gousse, </em>339 F.3d at 96, 2003 U.S.App. at *10. <em>See, also, Sui, </em>250 F.3d at 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Congress did not define the term \u201ctheft offense\u201d in 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43)(G). Thus, under <em>Taylor, </em>we must construe and define the meaning of the phrase. <em>Corona-Sanchez, </em>291 F.3d at 1204. Other circuits have considered this issue and this Court finds their conclusions persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">The Seventh, Ninth and Tenth Circuits have adopted a generic definition of \u201ctheft offense\u201d in the context of 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(43)(G). That definition reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-6\">[A theft offense] is a taking of property or an exercise of control over property without consent with the criminal intent to deprive the owner of rights and benefits of ownership, even if such deprivation is less than total or permanent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWty\"><em>Corona-Sanchez, </em>291 F.3d at 1205 (quoting He<em>rnandez-Mancilla v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1002, 1009 (7th Cir.2001)), <em>see also United States v. Vasquez-Flores, </em>265 F.3d 1122, 1125 (10th Cir.2001). Relying on the Seventh Circuit\u2019s determination that this \u201cdefinition is closer to the \u2018the generic sense in which the term is now used in the criminal codes of most states\u2019 and as \u2018envisioned by the Supreme Court,\u2019 \u201d the Ninth and Tenth Circuits adopted this definition.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Corona-Sanchez, </em>291 F.3d at 1205. This Court recognizes the desirability <em>of </em>a uniform national definition as suggested by the Supreme Court in <em>Taylor. Id. </em>As such, we also adopt the Seventh Circuit\u2019s construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">Having adopted a definition of \u201ctheft offense,\u201d we continue our categorical inquiry by looking to the statute under which Ibrahim was convicted. <em>Randhawa, </em>298 F.3d at 1153. The Ninth Circuit considered this very issue and we agree with their determination that a conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1708 facially qualifies as a conviction for a theft offense (and thus an aggravated felony) because that statute criminalizes only that conduct that fits within <em>Corona-Sanchez\u2019s </em>[our] definition of a theft offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Title 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1708 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-10\">Whoever steals, takes, or abstracts, or by fraud or deception obtains, or attempts so to obtain, from or out of any mail, post office, or station thereof, letter box, mail receptacle, or any mail route or other authorized depository for mail matter, or from a letter or mail carrier, any letter, postal card, package,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>bag, or mail, or abstracts or removes from any such letter, package, bag, or mail, any article or thing contained therein, or secretes, embezzles, or destroys any such letter, postal card, package, bag, or mail, or any article or thing contained therein; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALx\">Whoever steals, takes, or abstracts, or by fraud or deception obtains any letter, postal card, package, bag, or mail, or any article or thing contained therein which has been left for collection upon or adjacent to a collection box or other authorized depository of mail matter; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aqc\">Whoever buys, receives, or conceals, or unlawfully has in his possession, any letter, postal card, package, bag, or mail, or any article or thing contained therein, which has been so stolen, taken, embezzled, or abstracted, as herein described, knowing the same to have been stolen, taken, embezzled, or abstracted\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\">Shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Both 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1708 and our definition require a showing that a defendant knowingly possess stolen mail. <em>Randhawa, </em>298 F.3d at 1153-54. As such, we agree with the Ninth Circuit that \u00a7 1708 is no more broad on its face than our settled definition of a \u201ctheft offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1154.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">Accordingly, because we are without jurisdiction to consider Ibrahim\u2019s petition, respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss petition for lack of jurisdiction is GRANTED and the petition is DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Further, respondent\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of sixty (60) days after disposition of motion to dismiss petition in which to file the administrative record is DENIED as MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b453-7\">. Title III-A of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Sections 301-09, Pub. L. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 revises the procedure for removal of aliens, including the provisions relating to judicial review. IIRIRA, Section 306(b). Title III-A provisions\u2019 effective date is April 1, 1997. Section 309(a) provides that Title III\u2014 A, and the amendments therein, generally \"shall take effect on the first day of the first month beginning more than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act....\u201d As IIRIRA was enacted on September 30, 1996, the Title III-A provisions, except where otherwise indicated in IIRIRA, became effective on April 1, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-14\">The IIRIRA, section 309(c) provides for transitional rules for aliens who are in exclusion or deportation proceedings before April 1, 1997. These rules apply to aliens whose final administrative orders of exclusion or deportation are entered on or after October 31, 1996. IIRIRA, section 309(c)(4). These transitional rules apply to Ibrahim\u2019s case because his Issuance to Show Cause was issued on February 11, 1997 and the Board\u2019s Final Deportation Order was issued on April 14, 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b455-8\">.
