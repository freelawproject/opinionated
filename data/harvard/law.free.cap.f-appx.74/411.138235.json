His detention is now governed by INA \u00a7 241, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231. Therefore, the only issue raised by Byfield in this appeal, the constitutionality of his treatment under INA \u00a7 236(c), is no longer one on which this court can grant him meaningful relief. <em>See De La Teja v. United States, </em>321 F.3d 1357 (11th Cir.2003). Because there is no longer a ease or controversy, we DISMISS the appeal for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b437-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
