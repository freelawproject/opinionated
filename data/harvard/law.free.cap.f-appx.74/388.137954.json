In his complaint, Teixeira alleged that, while he was confined as pre-trial detainee at the Gregg County Jail (\u201cJail\u201d), the defendants violated his constitutional rights. The district court determined that Teixeira failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-22\">In his appellate brief, Teixeira does not challenge the district court\u2019s conclusion that his claims under the Equal Protection Clause and First Amendment were frivolous, nor does he challenge the court\u2019s dismissal of those claims with prejudice. These issues have effectively been abandoned. <em>See Walker v. Thompson, </em>214 F.3d 615, 625 (5th Cir.2000); Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>On appeal, Teixeira does contend that the district court erred in granting summary judgment for the defendants on his Eighth Amendment and due process claims. The district court found that Teixeira failed to exhaust the administrative remedies which were established and available at the Jail, as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). <em>See Wright v. Hollingsworth, </em>260 F.3d 357, 358 (5th Cir.2001). This Court reviews the district court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment de novo. <em>Whittaker v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., </em>206 F.3d 532, 534 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Teixeira asserts that he exhausted the grievance processes offered by the Jail. He attested in an affidavit that he had filed an initial grievance regarding the matters alleged in his complaint. As determined by the district court, however, Teixeira failed to offer competent summary judgment evidence to counter the defendants\u2019 evidentiary materials showing that Teixeira had failed to exhaust the remaining steps of the Jail\u2019s administrative remedial procedures -i.e., appealing to the Jail\u2019s Grievance Review Board and appealing to the county sheriff. His unsubstantiated assertion that he filed such an administrative appeal -which was set forth for the first time in his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report is not sufficient to sustain his evidentiary burden under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e). <em>See Little v. Liquid Air Corp., </em>37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir.l994)(en banc). Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b414-11\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
