The district court granted the United States\u2019 motion for summary judgment, entering judgment in the amount of $466,204.44 and ordering that Northern Trust thereafter pay Stout\u2019s monthly pension benefit of $711.88 directly to the United States. On appeal, Stout generally contests the validity and constitutionality of the judgment underlying the lien. But the Tax Court issued its judgment against Stout in 1986, and Stout did not file a notice of appeal within 90 days of the Tax Court\u2019s final decision as required under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7483. Judicial review of the tax assessment is no longer available, and the issue before the district court was the propriety of foreclosure, not the validity of the hen. In order to foreclose on the hen, the government had to show only that pension benefits were actually payable to Stout and that the hen remained unsatisfied, <em>see </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6331(j), and Stout disputes neither of these points.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">Stout\u2019s only other argument is that the district court lacked jurisdiction because the caption of the complaint in this case named as plaintiff the \u201cUnited States of America,\u201d rather than the \u201cUnited States.\u201d But the terms \u201cUnited States of America\u201d and \u201cUnited States\u201d are used interchangeably, <em>see generally, e.g., </em>U.S. Const. pmbl, and Stout\u2019s argument is a nonsensical exercise in semantics, <em>cf. United States v. Crum, </em>288 F.3d 332, 334 (7th Cir.2002) (argument that the Department of the Treasury and the Treasury Department are separate entities \u201cstrains credulity\u201d). In short, Stout\u2019s appeal is frivolous, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
