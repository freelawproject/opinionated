We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-17\">The decision of the Department of the Interior rejecting Roberts\u2019s amended allotment application is final and not subject to further review. The district court properly dismissed Roberts\u2019s claim against the United States as barred by the <em>Fanny Barr </em>settlement. <em>See Fanny Barr v. United States, </em>No. A 76-160 (D.Alaska Aug. 2, 1982). Alternatively, the application was untimely and thus barred. Further, the district court lacked jurisdiction under the Quiet Title Act with respect to Roberts\u2019s request that he be granted Parcel D, because the United States does not claim an interest in the land. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2409a(a). Finally, because Roberts has failed to establish a legal claim to the parcel, we need not reach his due process claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b788-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
