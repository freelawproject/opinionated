R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-23\">Mr. Robert Lee Winfield, Jr., a federal inmate appearing pro se<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his habeas corpus petition brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-24\">In 1996, Mr. Winfield<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was convicted in the United States District Court for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>Eastern District of Virginia of several offenses, including engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848. His convictions were affirmed. <em>United States v. Winfield, </em>139 F.3d 896 (4th Cir. March 5, 1998) (per curiam) (unpublished table decision). He then applied to the district court for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The request was denied and the denial was affirmed by the Fourth Circuit. Some time later, the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Richardson v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 813, 119 S.Ct. 1707, 143 L.Ed.2d 985 (1999), in which it held \u201ca jury in a federal criminal case brought under \u00a7 848 must unanimously agree not only that the defendant committed some \u2018continuing series of violations\u2019 but also that the defendant committed each of the individual \u2018violations\u2019 necessary to make up that \u2018continuing series.\u2019 \u201d 526 U.S. at 815, 119 S.Ct. 1707.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">In support of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition Mr. Winfield claims he is actually innocent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That claim derives from retroactive application of <em>Richardson </em>which announced a new rule of substantive law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> His jury was not instructed as <em>Richardson </em>later required.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The district court concluded he failed to show an inadequate or ineffective \u00a7 2255 remedy and that he did not make the requisite showing of actual innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-13\">A \u00a7 2241 petition for a writ of habeas corpus and a motion for sentencing relief under \u00a7 2255 have distinct purposes and are not interchangeable. The \u00a7 2241 petition \u201cattacks the execution of a sentence rather than its validity and must be filed in the district where the prisoner is confined.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Whereas \u201c[a] 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 petition attacks the legality of detention and must be filed in the district that imposed the sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations omitted). Unless \u00a7 2255 remedy is inadequate or ineffective, it is the exclusive remedy for testing the legality of the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>tention. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See also Williams v. United States, </em>328 F.2d 672, 673 (10th Cir.1963) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>377 U.S. 980, 84 S.Ct. 1887, 12 L.Ed.2d 749 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">Although nominally brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, Mr. Winfield presents a quintessential \u00a7 2255 claim; he is challenging the validity, rather than the execution, of his conviction and sentence. We have previously held that the restrictions on filing successive \u00a7 2255 motions do not render the \u00a7 2255 remedy inadequate or ineffective. <em>See Caravalho v. Pugh, </em>177 F.3d 1177, 1179 (10th Cir.1999). Nor do the denials of relief in previous \u00a7 2255 proceedings indicate the inadequacy or ineffectiveness of this remedy. <em>See Williams, </em>323 F.2d at 673. Because he has an adequate and effective remedy under \u00a7 2255 in the district where he was sentenced, \u00a7 2241 is inappropriate for this case. The district court\u2019s denial of the petition was therefore correct.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b876-15\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b876-25\">. We construe pro se pleadings liberally. <em>Ledbetter v. City of Topeka, </em>318 F.3d 1183, 1187 (10th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b876-26\">. Although Mr. Winfield\u2019s sentence was imposed in the Eastern District of Virginia, at the time he filed this \u00a7 2241 petition, he was an inmate at the United States Penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas. He has since been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>transferred to United States Penitentiary in Pollock, Louisiana.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b877-7\">. Some circuits interpret \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause to allow a federal prisoner, in limited circumstances, to seek relief under \u00a7 2241 if he can establish he is actually innocent of the crime for which he was convicted. <em>See Triestman v. United States, </em>124 F.3d 361 (2d Cir.1997); <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893 (5th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Peterman, </em>249 F.3d 458 (6th Cir.2001); <em>In re Davenport, </em>147 F.3d 605 (7th Cir.1998); <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236 (11th Cir.1999). <em>But see </em>cases that recognized the actual innocence argument without accepting or rejecting it: <em>Pryor v. United States, </em>278 F.3d 612, 616 n. 3 (6th Cir.2002); <em>In re Smith, </em>285 F.3d 6, 8-9 (D.C.Cir.2002); <em>Lorentsen v. Hood, </em>223 F.3d 950, 954 (9th Cir.2000). We have not resolved that issue and decline to do so here because the exceptional circumstances would necessarily include the unavailability of a \u00a7 2255 remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-11\">We express no opinion as to the merits of Mr. Winfield\u2019s arguments. But he can request the appropriate court of appeals (in this case the Fourth Circuit) to certify his case in accordance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 if, as he claims, it involves the existence of \"a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Although he has made no request, Mr. Winfield fears the Fourth Circuit will not certify. That fear prompts his argument that he has no effective or adequate \u00a7 2255 remedy. But the availability of a remedy is not determined by his subjective assessment of probable success and a \u00a7 2241 petition \"is not an additional, alternative, or supplemental remedy to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Bradshaw v. Story, </em>86 F.3d 164, 166 (10th Cir.1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b877-14\">. <em>See United States v. Barajas-Diaz, </em>313 F.3d 1242, 1245 (10th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b877-15\">. Trial error does not necessarily equate to actual innocence. He may be confusing actual innocence with legal innocence. <em>See Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 831 (5th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893 (5th Cir.2001)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
