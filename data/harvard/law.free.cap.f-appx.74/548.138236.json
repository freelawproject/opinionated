Smith (\u201cSmith\u201d), appeals the final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security (\u201cCommissioner\u201d) that she is not \u201cdisabled\u201d for purposes of Disability Insurance Benefits (\u201cDIB\u201d) under Title II of the Social Security Act, or Supplemental Security Income (\u201cSSI\u201d) under Title XVI of the Social Security Act (\u201cAct\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 416(i), 423, 1381(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-14\">For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that this decision is supported by substantial evidence and decided under the proper legal standards, and AFFIRM the denial of Smith\u2019s DIB and SSI benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-15\">I. BACKGROUND AND FACTUAL SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b575-16\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b575-17\">In this appeal, Smith seeks judicial review of the final decision of the Commissioner that she is not \u201cdisabled\u201d for purposes of DIB under Title II of the Social Security Act, and SSI under Title XVI of the Social Security Act (\u201cAct\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 416(i), 423, 1381(a). Smith filed applications for a period of disability, DIB, and SSI on April 15, 1997, alleging disability beginning on January 1, 1993, due to pain in her back, leg, and ankle. On March 31, 1998, Smith\u2019s eligibility for SSI and DIB ended. At that time, Smith was forty-one years of age, which is defined by Social Security Regulations as a \u201cyounger individual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-18\">The Commissioner denied her claims initially and on reconsideration. On January 12, 1999, Administrative Law Judge Robert D. Stalker (\u201cALJ\u201d) held a hearing at which Smith and a vocational expert testified. On June 21, 1999, the ALJ issued a hearing decision, denying Smith\u2019s claim. The Appeals Council denied Smith\u2019s request for review, making the ALJ\u2019s deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>sion the Commissioner\u2019s final disposition regarding her status. Smith subsequently appealed to the United States District Court, whereupon United States District Judge Julian Abele Cook, Jr. declined to accept the Report and Recommendation of Magistrate Judge Wallace Capel, Jr. (who recommended remanding the case to the Commissioner for further proceedings), and granted summary judgment in favor of the Commissioner. Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 405(g) and 1383(c)(3), Smith initiated this action for judicial review of the denial of her disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">\n<em>Factual Summary</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Smith was admitted to the emergency department at St. Joseph Mercy Hospital on February 19,1997. At that time, Smith complained of atypical chest pain. An EKG was performed, the results of which were normal. Soon after, Smith was diagnosed with trochanteric bursitis, but it was noted by the attending physician that psychiatric indicators had suggested that Smith suffered from a pain disorder associated with a medical condition, plus negative psychological factors. From March to May of 1997, Smith received physical therapy for treatment of her pain on the advice of her treating physician, Dr. Edward Washabaugh, of the Michigan Pain Institute. In June of 1997, Smith was examined by Dr. Pieter Vreede, a rheumatologist, who concluded that the cause of her left leg and hip pain was unclear. Dr. Vreede then referred Smith to a neurologistr-Dr. Anastasios Alexiou. Dr. Alexiou concluded from his examination of Smith that her complaints of pain were subjective, and \u201cimpossible to document.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">In October of 1997, Dr. John Trotter performed a consultative medical examination of Smith for the purpose of her application for disability benefits. He noted in his remarks that his examination of Smith was limited due to her complaints of pain, and he diagnosed her with arthritis. Also in October of 1997, an MRI was performed on Smith\u2019s lumbar spine which revealed that she had mild disc bulges and moderate facet degenerative changes. On October 29, 1997, Dr. Washabaugh studied Smith\u2019s MRI results, and diagnosed her with chronic pain syndrome, facet arthropathy, and degenerative disc disease. On December 2,1997, Dr. Donald Ross, another neurologist, examined Smith and concluded that she had no clinically significant disc bulge or neural compression. Dr. Ross could diagnose no source of her complained weakness, and was \u201cnot sure what to make of [her complaints].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">In May of 1998, after participating in several months of physical therapy, Smith was prescribed an antidepressant by Dr. Washabaugh in order to assist her with her \u201cchronic pain.\u201d At this time, Dr. Washabaugh suggested that Smith increase the level of her physical activity. In his May 15, 1998 letter to Dr. Vreede, Dr. Washabaugh wrote that \u201c[t]he best thing [for Smith] would be work or even volunteer work ... we discussed many opportunities for that today.\u201d In August of 1998, a psychologist, Dr. Ross Halpern, evaluated Smith at the request of Dr. Washabaugh. Dr. Halpern did not diagnose Smith with any psychological impairment, but he suggested that she should develop a skill or hobby in order to remain productive, rather than \u201csitting around the house constantly focusing on her pain.\u201d In October of 1998, Dr. Alexiou again examined Smith, and described her examination as \u201chysterical.\u201d He also noted the lack of effort by Smith upon muscular testing. In November of 1998, Smith reported to the emergency room complaining of back and groin pain. She was given pain medication, and released.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">On January 8, 1999, Smith was examined by Dr. Steven Harwood, a specialist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>in physical medicine and rehabilitation, at the request of Dr. Washabaugh. Dr. Harwood noted that Smith had several inconsistencies in her physical exam. He diagnosed chronic pain syndrome and stated that \u201cthere was a functional component to her pain.\u201d That same month, Dr. Harwood proceeded to fill out several forms on behalf of Smith, on which he suggested that she would be unable to work an eight-hour work day and that she would need to rest during the day for up to four hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">On March 8,1999, Dr. Elizabeth Bishop, a psychologist with the Michigan Disability Determination Service, performed a psychological evaluation of Smith. Dr. Bishop diagnosed Smith with \u201c[plain disorder associated with both psychological factors, arthritis, and back pain.\u201d While noting that Smith might benefit from mental health treatment and follow-up with a pain clinic, Dr. Bishop concluded that Smith suffered from no significant limitation in her ability to do work-related activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">On March 15, 1999, Dr. April Campbell performed a consultative medical examination on Smith. Dr. Campbell found that Smith\u2019s complaints of weakness were not consistent with any physiological state, and emphasized that she did not provide any effort with regard to lower extremity muscle testing. Dr. Campbell concluded that no objective evidence existed of any ongoing neurological, muscular, or osteo pathology; and that Smith had no limitations in lifting, standing, walking or sitting.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">On January 12, 1999, during a hearing before the ALJ, Ms. Nancy Jo Quinlan, a qualified vocational expert, testified as to the nature of Smith\u2019s prior employment, and her ability to secure appropriate work given her current physical and mental condition. Ms. Quinlan concluded that a \u201chypothetical worker\u201d of Smith\u2019s age, education, prior work experience (along with the residual functional capacity to perform a restricted range of sedentary and unskilled work), could perform any of a number of jobs which exist in the national and regional economy. These jobs included: inspector (1,700), assembler (12,000), information clerk (1,700), cashier (16,000), and reception clerk (6,200). The figures in parentheses represent the number of positions that exist in the regional economy and reflects four percent of the national average.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in a case involving denial of social security disability benefits <em>de novo. Walker v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>980 F.2d 1066, 1069 (6th Cir.1992). Further, judicial review of the Commissioner\u2019s decision to deny benefits revolves around whether the findings, and ultimate decision of the Commissioner, are supported by substantial evidence. \u201c \u2018Substantial evidence means \u2018more than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019\u201d <em>Kirk v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>667 F.2d 524, 535 (6th Cir.1981) (citations omitted). Under <em>Kirk, </em>the ALJ\u2019s findings should be affirmed by our Court if supported by substantial evidence. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b577-12\">To establish disability under the Social Security Act, Smith must prove the \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of a medically determinable physical condition or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or [last] for a continuous period of not less than twelve months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A); <em>see Walker, </em>980 F.2d at 1070.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-13\">A five-step evaluation format has been promulgated by the Commissioner for use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>in determining whether disability benefits should be allowed to a claimant. The step-by-step, sequential formula which the Commissioner is required to utilize in evaluating an individual\u2019s eligibility for disability benefits proceeds as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-4\">(1) Is the claimant working? If not,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-5\">(2) Does the claimant have a severe impairment? If so,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-6\">(3) Is/are the claimant\u2019s impairment(s) listed in, or equivalent to, an impairment listed in appendix one to 20 C.F.R. part 404, subpart P? If not,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-7\">(4) Does the impairment prevent the claimant from doing past relevant work? If so,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-8\">(5) Does the claimant\u2019s impairment prevent him from doing any other work?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-9\"><em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520, 416.920; <em>see also Wyatt v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>974 F.2d 680 (6th Cir.1992). Accordingly, the ALJ in this case found that Smith: (1) had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since January 1, 1993, (2) that the degenerative changes and bulging discs in Smith\u2019s back and her chronic pain syndrome were \u201csevere\u201d impairments within the meaning of the regulations, (3) but that these were not of sufficient severity to meet or equal the criteria of any listed impairment, (4) she could not perform her past relevant work, but however (5) she was capable of performing other work that exists in significant numbers in the national economy, and was, therefore, not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">We review a decision to deny disability benefits in order to determine if it was supported by substantial evidence; if indeed it was, the Commissioner\u2019s findings should be affirmed. We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Smith could perform the limited demands of a restricted range of sedentary work. The ALJ considered both the objective medical evidence contained in the record, as well as Smith\u2019s subjective complaints of pain in assessing her physical limitations. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1512(b)(1), 416.912(b)(1) (describing objective evidence as medical signs and laboratory findings); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1529, 416.929 (\u201cSince symptoms sometimes suggest a greater severity of impairment than can be shown by the objective medical evidence alone, the Social Security Administration will carefully consider any other information [provided] about [subjective] symptoms.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-12\">In making the determination that Smith could perform a limited range of sedentary work, the ALJ reasonably relied upon the opinions of Smith\u2019s treating physician, two examining psychologists, and a state agency psychologist. As of 1997, more than four years after Smith\u2019s alleged onset of disability, no medical evidence existed which documented any discernable mental or physical impairment. Smith has submitted no evidence suggesting that she had a severe mental impairment prior to 1997, and based on the medical evidence available as of December 24, 1997, Dr. Armand Kapik, a psychiatrist who examined Smith, concluded that she did not have a medically determinable mental impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-13\">Additionally, the ALJ reasonably relied on opinions of two examining psychologists in determining that Smith could perform a limited range of sedentary work. In 1998, Dr. Halpern conducted a psychological examination of Smith, and did not diagnose her with any psychological impairment. Rather, Dr. Halpern recommended that Smith be referred for vocational rehabilitation and that she should develop a skill or hobby to remain productive, rather than \u201csitting around the house constantly focusing on her pain.\u201d A second examining psychologist, Dr. Bishop, of the Michigan Disability Determination Service, found that Smith had no evidence of any signifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>cant limitation in her ability to do work-related activities despite her diagnosis of chronic pain disorder. Smith asserts that the ALJ should have given greater weight to her one-time assigned Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) score of forty-eight as evidence of her inability to perform even limited work. However, the ALJ noted that Dr. Bishop, the very psychologist who assigned this score, indicated that Smith \u201cwas not markedly limited in any area of functioning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Accordingly, we agree with both the district court and the Commissioner, and conclude that there is substantial evidence in the administrative record to support the finding that Smith was not disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the denial of Smith\u2019s disability benefits is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
