The order affirmed the decision of the Commissioner of Social Security to deny Matos\u2019s application for supplemental security income (SSI). Matos originally applied for SSI benefits on May 3, 1995, through her mother and legal custodian Alicia Colon.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-24\">Matos suffers from neurological impairment. She received a total score of 77 on an Intelligence Quotient (IQ) test, indicating that she is within the borderline range of intellectual functioning. She was placed in an individualized education plan (IEP) in 1995. According to an IEP report, Matos\u2019s intellectual achievement was at one time more than one year behind her intel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>lectual potential. However, she had made progress towards achieving the goals of her IEP and she was eventually mainstreamed into regular classes in math, art, music, and physical education, while remaining in special classes for her other subjects. Between the 1990-91 and 1994-95 school years, Matos\u2019s report card improved greatly, moving from a \u201cC\u201d in behavior and a \u201cF\u201d in work habits to \u201cB\u2019s\u201d in both areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Matos has other relevant physical and mental conditions. In 1993 Matos was hospitalized and diagnosed with symptoms of asthma. In May 1995 Doctor Chang diagnosed Matos with Moderate Opposition Deficit Disorder. In August 1995, Dr. G. Victor, a state agency psychological consultant, reviewed Matos\u2019s records and opined that Matos was improving in her physical and behavioral abilities but that she suffered from oppositional disorder and had a history of asthma. Most importantly, he stated that Matos had moderate limitations in her cognitive, personal, and behavioral development and functions; less than moderate limitations in communicative functions and in maintaining concentration, persistence and pace; and no limitations in motor or social development and function.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">We have jurisdiction of this appeal under 28 U.S.C. Section 1291. Our standard of review is whether the District Court correctly found the Commissioner\u2019s decision to be supported by substantial evidence. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), 1383(\u00a9)(3); <em>Plummer v. Apfel, </em>186 F.3d 422, 427 (3d Cir.1999). Substantial evidence is evidence adequate enough for a reasonable mind to support the conclusion. <em>Plummer, </em>186 F.3d at 427. Contradictory evidence may be found in the record, but is not cause for reversing the Commissioner\u2019s decision if substantial support exists for the decision within the record. <em>Sykes v. Apfel, </em>228 F.3d 259, 262 (3d Cir.2000). The fact that a reviewing court may have made a different decision is not important as long as the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (ALJ) decision is based on a reasonable interpretation of substantial evidence. <em>Schonewolf v. Callahan, </em>972 F.Supp. 277, 284 (D.N.J.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">In order for the reviewing court to perform its duty and to \u201cavoid judicial usurpation of administrative functions\u201d, we have required ALJ\u2019s to provide a statement of reasons or findings. <em>Cotter v. Harris, </em>642 F.2d 700, 705 (1981). This statement should include any important findings subordinate to final findings and an explanation of what evidence was accepted and rejected in reaching the final decision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">Turning to the merits of this appeal, a minor is disabled if she has \u201ca medically determinable ... impairment which results in marked and severe functional limitations ... which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not more than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(3)(C)(i) (2000). Determining whether a child is disabled is a three step process. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.924 (2003). ALJ must find that (1) the claimant is not engaged in substantial gainful activity; (2) the claimant suffers from one or more severe impairments; and (3) the impairment meets, medically equals, or is functionally equivalent in severity to an impairment listed in 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P. App. 1 (Listing of Impairments). If the claimant\u2019s impairments do not meet or equal any impairment specified in the Listings, the Commissioner evaluates all of the child\u2019s functional limitations caused by a disability. For a disability to be functionally equivalent, the limitations caused by the disability must be the same as the limitations caused by a listed impairment. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.924 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Following the required process, the ALJ found that Matos was not disabled. He determined that Matos\u2019s asthma did not create symptoms serious enough to qualify as impaired under the listing and that her mood disorder did not approach what is necessary to be considered an affective mood disorder. Moreover, he concluded that her borderline intelligence was not low enough to satisfy any of the 4 possible requirements for mental retardation. 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P. App. 1 \u00a7 112.00 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">As for her claim of problems with inattention, impulsiveness, and hyperactivity, Dr. Victor specifically concluded that Matos had less than moderate limitations in maintaining concentration, persistence, and pace and no limitations in motor or social development and function. Additionally, she had a consistently improving school and behavioral record. The ALJ concluded that, taking her mental condition as a whole, Matos had no limitation severe enough to satisfy any listing. Moreover, after careful review, the ALJ concluded that none of her impairments were the functional equivalent of a listed impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">We agree with the Commissioner and the District Court that the evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s decision is substantial and more importantly that there is little evidence that contradicts that decision. For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
