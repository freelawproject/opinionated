In that order, the NLRB determined OFC and OIC violated Sections 8(a)(5) and (1) of the Unfair Labor Act (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(5) and (1)) by failing to abide by a collective bargaining agreement and refusing to provide the Carpenters District Council of North Central Texas, affiliated with United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, AFL-CIO (\u201cthe Union\u201d) with information relating to company labor practices in the Union\u2019s jurisdiction. We exercise jurisdiction under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e) and deny enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">OFC contends the NLRB erred in concluding it was bound by a terminated master collective bargaining agreement it never signed, simply because it had signed a separate \u201cme too\u201d agreement<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> twenty years prior. It also maintains NLRB violated its due process rights by deciding the case on a theory not alleged in the complaint. If OFC was not contractually bound by a collective bargaining agreement with the Union, NLRB\u2019s finding of unfair labor practices cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">The facts are undisputed. OFC is an Oklahoma corporation that manufactures and installs fixtures and custom woodwork in retail stores throughout the United States. OIC, formed in May 1987, installs most of the fixtures manufactured by OFC. No appeal was taken from NLRB\u2019s finding that OIC was the alter ego of OFC. As OFC\u2019s alter ego, OIC is bound to OFC\u2019s \u201cme-too\u201d agreement to the same extent OFC is bound.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-11\">In July 1975, the North Texas Contractors Association (\u201cNTCA\u201d) and the Union negotiated a collective bargaining agreement, effective July 30, 1975, through April 30,1978 (\u201cMaster Agreement\u201d). The Master Agreement was self-described as a contract between NTCA \u201con behalf of members who have assigned their bargaining rights\u201d and the Union. On July 7, 1975, before the finalization of the Master Agreement, OFC signed a \u201cme-too\u201d agreement<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with the Union, consenting to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>bound by the Master Agreement that would ultimately result from negotiations between the Union and NTCA. The \u201cme-too\u201d agreement specifically acknowledged that OFC did not assign its bargaining rights to NTCA. It focused on wages and benefit contributions but did not discuss duration or termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The Master Agreement contained a duration clause, stipulating that after April 30, 1978, it would become an annual contract that \u201ceither party\u201d could terminate upon proper notice. Starting around April 30, 1978, NTCA and the Union negotiated several successive collective bargaining agreements that replaced the Master Agreement. NTCA terminated the last of these successive agreements on April 30, 1984. It thereafter negotiated an entirely new agreement with the Union, effective August 23, 1984.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A new \u201cme-too\u201d agreement was never obtained from OFC.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">From July 1975 through 1985, OFC employed workers within the Union\u2019s jurisdiction and made payments to the Union\u2019s health and welfare pension programs at the rate provided by the Master Agreement and successor agreements. OFC performed no work in the jurisdiction from 1985 to 1995, and thus had no obligation to make Union payments. After resuming work in the jurisdiction in 1995, OFC, under protest that it was not legally obligated to do so, continued payments to the Union. OIC has performed work in the Union\u2019s jurisdiction since its creation in May 1987, but neither OIC nor OFC informed the Union of OIC\u2019s activities or made payments to the Union on behalf of OIC. In May 1993, the Union requested information from OFC regarding its relationship with OIC. OFC did not provide the requested information. Thereafter, the Union filed a charge with NLRB against OFC alleging violations of the National Labor Relations Act. NLRB\u2019s General Counsel investigated and issued a complaint, specifically asserting that OFC, and OIC as its alter ego, were bound by all successor contracts negotiated between the Union and NTCA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Union similarly asserted in letters and briefs that OFC and OIC were bound by the successor agreements because of the automatic renewal clause in the Master Agreement. OFC responded to this specific allegation contained in the General Counsel\u2019s complaint and in the Union\u2019s briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-12\">Since the facts relating to that allegation (OFC &amp; OIC were bound to successor agreements) were not in dispute, the parties waived a trial before an administrative law judge and submitted the case on stipulated facts directly to the NLRB. A two-to-one majority of the NLRB held the \u201cme-too\u201d agreement did not bind OFC to the successor agreements.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Instead, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>NLRB majority, sua sponte and inexplicably, decided OFC\u2019s obligations continued under the Master Agreement even though it was terminated between NTCA and the Union, at the latest in 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"Agq\">A. Master Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">We generally afford \u201cgreat weight\u201d to NLRB\u2019s legal determinations and uphold those within reasonable bounds. <em>National Labor Relations Bd. v. Oklahoma Fixture Co., </em>295 F.3d 1143, 1145 (10th Cir.2002)(quoting <em>National Labor Relations Bd. v. Greater Kansas City Roofing, </em>2 F.3d 1047, 1051 (10th Cir.1993)). However, we review de novo NLRB\u2019s contract interpretations. <em>See Litton Fin. Printing Div., a Div. of Litton Bus. Sys., Inc. v. NLRB, </em>501 U.S. 190, 203, 111 S.Ct. 2215, 115 L.Ed.2d 177 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">The issue before us \u2014 whether signing a \u201cme-too\u201d agreement perpetually binds an employer to a terminated master agreement, which it did not sign \u2014 is a question of first impression in this Court. At least two other circuits have addressed this issue, and we find their decisions instructive. <em>See Wilson &amp; Sons Heating &amp; Plumbing, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Bd., </em>971 F.2d 758 (D.C.Cir.1992); <em>C.E.K. Indus. Mech. Contractors, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>921 F.2d 350 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\"><em>Wilson </em>is the most compelling because its facts are similar to those before us. There, the company agreed to be bound by current master agreements between a union and a multi-employer association by signing annual letters of assent, similar to a \u201cme-too\u201d agreement, but never assigned its bargaining rights to the association. <em>Wilson, </em>971 F.2d at 759. The master agreement was linguistically ambiguous as to whether it applied only to its signatories or if it also encompassed those signing letters of assent. <em>Id. </em>at 761. The letter of assent further confused the issue because it bound the company not only to the master agreement, but also to any revisions or amendments. <em>Id. </em>at 760. The master agreements stipulated they would automatically renew each year, absent proper notice to terminate. <em>Id. </em>At the end of the term of one of these master agreements, the multi-employer association prevented automatic renewal by giving notice of termination; it then negotiated a new agreement. Because the company that signed the letter of assent did not give notice of intent to terminate the agreement, the NLRB held the company was bound by the master agreement for another year, even though that master agreement was no longer binding on its signatories, i.e., the union and the members of the multi-employer association. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">Reviewing the contract de novo, as instructed by <em>Litton, </em>the court refused to enforce NLRB\u2019s order, holding the master agreement\u2019s automatic renewal clause and notice requirement applied only to the master agreement signatories, not to those who signed letters of assent. <em>Id. </em>Further, the court concluded the automatic renewal clause could not bind the company to another term because the union and multiemployer association had terminated the master agreement and renegotiated a different contract. \u201cIt would surely be anomalous to bind the company to the terms of an agreement that no longer existed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although the court considered \u201cthis structural anomaly may well be enough\u201d to find in favor of the employer, the court also looked at extrinsic evidence of intent due to the master agreement and letter of assent\u2019s \u201clinguistic ambiguity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 761. Of significance to the court was the company\u2019s refusal to sign the new contract, even though it abided by the wage rates and benefit terms contained in it. <em>Id. </em>Additionally, the union originally told the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>pany it was not bound by the new master agreement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Here, similar to <em>Wilson, </em>the Master Agreement had been terminated by its signatories. Like the D.C. Circuit, we conclude the \u201cstructural anomaly\u201d of attempting to bind OFC to a terminated agreement is not justified by contract language in the \u201cme-too\u201d agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">We need not examine extrinsic facts because neither the Master Agreement nor the \u201cme-too\u201d agreement is ambiguous as to duration. Although the Master Agreement\u2019s duration clause did not define the phrase \u201ceither party,\u201d its introduction clearly stated it was an agreement between the Union and NTCA members. OFC was not an NTCA member and it did not assign its bargaining rights to NTCA; thus, it was not a party to the 1975 Master Agreement. The \u201cme too\u201d agreement refers to the Master Agreement and no other. It contains no language even remotely suggesting it has vitality independent of the Master Agreement. Whether it bound OFC to amendments, revisions, or successor agreements seems unlikely, but could possibly be debatable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Neither ambiguous nor debatable is the effect of the 1984 termination. When the Master Agreement was terminated (whether unilaterally by NTCA or by the parties\u2019 mutual agreement), OFC\u2019s \u201cme too\u201d obligations, whatever they were, dissolved. The point of contract interpretation is to give meaning to the parties\u2019 express intention at the inception of their agreement, not to further one of the parties\u2019 unilateral interests, post hoc. We reject as irrelevant the argument that OFC did not expressly terminate its \u201cme too\u201d obligations by giving proper notice as prescribed in the Master Agreement (a point disputed by OFC). It strikes us as patently hollow and singularly unnecessary to give notice that one no longer considers itself bound to a terminated agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"AD\">In determining OFC was bound by the Master Agreement until it formally gave notice to terminate, NLRB relied upon <em>C.E.K. </em>That reliance is untenable. In <em>C.E.K </em>it appears the court did not review the contract de novo as the Supreme Court later required.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Litton, </em>501 U.S. at 202-03. Moreover, the facts are dissimilar. In <em>C.E.K., </em>the employer signed the actual master agreement, not merely a \u201cme-too\u201d agreement. <em>C.E.K., </em>921 F.2d at 352.</p>\n<p id=\"AI\">In other cases where courts found the employer to be bound by automatic renewal clauses or new agreements, the employer signed a collective bargaining agreement consenting to be bound by successor agreements and failed to give the requisite notice of termination,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the employer signed a letter of assent that contained specific termination requirements that the employer did not follow,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the employer assigned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>its bargaining rights to a multi-employer association,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the employer did not follow the requirements of the letter of assent by providing notice of termination of its assigned bargaining rights to the multiemployer association.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">We conclude \u201cthat the master agreement\u2019s renewal clause was not enough to bind [OFC] to another [term] under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>971 F.2d at 759. Because OFC was not bound by the Master Agreement, neither was its alter ego, OIC. Consequently we set aside NLRB\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">B. Due Process Violation</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">OFC maintains NLRB violated its due process rights by deciding the case on a legal theory not presented in the complaint. Because OFC has prevailed on the merits, it is unnecessary to reach that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">Oklahoma Fixture Company is not bound by the terminated 1975 Master Agreement. Accordingly, we DENY enforcement of National Labor Relations Board\u2019s order of April 4, 2001.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b57-16\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>case, <em>res judicata </em>and collateral estoppel.

R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b58-6\">. \u201cMe too\u201d agreements allow smaller employers to obtain the benefits of the master collective bargaining agreement negotiated by the principal employers in the industry without bearing the burden and expense of such negotiations and without assigning their bargaining rights to a collective bargaining representative.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">Thus, the independent employer is assured that (1) it will not be subject to a contract containing more onerous conditions than are applicable to its competitors, (2) it will obtain whatever protections or advantages the industry collective bargaining agreement provides other employers, (3) it will be saved the cost of expensive negotiations, and ...

Then the terms and conditions of that agreement will be in effect. (Wages and benefits are then listed.) (R., tab 7, ex. 11.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b59-8\">. The record is unclear whether the Master Agreement was terminated in 1978, upon the Union and NTCA negotiating and entering into successor agreements, or in 1984 when one of these successor agreements was terminated. Regardless, it appears the Master Agreement was terminated before 1987, when OIC began performing work in the Union\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b59-14\">. The complaint, submitted by NLRB\u2019s general counsel, alleged OFC \"agreed to be bound by a collective bargaining agreement between the Union and [NTCA], effective May 1, 1973, through April 30, 1975, and to be bound by <em>future agreements </em>negotiated between the Union and NTCA.\u201d (Emphasis added). The complaint did not allege OFC was still bound by the Master Agreement that was no longer in effect for its signatories.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b59-15\">.
