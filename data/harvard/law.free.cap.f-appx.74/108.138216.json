We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-15\">At sentencing, Marcano sought a downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5H1.4, which provides that \u201can extraordinary physical impairment may be a reason to impose a sentence below the applicable guideline range.\u201d Marcano alleged that gunshot wounds dating from 1992 and 1996 have caused him to suffer \u201cconstant numbness, extreme shooting pain, muscle loss, and the ability to stand, all in his right leg.\u201d The District Court denied the downward departure because it found that Marcano\u2019s alleged impairment was not sufficiently extraordinary, and thereafter sentenced Marcano to an incarcerative term of 57 months, the bottom of the applicable guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-16\">Marcano\u2019s sole argument on appeal is that his sentence is invalid because, \u201cwhile the [District] Court and the Government responded to Appellant\u2019s departure motion to the extent that it was based upon his <em>current medical condition, </em>i.e., treatment would be provided as necessary, they failed to recognize Marcano\u2019s right to a departure based upon [the Bureau of Prison]\u2019s failure to treat him <em>in the past.\u2019\u2019 </em>Appellant\u2019s Br. at 8 (emphasis added). This failure of treatment by the BOP allegedly occurred during Marcano\u2019s detainment in July 1996 in the District of Rhode Island, where he was charged with and eventually convicted of a prior instance of illegal re-entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>Our review of the record convinces us that Marcano failed to raise below the argument that the BOP\u2019s past failure of treatment serves as an independent basis for a downward departure. Although Marcano did point to his past experience with the BOP, it was only to underscore his contention that the BOP was ill-equipped to treat his <em>current </em>medical condition. Having thus failed to raise before the District Court the specific ground for departure he now presses on appeal, and there being no showing of plain error-indeed, Marcano has not cited a single case in which a downward departure was granted solely on the basis of a defendant\u2019s failure to receive appropriate medical treatment while imprisoned on a prior, unrelated offense-Marcano cannot succeed in this line of argument. <em>See United States v. Miller, </em>263 F.3d 1, 4 (2d Cir.2001) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">The judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
