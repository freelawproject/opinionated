Pointer argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction; that the magistrate judge erred in denying his motion to strike surplusage from the indictment; and that the district court erred in denying his request that certain prior bad acts be excluded from the jury charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-15\">Although Pointer\u2019s ex-wife, Keitha Parrott Pointer (\u201cParrott\u201d), could not produce a certificate of title indicating that she was the registered owner of the winch truck, the record clearly establishes that Parrott had legal possession of the truck when Pointer and co-defendant Buddy Hall arranged for its removal from Parrott\u2019s property. <em>See United States v. Hull, </em>437 F.2d 1, 5 (5th Cir.1971) (holding that \u201cformal proof of ownership\u201d is not an essential element in a Dyer Act conviction). Furthermore, viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, the evidence was also sufficient to establish that Pointer <em>knew </em>that he was stealing the truck when he had it transported across state lines to Oklahoma. Because a reasonable trier of fact could have found that the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, Pointer\u2019s insufficiency-of-the-evidence claim fails. <em>See United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number><em>Bell, </em>678 F.2d 547, 549 (5th Cir.1982) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The magistrate judge denied Pointer\u2019s pretrial motion to strike surplusage from the indictment pursuant to Fed. R.Crim. P. 7(d). Because Pointer never appealed the magistrate judge\u2019s order to the district court, he is essentially attempting to appeal the order directly to this Court. As this court lacks jurisdiction over such orders, this portion of Pointer\u2019s appeal must be DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See United States v. Renfro, </em>620 F.2d 497, 500 (5th Cir.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Pointer\u2019s other bad acts, which were set forth in the indictment and included in the jury charge, assisted the Government in establishing the knowledge element of an 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2312 violation, as the evidence showed that Pointer knew he had no lawful basis to take Potter\u2019s property, including the truck. Because the prior bad acts helped place the events leading to the ultimate removal of the winch truck in context, and assisted the Government in establishing an element of the charged crime, they constituted intrinsic evidence, and their admission was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Coleman, </em>78 F.3d 154, 156-57 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">Based on the foregoing, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED, and Pointer\u2019s appeal is DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b436-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
