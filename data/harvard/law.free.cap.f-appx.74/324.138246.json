Following an evidentiary hearing, the immigration judge (IJ) found Morales-Carrera removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)\u00a9 as an alien who had been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude committed within five years of admission. The BIA summarily affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(a)(7).<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-18\">Morales-Carrera argues that his deferred adjudication was not a criminal conviction for immigration purposes. Morales-Carrera\u2019s argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Moosa v. INS, </em>171 F.3d 994, 1005-06 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-19\">Morales-Carrera argues that his conviction for forging proof of financial responsibility under Tex. Transp. Code \u00a7 601.196 (West 1999) was not a crime involving moral turpitude. Forgery and fraud are crimes involving moral turpitude. <em>See Jordan v. De George, </em>341 U.S. 223, 232, 71 S.Ct. 703, 95 L.Ed. 886 (1951) (fraud); <em>Balogun v. Ashcroft, </em>270 F.3d 274, 276, 278-79 (5th Cir.2001) (forgery). Because the offense involved forgery and was fraudulent in nature, the IJ did not err in determining that the crime involved moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-20\">Morales-Carrera argues that the BIA violated his right to due process by affirming his appeal without opinion pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.1(a)(7)(ii). After Morales-Carrera filed his brief, this court rejected a due process challenge to the \u201cstreamlining\u201d regulation, holding that the summary affirmance procedures do not violate due process and do not deprive the court of a basis for judicial review. <em>Soad</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number><em>jede v.

Because the parties referred to the 2002 regulation, and because the new regulation is either identical or substantially similar to the older version, we will refer to the 2002 regulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
