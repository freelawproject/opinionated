Jones argues that when the mail room staff at Allen Correctional Center opened his legal mail which had been returned as improperly addressed, they violated his right of access to the courts and hindered his effort to use a procedure for filing confidential grievances. The mail room staff apparently opened Jones\u2019 mail when it was returned to the prison because it was improperly addressed. The prison mail staff did not violate Jones\u2019 right of access to the courts by opening his incoming legal mail as prison officials may open incoming legal mail to inspect it for contraband. <em>See Brewer v. Wilkinson, </em>3 F.3d 816, 820-21 (5th Cir.1993). Further, Jones did not allege that he was prejudiced in any way in a legal proceeding or prevented from filing another grievance because the mail room staff opened his legal mail. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 349-51, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996). Therefore, Jones has not shown that the district court erred in dismissing his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Jones\u2019 appeal is without arguable merit and, therefore, is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint and the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous each count as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Jones is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is in imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b444-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
