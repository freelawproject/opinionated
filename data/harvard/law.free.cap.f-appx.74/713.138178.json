We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo the denial of a motion to dismiss based on a collateral deportation challenge, and for clear error findings of fact regarding such a motion. <em>United States v. Hinojosa-Perez, </em>206 F.3d 832, 835 (9th Cir.2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-23\">Luna-Perez\u2019s due process rights were not violated when the Immigration Judge ordered him deported in absentia, because the record shows he was sent adequate notice of the hearing. <em>See INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, </em>468 U.S. 1032, 1038-39, 104 S.Ct. 3479, 82 L.Ed.2d 778 (1984) (noting that deportation proceedings are civil in nature, and may proceed in the absence of an alien who fails to appear despite being given a reasonable opportunity to attend); <em>Farhoud v. INS, </em>122 F.3d 794, 796 (9th Cir.1997) (holding notice of deportation hearing sent to alien\u2019s address by certified mail in accordance with agency regulations did not violate due process, because it was reasonably calculated to reach the alien). Moreover, the record does not show that Luna-Perez had reasonable cause for his failure to attend the hearing. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>\u00a7 1252(b) (1993); <em>Hernandez-Vivas v.
