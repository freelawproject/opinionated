We find that these decisions did not involve such an application of federal law and therefore AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">To the extent Winzer argues that, as a matter of clearly established federal law, a murder can <em>never </em>be the natural and probable consequence of a misdemeanor, such an argument is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Spivey v. Rocha, </em>194 F.3d 971, 976-77 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-13\">Under the specific facts and circumstances of this case, the California Court of Appeal\u2019s decision that it was proper for the jury to be instructed regarding the natural and probable consequences doctrine was not \u201cobjectively unreasonable,\u201d <em>Lockyer v. Andrade, </em>538 U.S. 63, 123 S.Ct. 1166, 1172, 155 L.Ed.2d 144 (2003), because there is <em>no </em>Supreme Court precedent on point. On habeas review, with regard to jury instructions, we must not \u201cengage in a technical parsing of [their] language, ... but instead approach the instructions in the same way that the jury would \u2014 with a commonsense understanding of the instructions in the light of all that has taken place at the trial.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Texas, </em>509 U.S. 350, 368, 113 S.Ct. 2658, 125 L.Ed.2d 290 (1993) (internal quotations omitted). The jury was presented with evidence that Winzer robbed one person, participated in the violent battery of another, and jumped on the hood and kicked in the windshield of the car wherein the murder victim was shot to death. Based on these circumstances and upon evidence of Winzer\u2019s affiliation with a gang reputed to be violent, the jury could have inferred that Winzer knew his compatriot was armed. <em>See United States v. Abel, </em>469 U.S. 45, 53, 105 S.Ct. 465, 83 L.Ed.2d 450 (1984). Moreover, the instruction did not effect a judicial change in the law, violating the <em>ex post facto </em>clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-15\">The admission of evidence regarding Winzer\u2019s gang membership and of the gang\u2019s alleged practice of \u201crat-packing\u201d similarly does not support granting the writ. The admission of such evidence did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>not violate the constitutional principles established by <em>Scales v. United States, </em>367 U.S. 203, 81 S.Ct. 1469, 6 L.Ed.2d 782 (1959), because he was not convicted for simply being a member of an illegal organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Winzer\u2019s argument that the admission of such evidence violates the California Evidence Code is an argument that we do not have jurisdiction to consider. An inquiry into whether a state court violated its own code of evidence is \u201cno part of a federal court\u2019s habeas review of a state conviction.\u201d <em>Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 67, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991). Rather, \u201c[t]he admission of \u2018other acts\u2019 evidence, which a defendant contends is unduly prejudicial, will violate due process only when there are <em>no </em>permissible inferences the jury may draw from the evidence.\u201d <em>Windham v. Merkle, </em>163 F.3d 1092, 1103 (9th Cir.1998) (emphasis in original) (internal quotations and citations omitted). The jury could have drawn a permissible inference from this evidence as it tends to show that Winzer knew his compatriots were armed and dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">This not being a conspiracy case, <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>151 F.3d 1243 (9th Cir.1998) is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b716-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
