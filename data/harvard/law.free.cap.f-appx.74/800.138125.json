We affirm the BIA\u2019s dismissal and deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">The BIA may summarily dismiss an appeal if \u201c[t]he party ... indicates on Form EOIR-26 ... that he or she will file a brief or statement in support of the appeal and, thereafter, does not file such brief or statement, or reasonably explain his or her failure to do so.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(E). Cheluca indicated he would file a timely written brief, but failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">Cheluca waived the issue of the BIA\u2019s summary dismissal by failing to raise it in his opening brief. <em>Collins v. City of San Diego, </em>841 F.2d 337, 339 (9th Cir.1988). Nonetheless we may exercise our discretion to review the issue because the government briefed it, and therefore suffers no prejudice from Cheluca\u2019s failure to raise the issue properly. <em>See Koerner v. Grigas, </em>328 F.3d 1039, 1048 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-8\">So long as \u201csufficient notice is conveyed to the BIA\u201d by the reasons set out on the Notice of Appeal, a brief need not be filed in order to meet the requirement of specificity in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(2)(i)(E). <em>Casas-Chavez v. INS, </em>300 F.3d 1088, 1090 (9th Cir.2002). The Notice of Appeal on EOIR Form 26 stated that the immigration judge \u201cabused his discretion when he failed to continue the case of [Cheluca] along with the cases of his parents.... If the Immigration Judge had waited until the hearing of his parents\u2019 case, then [Chleuca] would have had the qualifying relatives and would have been eligible for the relief applied for.\u201d The Notice of Appeal stated adequate factual and legal grounds to raise the issue of whether the immigration judge abused his discretion. The BIA was not left \u201cguessing at how and why petitioner thought the court had erred.\u201d <em>Toquero v. INS, </em>956 F.2d 193, 195 (9th Cir.1992) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-11\">From the BIA\u2019s statement that \u201cupon review of the record, we are not persuaded that the Immigration Judge\u2019s ultimate resolution of this case was in error,\u201d we may infer the BIA addressed the merits of Cheluca\u2019s case. There was no abuse of discretion in the BIA\u2019s summary dismissal. The immigration judge acted within his authority to deny Cheluca cancellation of removal after finding he had no qualifying relatives as required by INA \u00a7 240A(b)(l)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-12\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b827-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
