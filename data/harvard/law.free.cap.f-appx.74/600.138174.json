This case has been referred to a panel of the court pursuant to Rule 34(j)(l), Rules of the Sixth Circuit. Upon examination, this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-23\">Whitehead filed his complaint in the district court alleging that unnamed people subjected him to physical abuse and psychological control. The district court dismissed the complaint sua sponte as frivo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>lous or otherwise without merit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). Plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal. On appeal, plaintiff has submitted a brief including allegations similar to those he made in his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Upon de novo review, see <em>McGore v. Wrigglesworth, </em>114 F.3d 601, 604 (6th Cir.1997), we affirm the judgment for the reasons stated by the district court in its memorandum opinion entered January 22, 2003. Plaintiffs complaint is frivolous because he failed to present a claim with an arguable or rational basis in law or in fact. <em>See Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989); <em>Lawler v. Marshall, </em>898 F.2d 1196, 1198 (6th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Accordingly, the motion for counsel is denied, and the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed. <em>See </em>Rule 34(j)(2)(C), Rules of the Sixth Circuit.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
