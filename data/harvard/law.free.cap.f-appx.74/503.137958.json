Daniel, represented by counsel, appeals his judgment of conviction and sentence. The parties have expressly waived oral argument, and this panel unanimously agrees that oral argument is not needed. Fed. R.App. P. 34(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>In June 2002, Daniel pleaded guilty to possessing with intent to distribute over 50 grams of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, and using and/or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking offense in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). Daniel was sentenced to a total of 160 months of imprisonment. Daniel has filed a timely appeal, arguing that his guilty plea was invalid because the district court failed to inform him that if he pleaded guilty there would not be a further trial of any kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Upon review, we conclude that Daniel is not entitled to relief on his claim that his guilty plea is invalid because he voluntarily waived his right to appeal. An appeal waiver provision in a plea agreement is binding as long as it was knowingly and voluntarily made. <em>Hunter v. United States, </em>160 F.3d 1109, 1113 (6th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Bazzi, </em>94 F.3d 1025, 1028 (6th Cir.1996). Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Daniel specifically waived \u201chis right to appeal his conviction and sentence herein.\u201d Furthermore, a review of the guilty plea transcript clearly reflects that the magistrate judge reviewed with Daniel the \u201cwaiver of appeal\u201d clause contained in the plea agreement. The magistrate judge explained the \u201cwaiver of appeal\u201d language contained in the plea agreement, and Daniel testified that he understood the language and that he was waiving his right to appeal. There is nothing in the record to suggest that Daniel\u2019s assent to the \u201cwaiver of appeal\u201d provision was unknowing or involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Nonetheless, we conclude that Daniel\u2019s guilty plea was valid. Daniel\u2019s only argument is that the district court failed to inform him that if he pleaded guilty there would not be any trial. A plea of guilty is valid if entered voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently; its validity is determined under the totality of the circumstances. <em>See Brady v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 749, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970). The Constitution requires that the circumstances reflect that the defendant be informed of all the direct consequences so that the plea represents a voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternatives. <em>See North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 31, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970). Here, contrary to Daniel\u2019s argument, the record reflects that Daniel was informed that, if he pleaded guilty, there would not be a trial. The magistrate judge specifically informed Daniel that he had \u201cthe right to a jury trial,\u201d but that he would be \u201cgiving up that right\u201d by entering a plea of guilty. Moreover, Daniel\u2019s plea agreement advised him that by pleading guilty, he \u201cspecifically and voluntarily waive[d]\u201d his \u201cright to a trial by jury or by the court.\u201d The magistrate judge\u2019s failure to specifically advise Daniel that \u201cthere will not be a further trial of any kind\u201d does not require a remand to permit Daniel to renew his guilty plea. Any variance from the procedures required by Rule 11 which does not affect substantial rights shall be disregarded. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(h); <em>United States v. Turner, </em>272 F.3d 380, 384 (6th Cir.2001) (noting that violations of Rule 11 are subject to a harmless error analysis). Here, any error was harmless because Daniel had clearly been advised that he was waiving his right to a trial by jury or by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of conviction and sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
