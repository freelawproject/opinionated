We have jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-19\">Reina contends that the district court\u2019s failure to adequately define the nature of the charges and fully comply with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 resulted in the entry of his guilty plea unknowingly and involuntarily. Because Reina failed to raise these objections in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Vonn, 535 </em>U.S. 55, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 1046, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002). After reviewing the entire record, <em>see id. </em>at 1055, we conclude that Reina did understand the essential elements of the offenses, and knowingly and voluntarily entered his guilty plea. Moreover, the district court\u2019s failure to fully comply with Rule 11 did not substantially affect Reina\u2019s rights. <em>See id. </em>at 1094.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-24\">Reina also contends that the district court erred by refusing to grant a safety valve departure pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 5C1.2. Reviewing for clear error, we find none. <em>See United States v. Ajugwo, </em>82 F.3d 925, 929 (9th Cir.1996) (requiring defendant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he qualifies for the safety valve).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b861-34\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
