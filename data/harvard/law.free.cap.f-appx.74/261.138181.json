This section provides that the Attorney General, in his discretion, may remove the conditional basis placed upon an alien\u2019s permanent resident status (and waive the requirement that the alien and his citizen spouse jointly file a petition for removal of the conditional basis) upon a showing that the alien\u2019s marriage was entered into in good faith. Because we find that the immigration judge did not abuse his discretion in finding that Nkong did not enter into his marriage in good faith, we deny the petition for review. <em>See Nyonzele v. INS, </em>83 F.3d 975, 979 (8th Cir.1996); <em>Matter of Laureano, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1, 2-3, 1983 WL 29913 (BIA 1983).
