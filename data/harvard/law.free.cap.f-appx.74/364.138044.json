This is the same issue on which the district court granted a certificate of appealability (COA) after ruling that Stromile\u2019s petition was not time-barred under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). We have subsequently rejected this basis for denying Cockrell\u2019s time-bar argument. <em>See Roberts v. Cockrell, </em>319 F.3d 690, 694-95 (5th Cir.2003). A review of the record reveals that Stromile\u2019s petition is indeed time-barred, as the limitations period was not tolled by his state habeas application, filed after expiration of the period, or by his previous habeas petition, which he voluntarily dismissed. <em>See Grooms v. Johnson, </em>208 F.3d 488, 489-90 (5th Cir.1999); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d). Denial of habeas relief may be - and is - affirmed on this alternate basis. <em>See Bickford v. International Speedway Corp., </em>654 F.2d 1028, 1031 (5th Cir.1981). We deny as moot Stromile\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b391-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
