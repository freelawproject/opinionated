We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-19\">Free contends the district court erred in denying his petition for writ of error co-ram nobis because he had valid reasons for not previously attacking his sentence. We review for an abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s denial of his petition on the basis of laches. <em>Telink, Inc. v. United States, </em>24 F.3d 42, 47 (9th Cir.1994). Upon review of the record, and accepting the facts stated by Free as true; we conclude that Free\u2019s approximately 26-year delay was unreasonable, and that the government would be sufficiently prejudiced by the delay. <em>See id. </em>at 48. Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s denial of Free\u2019s petition for writ of error coram nobis, nor in its decision not to hold an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b867-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
