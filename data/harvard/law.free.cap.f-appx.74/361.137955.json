McKenzie argues that his claims fall under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 because that section is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his imprisonment. His savings clause arguments are premised upon his contention that the jury did not determine drug quantity and therefore his constitutional rights were violated when the sentencing court determined quantity and used its quantity determination when it sentenced McKenzie to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-22\">\u201c[T]he savings clause of [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 2255 applies to a claim (i) that is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and (ii) that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first [28 U.S.C.] \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). While McKenzie does not cite <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), in his brief, his arguments are nonetheless based on principles set forth in <em>Apprendi. Apprendi </em>does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review, and an <em>Apprendi </em>claim does not satisfy the test for filing a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Wesson v. U.S. Penitentiary, Beaumont, Tx., </em>305 F.3d 343, 347-48 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1241, 123 S.Ct. 1374, 155 L.Ed.2d 212 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">McKenzie\u2019s reliance on <em>Sawyer v. Whitley, </em>505 U.S. 333, 112 S.Ct. 2514, 120 L.Ed.2d 269 (1992), is also misplaced. <em>Sawyer </em>was decided before McKenzie was convicted and did not legitimize drug-trafficking crimes. Therefore, McKenzie cannot use <em>Sawyer </em>to avail himself of the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904. McKenzie has not met either prong of the <em>ReyesRequena </em>test, and thus he cannot use 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 to bring his habeas corpus claims challenging his federal sentence. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. McKenzie\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b387-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
