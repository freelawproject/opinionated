In so holding, the District Court reversed decisions denying reimbursement rendered by two Impartial Hearing Officers (\u201cIHOs\u201d) and affirmed by a State Review Officer (\u201cSRO\u201d) of the New York State Education Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-14\">Having reviewed the record before the District Court, we reverse the judgment of the District Court and enter judgment affirming the administrative determinations of the New York State Education Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"ArJ\">I. The IDEA</p>\n<p id=\"b164-16\">The IDEA offers federal funds to states that develop plans to assure \u201call children with disabilities\u201d a \u201cfree appropriate public education,\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412(a)(1)(A). To meet the requirements of the IDEA, each student with a disability must receive \u201cspecial education and related services\u201d designed to serve his needs. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1401(8). Such services must the administered according to an \u201cindividualized education program\u201d (\u201cIEP\u201d), which school districts must implement each year for each student with a disability. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1414(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-17\">IEPs are subject to considerable procedural and substantive requirements, <em>id., </em>but they are not required to \u201cfurnish[ ] ... every special service necessary to maximize each handicapped child\u2019s potential,\u201d <em>Board of Education v. Rowley, </em>458 U.S. 176, 200, 102 S.Ct. 3034, 73 L.Ed.2d 690 (1982). Rather, the IDEA requires that IEPs provide a \u201cbasic floor of opportunity,\u201d consisting of services that are \u201cindividually designed to provide educational benefit\u201d to a child with a disability. <em>Id. </em>at 201, 102 S.Ct. 3034.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-18\">The IDEA further imposes on school districts developing IEPs a strong preference for \u201cmainstreaming,\u201d or educating children with disabilities \u201c[t]o the maxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>mum extent appropriate\u201d along with their non-disabled peers. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412(a)(5). This Court has interpreted this provision as a requirement that special education be provided in the \u201cleast restrictive setting consistent with a child\u2019s needs.\u201d <em>Walczak v. Florida Union Free School District, </em>142 F.3d 119, 122 (2d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">New York parents who believe an IEP is insufficient under the IDEA may challenge it in an \u201cimpartial due process hearing,\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(f), before an IHO appointed by the local board of education. <em>See </em>N.Y. Educ. L. \u00a7 4404(1). At that hearing, the school district has the burden of demonstrating the appropriateness of its proposed IEP. <em>See, e.g., Walczak, </em>142 F.3d at 122 (collecting cases). The decision of an IHO may be appealed to an SRO, <em>see </em>N.Y. Educ. L. \u00a7 4404(2); <em>see also </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(g), and that officer\u2019s decision may in turn be challenged in either state or federal court, <em>see </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">II. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Plamtif\u00eds-Appellees Steven and Joan Grim enrolled their daughter, Chelsea, in Defendant-Appellant Rhinebeck Central School District for first and second grades. Toward the end of her second-grade year, Chelsea was tested at her parents\u2019 request and classified as \u201clearning disabled.\u201d Accordingly, the school district developed an IEP outlining a program of special education for her. Chelsea began receiving instruction pursuant to the IEP during the final month of her second-grade year, June 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">During the following summer, the Grims concluded that the IEP was insufficient for Chelsea\u2019s needs, so they unilaterally removed her from the Rhinebeck public schools and enrolled her in the private Kildonan School (\u201cKildonan\u201d), which specializes in the education of dyslexic students. Kildonan educates according to the Orton-Gillingham method, \u201ca language based remedial program for students who have specific difficulties in the phonological encoding and decoding of the language.\u201d <em>See Grim v. Rhinebeck Central School District, </em>No. 98 Civ. 4854, slip op. at 20-21 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 29, 2002) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">Near the conclusion of Chelsea\u2019s third-grade year at Kildonan, the Grims formally challenged the adequacy of the IEP that had been developed the previous spring (\u201c1995-96 IEP\u201d) by requesting an impartial hearing before an IHO, as authorized by the IDEA. They sought reimbursement from the Rhinebeck Central School District for the expense of sending Chelsea to Kildonan. After hearing extensive testimony, on March 14,1997, the IHO issued a determination that the 1995-96 IEP was appropriate and legally sufficient under the IDEA, and further, that Kildonan was not an appropriate placement for Chelsea because of the IDEA\u2019S preference for educating students in the \u201cleast restrictive environment.\u201d An SRO affirmed the IHO\u2019s decision on March 10,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-11\">In the summer of 1996, defendant school district again prepared an IEP to guide the provision of special education to Chelsea during her approaching fourth-grade year (\u201c1996-97 IEP\u201d), as required by the IDEA. Deeming the 1996-97 IEP insufficient to meet Chelsea\u2019s needs, the Grims enrolled Chelsea in Kildonan for a second year. They later deemed defendant\u2019s proposed IEP for Chelsea for her fifth-grade year (\u201c1997-98 IEP\u201d) similarly insufficient, so Chelsea remained at Kildonan for a third year.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-12\">Plaintiffs\u2019 subsequent challenges to the sufficiency of the 1996-97 and 1997-98 IEPs were consolidated before a single IHO. The IHO held that both IEPs \u201coffered an appropriate public education in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>the least restrictive environment,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 55, and that the procedures followed in their development adequately complied with the IDEA, <em>id. </em>An SRO affirmed the decisions of the IHO. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">I. Judicial Review Under the IDEA</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">Federal courts reviewing administrative determinations under the IDEA must base their decisions on \u201ca preponderance of the evidence,\u201d taking into account not only the record from the administrative proceedings, but also any further evidence presented before the District Court by the parties. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(B). The Supreme Court and our Court have interpreted the IDEA as strictly limiting judicial review of state administrative decisions. <em>See Rowley, </em>458 U.S. at 204-08,102 S.Ct. 8034; <em>Walczak, </em>142 F.3d at 119. Federal courts reviewing administrative decisions must give \u201cdue weight\u201d to the administrative proceedings, \u201cmindful that the judiciary generally lack[s] the specialized knowledge and experience necessary to resolve persistent and difficult questions of educational policy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 129 (quoting <em>Rowley, </em>458 U.S. at 206, 208, 102 S.Ct. 3034) (alteration in original; internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The <em>Rowley </em>Court also held that the IDEA established a two-fold inquiry for courts reviewing administrative determinations: \u201cFirst, has the State complied with the procedures set forth in the Act? And second, is the individualized educational program developed through the Act\u2019s procedures reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits?\u201d <em>Rowley, </em>458 U.S. at 206-07, 102 S.Ct. 3034 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">II. Procedural Violations of the IDEA</p>\n<p id=\"b166-12\">Conducting this two-part inquiry, the District Court first held that all three challenged IEPs at issue were inadequate under the IDEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-13\">The first violation the Court identified was extensive delay in Rhinebeck School District\u2019s development and review of all three challenged IEPs-at least that portion of the considerable delays for which the plaintiffs were not themselves responsible. <em>Grim, </em>No. 98 Civ. 4854, slip op. at 64-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-14\">The Court then proceeded to identify a further violation in all three challenged IEPs, namely, their generic articulation of goals and strategies for evaluating Chelsea\u2019s progress. Specifically, the District Court held that \u201cthe rote use of [a single] phrase in practically every objective of the [1995-96] IEP is facially insufficient to meet the requirements of the IDEA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 71. The 1996-97 and 1997-98 IEPs, according to the District Court, \u201cecho\u201d and fail to solve the problems of this first IEP. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, reversing the SRO, the District Court found that, even though delay alone did not independently render the IEPs insufficient under the IDEA, <em>id. </em>at 66-67, the combination of the delay and this second violation was sufficiently serious to render all three IEPs inadequate under the IDEA. <em>See id. </em>at 66-67, 70-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-15\">The District Court correctly noted that the Supreme Court, interpreting the IDEA<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in <em>Rowley, </em>emphasized the importance Congress attached to the statute\u2019s procedural requirements as \u201csafeguards\u201d of the rights protected by the IDEA. <em>See id. </em>at 63. Specifically, the <em>Rowley </em>Court noted that compliance with the considera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>ble procedural provisions of the IDEA \u201cwould in most cases assure much if not all of what Congress wished in the way of substantive content in an IEP.\u201d <em>Rowley, </em>458 U.S. at 206, 102 S.Ct. 8034. As the District Court recognized, however, it does not follow that every procedural error in the development of an IEP renders that IEP legally inadequate under the IDEA. <em>See Grim, </em>No. 98 Civ. 4854, slip op. at 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">It is no doubt true that administrative delays, in certain circumstances, can violate the IDEA by depriving a student of his right to a \u201cfree appropriate public education.\u201d For example, if a student were actually being educated under an inappropriate IEP, and state officers failed to review it in a timely manner, the delay might constitute a violation of the IDEA. Here, however, Chelsea Grim was never in any danger of being educated under the district\u2019s proposed IEPs. The sole purpose of the various hearings was to determine, retrospectively, whether the Grims would receive reimbursement for the tuition they had paid to the Kildonan School. The challenge to the 1995-96 IEP, for example, was not made until May of 1996, a few weeks before the end of a school year Chelsea had already spent at Kildonan. Considering the circumstances, we do not see how Chelsea\u2019s right to a free appropriate public education was endangered by delays in the state\u2019s administrative review process.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">It is not clear from the District Court\u2019s opinion whether the Court would have considered the IEPs\u2019 inadequate articulation of objectives violative of the IDEA if their inadequacy had not been compounded by delay. However, having reversed the District Court\u2019s holding on the legal effect of delay, it is sufficient for our purposes to note that, whether a procedural or a substantive issue, the sufficiency of goals and strategies in an IEP is precisely the type of issue upon which the IDEA requires deference to the expertise of the administrative decisions. Accordingly, the analysis below, based upon the <em>Rowley </em>standard, applies equally to this flaw, which the District Court identified as \u201cprocedural,\u201d as to the flaws the Court deemed \u201csubstantive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">III. Substantive Violations of the IDEA</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">In addition to the procedural defects the District Court identified with respect to all three of the IEPs in question, the District Court identified substantive violations of the IDEA in the 1996-97 and 1997-98 IEPs, finding that \u201cneither ... IEP was reasonably calculated to provide educational benefit\u201d to Chelsea. <em>Id. </em>at 81. According to the Court, the 1996-97 IEP was substantively inadequate because it did not sufficiently augment the services provided by the 1995-96 IEP in response to test scores that revealed that the student failed to progress during preceding year. <em>Id. </em>at 77. Additionally, both the 1996-97 and 1997-98 IEPs were substantively inadequate because, according to the District Court, \u201cat the second [IHO] hearing,\u201d which reviewed both these later IEPs, \u201cthe testimony only supported] the conclusion that the Orton-Gillingham approach was the appropriate approach for teaching Chelsea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">In <em>Rowley, </em>the Supreme Court overturned the reversal of an administrative decision under the IDEA, holding that the reviewing court had impermissibly \u201cimpos[ed its] view of preferable educational methods upon the States,\u201d by accepting the testimony of experts as to \u201cthe best method for educating the deaf.\u201d <em>Rowley, </em>458 U.S. at 207 &amp; n. 29, 102 S.Ct. 3034. The Supreme Court noted that adopting the expert opinion was inappropriate for a court reviewing administrative determinations under the IDEA, because the optimal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>method for deaf education was \u201ca question long debated among scholars,\u201d and the same expert evidence had been presented to, and found insufficient by, the SRO. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Our Court applied the <em>Rowley </em>standard in <em>Walczak, </em>in which we overturned a District Court\u2019s reversal of an SRO\u2019s decision under the IDEA. In <em>Walczak </em>we noted that, in order for the District Court to conduct an \u201cindependent review\u201d of the sufficiency of an IEP under the IDEA that did not \u201cimpermissibly meddl[e] in state educational methodology,\u201d it must examine the record for \u201cany objective evidence indicating whether the child is likely to make progress or regress under the proposed plan.\u201d <em>Walczak, </em>142 F.3d at 130 (citing <em>Mrs. B. v. Milford Bd. of Educ., </em>103 F.3d 1114, 1121 (2d Cir.1997) (citing <em>Rowley, </em>458 U.S. at 203, 102 S.Ct. 3034)). The <em>Walczak </em>Court noted that such \u201cobjective evidence\u201d is most easily interpreted in the form of grades in mainstream classes, but \u201ctest scores and similar objective criteria\u201d could also be considered. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">Despite the District Court\u2019s protest that its holding did not violate <em>Rowley </em>by \u201cimposing [its] view of preferable education methods upon the States,\u201d <em>Grim, </em>No. 98 Civ. 4854, slip op. at 81 (quoting <em>Rowley, </em>458 U.S. at 207, 102 S.Ct. 3034) (internal quotation marks omitted)), the Court\u2019s judgment reflects precisely the type of subjective credibility assessment that the <em>Rowley </em>Court found inappropriate. The District Court concluded that Chelsea must be educated using a single educational methodology in a fully segregated environment in order to receive the \u201ceducational benefit\u201d sufficient to meet the \u201cbasic floor of opportunity,\u201d <em>Rowley, </em>458 U.S. at 201, 102 S.Ct. 3034, guaranteed by the IDEA. The Court reached this conclusion despite contrary holdings of the IHOs and SRO, and despite the IDEA\u2019S preference for educating students in the least restrictive environment possible. It justified its conclusion by finding that \u201c[n]either the IHO nor the SRO [reviewing the two later IEPs] gave appropriate consideration to the experts on dyslexia, who had personal knowledge of the student in question.\u201d <em>Grim, </em>No. 98 Civ. 4854, slip op. at 81. The District Court thus impermissibly chose between the views of conflicting experts on a controversial issue of educational policy-effective methods of educating dyslexic students-in direct contradiction of the opinions of state administrative officers who had heard the same evidence, as prohibited by <em>Rowley. See Rowley </em>458 U.S. at 207 <em>&amp; </em>n. 29, 102 S.Ct. 3034.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">For the above reasons, we hold that the District Court misapplied the standard of review applicable in IDEA cases by not according appropriate deference to administrative determinations under the IDEA when it concluded that the 1995-96, 1996-97 and 1997-98 IEPs were inadequate under the IDEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\"><em>% </em># :j: ifc \u2756</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">In sum, we reverse the judgment of the District Court because it is based on a misapplication of the standard of review under the IDEA; because it improperly held that the 1995-96, 1996-97, and 1997-98 IEPs were procedurally inadequate under the IDEA; and because it erroneously held that the 1996-97 and 1997-98 IEPs were substantively inadequate under the IDEA. We therefore enter judgment in favor of the defendants, affirming the SRO decisions denying plaintiffs private-school tuition reimbursement for the 1995-96, 1996-97 and 1997-98 school years.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-12\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the District Court is REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b166-8\">. In fact, the <em>Rowley </em>Court interpreted the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975, which was subsequently amended and renamed IDEA. <em>Walczak, </em>142 F.3d at 122. For consistency, we refer to the relevant statute as the IDEA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
