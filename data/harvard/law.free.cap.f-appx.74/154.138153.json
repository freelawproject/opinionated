Shaev alleges that a proxy statement issued by the defendants on March 8, 1999, violated Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78n(a), and Rule 14a-9, promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.14a-9, by making material misstatements and omissions as to the number of shares available under a proposed stock incentive plan, and by failing to provide a Black-Scholes estimate of the plan\u2019s cost. Further, she contends that the district court abused its discretion: (1) in denying her motion to allow discovery on the issue of whether reasonable estimates of these figures were available to the defendants when they disseminated the proxy statement; and (2) in excluding the report of an independent proxy statement review firm from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-21\">The district court acted well within its discretion in denying the plaintiffs motions to allow discovery and to enlarge the rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>ord. We also agree with the court below that our decision in <em>Resnik v. Swartz, et al., </em>308 F.3d 147 (2d Cir.2002), requires that the plaintiffs amended complaint be dismissed under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). We need not, therefore, reach the other questions raised by this appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">We have considered all of the appellant\u2019s arguments and found them to be without merit. Accordingly, for substantially the reasons stated by the district court, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b181-14\">. Thus, we need not decide whether plaintiff's complaint could also be dismissed for failure to make a demand on Alcoa\u2019s Board of Directors, nor whether plaintiff's complaint was pleaded with sufficient particularity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
