Ingram raises two issues on appeal. This summary order concerns the first issue, which is whether the District Court erred in failing to suppress firearms evidence seized as a result of an allegedly unconstitutional search of his hotel room. We address the second issue, which concerns whether Ingram\u2019s Canadian conviction constitutes a predicate offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), in an opinion also filed on this date. Accordingly, below we briefly set forth the facts relevant to the suppression issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-21\">On February 16, 2001, co-defendant Kirk Gayle attempted to enter the United States from Canada at Champlain, New York, where he was subjected to a border inspection conducted by United States Customs inspectors. Special Agent Peter Dunbar, a supervisory board patrol agent present during the inspection, observed Gayle to be \u201cevasive,\u201d \u201cvisibly nervous,\u201d and \u201csweating profusely.\u201d Agent Dunbar also suspected that someone else had been riding with Gayle upon noticing wet floor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>boards behind the driver\u2019s seat in Gayle\u2019s ear.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">The inspectors obtained from Gayle a piece of paper with what appeared to be a phone number followed by a three digit number. The phone number was for the Inn at Smithfield, a hotel in Plattsburgh, New York, causing Agent Dunbar to suspect that the three digit number was a hotel room number. Agent Dunbar traveled to the Inn at Smith field, where he learned that the room was registered in the name of defendant-appellant Rohan Ingram. Agent Dunbar then requested from the Customs dispatch office a records check on Ingram\u2019s criminal history, immigration status, and tax records. The dispatch office cautioned Agent Dunbar that Ingram was possibly armed and dangerous. Specifically, the record check revealed that Ingram had an extensive criminal history, which included violence, narcotics trafficking, and weapon violations in Canada.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Agent Richard Labounty soon arrived at the Inn at Smithfield to provide assistance. As Agents Dunbar and Labounty approached Ingram\u2019s hotel room, Ingram emerged from the room. The agents identified themselves to Ingram, who revealed his name and produced a Canadian driver\u2019s license. The agents then arrested Ingram for being illegally in the United States, informed him that they believed he was wanted in Canada, and placed him in handcuffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">After arresting Ingram, the agents heard voices coming from the hotel room. When they asked Ingram who else was in the room, \u201che was evasive and uncooperative and didn\u2019t really tell [the agents] who was there.\u201d The agents proceeded to knock on the door and were met by Ann-Marie Richardson, another charged defendant who ultimately testified as a cooperating witness at Ingram and Gayle\u2019s trial. Recognizing Richardson\u2019s name from an acquaintance list in Ingram\u2019s tax record, Agent Dunbar believed that Richardson was excludable from the United States because of her criminal history in Canada. Richardson claimed not to have her immigration documents with her at the time, but she stated that her identification was in a bag across the room.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Agent Dunbar claimed to be concerned that Richardson would retrieve not identification, but instead a weapon, and that other individuals may have been hiding in the room. Agent Dunbar therefore accompanied Richardson as she walked towards the bag to enable him to \u201ckeep an eye on her and on her hands and all.\u201d As Agent Dunbar and Richardson approached the bag that supposedly contained her identification, Agent Dunbar viewed white cardboard boxes marked \u201cfirearms.\u201d Agent Dunbar claimed that the boxes were \u201cclearly visible\u201d and that he did not have to manipulate the duffle bag at all to see the markings on the boxes. Upon noticing the word, \u201cfirearms,\u201d Agent Dunbar notified Agent Labounty, who proceeded to handcuff Richardson. Agent Dunbar opened the top two boxes to verify that they in fact contained firearms, which they did.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">On May 28, 2001, Ingram was charged in a superseding indictment with conspiracy to unlawfully export defense articles designated on the United States Munitions List in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2778; conspiracy to travel with intent to engage in the illegal acquisition of firearms, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371, 922(a)(1)(A), 924(n); and being a felon unlawfully in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), 924(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">Ingram moved before the District Court to suppress the physical evidence seized during Agent Dunbar\u2019s search of the hotel room, alleging that the evidence was ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>tained in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights because Ingram had a legitimate expectation of privacy in his hotel room. The government argued that the firearms seized by Agent Dunbar were admissible under the \u201csearch incident to arrest\u201d exception. The District Court conducted a suppression hearing on July 3, 2001, and July 9, 2001, at which various witnesses described the events set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">On August 24, 2001, the District Court denied Ingram\u2019s motion to suppress. <em>United States v. Ingram, </em>164 F.Supp.2d 310 (N.D.N.Y.2001). The court first determined that Agents Dunbar and Labounty had probable cause to arrest Ingram based on the information revealed in the background check. <em>Id. </em>at 314. The court then concluded that the agents\u2019 protective sweep of the hotel room was constitutional because it was incident to a lawful arrest and the agents had \u201ca reasonable suspicion that they might be in danger from someone else in the hotel room.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 315. Finally, because the court concluded that the agents were justified in executing a protective sweep of the hotel room, they were \u201clawfully in a location from which to view and access the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For these reasons, the court concluded that the evidence seized was admissible under the \u201cprotective sweep\u201d and \u201cplain view\u201d exceptions to the warrant requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 314-15, 317.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Ingram and Gayle were tried together in a trial commencing on October 1, 2001. On October 5, 2001, the jury found Ingram guilty on all three counts and acquitted Gayle of all charges. Ingram moved for a judgment of acquittal, which was denied on February 5, 2002. On January 30, 2002, Ingram was sentenced to seventy-eight months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release, and a special assessment of $300.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">Ingram concedes that Agent Dunbar had probable cause for his arrest, but argues that Agent Dunbar exceeded constitutionally permissible bounds by entering into his hotel room and by following Richardson to her bag. The government responds that Agent Dunbar acted reasonably in light of the circumstances, and that the evidence was lawfully viewed in the course of a protective sweep permissible under the Fourth Amendment. A district court\u2019s factual findings underlying its denial of a motion to suppress are viewed in the light most favorable to the government and reviewed for clear error, while the legal issues the court addressed are reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Davis, </em>326 F.3d 361, 365 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">The Fourth Amendment protects \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. IV. The amendment proscribes warrantless searches unless they fall under one of certain well-defined exceptions. <em>See Smith v. Ohio, </em>494 U.S. 541, 542, 110 S.Ct. 1288, 108 L.Ed.2d 464 (1990); <em>United States v. Oguns, </em>921 F.2d 442, 446 (2d Cir.1990) (referring to \u201cthe axiom that warrantless searches are <em>per se </em>unreasonable, subject to a few well-delineated exceptions\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). One of these exceptions is a security sweep incident to a lawful arrest. <em>See Maryland v. Buie, </em>494 U.S. 325, 334, 110 S.Ct. 1093, 108 L.Ed.2d 276 (1990); <em>see also United States v. Robinson, </em>414 U.S. 218, 230-37, 94 S.Ct. 467, 38 L.Ed.2d 427 (1973) (setting forth search incident to arrest exception to warrant requirement); <em>Smith, </em>494 U.S. at 543, 110 S.Ct. 1288 (\u201cThe exception for searches incident to arrest permits the police to search a lawfully arrested person and areas within his immediate control.\u201d). Because Ingram does not challenge the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>lawfulness of his arrest, we consider whether the search exceeded the bounds of the protective sweep exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The Supreme Court enunciated the protective sweep doctrine in <em>Buie, </em>where it held \u201cthat as an incident to the arrest the officers could, as a precautionary matter and without probable cause or reasonable suspicion, look in closets and other spaces immediately adjoining the place of arrest from which an attack could be immediately launched.\u201d 494 U.S. at 334, 110 S.Ct. 1093. To conduct a search that extends beyond an examination into immediately adjoining areas, \u201cthere must be articulable facts which, taken together with the rational inferences from those facts, would warrant a reasonably prudent officer in believing that the area to be swept harbors an individual posing a danger to those on the arrest scene.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[I]f an officer reasonably concludes that an individual poses a danger to those at the scene of the arrest, the threat of physical harm may be neutralized by a quick search for weapons within the reach of that individual.\u201d <em>United States v. Blue, 78 </em>F.3d 56, 59 (2d Cir.1996). Although a protective search may not constitutionally extend to a full search of the premises, it may include a search \u201cfor weapons within the grab area of an individual whom the government agents have reasonably concluded is dangerous.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>941 F.2d 133, 137 (2d Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Under the protective sweep doctrine, Agent Dunbar was permitted to conduct a sweep to protect himself from danger posed not just by Ingram, but also by others. <em>See Buie, </em>494 U.S. at 334, 110 S.Ct. 1093. At the suppression hearing, Agent Dunbar testified to various facts which permitted him to conclude that the situation was sufficiently dangerous so as to justify the hotel room search. Shortly before Ingram\u2019s arrest, Agent Dunbar learned that Ingram could be armed and dangerous and had an extensive criminal history of violence and firearms possession. After arresting Ingram, Agent Dunbar heard voices coming from a nearby hotel room, which was registered in Ingram\u2019s name. In light of these circumstances, it is quite understandable that Agent Dunbar would fear that the individuals in the room could pose a threat to his and Agent Labounty\u2019s safety. For these same reasons, it was reasonable for Agent Dunbar to accompany Richardson as she retrieved her identification to ensure that she was not instead retrieving a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Having concluded that Agent Dunbar\u2019s protective sweep was lawful, we turn to whether the items seized in the course of this sweep were within plain view. \u201cUnder [the plain view] doctrine, if police are lawfully in a position from which they view an object, if its incriminating character is immediately apparent, and if the officers have a lawful right of access to the object, they may seize it without a warrant.\u201d <em>Minnesota v. Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. 366, 375, 113 S.Ct. 2130, 124 L.Ed.2d 334 (1993). We already have held that Agent Dunbar was lawfully in the hotel room. At the suppression hearing, Agent Dunbar testified that as he walked with Richardson into the hotel room, \u201cI looked over to my left, and down, and there was a duffle bag sitting on the floor, ... and there were cardboard boxes in the top and in bold letters it said firearms on top of the boxes.\u201d This testimony firmly established that the incriminating character of the evidence was immediately apparent for Agent Dunbar to observe while he performed the protective sweep of the hotel room.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">We have reviewed all of the defendant-appellant\u2019s arguments and, for reasons stated above and in the opinion filed on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>this date, affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
