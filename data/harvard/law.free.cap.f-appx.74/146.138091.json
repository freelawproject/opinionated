City of New York, </em>No. 00 Civ. 326, 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20426 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 11, 2001) . Thereafter, the City moved for reconsideration of the denial of summary judgment with respect to the retaliation claim. Upon reconsideration, the District Court granted the City\u2019s motion and dismissed the retaliation claim. The District Court held that \u201cPimentel has failed to establish that denial of her transfer requests constituted an adverse employment action....\u201d <em>Pimentel v. City of New York, </em>No. 00 Civ. 326, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8454, at *17 (S.D.N.Y. May 14, 2002) .</p>\n<p id=\"b173-17\">We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Fujitsu Ltd. v. Fed. Express Corp., </em>247 F.3d 423, 428 (2d Cir.2001). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Pimentel, we agree with the District Court that there is no issue of material fact in dispute and that the City is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. A plaintiff alleging discriminatory retaliation must prove, <em>inter alia, </em>that her employer took an adverse employment action against her. <em>See Gordon v. New York City Bd. of Educ., </em>232 F.3d 111, 116 (2d Cir.2000). To sustain an adverse employment action, a plaintiff must \u201cendure[ ] a \u2018materially adverse change\u2019 in the terms and conditions of employment.\u201d <em>Galabya v. New York City Bd. of Educ., </em>202 F.3d 636, 640 (2d Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Richardson v. New York State Dep\u2019t of Corr. Serv., </em>180 F.3d 426, 446 (2d Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>As the District Court explained, a forced transfer, or denial of a transfer, may amount to an adverse employment action when, for example, an employee is forced to move to or to stay in a unit with more cumbersome job responsibilities or lower compensation. <em>See Richardson, </em>180 F.3d at 444 (finding \u201csufficient evidence to conclude that the transfer and reassignment\u2014 which involved different job responsibilities and a move to a position involving contact with the prisoner population \u2014 constituted an adverse employment decision\u201d). However, a forced transfer, or denial of a transfer, is not an adverse employment action if the terms, privileges, duration, or condition of a plaintiffs employment do not change. <em>See Weeks v. New York State (Div. of Parole), </em>273 F.3d 76, 86-87 (2d Cir.2001) (concluding that a forced transfer to another work location failed to rise to the level of an adverse employment action when the plaintiff failed to demonstrate that the transfer materially changed her terms and conditions of employment); <em>Galabya, </em>202 F.3d at 641 (affirming entry of summary judgment when plaintiff had not \u201cproduced evidence to show that the transfer was to an assignment that was materially less prestigious, materially less suited to his skills and expertise, or materially less conducive to career advancement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">Here, Pimentel has presented no evidence that the positions she sought, first in another OCSE office and then outside OCSE, were objectively preferable to the position she already held. Because Pimentel has failed to raise an issue of material fact with respect to an essential element of her retaliation claim, the District Court properly granted summary judgment dismissing that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">We have considered all of plaintiffs claims on appeal and we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court substantially for the reasons stated by the Court in its Opinion and Order entered May 14, 2002.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
