He argues that he did not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive his Sixth Amendment right to conflict-free counsel. He contends that the district court erred in failing to conduct an adequate hearing under Fed. R.Crim. P. 44(c) to determine whether any conflict of interest might exist or arise because of his counsel\u2019s joint representation of Vasquez and his co-defendant brother. He argues further that the district court erred in failing to conduct a second hearing pursuant to Fed. R.Crim. P. 44(c) when a conflict became apparent during the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Vazquez has failed to demonstrate an actual conflict of interest in his counsel\u2019s joint representation. <em>See United States v. Rico, </em>51 F.3d 495, 509 (5th Cir.1995). Therefore, the district court did not err in allowing the same counsel to represent both Vazquez and his brother; neither did it err in not conducting a second hearing pursuant to Fed. R.Crim. P. 44(c). <em>See United States v. Newell, </em>315 F.3d 510, 520 (5th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Lyons, </em>703 F.2d 815, 820 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b444-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
