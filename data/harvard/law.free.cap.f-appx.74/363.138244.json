He argues that the district court erred in assessing two criminal history points for a prior attempted robbery conviction while he was a juvenile. Based upon our review of the record, we conclude that the district court did not err in assessing these criminal history points because Florez did not present evidence to the district court indicating that he was released from custody for this offense more than five years before he was arrested for the instant offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We do not consider facts that were not presented to the district court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Florez also argues that the district court erred by assessing a criminal history point for his prior conviction for \u201cfare-beating,\u201d or avoiding payment of a transportation fare. Although this offense is not specifically listed as an excluded offense under Guideline \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l), we conclude that this offense is similar to a listed offense and that the district court erred by not excluding it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The erroneous inclusion of this single criminal history point increased Florez\u2019s criminal history category from III to TV, which in turn increased the applicable range of imprisonment and therefore resulted in a sentence outside of the correct range. Therefore, we vacate his sentence and remand this case to the district court for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">SENTENCE VACATED; REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b389-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
