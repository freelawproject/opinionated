Because Chow\u2019s departure from this country constituted a withdrawal of his appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d), we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Interpreting the law as it stood before the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), the Supreme Court held in <em>Rosenberg v. Fleuti 3</em>74 U.S. 449, 83 S.Ct. 1804, 10 L.Ed.2d 1000 (1963) (\u201cFleuti\u201d), that a Lawful Permanent Resident\u2019s return to the United States from an \u201cafternoon trip\u201d to Mexico did not constitute an \u201centry\u201d within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13), because the trip was \u201cinnocent, casual, and brief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 461, 83 S.Ct. 1804. Chow seeks to apply <em>Fleuti </em>to his case, and asks us to hold that his five-day trip to Canada did not constitute a \u201cdeparture\u201d sufficient to withdraw his BIA appeal within the meaning of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">We analyze this question under the Immigration and Nationality Act as it existed before the enactment of the IIRIRA. IIRIRA does not apply to deportation or exclusion proceedings that were initiated prior to April 1, 1997, IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(1), and the INS initiated proceedings against Chow in 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">However, <em>Fleuti </em>was based in large part on the legislative history behind 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13), which the Court held evidenced an intent to \u201cameliorate the severe effects of the strict \u2018entry\u2019 doctrine.\u201d 374 U.S. at 462, 83 S.Ct. 1804. Chow\u2019s case is based on the interpretation of the term \u201cdeparture,\u201d not the term \u201centry,\u201d and the statute from which 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.4 draws its authority, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(c), possesses no parallel legislative history. Absent congressional intent on the matter, we may not extend the <em>Fleuti </em>exception to cases to which its rationale does not apply. Because Chow was subject to a pending deportation order, as would be all aliens whose appeals are withdrawn pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.4, a finding that his appeal was withdrawn because he left the country is not one of the \u201cmeaningless and irrational hazards\u201d that concerned the Court in <em>Fleuti. </em>374 U.S. at 460, 83 S.Ct. 1804; <em>Aleman-Fiero v. INS, </em>481 F.2d 601 (5th Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">Further, the procedure used by the INS when it found Chow\u2019s appeal to be withdrawn did not violate his procedural due process rights. <em>See Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976). While the interest asserted by Chow is substantial, it is insufficient to overcome the presumption in favor of the constitutionality of immigration regulations. <em>See Pazcoguin v. Radcliffe, </em>292 F.3d 1209, 1218 (9th Cir.2002). The written notice afforded Chow was sufficient, given that even \u201cnotice published in the Federal Register ... [is] more than ample to satisfy any due process concerns.\u201d <em>Lyng v. Payne, </em>476 U.S. 926, 942, 106 S.Ct. 2333, 90 L.Ed.2d 921 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-11\">\n<em>Petitioner\u2019s Motion to Remand is denied.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b760-12\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b760-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
