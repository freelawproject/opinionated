We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The \u2019998 patent is directed to a controlled ejection method for injection molding. Claims 1 and 2 provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-7\">1.

A method according to claim 1, wherein step (f) comprises the step of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-15\">(g) Transporting the ejected product through the guide conduit at an orientation directed by the contours of the guide conduit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-16\">\u2019998 patent, col. 5, 1. 27-col. 6, 1. 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-17\">Defendant Kraus Maffei Corp. manufactures and sells an injection molding machine with a mold set (\u201cCD-94 mold\u201d) designed to manufacture an optical disc. The other defendants use that machine to manufacture CDs and DVDs. The district court described in its opinion the composition and operation of the CD-94 mold, and none of the parties raises any disputed issues of material fact regarding the district court\u2019s description of the device used to perform the accused process.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-18\">The primary dispute in this case focuses on the construction of the term \u201cguide conduit\u201d found in limitation (d) of claim 1. In such cases, \u201c[w]here the parties do not dispute any relevant facts regarding the accused product ... but disagree over possible claim interpretations, the question of literal infringement collapses into claim construction and is amenable to summary judgment.\u201d <em>General Mills, Inc. v. Hunt-Wesson, Inc., </em>103 F.3d 978, 983 (Fed.Cir.1997) (citing <em>Athletic Alternatives, Inc. v. Prince Mfg., Inc., </em>73 F.3d 1573, 1578 (Fed.Cir.1996)). In its claim construction ruling, the district held that the \u201csubstantially enclosed guide conduit\u201d is \u201ca tube or channel that is almost entirely closed in from the outside environment, and that carries materials from one place to another and that helps to direct the materials\u2019 progressive motion.\u201d The district court later clarified its claim construction, holding that \u201cthe guide conduit itself nevertheless must help to carry and direct the molded product\u2019s progressive motion.\u201d Based on that modified construction, the district court granted defendants\u2019 motions for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>judgment of non-infringement, concluding that the guide rails, kicker plate, and discharge chute of the CD-94 mold do not comprise a guide conduit as construed by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">We hold that the district court erred in its interpretation of guide conduit. A review of the claim language, written description, and prosecution history show that a guide conduit is simply a passageway through which a plastic product is moved. The plain language of the claims describes the guide conduit as an area within the mold. The district court\u2019s definition attributes a function to the guide conduit, namely that it direct the material\u2019s motion. That is an added limitation not found in the claim language or properly imposed by the intrinsic record.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Even though the district court unduly narrowed the guide conduit limitation, summary judgment of non-infringement is nonetheless appropriate in this case because under the correct claim construction, the CD-94 mold still does not have a guide conduit as defined by the claims. <em>See Zelinski v. Brunswick Corp., </em>185 F.3d 1311, 1316 (Fed.Cir.1999) (affirming grant of summary judgment of non-infringement despite district court\u2019s unduly narrow claim construction). Because the CD-94 mold lacks a guide conduit, the defendant manufacturers and users of the CD-94 mold do not practice the claimed method of injection molding. To the extent that there is a passageway through which a plastic product is moved, that passageway is not formed by \u201c[separating the two mold parts\u201d as required by the claims. The cavity created by the separation of the mold parts is not a guide conduit. Part (e) of claim 1 requires that the plastic product be ejected \u201cinto said guide conduit.\u201d The plastic product is already in the cavity upon separation. Moreover, the guide conduit must \u201clead[] in a direction substantially perpendicular to said predetermined direction.\u201d The cavity created by separating the two mold parts in the device used in the accused process only leads in a direction <em>parallel </em>to the predetermined direction. It is not until the product begins moving in a perpendicular direction that it enters the guide conduit. In the CD-94 mold, the plastic product moves perpendicularly into a discharge chute with the assistance of the guide rails. Neither the guide rails nor the discharge chute are created by the separation of the mold parts. Thus, use of the CD-94 mold does not involve a guide conduit as described in the method claim, and no reasonable juror could conclude otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">With respect to infringement under the doctrine of equivalents, the parties dispute whether the amendment to claim 1 constituted a narrowing amendment and triggered prosecution history estoppel. The original claims did not require that the guide conduit be \u201csubstantially enclosed.\u201d Specifically, the relevant June 10, 1983 amendment to claim 1 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-8\">(d) Separating the two mold parts by moving, in a direction opposite to the predetermined direction, said mold parts in relation to each other <em>to create a substantially enclosed guide conduit having contours defined by the regions of the parting surface and the internally positional cavity/ies that are exposed subsequent to separation and leading in a direction substantially perpendicular to said predetermined direction;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-9\">(e) Ejecting the plastic product into [a] <em>said </em>guide conduit [which leads in a direction substantially perpendicular to said predetermined direction]; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-10\">(f) Transporting the ejected product through the guide conduit[, the contours of said conduit, substantially being defined by regions of the parting surface and the internally positioned cavity/ies, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>which are exposed subsequent to separation].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">We agree with the district court that this is a narrowing amendment. The original claim did not require that the guide conduit be substantially enclosed. TurnKey admits that the amendment narrowed the claim in that respect, but argues that the claim was broadened because the amended claim removed a limitation that substantially all of the contours of the guide conduit be defined by regions of the parting and cavity surfaces. We disagree. There is little meaningful difference between the language \u201cthe contours of said guide conduit <em>substantially being </em>defined by the regions of the parting surface ...\u201d and \u201ca substantially enclosed guide conduit <em>having </em>contours defined by the regions of the parting surface____\u201d Regardless whether the claim was broadened in any way, the claim was narrowed with respect to the new requirement that the guide conduit be substantially enclosed. Prosecution history estoppel was triggered with respect to that limitation. <em>See generally Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co., 535 </em>U.S. 722, 737-40, 122 S.Ct. 1831, 152 L.Ed.2d 944 (2002) (noting that narrowing amendments may give rise to a rebuttable presumption of prosecution history estoppel) (citing <em>Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chem. Co., </em>520 U.S. 17, 33, 117 S.Ct. 1040, 137 L.Ed.2d 146 (1997)). Other than arguing that the claim was not in fact narrowed, Turn-Key did not present any argument to this court that it overcame any presumption of surrender.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">Even if Turn-Key could rebut any presumption of surrender, no reasonable juror could conclude that the accused CD-94 mold operates in the same <em>way </em>as the claimed invention. The claims require that the mold parts separate to create a substantially enclosed guide conduit. While the use of guide rails and a discharge chute may perform the same function and achieve the same result as the claimed process, they do so in a different way. Because the way in which the accused device operates is different from the method claimed, the differences are not insubstantial, the claims cannot be infringed under the doctrine of equivalents, and no reasonable juror could conclude otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">The district court misconstrued the term \u201cguide conduit.\u201d That error, however, was harmless because under the correct claim construction, the CD-94 mold lacks a guide conduit. Without a guide conduit, the defendant users and manufacturers of the CD-94 mold do not practice the claimed method. Therefore, summary judgment of non-infringement, both literally and under the doctrine of equivalents was appropriate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
