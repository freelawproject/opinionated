The plaintiff alleges that similarly situated white TA employees with arrest records retained their jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-21\">The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation concluding that summary judgment was appropriate. The court found that the plaintiff had not introduced any evidence showing that similarly situated employees who were not in protected categories had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>been treated differently from plaintiff. It, therefore, concluded that no evidence supported an inference of discrimination. Finally, the court found that plaintiff had not rebutted the defendant\u2019s legitimate, nondiseriminatory reason for terminating his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusions, and for substantially the reasons stated by it, we AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
