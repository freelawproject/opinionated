Furthermore, the district court did not err in refusing to hold a <em>Garcia </em><footnotemark>**</footnotemark> hearing. A <em>Garcia </em>hearing in Rogers\u2019s case was unnecessary given (1) that Rogers himself brought the alleged conflict to the court\u2019s attention in an effort to secure new appellate counsel with the intent of exercising his right to conflict-free representation and (2) that there was no \u201cactual conflict of interest.\u201d <em>See United States v. Greig, </em>967 F.2d 1018, 1022 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The grounds on which Rogers sought conflict-free representation do not constitute an \u201cactual conflict\u201d and are more properly characterized as claims of ineffective assistance, which as a general rule are not resolved on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Sanchez-Pena, </em>336 F.3d 431, 445 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Mitchell v. Maggio, </em>679 F.2d 77, 79 (5th Cir.1982). Consequently, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying his request. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b445-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
