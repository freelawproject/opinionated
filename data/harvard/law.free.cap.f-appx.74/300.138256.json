Anyah (Anyah) appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition challenging his removal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(a)(5)(A), which authorizes the removal, <em>in absentia, </em>of any alien who fails to attend a removal proceeding after being given notice thereof. He argues that his constitutional right to due process was violated because he was detained and ordered removed without proper notice and without the opportunity to be heard in his removal proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Contrary to the Government\u2019s assertions, we have jurisdiction over Anyah\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition because, as an alien who is removable for having committed an aggravated felony, he is precluded by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) from seeking direct judicial review, and his petition raises questions of law only. <em>See CalcanoMartinez v. INS, </em>533 U.S. 348, 351-52, 121 S.Ct. 2268, 150 L.Ed.2d 392 (2001); <em>INS V. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 314, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) properly sent the notices of Anyah\u2019s removal proceeding and hearing to the last address provided by him. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(a)(1); <em>United States v. Estrada-Trochez, </em>66 F.3d 733, 736 (5th Cir.1995). Anyah did not notify the INS of his change of address as required by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1305. <em>See Estrada-Trochez, </em>66 F.3d at 736. Moreover, Anyah has not demonstrated that he did not receive notice or that his failure to appear at his removal hearing was due to \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(5)(C). Accordingly, we conclude that Anyah was not denied due process of law and is not entitled to habeas relief. <em>See Estrada-Trochez, </em>66 F.3d at 736.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b326-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
