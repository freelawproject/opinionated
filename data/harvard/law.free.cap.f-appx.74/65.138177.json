Petitioner Francis Stewart (\u201cStewart\u201d) argues this conclusion was based on an erroneous factual premise: that he was represented by counsel during the 1960 proceeding. In a federal habeas action, the factual findings of the state court are presumed correct, and the petitioner has the burden of rebutting the presumption by clear and convincing evidence. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). The 1960 docket sheet shows Stewart did receive appointed counsel. Stewart claims otherwise, but his assertion, standing alone, is insufficient to meet the clear and convincing evidence standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>As for the admissibility of the misdemeanor conviction for operating a motor vehicle under the influence, we agree with the state appellate court\u2019s assessment that admission of the evidence would have been harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under the standard in <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967), given that evidence of four prior felony convictions also would have been available to impeach Stewart. As the trial court planned to admit the evidence in the event Stewart testified, it was clear Stewart only could prevent admission of the evidence by choosing not to testify. Thus, his attorney\u2019s advice to this effect was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">Ultimately, then, the advice Stewart received in the course of deciding whether to testify was correct. His ultimate waiver of his right to testify was knowingly made and was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Appellee\u2019s motion to strike is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\"><em>Affirmed. See </em>1st Cir. Loc. R. 27(c).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
