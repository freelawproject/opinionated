For the reasons discussed below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-19\">Adan first claims that the Board erred in affirming the decision of the immigration judge without opinion, after review by a single Board member, in accordance with the procedure set out in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7) (2003). We have reviewed Adan\u2019s challenges to the Board\u2019s use of this streamlined procedure and find them to be without merit. <em>See Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>335 F.3d 1009 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Georgis v. Ashcroft, </em>328 F.3d 962, 967 (7th Cir.2003); <em>Mendoza v. United States Attorney Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1288-89 (11th Cir.2003); <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 832-33 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Gonzalez-Oropeza v. United States Attorney Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1333-34 (11th Cir.2003); <em>Albathani v. INS, </em>318 F.3d 365, 375-79 (1st Cir.2003); <em>see also Khattak v. Ashcroft, </em>332 F.3d 250, 253 (4th Cir.2003) (rejecting a challenge to the Board\u2019s summary affirmance procedure on retroactivity grounds and concluding that \u201callowing summary opinions in clear cases is nothing more than a procedural change that does not affect substantive rights\u201d). We further find that summary affirmance was appropriate in this case under the factors set forth in \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-20\">Next, Adan challenges the immigration judge\u2019s finding that he failed to demonstrate that he suffered past persecution or that he possesses a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground. The decision to grant or deny asylum relief is conclusive \u201cunless manifestly contrary to the law and an abuse of discretion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(D) (2000). We conclude that the record supports the immigration judge\u2019s conclusion that Adan failed to establish his eligibility for asylum on a protected ground. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2003) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish his eligibility for asylum); <em>INS v. Elias</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number><em>Zacar\u00edas, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (holding that the alien must show \u201cthat the record compels the conclusion that he has a \u2018well-founded fear\u2019 that the guerrillas will persecute him <em>because of </em>[his] political opinion [or membership in a social group], rather than because of his refusal to fight with them\u201d) (emphasis in original). As the decision in this case is not manifestly contrary to law, we cannot grant the relief that Adan seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Additionally, we uphold the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Adan\u2019s application for withholding of removal. The standard for withholding of removal is more stringent than that for granting asylum. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th Cir.1999). To qualify for withholding of removal, an applicant must demonstrate \u201ca clear probability of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Cardozar-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). Because Adan fails to show that he is eligible for asylum, he cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
