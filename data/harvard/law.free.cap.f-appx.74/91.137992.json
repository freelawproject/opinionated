Griffith, who is currently incarcerated, challenges the constitutionality of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2215(a). The statute imposes criminal penalties upon individuals who employ juveniles as performers in pornographic productions. Mr. Griffith contends that the statute violates the First Amendment because it does not sufficiently provide for a defense that the juvenile at issue misrepresented herself or himself as an adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">The district court sua sponte dismissed the complaint on the ground that a federal court lacks jurisdiction to consider constitutional challenges in the absence of an actual case or controversy. Consistent with the district court\u2019s judgment, we conclude that the plaintiff has failed to \u201cproffer some objective evidence to substantiate his claim that the challenged conduct has deterred him [or those he purports to represent] from engaging in protected activity.\u201d <em>Bordell v. General Elec. Co., </em>922 F.2d 1057, 1061 (2d Cir.1991); <em>accord Nitke v. Ashcroft, </em>253 F.Supp.2d 587, 596 (S.D.N.Y.2003) (three-judge panel). Particularly in light of the discretionary nature of declaratory relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201(a), <em>see Farrell Lines Inc. v. Ceres Terminals Inc., </em>161 F.3d 115, 117 (2d Cir.1998) (per curiam), we therefore affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
