R.App. P. 34(a); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G).

Counsel for Mr. Boch filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967) and moved for leave to withdraw as counsel. Although Mr. Boch was afforded 30 days within which to raise any challenges to his conviction or his sentence, he failed to do so within the time period provided. Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we dismiss the appeal and grant counsel\u2019s request to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-24\">Mr. Boch was charged with a single count of illegal reentry. The government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>filed a notice of sentence enhancement based on Mr. Boch\u2019s having been convicted of three other felonies. I R. Doc. 2. Mr. Boch thereafter entered an unconditional guilty plea on the charged count and moved the district court to depart downward on the grounds of criminal history over-representation, pre-indictment rehabilitation, and exceptional circumstances. Over the government\u2019s opposition, the district court granted Mr. Boch\u2019s downward departure motion and sentenced him to a term of imprisonment of 72 months followed by 36 months of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">In his <em>Anders </em>brief, counsel for Mr. Boch states that after reviewing the record and completing the necessary legal research, he \u201ccannot find any reasonable grounds for appeal.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 3. The certification of service indicates that Mr. Boch was served with a copy of the brief and motion to withdraw; he has not responded. <em>See </em>10th Cir. R. 46.4(B)(2). In <em>Anders, </em>the Supreme Court held that if appointed counsel \u201cfinds his case to be wholly frivolous, after a conscientious examination of it, he should so advise the court and request permission to withdraw.\u201d 386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396. Where counsel has filed an <em>Anders </em>brief, we must conduct a \u201cfull examination of all the proceedings\u201d to determine if the appeal is \u201cwholly frivolous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If we concur in counsel\u2019s evaluation of the case, we may grant the request to withdraw and dismiss the appeal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">After a thorough review of the record we conclude there are no meritorious issues for appeal. As to Mr. Boch\u2019s conviction, we note at the outset that because a defendant who pleads guilty waives all non-jurisdictional challenges to his conviction, his \u201conly avenue for challenging his conviction is to claim that he did not voluntarily or intelligently enter his plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Wright, </em>43 F.3d 491, 494 (10th Cir.1994) (citing <em>Mabry v. Johnson, </em>467 U.S. 504, 508-09, 104 S.Ct. 2543, 81 L.Ed.2d 437 (1984)). However, Mr. Boch has not argued that his plea was involuntary or unknowing, and nothing in the record suggests that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">As to the validity of his sentence, the record reveals that the sentence imposed was within the applicable guideline range, that the guideline range was correctly determined, <em>see United States v. Soto-Ornelas, </em>312 F.3d 1167, 1171 (10th Cir.2002) (holding that the district court is not limited to considering only the conviction immediately preceding deportation), and that the district court did not exceed the statutory maximum sentence for the offense of conviction. In fact, in light of the district court\u2019s downward departure, Mr. Boch received a significantly lighter sentence than he might have otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">Accordingly, we DISMISS the appeal and GRANT counsel\u2019s request to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b892-25\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrin\u00e9s of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
