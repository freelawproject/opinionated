We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(a). Reviewing de novo, <em>Alvarado v. Hill, </em>252 F.3d 1066, 1068 (9th Cir.2001), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-13\">Lewis contends that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance because she incorrectly believed that under Arizona law, the state was required to disprove Lewis\u2019s defense of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See </em>Ariz.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 13-205(A) (providing that the burden is on the defendant to prove self-defense by a preponderance). The Arizona Court of Appeals rejected this claim, reasoning that although counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, Lewis had not shown prejudice. This state court decision was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Early v. Packer, </em>537 U.S. 3, 123 S.Ct. 362, 365-66, 154 L.Ed.2d 263 (2002) (per curiam); <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) (holding that ineffective assistance of counsel occurs when there is deficient performance and prejudice, which \u201cis a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different\u201d). Thus, the district court properly denied Lewis\u2019s petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b738-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b738-16\">.
