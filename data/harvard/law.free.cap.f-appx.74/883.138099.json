R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This case is therefore submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">Petitioner C. Eli-Jah Hakeem Muhammad, a prisoner appearing pro se, appeals the dismissal of his habeas corpus action challenging a prison disciplinary conviction. He contends that the prison disciplinary proceeding violated his substantive and procedural due process rights, as well as various Bureau of Prison program statements. The district court dismissed. We review the case de novo, construing petitioner\u2019s claims liberally on account of his lack of legal counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">The district court reviewed each of petitioner\u2019s claims, and stated and applied the correct legal standards. See <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 563-66, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974); <em>Superintendent v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 454, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985). We have reviewed petitioner\u2019s arguments and record submissions on appeal, and affirm for the reasons stated by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">Petitioner\u2019s motion for leave to proceed without prepayment of costs or fees is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b909-26\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
