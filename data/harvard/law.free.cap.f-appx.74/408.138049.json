He argues that the district court erred in denying an offense level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. However, the district court provided several reasons supporting its doubt of McFadden\u2019s true acceptance of responsibility.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Giving great deference to the district court\u2019s decision to deny sentencing leniency under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b435-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
