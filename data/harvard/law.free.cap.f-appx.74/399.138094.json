The district court sentenced him to 188 months in prison and a five-year term of supervised release and ordered him to pay a fine. Following a direct appeal and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, Beltran filed a motion seeking modification of his fine. The instant appeal challenges the district court\u2019s denial of this motion. The propriety of Beltran\u2019s fine is not cognizable under any postconviction motion. The district court thus lacked jurisdiction to consider the motion. <em>See United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 141 (5th Cir.1994). Because the district court was without jurisdiction to consider the motion, the district court\u2019s denial of the motion is AFFIRMED on the alternate basis of lack of jurisdiction. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b426-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
