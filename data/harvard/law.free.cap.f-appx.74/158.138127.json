The Government filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">On May 5, 2003, the Supreme Court granted a writ of certiorari, vacated our opinion and judgment and remanded the case to us for further consideration in light of <em>Demore v. Kim, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 123 S.Ct. 1708, 155 L.Ed.2d 724 (2003). In <em>Demore, </em>the Court majority rejected the criminal alien\u2019s challenge to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226(c) and concluded that \u201c[djetention during removal proceedings is a constitutionally permissible part of the process.\u201d We then asked counsel to provide us with their suggested dispositions in light of the above.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">Counsel for the Government argued that we should vacate our decision and remand the case to the District Court with instructions to dismiss the case. Counsel for Radoncic also suggested that we remand the case to the District Court for further consideration \u201cbecause some of the facts deemed critical in <em>Demore v. Kim </em>are absent from this case and this case has facts and circumstances not considered by the Supreme Court in <em>Demore v. Kim.\u201d </em>We believe the arguments of the parties should be addressed by the District Court in the first instance. We will therefore vacate our prior opinion and judgment and remand this case to the District Court for its reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">For the reasons set forth above, we will vacate our prior opinion and judgment and remand this case to the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
