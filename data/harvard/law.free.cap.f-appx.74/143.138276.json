The complaint alleges that the defendants unlawfully discriminated against Thompson on the basis her race, gender, and national origin in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981, and New York State Executive Law \u00a7 296. In particular, the complaint asserts that the defendants discriminated against Thompson by failing to interview her for an open position in the department, failing to promote her to that position, and retaliating against her for filing an employment discrimination claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-21\">On October 5, 2001, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. In a careful and comprehensive, 79-page opinion, the District Court analyzed the evidence presented by Thompson in support of each of her claims and concluded that no genuine issues of material fact existed. The District Court therefore granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-22\">For substantially the reasons stated by the District Court, we agree that the defendants are entitled to summary judgment. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court granting the defendants\u2019 motion and dismissing Thompson\u2019s complaint is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
