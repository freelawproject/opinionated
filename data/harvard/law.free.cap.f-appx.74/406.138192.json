Williams, Texas inmate # 1103979, proceeding <em>pro se </em>and <em>informa pauperis </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d), appeals the district court\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e) dismissal as frivolous and for failure to state a claim of his complaint filed pursuant to <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, </em>403 U.S. 388, 389, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). Williams sought damages for the defendants\u2019 alleged conspiracy, perjury, unlawful search, prosecutorial misconduct, and selective prosecution that resulted in Williams\u2019 criminal indictment and conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-20\">Williams contends that he is not challenging his conviction and that his claims are not barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). In addition, he asserts that the district court should have allowed him to amend his complaint prior to dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-21\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s dismissal of an IEP complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 734 (5th Cir.1998). In our review, we consider that all of the plaintiffs factual allegations are true, and we uphold the dismissal only if it appears that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations. <em>Bradley v. Puckett, </em>157 F.3d 1022, 1025 (5th Cir.1998). We review a dismissal of a complaint as frivolous for an abuse of discretion. <em>Black, </em>134 F.3d at 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-22\">As the district court determined, resolution of Williams\u2019 claims would necessarily imply the invalidity of Williams\u2019 conviction, and <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, mandates dismissal because no cause of action accrues unless and until Williams can show that he has had his conviction reversed, expunged, declared invalid, or otherwise called into question by a writ of habeas corpus, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>See Stephenson v. Reno, </em>28 F.3d 26, 27-28 (5th Cir.1994). Because Williams\u2019 cause of action has not yet accrued, the district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing his complaint without amendment and further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>clarification. <em>Eason v. Thaler, </em>14 F.3d 8, 9-10 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">Williams\u2019 appeal is without arguable merit, is frivolous and is DISMISSED. 5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). The dismissal of this appeal and the district court\u2019s dismissal of Williams\u2019 complaint count as strikes under the Prison Litigation Reform Act. <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Williams is WARNED that if he accumulates three \u201cstrikes\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) he will not be able to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED, SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b432-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
