We have reviewed the administrative record and find that substantial evidence supports the conclusion of the IJ and the Board that Mbeng failed to establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution in a protected category, as necessary to qualify for relief from deportation. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4) (1994); <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b) (2002). Thus, the record supports the Board\u2019s conclusion that Mbeng failed to establish her eligibility for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-23\">Additionally, we uphold the Board\u2019s denial of Mbeng\u2019s application for withholding of deportation. The standard for receiving withholding of deportation is \u201cmore stringent than that for asylum eligibility.\u201d <em>Chen v. U.S. I.N.S., </em>195 F.3d 198, 205 (4th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>Cir.1999). An applicant for withholding must demonstrate a clear probability of persecution. <em>I.N.S. v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 430, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987). As Mbeng has failed to establish refugee status, she cannot satisfy the higher standard for withholding of deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Finally, we conclude that the Board did not err in denying Mbeng\u2019s motion to remand, as her eligibility under the diversity visa program has expired. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154(a)(l)(G)(ii)(II) (2000); <em>Nyaga v. Ashcroft, </em>323 F.3d 906, 914-15 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">We accordingly deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal arguments are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b281-16\"> We note that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(4) was repealed by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), Pub.L. No. 104-128, 110 Stat. 3009 (IIR-IRA), effective April 1, 1997. Because this case was in transition at the time the IIRIRA was passed, \u00a7 1105a(a)(4) is applicable here under the terms of the transitional rules contained in \u00a7 309(c) of the IIRIRA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
