He argues that he has raised a valid equal-protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>claim, that the district court erred in substituting Janie Cockrell for the defendants originally named in his complaint, and that the district court should have enforced this court\u2019s prior order that Cockrell bear part of the costs associated with his initial appeal. He also moves this court for the appointment of counsel; to issue a show cause order that directs Cockrell to pay the appellate costs she owes him; and to reconsider our prior dismissal of Cockrell\u2019s appeal, which was dismissed upon her motion. Cockrell moves this court to vacate that part of the district court\u2019s judgment relating to Taylor\u2019s claim under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act (\u201cRLUIPA\u201d). Several of Taylor\u2019s former fellow inmates move this court for leave to intervene in the suit, to certify it as a class action, and to join as plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Taylor has not briefed that portion of the district court\u2019s judgment holding that his claim for monetary damages was barred by Eleventh Amendment immunity. Accordingly, this issue is waived. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Taylor does, however, argue that the district court erred in dismissing his claim for injunctive relief because he has raised a valid claim that the grooming policy had a disparate impact upon Muslims. This argument is unavailing. Taylor\u2019s recent release from prison moots his claims for injunctive relief. <em>See Rocky v. King, </em>900 F.2d 864, 867 (5th Cir.1990). Accordingly, Taylor\u2019s appeal from the district court\u2019s dismissal of his equal-protection claim for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted is DISMISSED AS MOOT. Taylor\u2019s motion for a show cause order is DENIED because the defendant asserts that she is taking reasonable steps to comply with this court\u2019s order concerning appellate costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">\u201cIf a claim becomes moot after the entry of a district court\u2019s judgment and prior to the completion of appellate review, we generally vacate the judgment and remand for dismissal.\u201d <em>Murphy v. Fort Worth Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>334 F.3d 470, 471 (5th Cir.2003). That is the scenario presented by the instant case in relation to Taylor\u2019s RLUIPA claim. Accordingly, we GRANT Cockrell\u2019s motion, VACATE the district court\u2019s Memorandum Order and Injunction relating to Taylor\u2019s RLUIPA claim, and REMAND this case to the district court for the sole purpose of dismissal of Taylor\u2019s RLUIPA claim. Because Taylor\u2019s appeal is moot, all other outstanding motions are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b395-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
