For the reasons that follow, we will affirm the judgments of conviction as to each appellant, but will remand for resentencing of Hoffner, Sr., and Michael Hoffner.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-14\">As we write solely for the parties, we will recite only those facts relevant to the issues before us. In August 1999, Bennett and the Hoffners, along with eight others, were indicted for conspiring to distribute methamphetamine and related offenses. Count One charged all three appellants with conspiracy and aiding and abetting; Counts Twelve and Seventeen charged Hoffner, Sr., with using a telephone in furtherance of the drug offense; and Count Eighteen charged Hoffner, Sr., and Michael Hoffner with using a telephone in furtherance of the drug offense. All three appellants pled not guilty and proceeded to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"ANR\">During jury selection, the defendants collectively used nine of their ten allotted peremptory strikes against African-Americans.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The government challenged these strikes under <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), on the ground that the venirepeople were being stricken because of their race. The District Court denied all of the government\u2019s challenges but one, regarding an African-American venirewoman who was doing a crossword puzzle during voir dire. Regarding that venirewoman, the defendants explained that they wanted to strike the woman because her doing a crossword puzzle indicated that she was \u201canalytical\u201d and would be more susceptible to the government\u2019s argument that the pieces of evidence, including numerous audio and video tapes, fit together like a puzzle. 37-38a. The government responded that the crossword puzzle was just like a book, and that the Court had instructed the jurors to feel free to take out books while they waited. 38a.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-17\">The Court accepted the government\u2019s position that the defense was using its peremptory in a racially discriminatory manner, explaining, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any basis whatsoever for striking for the reasons set forth by defense counsel,\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>stating that it found the given explanation \u201cfarcical,\u201d and believed that the woman was being stricken because of her race. 39a. The Court then seated the juror, allowing the defendants to use the peremptory strike against another venire person. 42a. In her opening remarks, the prosecutor analogized the case to a puzzle. Bennett then filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the <em>Batson </em>Ruling, arguing that the prosecution had made the exact \u201cpuzzle\u201d argument to which they had feared the crossword puzzle juror would be susceptible. 48a. The Court denied the motion, and \u201creiterate[d] its findings that the effort of all defendants, all Caucasian, to strike [the crossword puzzle juror], an African-American female, was based on her race and that the reason given for striking her was a pretext.\u201d The Court then noted \u201cthat the lead prosecutor is an African-American female.\u201d 50a.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">During trial, the government presented audio tapes of intercepted telephone calls, video surveillance tapes, testimony from Joseph Sinni, a cooperating witness who had been party to the conspiracy, regarding the participation of both Hoffners, and expert testimony from Narcotics Agent Kenneth Beilis regarding drug jargon. The jury convicted Bennett of all charges, Hoffner, Sr., of Counts One, Seventeen, and Eighteen, and Michael Hoffner of Counts One and Eighteen, and acquitted Hoffner, Sr., on Count Twelve. (Verdict Sheet, 10a-13a)</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">At sentencing, the District Court found that 12.6 kilograms of methamphetamine was attributable to Hoffner, Sr., and imposed a sentence of 264 months imprisonment, which term fell in the middle of the applicable guideline range. The Court then entered judgment against Hoffner, Sr., on Counts One and Eighteen, but did not enter any judgment on Counts Twelve and Seventeen. Regarding Michael Hoffner, the Court found that his base offense level was 32, which carries a guideline range of 135-168 months. However, the Court sentenced Michael to a term of imprisonment of 20 years, based on the Court\u2019s understanding that Michael had previously been convicted of a felony drug offense and that it was therefore required to impose a 20 year mandatory minimum. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">All three defendants appeal the Court\u2019s ruling that their use of the peremptory challenge against the crossword puzzler was based on the venirewoman\u2019s race, and the Court\u2019s admission of certain testimony by Agent Beilis regarding drug jargon and his evaluation of certain government witnesses. The Hoffners further claim that Agent Beilis should not have been allowed to testify as to why the government did not have more intercepted phone calls regarding the alleged drug conspiracy, that testimony regarding the manufacture of methamphetamine was improperly admitted because it involved events occurring outside the scope of the charged conspiracy, that the government committed misconduct when it referred to the \u201cHoffner family business\u201d in its closing remarks, and that there was insufficient evidence that Michael knew of the purpose of the conspiracy or that Hoffner, Sr., and Michael\u2019s use of the telephone as charged in Count Eighteen was in furtherance of the conspiracy. Hoffner, Sr., challenges his sentence on the grounds that the Court impermissibly imposed a \u201cgeneral\u201d sentence, rather than sentencing him on each count, that the Court\u2019s calculation of 12.6 kilograms was clearly erroneous, and that the Court did not provide any reason for sentencing him in the middle of the guideline range. Finally, Michael Hoffner challenges the enhancement of his sentence on the ground that the conviction that formed the basis for his enhanced sentence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>not final as of the date of the charged conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231, and we exercise jurisdiction over the Court\u2019s final orders under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Although the Court neglected to enter a final judgment as to Hoffner, Sr., on Counts Twelve and Seventeen, the jury clearly returned a verdict of \u201cnot guilty\u201d on Count Twelve (12a) and \u201cguilty\u201d on Count Seventeen (12a). Therefore, we need not dismiss his appeal for lack of jurisdiction, because, while entry of judgment on both is obligatory, the District Court may easily remedy the defect. <em>United States v. Stallings, </em>810 F.2d 973, 975 (10th Cir.1987); Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(d)(1). We will therefore direct the Court to enter judgment on Counts Twelve and Seventeen and will proceed with this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">I. Alleged Trial Errors</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">We begin with the <em>Batson </em>issue. <em>Bat-son </em>prohibits the use of peremptory strikes in a racially discriminatory manner. <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 95. An evaluation under <em>Batson </em>involves the familiar three-step burden shifting rules: first, the challenger must make out a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination; second, the one exercising the strike must present a race-neutral explanation; finally, the challenger bears the \u201cultimate burden\u201d of proving that the reason given is a pretext and that the discrimination was intentional. <em>Id. </em>at 93-94, <em>&amp; </em>n.18. Here, the defendants concede that the government made out a prima facie case, and the government concedes that the defendants presented a race-neutral explanation. The question then is whether the District Court erred in finding, at Step Three, that the defendants engaged in intentional discrimination in striking the crossword puzzle venirewoman.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">We review the Court\u2019s factual finding that the defendants\u2019 explanation for why they struck the crossword puzzle venirewoman was a pretext for intentional discrimination for clear error. <em>United States v. Uwaezhoke, </em>995 F.2d 388, 394 (3d Cir.1993). Under the clear error standard, \u201c[w]e must accept the factual determination of the district court unless that determination \u2018either (1) is completely devoid of minimum evidentiary support displaying some hue of credibility, or (2) bears no rational relationship to the supportive evidentiary data.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Haines v. Liggett Group, Inc., </em>975 F.2d 81, 92 (3d Cir.1992)). We owe great deference to the Court\u2019s <em>Batson </em>findings, as the District Court was in the best position to evaluate the credibility of the attorneys. <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 98 n. 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">Under this deferential standard, we find no error. In making its final determination, the Court was entitled to \u201cdisbelieve a silly or superstitious reason.\u201d <em>Purkett v. Elem, </em>514 U.S. 765, 768, 115 S.Ct. 1769, 131 L.Ed.2d 834 (1995) (explaining that in the <em>Batson </em>context \u201cimplausible or fantastic justifications may (and probably will) be found to be pretexts for purposeful discrimination\u201d). The Court\u2019s belief that the crossword puzzle reason was unworthy of credence, combined with the strong prima facie showing of discrimination, which was based on the fact that the defendants had used all but one of their strikes against African-Americans and the prosecutor was herself African-American, fortifies our view that the Court\u2019s finding was not clearly erroneous. <em>See St. Mary\u2019s Honor Center v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 511, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993) (\u201cThe factfinder\u2019s disbelief of the reasons put forward by the defendant (particularly if disbelief is accompanied by a suspicion of mendacity) may, together with the elements of the prima facie case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>suffice to show intentional discrimination.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">We will next address the defendants\u2019 challenges to the Court\u2019s evidentiary rulings. First, regarding Agent Beilis, who testified as an expert in \u201cdrug jargon,\u201d the defendants contend that the District Court erred in allowing Agent Beilis to interpret the meaning of the words \u201cbreakfast\u201d and \u201clunch\u201d and other statements uttered by the defendants at various points during intercepted phone conversations. Agent Beilis testified that a number of these statements were coded references to drug activity. The defendants argue that the Court\u2019s admission of this testimony violated Federal Rule of Evidence 702 because the testimony was not helpful to the jury and Rule 704(b) because the testimony went to the ultimate issue of the defendants\u2019 intent to engage in a conspiracy. The defendants objected to Agent Beilis\u2019s testimony under Rule 702, therefore we review the District Court\u2019s admission under that rule for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Gibbs, </em>190 F.3d 188, 211 (3d Cir.1999). However, the defendants did not object under Rule 704(b), therefore we review the Court\u2019s admission under that rule for plain error. <em>United States v. Boone, </em>279 F.3d 163, 173 &amp; 174 n. 6 (3d Cir.2002). Under either standard, we will only reverse if the error affected a \u201csubstantial right\u201d of the defendants. Fed. R.Evid. 103(a), (d); <em>Gibbs, </em>190 F.3d at 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">We find no reversible error. Although it may be a close question as to whether, in the instances highlighted by appellants, Agent Beilis\u2019s testimony crossed the line into \u201cunhelpful\u201d testimony about ordinary terms, or went to the ultimate issue of intent, given the other evidence of guilt, including the testimony of corroborating witnesses and the Agent\u2019s unquestionably permissible statements, any possible error here was harmless, as we find it \u201chighly probable that the error did not contribute to the judgment.\u201d <em>Gibbs, </em>190 F.3d at 213 n. 16 (quoting <em>United States v. Mastrangelo, </em>172 F.3d 288, 297 (3d Cir.1999)).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">The defendants further contend that Beilis impermissibly vouched for the credibility of government witnesses. In response to a cross-examination about the potential for government witnesses to lie, Beilis was asked on redirect to explain the precautions that he takes when interviewing witnesses to determine whether or not they might be lying. The defendants did not object to this line of questioning, therefore we review for plain error, and find none. Contrary to the defendants\u2019 contention, Beilis did not impermissibly \u201cassure the jury that the testimony of a Government witness [wa]s credible.\u201d <em>Lam v. Kelchner, </em>304 F.3d 256, 271 (3d Cir.2002). Rather, Beilis simply explained the kind of investigative techniques he used in evaluating a government witness in response to insinuations made by the questioning in cross-examination. The Court did not err in allowing the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-9\">The Hoffners also claim that the District Court erred in allowing Agent Beilis to testify as to why the government was only able to present four drug-related telephone calls between Michael Hoffner and Hoffner, Sr. In response to the defendants\u2019 argument that the government\u2019s case was weak because it included only a handful of calls between the Hoffners, Beilis testified that the reason the government could not present any more calls was because the two used \u201cNextel-to-Nextel\u201d communications, which the government was unable to intercept. As no objection was made at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>trial, we review for plain error, and again find none. The inaudible Nextel calls were not themselves admitted into evidence, nor was there any suggestion by the government that those calls involved drug activity. Rather, Beilis simply explained why they did not have more calls to present without making any intimations as to the content of the calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Next, the Hoffners claim that the Court committed plain error in admitting evidence regarding their efforts to acquire the ingredients for manufacturing methamphetamine during the summer or fall of 1999 because such activity fell outside the scope of the conspiracy. This contention is without merit, as such evidence was relevant to the charge of conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine from \u201cin or about August 1998 to <em>on or about </em>June 1999.\u201d (75a) \u201cWhere \u2018on or about\u2019 language is used, the government is not required to prove the exact dates, if a date reasonably near is established.\u201d <em>United States v. Nersesian, </em>824 F.2d 1294, 1323 (2d Cir.1987) (\u201cIn our view, the government\u2019s argument that the date of the actual transaction was possibly July or early August was not an improper material variance from the \u2018on or about June 1984\u2019 date charged in the indictment.\u201d). Our decision in <em>United States v. </em>Boyd, 595 F.2d 120, 125 (3d Cir.1978), in which we held that evidence falling two months outside the exact dates of the indictment was inadmissible, is not to the contrary, as in <em>Boyd </em>the government conceded that the evidence was not offered as part of the conspiracy but rather to establish a predisposition to deal in drugs and the modus operandi.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The final evidentiary error raised by the Hoffners involves the prosecutor\u2019s use of a purported \u201cguilt by familial association\u201d argument in closing. Again, as there was no objection at trial, we review for plain error. We have refused to allow a conviction based on a person\u2019s familial relationships. <em>See Gambino v. Morris, </em>134 F.3d 156, 162 (3d Cir.1998). Here, however, there was clear evidence of Michael\u2019s participation in the conspiracy completely outside his relationship with his father. The prosecutor\u2019s reference to the \u201cHoffner family business\u201d was a permissible characterization of the facts before the jury, which included evidence that Hoffner, Sr., his son, Thomas Hoffner, Jr., and his other son, Michael, were all involved in the distribution of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">Finally, the Hoffners claim that there was insufficient evidence to allow the jury to find that Michael knew of the purpose of the conspiracy or that the telephone conversation between Michael and Hoffner, Sr., on April 20, 1999, that formed the basis for Count Seventeen, facilitated the conspiracy. The Hoffners\u2019 contentions are without merit. Viewing the evidence, as we must, in the light most favorable to the verdict, <em>United States v. Dent, </em>149 F.3d 180, 187 (3d Cir.1998), the jury could have believed Sinni\u2019s testimony that Michael provided Sinni with methamphetamine when Hoffner, Sr., was not available. The jury could have also found credible Sinni\u2019s testimony that he met with Hoffner, Sr., at the time and place discussed in Hoffners\u2019 telephone call and gave Hoffner, Sr., money for the meth in a plastic bag. Coupled with the videotape showing Hoffner, Sr., and Michael then meeting at another location, which was also discussed in the phone call, and passing a plastic bag between them, the evidence before the jury was enough for it to find that the phone call had facilitated the conspiracy. Given our deferential standard of review, we cannot overturn the jury verdict based on the fact that Sinni was \u201can admitted drug dealer and \u2018weekend\u2019 cocaine user,\u201d App. Br. at 26, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>rather must credit the jury\u2019s apparent finding that Sinni was a credible witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">Therefore, because we find that the District Court did not commit any reversible trial errors, we will affirm the judgments of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">II. Sentencing Errors</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">We find, however, that the District Court did commit a number of errors during sentencing of the Hoffners, and we will therefore vacate their sentences and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Regarding the enhancement of Michael\u2019s sentence for a \u201cprior\u201d felony drug conviction under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), the government concedes that Michael\u2019s conviction under New Jersey law for possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute was not final until after the instant conspiracy had ended, and that the enhancement therefore cannot apply. <em>See United States v. Vasquez, </em>298 F.3d 354, 359 (5th Cir.2002). The proper range for Michael\u2019s sentence would appear to be 135 to 168 months imprisonment, unless an adjustment is warranted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">We will also vacate Hoffner, Sr\u2019s, sentence and remand for resentencing, as we find that the District Court clearly erred in not providing a specific sentence on each count, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2, not providing a reason for imposing a sentence above the bottom of the guideline range, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1), overstating the 1.1 kilograms distributed by Thomas Hoffner, Jr., by 1.5 kilograms, and relying on estimates of methamphetamine amounts without \u201carticulat[ing] an adequate evidentiary basis for selecting the middle value of the two estimates, as opposed to selecting the low end of the range.\u201d <em>United States v. Medford, </em>194 F.3d 419, 424 (3d Cir.1999). Although these errors may not have put Hoffner, Sr., in a different guideline range, we cannot say that \u201cthe error did not affect the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed,\u201d <em>United States v. Thayer, </em>201 F.3d 214, 229 (3d Cir.1999), and will therefore remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-12\">In accordance with the above opinion, we will direct the District Court to enter judgment on Counts Twelve and Seventeen, will affirm all judgments of conviction, and will vacate Hoffner, Sr., and Michael Hoffner\u2019s sentences and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b229-18\">. One African-American was seated without interference.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b232-6\">. Because we find that the Court did not err, we leave for another day the question of whether an erroneous grant of a <em>Batson </em>challenge automatically results in reversal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b234-9\">. As the Court did not consider Michael\u2019s request for a minor role adjustment due to its application of the 20-year mandatory sentence, it may do so on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
