In this case ejectment was brought to recover a strip of land lying between and adjoining two parcels to which defendant had title. Both parties claimed title from a common source. The plaintiff's title was of record. The deeds constituting defendant\u2019s chain of title described the land conveyed by metes and bounds, excluding the intervening strip in controversy. The defendant resisted the recovery solely upon the ground that the original owner, the common source of title, had declared he had no remaining interest in the land, and that the defendant was the owner thereof, insisting that thereby he and his grantees were estopped from afterwards asserting title. But there was held to be no estoppel.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b456-6\" pgmap=\"456\">10.

The defendant resists the plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery solely upon the ground of certain declarations of Ellis, which, he contends, operate to estop him and his grantees from claiming title to the premises in controversy. The following testimony will show the grounds of the alleged estoppel:</summary><summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-9\" pgmap=\"457(91) 458(145)\">Mrs. Johnson, a daughter of Samuel Ellis, testified: Am acquainted with tract called Cottage Grove Tract. My father first moved on it in 1832. He moved on that part now owned by Graves, in 1835 or 1836. I remember the time. Lived there two or three years. The first he sold of it was to E. K. Hubbard, I think. At the time of that sale, my father retained possession of the north part of the 36 acres. He retained possession of 36 acres. He afterwards sold the 36 acres to Mr. Jones. Gave possession of same in 1837, I think. Removed to near Langley\u2019s place. The place on which he lived, is known as Ellis\u2019 Addition. I remember Augustus Garrett, and of his purchasing lands my father had sold. At that time father lived at same place he had moved to. He died October, 1853. He knew Garrett purchased the lands. Don\u2019t remember whether Garrett fenced the lands. Remember seeing fence around the Cottage Grove piece, or that north of it. Saw it a great while ago. Knew about the time Graves went into possession of the premises. Some of it was fenced before he went in. Think father knew of Graves purchasing them. Have heard him say so, that he was glad he was going to have Graves for a neighbor. Father, and Graves saw each other every few days, were very friendly.</summary><summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AN1\" pgmap=\"458\">Cross-examination: Am near 47 years old. At the time my father left, he had fenced in the S. W. side of the property he sold. Think that not all the quarter section was fenced. Fence was below the south line. The house faced west. It was a small shanty, one room in it. It was not fenced towards the north part of the section, all open prairie. I don\u2019t know how much was sold the first time, whether 60 or 65 acres, but they reserved 36 acres for a residence. Heard my father say that. Think we moved away in \u201937 or \u201938. Father had fenced some of the north part. Ho inclosure around all of it. By giving possession, I mean the giving the deed, that is all the possession I mean.</summary><summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-7\" pgmap=\"458\">Re-examination: E. K. Hubbard went into possession after our moving away. The sale was about that time.</summary><summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b458-8\" pgmap=\"458(81) 459(149)\">Lyman Ellis, son of Samuel Ellis, testified: Remember the time father left Cottage premises. Can\u2019t tell who went into possession. Augustus Garrett purchased. Suppose father knew it. Don\u2019t know certainly. Don\u2019t know year it was fenced. Know it was done after Garrett got it, with a picket fence. Think it was around the whole piece, the Cottage Grove part that lying north of it. Also, on each side of the road. Don\u2019t know how many years it was fenced. Think some was standing 2 or 3 years ago around some part of it. Don\u2019t remember the year Dexter Graves went into possession. It was fenced up when he went there. Father lived then on next lot. Possibly over 10 rods. Lived there till he died. Lorin and Henry Graves have occupied the premises since Dexter Graves\u2019 death. Father was in the habit of going to Cottage House, sometimes three or four times a week, at others once or twice. Never heard him talk with Graves about the purchase. Father was there often at time Graves was sick. Dexter Graves did not stop there but one season. Don\u2019t know as father was at Cottage House except when Graves was sick. He bad to come by there every time he come to Chicago. Never heard father claim the premises, that is after he had sold it, or after giving the possession.</summary><summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-6\" pgmap=\"459\">Cross-examination : Don\u2019t know of father claiming land after selling to Hubbard &amp; Jones. Ho person living on premises before he left the house. Could not say that any part was fenced, except a little west of the Cottage. Don\u2019t know of any more.</summary><summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-7\" pgmap=\"459\">Re-excmimation: The fencing is not the fence that Garrett built; Garrett built that soon after father sold to Jones, within a year after. He fenced with picket fence. It remained there wholly probably two or three years.</summary><summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b459-8\" pgmap=\"459\">Frederick Howe sworn: Came to this country in 1835. First saw S. Ellis on Cottage .property in that year. Lorin Graves owns it now. Ellis was there two or three years after I came, then removed directly south of Douglas place. I used to see him very frequently. I knew Garrett went into those premises. He built a fence around the whole lot. Can not state the time. It was around whole lot in which Cottage Grove House was. Took in what is the camp ground now. It was picket fence, some may be standing now. Was acquainted with Dexter Graves. First knew him in 1835. \u00a1Knew he and Ellis were acquainted. Remember that he purchased the premises of Garrett. He took all the land inclosed. In going to city to trade Ellis had to go by there.</summary><summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-5\" pgmap=\"460\">Interrogatory : Did you hear Ellis say anything previous to 1852, about having sold that property and given up possession, if so, state what it was, and when?</summary><summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-6\" pgmap=\"460\">Answer : I can\u2019t state the date, but the first I knew was when Dexter Graves died and Lorin Graves came to me and wanted me to see Ellis, that some one had been after the old man and got a quit claim deed of Ellis for a strip through the Cottage property. He took me down to Ellis. He says I have no interest in that property. It belongs to Graves. 1 refused to give any quit claim deed. I would not do anything to injure the boys. I sold it long previously. It was soon after Graves died, I think. After Lorin\u2019s death, Henry came to me\u2014another muss about it. Got me to go to see the old man. Think he told me same story, they had no interest and refused to give a quit claim. Dexter Graves died in 1845, Lorin three or four years after. Have done great deal of business for Graves.</summary><summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b460-7\" pgmap=\"460\">T. Doty testified: Came to Chicago July, 1837. Knew Graves, Ellis and Garrett. Garrett owned premises and improved by fencing. Was fenced near old house. Hot as much as is now called Cottage property. Hot as far as the Graves property runs now. It runs some way into Camp Douglas. Roads and streets have changed. Fence came to old city limits. Some not under fence now. Can\u2019t state time when Graves went in. Know the fact. Ellis often came to city. Graves kept Cottage Grove premises under fence.

Unable to tell precisely, they referred me to Ellis, who was then passing by. 1 made the inquiry of Ellis, and he went with me and pointed out the spot where the old house stood, and pointed out what he said was the line. He said he had sold all north of that line, and that H. and L. Graves were then the owners. That he had also sold all south, but could not state present owners. The line pointed out by Ellis is the same on which I built my part of the fence. Ellis mentioned William Jones as one of the parties to whom he had sold a portion of said tract, and I think E. K. Hubbard or Augustus Garrett as the purchasers of the residue. Ellis said distinctly\" that Henry and Lorin Graves were the owners of all that part of said quarter section north of the line he pointed out, and that it contained between 58 and 60 acres, a portion of which was then inclosed by a fence.</summary><summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-7\" pgmap=\"461\">Ellis disclaimed any interest in said tract.</summary><summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-8\" pgmap=\"461\">To all which testimony of witnesses and in deposition so far as it relates to the declarations of said Ellis the plaintiff objected, for irrelevancy, and for that it seeks to-'establish title to land by parol as against title evidenced by deeds of record, and asked the same ruled opt.

E. qr. of sec. 34, T. 39 N. R. 4 E. Both parties claim from Samuel Ellis as a common source of title. Plaintiff produced a regular connected chain of title to the premises in controversy. And a recovery was opposed upon the ground that Ellis and those claiming under him, were estopped by matter in pais from asserting title. The doctrine of estoppels in pads, at this day, ^eems to be that they are equitable and not legal, when they relate to real property. An estoppel is defined to be an impediment or bar to the assertion of a right of action arising by a man\u2019s own act, or where he is forbidden by law to speak against his own act. It extends to and binds privies in blood, privies in estate and privies in law. Co. Litt. 352, A. Lord Coke says, that every estoppel, to be binding, ought to be reciprocal, and should bind both parties, and for that reason a stranger shall neither take advantage of, nor be bound by,- an estoppel. That \u2019iecause it concludes a man from alleging the truth it must be certain, to every intent, and must not be taken by argument or inference. That every estoppel ought to be a precise affirmation of that which creates the estop]: el, and not by way of recital, lb.</p> <p id=\"b465-6\" pgmap=\"465\">It then follows from this rule, that mere loose expressions inadvertently made, in ignorance of the party\u2019s rights, or declarations ambiguous in their character, can not create a bar to the assertion of the truth. And it is a well recognized rule that declarations, which were not acted upon, can never operate as an estoppel. They are said to be odious to the law, and it is for the reason that they prevent the assertion of the truth. They are only sanctioned to prevent the perpetration of fraud and to effectuate justice. When a party stands by and sees another acting to his injury, and the owner declares that he has no claim, equity will not permit him afterwards to assert his title to the injury of the person he has thus misled. And cases may be found where mere silence, by the true owner being present and failing to assert his right, when he sees a person purchasing the property, has been held to create an estoppel. But to operate as a bar to the assertion of his right, the acts of the owner must contribute to the injury of the person relying upon the bar, before he can be estopped.</p> <p id=\"b465-7\" pgmap=\"465\">Mere declarations to strangers, unless communicated to, and acted upon by, the party will not operate as an estoppel. And, generally, when the avenues of information are equally open to both parties there will be no bar. Mor is the party holding |ho title bound to seek the other and inform him of his rights, when he is in no default. The owner of land having his title duly recorded, has given all the information to the purchaser which the law requires. So, a person in the actual occupancy of his land, gives thereby all the information of his claim which is required, unless specially interrogated. In case, however, he was not in possession, or his title was not recorded, it would be different.</p> <p id=\"b465-8\" pgmap=\"465(47) 466(208)\">In the case at bar, plaintiff\u2019s title was on record, and it was the duty of persons desiring to purchase, to examine the title of record, and the presumption is that such was the case. If so, they were fully informed that Samuel Ellis or any persoff through whom defendant derives title, never attempted to convey this strip of land. Hor does it appear that any person through whom defendant\u2019s title passed, was ever misled, or induced to believe, that they were acquiring title to these premises at the time they purchased. They all purchased by metes and bounds, and acquired all the land they purchased. And by what pretense it can. be insisted that those claiming adversely to plaintiff have ever been wronged by any declarations made by Samuel Ellis, is beyond our comprehension. When they have no conveyance for the land, have never contracted for its purchase, and never paid anything for it, we are unable to perceive how any fraud has been committed by Ellis in his life time. It is true, that this strip adjoins the land purchased by defendant in error, but that does not give him title even if Samuel Ellis did say to some person that he had no claim to the land. Titles to land are not so fleeting as tobe acquired or lost with such facility. There is more stability in our tenures, than warrants a divestiture by such slight and trifling acts by the owner. That requires more solemn and deliberate action.</p> <p id=\"b466-6\" pgmap=\"466(179) 467(42)\">Had the acts which were proved, constituted an estoppel, it would have been simply an equitable right, incapable of assertion in a court of law. Wales v. Bogue, 31 Ill. 464. There can be no pretense that mere oral declarations can ever transfer the legal title, and equitable title and demands are not cognizable in a court of law. Even if this were such an estoppel as defendant claims, the legal title is in Ellis\u2019 heirs or grantees. After a careful examination of the adjudged cases, we are unable to find that such estoppels can be made available in a court of law. Estoppels relating to real estate, so far as we can find, have been uniformly enforced in courts of equity, and usually by injunction. And this is manifestly in accordance with the analogies of the law. Legal rights of action or defense are allowed in courts of law, whilst those which are equitable are alone cognizable in a court of equity. Equitable titles created by parol, and not within the statute of frauds, can only be enforced in a court of chancery. If such an estoppel operates to transfer title, or to produce that effect, it is upon the principle that an equitable estate has been created and not that the legal title has been transferred.</p> <p id=\"b467-5\" pgmap=\"467\">In some cases verbal sales of land are taken out of the statute of frauds, for the purpose of preventing the statute from being used for the perpetration of the fraud it was designed to prevent. So of estoppels relating to the title to land, if the owner does by parol that which operates as a fraud and injustice upon another dealing with the property, equity will not permit him to consummate his fraud by the assertion of his legal title. In Cochrane v. Harrow, 22 Ill. 345, this court held, that where a person stands by and permits another to purchase land to which he had title and failed to make it known, such a failure to assert his rights constituted an equitable estoppel. But an estoppel can never be allowed where it would itself perpetrate fraud, work injustice, or fail to protect the innocent. In those States, however, where equitable rights are regarded and equitable relief administered in their courts of law, estoppels are allowed to be asserted in such courts, and their decisions would not apply to our system of jurisprudence.</p> <p id=\"b467-6\" pgmap=\"467\">The judgment of the court below must be reversed and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b467-7\" pgmap=\"467\">Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
