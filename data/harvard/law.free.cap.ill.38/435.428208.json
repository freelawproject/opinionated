A motion for a new trial was entered by the defendant, which was overruled, to which the defendant excepted. 'A judgment was entered upon the verdict, to reverse which the defendant prosecutes this writ of error, and assigns for error that the name of the party to whom the liquor was sold, was not given in the indictment, nor was there any averment therein that the name of the purchaser was to the jury unknown ; and further, that there was no evidence that the offense was committed in the county of McLean.</p> <p id=\"b436-7\" pgmap=\"436\">Upon the first point, it was held by a majority of this court in Cannady v.
