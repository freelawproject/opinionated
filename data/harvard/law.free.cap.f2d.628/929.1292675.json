He was indicted on 37 counts of distributing controlled substances in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1306.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He appeals from his conviction by a jury on 33 of the 37 counts. We agree with appellant that this case is controlled by <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>Leigh, </em>487 F.2d 206 (5th Cir. 1973), and we accordingly reverse with directions to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">Section 841(a)(1) of 21 U.S.C. makes it unlawful \u201cto manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance.\u201d In <em>Leigh, </em>this Court held that, under the definitions of the terms \u201cdispense\u201d and \u201cdistribute\u201d in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 802(10) and (11), \u201ca doctor who administers or prescribes a controlled substance is, for the purpose of the statute, <em>dispensing </em>it,\u201d <em>Leigh, </em>487 F.2d at 208 (emphasis added), and affirmed the dismissal of an indictment charging a doctor with \u201cdistributing\u201d rather than \u201cdispensing\u201d a controlled substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-8\">The government argues that \u201cdecisions subsequent to <em>Leigh </em>have rendered <em>Leigh </em>of dubious precedential value,\u201d citing <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>423 U.S. 122, 96 S.Ct. 335, 46 L.Ed.2d 333 (1975); <em>U. S. v. Dunbar, </em>614 F.2d 39 (5th Cir. 1980); and <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>Greenfield, </em>574 F.2d 305 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 860, 99 S.Ct. 178, 58 L.Ed.2d 168 (1978). We must disagree. In <em>Moore, </em>the Supreme Court held that the provisions of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 842 and 843, which apply specifically to persons registered under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 822, and which provide lesser penalties than does \u00a7 841, do not imply an exemption from \u00a7 841 for physicians and other registrants. Although the government relies on the Supreme Court\u2019s statement of the issue as \u201cwhether persons who are registered under the Controlled Substances Act . . . can be prosecuted under \u00a7 841 for dispensing or distributing controlled substances,\u201d <em>Moore, </em>423 U.S. at 124, 96 S.Ct. at 337, 46 L.Ed.2d at 337, that case did not address the question whether a physician is properly charged with \u201cdispensing\u201d or \u201cdistributing.\u201d Similarly, although both <em>Dunbar </em>and <em>Greenfield </em>upheld convictions of physicians for \u201cdistributing\u201d controlled substances, neither case considered the issue presented here. Moreover, this Court only recently reaffirmed the holding of <em>Leigh </em>in dictum in <em>U. S. v. Thompson, </em>624 F.2d 740, 742 (5th Cir. 1980) (affirming physician\u2019s conviction for \u201cdispensing\u201d controlled substances): \u201cPrecedent in this circuit establishes that, under Title 21 of the Code, a doctor who administers or prescribes a controlled substance in an unlawful manner is to be indicted for dispensing it rather than distributing it. <em>U. S. v. Leigh.\u201d</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1000-11\">On or about the 22nd day of March, 1977, within the Northern District of Georgia, the defendant JIM T. HARRISON, JR., did unlawfully and knowingly <em>distribute and cause to be distributed </em>a Schedule III controlled substance, that is Didrex (Benzphetamine hydrochloride) pursuant to a prescription numbered 156753, for other than a legitimate medical purpose and not in the usual course of professional practice, in violation of Title 21, United States Code, Section 841(a)(1) and Title 21, C.F.R., Section 1306. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1000-14\">Appellant also challenges the procedure by which the trial judge took judicial notice of the schedules of controlled substances listed in 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1306 and the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction on counts 15 through 27. Because of our disposition of appellant\u2019s challenge to the indictment, we need not consider these objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-15\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1000-9\">.
