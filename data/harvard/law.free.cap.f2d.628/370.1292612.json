JOHNSON, Jr., Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b441-18\">This is an appeal from the denial of motions for preliminary and permanent injunctions filed by Meridian Investing &amp; Development Corporation against Suncoast Highland Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-22\">The controversy stems from Meridian\u2019s attempts to collect on a federal court judgment. Meridian is a Delaware corporation having its principal place of business in New York. Suncoast is a Florida corporation having its principal place of business in Florida. In May 1976, Suncoast made and delivered to Meridian a promissory note. In August 1977, Meridian brought suit against Suncoast in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that Suncoast was in default. No question was (or has been) raised as to the Southern District\u2019s jurisdiction. Suncoast appeared, defended itself against Meridian\u2019s claims, and lost. In July 1979, the district court granted summary judgment to Meridian and entered a judgment in Meridian\u2019s favor in the amount of over $200,000. In August 1979, Meridian filed suit in Florida circuit court seeking to reduce the judgment to a state court judgment for the purpose of instituting immediate collection procedures through the Florida court system, and seeking immediate judicial action to prevent Suncoast from dissipating its assets before Meridian could collect. In September 1979, when the time for appeal of the New York federal court judgment had expired with no notice of appeal having been filed by Suncoast, Meridian registered the judgment in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1963<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and initiated federal proceedings to collect. On Suncoast\u2019s motion, the Florida circuit court enjoined Meridian from so proceeding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Meridian sought relief from this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>injunction (1) by filing a motion in state court for its dissolution and (2) by filing a motion in the Middle District of Florida for a preliminary and permanent injunction. In December 1979, the federal district court denied the motion on the ground that \u201csince the jurisdiction of the Pinel[l]as County Circuit Court first attached, [this] Court is precluded from exercising its jurisdiction over the same property so as to defeat or impair the state court\u2019s injunction.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Meridian filed a notice of appeal. In March 1980, the state court denied Meridian\u2019s motion to dissolve its injunction and also denied Meridian\u2019s motions to strike and dismiss challenges to the validity of the New York federal court judgment that had been pled by Suncoast as affirmative defenses to Meridian\u2019s state court complaint. Following the state court\u2019s action, Meridian renewed its motion in the Middle District of Florida for a preliminary and permanent injunction. The motion was again denied and Meridian filed another notice of appeal. The two appeals have been consolidated for our consideration here.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Meridian first contends that the district court erred in failing to issue the injunction Meridian requested directing Suncoast to cause the dissolution of the Florida state court injunction. This contention has merit. It is settled law that state courts have no authority to bar-by injunction or otherwise-the prosecution of <em>in personam </em>actions in federal courts. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>General Atomic Co. v. Felter, </em>434 U.S. 12, 98 S.Ct. 76, 54 L.Ed.2d 199 (1977), \u201cthe rights conferred by Congress to bring <em>in personam </em>actions in federal courts are not subject to abridgment by state-court injunctions . . .\u201d 434 U.S. at 17, 98 S.Ct. at 78. <em>See also Donovan v. Dallas, </em>377 U.S. 408, 412-13, 84 S.Ct. 1579, 1582, 12 L.Ed.2d 409 (1964). Meridian\u2019s federal court action was an action <em>in personam. See, e. g., Byrd-Frost, Inc. v. Elder, </em>93 F.2d 30, 32-33 (5th Cir. 1937), <em>cert. denied, </em>303 U.S. 647, 58 S.Ct. 646, 82 L.Ed. 1108 (1938). <em>See generally </em>1 Am.Jur.2d <em>Actions </em>\u00a7\u00a7 39-41 (2d ed. 1962).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus the district court should have issued the requested relief. <em>See, e. g., Ermentrout v. Commonwealth Oil Company, </em>220 F.2d 527, 530 (5th Cir. 1955) (\u201cfederal court may not abdicate its authority or duty in favor of the state jurisdiction\u201d). The district court\u2019s contrary decision evidenced a belief that a pending state court action to enforce a federal court judgment precludes supplementary proceedings in aid of execution in federal court. Such is not the case. <em>See </em>12 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 3013 (1973). Indeed, in cases such as this one, in which execution of the federal court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>judgment is pursued through registration in another federal district court, see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1963, <em>quoted in </em>note 1, <em>supra, </em>the filing of concurrent state and federal suits may be the judgment creditor\u2019s only effective course of action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Meridian also contends that the district court erred in failing to grant its motion to enjoin Suncoast from relitigating the validity of the New York federal court judgment in Florida state court. This contention also has merit. The law is well settled that \u201cfederal courts may enjoin the relitigation in state court of issues that federal courts have fully and finally adjudicated.\u201d <em>International Association of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers v. Nix, </em>512 F.2d 125,130 (5th Cir. 1975). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2283.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As we explained in <em>Woods Exploration &amp; Producing Company </em>v. <em>Aluminum Company of America, </em>438 F.2d 1286 (5th Cir. 1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 1047, 92 S.Ct. 701, 30 L.Ed.2d 736 (1972), the federal courts\u2019 capacity to issue such injunctions \u201c \u2018prevents multiple litigation of the same cause of action and it assures the winner in a federal court that he will not be deprived of the fruits of his victory by a later contrary state judgment which the Supreme Court may or may not decide to review.\u2019 \u201d 438 F.2d at 1312, <em>quoting </em>Note, 74 Harv.L.Rev. 726, 734 (1961). <em>See also Scott </em>v. <em>Hunt Oil Co., </em>398 F.2d 810, 811 (5th Cir. 1968) (\u201cLitigation must come to an end and the victors are entitled to the fruits of that victory. And the losers must abide the loss.\u201d). The record here indicates that Sun-coast seeks to relitigate in the state court proceeding issues that have already been decided by the Southern District of New York. <em>See generally Montana v. United States, </em>440 U.S. 147, 153-54, 99 S.Ct. 970, 973-974, 59 L.Ed.2d 210 (explaining doctrines of collateral estoppel and res judicata). Issuance of an order' enjoining Sun-coast from so proceeding was and is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">The district court has inherent power to enforce such orders through use of appropriate sanctions. <em>See, e. g., Scott v. Hunt Oil Company, </em>398 F.2d at 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">REVERSED AND REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b441-19\">. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1963 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-20\">A judgment in an action for the recovery of money or property now or hereafter entered in any district court which has become final by appeal or expiration of time for appeal may be registered in any other district by filing therein a certified copy of such judgment. A judgment so registered shall have the same effect as a judgment of the district court of the district where registered and may be enforced in like manner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-24\">A certified copy of the satisfaction of any judgment in whole or in part may be registered in like manner in any district in which the judgment is a lien.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b441-25\">.

S. District Court, Southern District of New York, Civil Action No. 77 Civil 4148 (MJL), and docketed in the U. S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division, as Case No. 79-970-1/2 Civil T-WC, and the Plaintiff is enjoined and required to take such actions as may be requisite or appropriate to return the judgment made the subject of its Complaint herein to its status as it existed upon the filing of the Complaint in this cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b442-6\">. <em>See Penn General Casualty Co. v. Pennsylvania, </em>294 U.S. 189, 55 S.Ct. 386, 79 L.Ed. 850 (1935):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-7\">if the two suits are in rem or quasi in rem, requiring that the court or its officer have possession or control of the property which is the subject of the suit in order to proceed with the cause and to grant the relief sought, the jurisdiction of one court must of necessity yield to that of the other. . the principle, applicable to both federal and state courts, is established that the court first assuming jurisdiction over the property may maintain and exercise that jurisdiction to the exclusion of the other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">294 U.S. at 195, 55 S.Ct. at 389 (citations omitted); <em>Kline v.

For this reason, the principle governing conflicting <em>in rem </em>actions that was relied on by the district court, <em>see </em>note 3, <em>supra, </em>is inapposite here even assuming that Meridian\u2019s state court action was properly characterized as an action <em>in rem </em>or <em>quasi in rem, </em>which we doubt. <em>See </em>1A Moore\u2019s Federal Practice 11 0.222 (2d ed. 1979). <em>See also </em>Restatement of Judgments, Introductory Note to Chapter 1 (1942) (differentiating proceedings <em>in personam, in rem </em>and <em>quasi in rem)-, Griffin v.
