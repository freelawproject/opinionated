Their trials were severed from those of alleged coconspirators with whom they were indicted in connection with these events. Centeno, Leon, and Palofox each received life sentences for their role in the conspiracy based on a jury\u2019s findings that the robberies were gang related. Gang allegations were found not true as to Rivas, who was sentenced to a total of 22 years in prison.

The trial court\u2019s sentencing decisions are challenged on multiple grounds. There are also assertions of constitutionally deficient performance by trial counsel, as well as a claim that racial discrimination tainted the jury selection process. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">In the published portion of the opinion, we apply the California Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>People v. Elizalde </em>(2015) 61 Cal.4th 523 [189 Cal.Rptr.3d 518, 351 P.3d 1010] (Elizalde) to resolve challenges to evidence of gang affiliation admissions made by Centeno and appellants\u2019 coconspirators when they were booked into jail. We conclude any prohibited use of Centeno\u2019s admission was harmless error, and that the self-incriminating statements were not testimonial for purposes of the constitutional right to confront adverse witnesses. Our published discussion further holds that trial courts have discretion under Penal Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 669 to impose concurrent sentences for gang-related offenses punishable under the alternate penalty provisions of section 186.22, subdivision (b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">STATEMENT OF THE CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">The underlying events occurred in February and March of 2010 when a group of people from Arizona, working in conjunction with an individual who lived in California, carried out a series of home invasion robberies in the cities of Atwater, Clovis, Kerman, and Selma. The crimes were carefully coordinated, sometimes involving upwards of 10 perpetrators, and followed the same general pattern. The men would split up into two groups of lookouts and intruders, with the former stationing themselves in parked cars at strategically selected locations and maintaining communication with the intruders over cell phones and walkie-talkies. The intruders, meanwhile, would enter homes and force the occupants inside to surrender cash, gold, and other items of value. Armed with guns, they threatened to kill their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>victims and used violence to extract information about the location of money and valuables. The victims were sometimes tied up with electrical cords and other makeshift restraints. In three of the five incidents, an automobile was stolen during the course of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\">A joint investigatory effort by law enforcement agencies in California and Arizona led to the arrest and prosecution of nine suspects. On March 22, 2011, a Fresno County grand jury returned an 18-count indictment against appellants and their accomplices, Gilbert Beltran, Christopher Escobedo, Estevan Landeros, Christian Rodriguez, and Eric Rodriguez. Count 1 of the indictment charged all parties with criminal conspiracy in violation of section 182, subdivision (a)(1). Leon and Rivas, along with coconspirators Estevan Landeros and Christian Rodriguez, were each charged in counts 2 through 18 for their respective roles in the five robberies. All parties, including Centeno and Palofox, were charged in counts 11 through 18 for their participation in the last two of those robberies. Centeno, who was 17 years old at the time of the offenses, was charged as an adult pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 707, subdivision (d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Appellants were tried before a Fresno County jury in May and June 2012. A bifurcated trial was conducted on gang allegations that were made pursuant to section 186.22, subdivision (b). Trial evidence relevant to the claims on appeal is described within the body of our Discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">The first two robberies occurred on February 24, 2010, in Clovis and Atwater. For his part in the Clovis robbery, Rivas was convicted of robbery in concert (\u00a7\u00a7211, 213, subd. (a)(1)(A); count 2), false imprisonment by violence (\u00a7\u00a7 236, 237; count 3), and using threats or violence to prevent or dissuade a victim from reporting a crime (\u00a7136.1, subd. (c)(1); count 4). In relation to the Atwater robbery, Rivas was convicted of robbery in concert (count 5), assault by means likely to cause great bodily injury (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1); count 6), false imprisonment by violence (count 7), and vehicle theft (Veh. Code, \u00a7 10851, subd. (a); count 8). He was also found guilty of conspiracy under count 1. Leon was convicted of conspiracy as well, but was acquitted on counts 2 through 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">The third robbery took place in Kerman on March 15, 2010. For this incident, Leon and Rivas were convicted of robbery in concert (count 9) and false imprisonment by violence (count 10). As to Leon, the robbery was found to be gang related within the meaning of section 186.22, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">The fourth and fifth robberies occurred on March 16, 2010, in Atwater and Selma. For the (second) Atwater robbery, all appellants were convicted of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>robbery in concert (count 11), false imprisonment by violence (count 12), assault with a semiautomatic firearm (\u00a7 245, subd. (b); count 13), making criminal threats (\u00a7 422; count 14), and vehicle theft (count 15). In regards to the Selma robbery, appellants were convicted of robbery in concert (count 16), false imprisonment (count 17), and vehicle theft (count 18). As to Centeno, Leon, and Palofox, the robberies were found to be gang related. Enhancement allegations for personal use of a firearm within the meaning of section 12022.5, subdivision (a) were found true as to Leon on counts 11 and 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Leon was sentenced to an aggregate term of 48 years to life in prison. For robbery in concert under counts 9, 11, and 16, he received consecutive terms of 15 years to life based on the alternate penalty set forth in section 186.22, subdivision (b)(4)(B). A consecutive three-year term was imposed for the gun enhancement attached to count 11. Concurrent terms were imposed for counts 14, 15, and 18, with all other sentences stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">Centeno and Palofox received sentences of 30 years to life in prison based on the gang-related robbery convictions on counts 11 and 16. Concurrent terms were imposed for counts 13, 14, 15, and 18. All other sentences were stayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">Rivas was sentenced to a total of 22 years in prison as follows: The upper term of nine years under count 2 for robbery in concert, plus consecutive two-year terms (one-third of the middle term) for each robbery in concert conviction under counts 5, 9, 11 and 16, plus a consecutive three-year term for count 4, and a consecutive two-year term for count 13. Concurrent terms were imposed as to counts 8, 14, 15, and 18. Stayed sentences were imposed for all remaining counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">I.-V<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-10\">VI. <em>Gang Findings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b896-11\">A bifurcated jury trial was conducted as to the gang-related allegations in counts 9, 11, and 16. Each of those counts involved the substantive offense of robbery committed within an inhabited dwelling house and in concert with two or more other persons (\u00a7\u00a7 211, 213, subd. (a)(1)(A)). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>gang allegations were made pursuant to section 186.22, subdivision (b), which provides for increased punishment when an offense is committed \u201cfor the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with any criminal street gang, with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in any criminal conduct by gang members.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>subd. (b)(1) and (4).) The jury\u2019s findings ultimately determined whether appellants received life sentences (Centeno, Leon, and Palofox) or a sentence for a term of years (Rivas).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">The prosecution argued that appellants knowingly committed the underlying offenses in association with members of a criminal street gang, and were therefore liable under section 186.22, subdivision (b) regardless of their personal gang affiliations or lack thereof. To support this theory, evidence was presented regarding admissions made by certain individuals during jail classification interviews that followed their arrest for the subject robberies, including those of third party accomplices/coconspirators Gilbert Beltran, Christopher Escobedo, Estevan Landeros, and Christian Rodriguez. Evidence of an admission made by Centeno during the jail intake process was introduced over an objection that it was obtained in violation of his <em>Miranda (Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966) 384 U.S. 436 [16 L.Ed.2d 694, 86 S.Ct. 1602] <em>(Miranda)) </em>rights. Leon, Palofox, and Rivas each denied having gang ties during their own jail classification interviews, but the jury learned Palofox subsequently admitted his gang status in conjunction with a request to be transferred out of general population housing for safety reasons. The gang allegations were found true as to Centeno, Leon, and Palofox, but not true with respect to Rivas.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">On appeal, Centeno renews his <em>Miranda </em>objection and summarily joins in arguments made by Leon. Leon\u2019s briefing challenges all of the prosecution\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>jail classification evidence on grounds that its admission contravened <em>Miranda </em>principles and resulted in a violation of his rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. In a related argument, Leon contends that the prosecution introduced testimonial hearsay through the opinions of its gang expert in violation of his constitutional right to confront adverse witnesses. Palofox summarily joins in the positions taken by Centeno and Leon.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">During the pendency of this appeal, the California Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Elizalde, </em>which addresses and resolves the <em>Miranda </em>issue raised by Centeno. It is now settled that the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination is implicated when law enforcement officers ask \u201croutine questions about gang affiliation\u201d while processing a defendant into jail. <em>(Elizalde, supra, </em>61 Cal.4th at p. 527.) As will be explained, the admission of evidence concerning Centeno\u2019s jail classification statements was erroneous under <em>Elizalde. </em>The more difficult question is whether the error was prejudicial, and the answer depends in part on the admissibility of the statements made by accomplices/coconspirators who were not parties to the case. We conclude appellants do not have standing to assert the constitutional rights of those third parties, nor could they have asserted their own Sixth Amendment confrontation rights as a basis for excluding evidence of the third party admissions. Given the significance of the accomplices\u2019 self-incriminating statements in combination with other admissible evidence presented at trial, the violation of Centeno\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights did not constitute reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">\n<em>Additional Background Information</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">Trial of the gang allegations began with a hearing conducted pursuant to Evidence Code section 402 in regards to Centeno\u2019s jail classification admissions. The trial court had previously advised defense counsel of its belief that the law was \u201cfairly settled\u201d in terms of there being \u201cno grounds for arguing that there\u2019s some kind of Fifth Amendment violation\u201d in the use of such evidence. Each defendant was given the opportunity to argue otherwise, but only Centeno chose to do so. Relying on <em>pre-Elizalde </em>case law, the trial court ruled that Centeno\u2019s statements during the jail intake process were admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">The prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief included testimony by correctional officers from the Fresno County Jail. Witness Cynthia Diaz described herself as a \u201cjail classification officer\u201d or \u201cpopulation management officer.\u201d Her duties involved placing inmates in the appropriate custodial setting based on their responses to a standardized intake interview. The process required interviewees to answer questions listed on a preprinted form, including, \u201cDo you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>associate with any street/prison gangs? If yes, explain.\u201d All inmates were required to review and sign their completed form.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">Officer Diaz conducted two classification interviews with Estevan Landeros. She observed and documented the presence of tattoos on his body of the words \u201cSouth Side\u201d and of three dots grouped together in a triangular pattern. Recognizing the tattoos as being indicative of a connection to the \u201cSure\u00f1o\u201d gang, Officer-Diaz was skeptical when Landeros initially denied being a gang member or associate. During the second interview, she advised him that he needed to answer the gang association question truthfully for his own safety. At trial she explained; \u201cIf he denied then I would have to put him in general population, [where] we have rival gangs and he would be assaulted.\u201d The majority of inmates in general population housing were members of the regional \u201cBulldogs\u201d gang, which viewed the Sure\u00f1os as a rival group. Landeros eventually informed Officer Diaz that he \u201cassociated with the Sure\u00f1os.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">The correctional officer who interviewed Centeno testified that he admitted to being a \u201cSure\u00f1o from Phoenix.\u201d Christian Rodriguez similarly identified himself as a \u201cPhoenix Sure\u00f1o\u201d during his jail classification interview. Christopher Escobedo admitted to being a \u201cSouth Side associate from Phoenix,\u201d and Gilbert Beltran claimed to be a \u201cSouth Sider from Phoenix.\u201d Beltran and Escobedo were noted to have tattoos of the letters \u201cSS.\u201d Escobedo reportedly obtained a three-dot tattoo subsequent to his admission into the jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">Detective Andrew Simonson of the Fresno County Sheriff\u2019s Department testified as the prosecution\u2019s gang expert. He explained, based on his training and experience, that the Sure\u00f1o criminal street gang is controlled by a prison gang known as the \u201cMexican Mafia.\u201d Since most members of the Mexican Mafia are \u201clocked down in protective housing units throughout the state and federal system,\u201d they rely on the Sure\u00f1os to act as their \u201cfoot soldiers\u201d outside of prison, generating money for the organization through criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">The Sure\u00f1os have a nationwide presence and commonly identify with certain words and symbols. The name itself translates to \u201csoutherner,\u201d and terms such as \u201csur\u201d (meaning \u201csouth\u201d) \u201csouth side\u201d or \u201csouth sider\u201d are often used to indicate a Sure\u00f1o affiliation. The number 13 has significance to Sure\u00f1os because the 13th letter of the alphabet is \u201cM,\u201d which to them connotes the Mexican Mafia. Gang members will display the number 13 using Roman numerals or a symbol from the Mayan numbering system of two horizontal lines underneath three dots. According to Detective Simonson, the most common tattoo used by Sure\u00f1os to signify their membership is three dots grouped together in a triangular pattern.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>Detective Simonson opined that appellants and their accomplices were all Sure\u00f1o members or associates. His opinions with respect to the accomplices were primarily based on their admissions during jail classification interviews. The expert stressed that he considered such admissions to be the most reliable form of evidence to determine gang affiliation (\u201cFor us it\u2019s basically a stand-alone criteria.\u201d). As a practical matter, gang members are motived by \u201cself-preservation\u201d to answer jail classification questions truthfully because \u201c[tjhey don\u2019t want to be placed in housing with rival gang members where they can be killed [or] assaulted.\u201d Falsely claiming association with a particular gang can also be deadly. In Detective Simonson\u2019s experience, the occupants of a segregated Sure\u00f1o \u201cpod\u201d will assault or kill non-Surenos if such individuals are housed with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">Leon denied having gang ties during his classification interview and was accordingly housed in a minimum security location. Nevertheless, Detective Simonson believed Leon was a Sure\u00f1o \u201cassociate.\u201d The expert had personally participated in the execution of a search warrant at Leon\u2019s residence in Arizona, and had observed distinctive gang graffiti displayed in various locations on the property. He testified to seeing the number 13 carved into trees near the trailer in which Leon was living, and, in other locations, the three-dot imagery, the words \u201cSouth Side\u201d and \u201cHayden Park,\u201d and the letters \u201cSS\u201d and \u201cVHPLS.\u201d The letters VHPLS purportedly stood for \u201cVario Hayden Park Locos,\u201d a Phoenix area subset of the Sure\u00f1os. Photographs of the graffiti were admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">The expert\u2019s opinions about Leon were further based on his review of police reports and other information provided to him by members of the Phoenix Police Department. According to those sources, Leon had previously been seen wearing gang clothing and was known to associate with Estevan Landeros. Phoenix police believed Landeros and Leon were both part of the Vario Hayden Park Locos.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">As to Centeno, the expert relied on \u201cjail classifications as well as Phoenix Police reports.\u201d These records indicated that Centeno had gang tattoos and belonged to a Sure\u00f1o subset known as the \u201cVario Happy Homes Locos.\u201d He was also known to associate with Palofox and Gilbert Beltran.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">On direct examination, Detective Simonson opined that Palofox was a Sure\u00f1o member based upon his review of \u201cthe Phoenix Police reports as well as local classification documents.\u201d On cross-examination, Palofox\u2019s attorney elicited testimony from the expert regarding his client\u2019s denial of gang membership during a classification interview at the Fresno County Jail\u2014 information not previously disclosed in front of the jury. Defense counsel also successfully moved to have Palofox\u2019s signed jail classification questionnaire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>admitted into evidence. This line of questioning led to the revelation that Palofox had later requested to be transferred from general population housing out of fear for his safety: \u201cOriginally he was placed with Bulldogs. He was \u2014 he told the CO that the Bulldogs overheard him talking to his family and stated he slipped. And then he admitted to the classification officers that he was a South Sider and he no longer [felt] comfortable housed with any Bulldogs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">Finally, with respect to Rivas, the expert acknowledged there was no evidence to indicate he was a gang member. Detective Simonson believed Rivas had associated with gang members through his involvement with the codefendants and other accomplices, but conceded there was no evidence Rivas actually knew those individuals were members of a gang. As stated above, the gang allegations against Rivas were found not to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\"><em>The </em>Elizalde <em>Decision</em></p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">In <em>Elizalde, </em>the California Supreme Court considered \u201cwhether routine questions about gang affiliation, posed to [a] defendant while processing him into jail on murder charges, come within <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>well-recognized booking exception.\u201d <em>(Elizalde, supra, </em>61 Cal.4th at p. 527.) The key holding of the opinion is as follows: \u201cGang affiliation questions do not conform to the narrow exception contemplated in <em>[Rhode Island v. Innis </em>(1980) 446 U.S. 291 [64 L.Ed.2d 297, 100 S.Ct. 1682]] and <em>[Pennsylvania v. Muniz </em>(1990) 496 U.S. 582 [110 L.Ed.2d 528, 110 S.Ct. 2638]] for basic identifying biographical data necessary for booking or pretrial services. Instead, they must be measured under the general <em>Innis </em>test, which defines as \u2018interrogation\u2019 questions the police should know are \u2018reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Elizalde, supra, </em>61 Cal.4th at p. 538.) Whether or not a gang-related inquiry by jail personnel requires a <em>Miranda </em>admonition will depend on the nature of the charges the inmate is facing.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">The <em>Elizalde </em>defendant was asked gang affiliation questions by sheriff\u2019s deputies who were aware he had been charged with murder but did not know the offense was gang related. <em>(Elizalde, supra, </em>61 Cal.4th at p. 529.) Ignorance of the latter circumstance was immaterial because murder is \u201ca crime frequently committed for the benefit of criminal street gangs, and a qualifying offense establishing a \u2018 \u201cpattern of criminal gang activity\u201d \u2019 \u201d for purposes of section 186.22. <em>(Elizalde, </em>at p. 540.) Therefore, the questions were likely .to elicit an incriminating response and needed to be prefaced with a <em>Miranda </em>admonition, \u201ceven if the deputies\u2019 subjective intention was benign.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cWhile officers were permitted to ask these questions for institutional security purposes, defendant\u2019s <em>un-Mirandized </em>responses were inadmissible against him during the [prosecution\u2019s] case-in-chief.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 527.)</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>Under <em>Elizalde, </em>Centeno\u2019s objection to the admission of his jail classification statements should have been sustained. The jail classification officer who interviewed him knew of his connection to the other inmates from Arizona, and the record indicates the officer would have also been aware of his charges. As discussed in footnote 8, <em>ante, </em>robbery in concert in violation of section 213, subdivision (a)(1)(A) is subject to punishment under the alternate penalty provision in section 186.22, subdivision (b)(4)(B). These circumstances made it reasonably likely that the gang affiliation question would elicit an incriminating response, and a <em>Miranda </em>admonishment was therefore required.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Palofox\u2019s situation does not fit squarely within the parameters of the <em>Elizalde </em>decision. It appears he approached correctional officers on his own accord and volunteered information about his gang status in conjunction with a request for alternate housing arrangements. The record does not demonstrate that his admission was the product of interrogation. He has made no effort to argue this issue on appeal, and we will not endeavor to make arguments on his behalf. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Bryant, Smith and Wheeler </em>(2014) 60 Cal.4th 335, 364 [178 Cal.Rptr.3d 185, 334 P.3d 573] [although joinder of claims is broadly permitted, \u201c \u2018each appellant has the burden of demonstrating error and prejudice\u2019 \u201d].) Under current law, a gang expert\u2019s opinion may be based on hearsay, and when testifying, he or she may describe the material that forms the basis for their opinion. <em>(People v. Gardeley </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 605, 618 [59 Cal.Rptr.2d 356, 927 P.2d 713].) We therefore assume Detective Simonson\u2019s testimony in regards to Palofox\u2019s admission was permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">\n<em>Due Process Considerations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">Leon claims his due process rights were violated by the admission of evidence of his coconspirators\u2019 jail classification statements. He argues those statements were coerced in that each person faced a Hobson\u2019s choice of providing self-incriminating information or jeopardizing their personal safety by being housed with rival gang members. Leon further alleges ineffective assistance of counsel based on his trial attorney\u2019s failure to make these arguments below.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">\u201cIt is settled that the accused has no standing to object to a violation of another\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Badgett </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 330, 343 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 635, 895 P.2d 877] <em>(Badgett).) </em>However, a defendant does have limited standing to assert that his own due process right to a fair trial has been violated through the admission of improperly obtained statements made by a third party. <em>(People v Williams </em>(2010) 49 Cal.4th 405, 452 [111 Cal.Rptr.3d 589, 233 P.3d 1000] <em>(Williams); People </em>v. <em>Jenkins </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 900, 966 [95 Cal.Rptr.2d 377, 997 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>1044] <em>(Jenkins).) </em>This relatively uncommon issue has arisen in the context of a challenge to coerced trial testimony, and in relation to the \u201cfruits\u201d of a third party\u2019s involuntary out-of-court statements. <em>(Williams, supra, </em>49 Cal.4th at pp. 452-454; <em>Jenkins, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at pp. 966-967; <em>Badgett, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at pp. 342-348; <em>People v. Douglas </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 468, 501-505 [268 Cal.Rptr. 126, 788 P.2d 640]; <em>People v. Varnum </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 808, 811-813 [59 Cal.Rptr. 108, 427 P2d 772].) Leon cites to most of these cases in his briefs, but provides no further authority regarding due process challenges to the type of evidence at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\">\u201cThe violation of a third party\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination may deprive a defendant of his or her due process rights if such action adversely affects the reliability of testimony offered against the defendant at trial.\u201d <em>(Jenkins, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 966.) \u201c[W]hen the defendant\u2019s claim is based upon the involuntariness of a third party\u2019s statement, the exclusionary rule applicable to a claimed violation of the privilege against self-incrimination does not apply. [Citation.] Rather, the defendant may prevail only by demonstrating fundamental unfairness at trial, normally by establishing that evidence to be produced at trial was made unreliable by coercion.\u201d (Ibid.; see <em>Badgett, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 348 [\u201cTestimony of third parties that is offered at trial should not be subject to exclusion unless the defendant demonstrates that improper coercion has impaired the reliability of the testimony.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">Respondent argues there is no due process violation under the framework set forth in cases such as <em>Jenkins </em>and <em>Badgett </em>because the circumstances in which the statements of Leon\u2019s coconspirators were made, and the independent evidence of their gang affiliations, overwhelmingly demonstrate that the admissions were reliable. Leon does not disagree with the reliability argument, but submits that a due process violation should be found because the third party admissions were procured by \u201coutrageous police misconduct.\u201d We find respondent\u2019s argument to be more persuasive given the authorities upon which the parties have relied. The <em>Elizalde </em>decision may inevitably lead to future claims that even <em>Mirandized </em>jail classification admissions are inherently coercive, but we need not resolve that issue in order to dispose of Leon\u2019s current claim. The ineffective assistance claim fails pursuant to the foregoing analysis and given the state of the law at the time of trial. (See <em>People v. Welch </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 228, 237 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 520, 851 P.2d 802] [\u201cReviewing courts have traditionally excused parties for failing to raise an issue at trial where an objection would have been futile or wholly unsupported by substantive law then in existence.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>\n<em>Sixth Amendment Considerations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">Leon alleges a violation of his Sixth Amendment rights under <em>Crawford v. Washington </em>(2004) 541 U.S. 36 [158 L.Ed.2d 177, 124 S.Ct. 1354] <em>(Crawford). </em>Two categories of evidence are relevant to his claim. He describes the first category as \u201chearsay evidence from Phoenix police,\u201d referring to the documents and verbal information Detective Simonson obtained from Arizona law enforcement officers and relied upon in forming his expert opinions. The second category is comprised of the jail classification admissions of his codefendants and third party accomplices.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">\u201cThe confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment to the federal Constitution, made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that \u2018[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u2019 The right of confrontation includes the right of cross-examination.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fletcher </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 451, 455 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 572, 917 P.2d 187].) In <em>Crawford, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the confrontation clause bars the admission of out-of-court testimonial hearsay statements except when \u201cthe declarant is unavailable . . .\u201d and the defendant \u201chad a prior opportunity to cross-examine\u201d the declarant. <em>(Crawford, supra, </em>541 U.S. at p. 59.)</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">The issue of whether a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation is violated by a gang expert\u2019s reliance on testimonial hearsay is currently pending before the California Supreme Court. <em>(People v. Sanchez, </em>review granted May 14, 2014, S216681; <em>People </em>v. <em>Archuleta, </em>review granted June 11, 2014, S218640 [briefing deferred pending consideration and disposition of Sanchez]; <em>People v. Eberhart, </em>review granted Nov. 24, 2015, S229864 [same].) We decline to speculate as to how the issue will be decided, and conclude the verdict in this case would have been the same even without Detective Simonson\u2019s testimony regarding the contents of Phoenix police reports and his conversations with out-of-state law enforcement officers. (See further discussion, <em>post.) </em>The outcome would likely have been different if appellants\u2019 Sixth Amendment rights were implicated by evidence of their accomplices\u2019 jail classification admissions, but for the reasons that follow we conclude those admissions were not \u201ctestimonial\u201d for purposes of <em>Crawford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">In <em>Elizalde, </em>our Supreme Court determined that jail classification interviews are a form of custodial interrogation for purposes of the Fifth Amendment insofar as the questioning is likely to elicit an incriminating response. <em>(Elizalde, supra, </em>61 Cal.4th at pp. 531, 538-539.) However, while responses to such interrogation may be considered \u201ctestimonial\u201d in a Fifth Amendment context, the same is not necessarily true for purposes of the Sixth Amendment. <em>(Elizalde, </em>at p. 532, fn. 7.) The <em>Elizalde </em>opinion contains a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>footnote on this point that states, in pertinent part: \u201cThis case in no way implicates the court\u2019s <em>Crawford </em>jurisprudence.\u201d <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">The <em>Crawford </em>opinion does not define the term \u201ctestimonial,\u201d but says it \u201capplies at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial; and to police interrogations.\u201d <em>(Crawford, supra, </em>541 U.S. at p. 68.) As originally decided, <em>Crawford </em>left no room for debate over the last category: \u201cStatements taken by police officers in the course of interrogations are . . . testimonial under even a narrow standard.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 52.) The high court revised its position in <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(2006) 547 U.S. 813 [165 L.Ed.2d 224, 126 S.Ct. 2266] <em>(Davis) </em>to make an exception for emergency situations. The <em>Davis </em>case instructs that \u201c[statements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency. They are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>(Davis, supra, </em>547 U.S. at p. 822.) This aspect of the opinion has come to be known as the \u201c \u2018primary purpose\u2019 \u201d test. <em>(Ohio v. Clark </em>(2015) 576 U.S._[192 L.Ed.2d 306, 135 S.Ct. 2173, 2179] <em>(Clark).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">Since <em>Davis, </em>the United States Supreme Court has adopted the view that \u201cnot all those questioned by the police are witnesses\u201d for purposes of the Sixth Amendment and not all \u201c \u2018interrogations by law enforcement officers,\u2019 [citation], are subject to the Confrontation Clause.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Michigan v. Bryant </em>(2011) 562 U.S. 344, 355 [179 L.Ed.2d 93, 131 S.Ct. 1143] <em>{Bryant), </em>quoting <em>Crawford, supra, </em>541 U.S. at p. 53.) Hearsay evidence must now satisfy the primary purpose test in order to be considered testimonial for purposes of the Sixth Amendment right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses. <em>(Clark, supra, </em>576 U.S. at p. _ [135 S.Ct. at p. 2180]; <em>People v. Chism </em>(2014) 58 Cal.4th 1266, 1288-1289 [171 Cal.Rptr.3d 347, 324 P.3d 183].) In its current formulation, the test asks whether the statement at issue was \u201cprocured with a primary purpose of creating an out-of-court substitute for trial testimony.\u201d <em>{Bryant, supra, </em>562 U.S. at p. 358.) The California Supreme Court has described the test in substantially similar terms: \u201cFirst, to be testimonial the statement must be made with some degree of formality or solemnity. Second, the statement is testimonial only if its primary purpose pertains in some fashion to a criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>(People v. Dungo </em>(2012) 55 Cal.4th 608, 619 [147 Cal.Rptr.3d 527, 286 P.3d 442].)</p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">The primary purpose test is essentially a totality of the circumstances analysis. \u201c[T]he relevant inquiry is not the subjective or actual purpose of the individuals involved in a particular encounter, but rather the purpose that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>reasonable participants would have had, as ascertained from the individuals\u2019 statements and actions and the circumstances in which the encounter occurred.\u201d (Bry<em>ant, supra, </em>562 U.S. at p. 360.) \u201cIn the end, the question is whether, in light of all the circumstances, viewed objectively, the \u2018primary purpose\u2019 of the conversation was to \u2018creat[e] an out-of-court substitute for trial testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Clark, supra, </em>576 U.S. at p. _ [135 S.Ct. at p. 2180].) \u201c \u2018Where no such primary purpose exists, the admissibility of a statement is the concern of state and federal rules of evidence, not the Confrontation Clause.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">Here, the statements in dispute were made with a sufficient degree of formality. However, we cannot conclude the primary purpose of those statements \u2014 from the perspective of either the person asking the questions or the person answering them \u2014 was to create an out-of-court substitute for trial testimony or to otherwise contribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution. Nothing suggests that Leon\u2019s codefendants and third party accomplices disclosed gang membership or affiliation for the purpose of making a confession against themselves or an accusation against someone else. Likewise, based on all of the available evidence, including testimony by the correctional officers who appeared at trial, we are convinced the <em>primary </em>purpose for the gang affiliation questions was to further institutional security objectives, i.e., to ensure the safety of inmates and jail personnel. The answers to those questions also had evidentiary value from a prosecutorial standpoint, but the objective primary purpose \u201creasonable participants would have had\u201d in this context was not the creation of an out-of-court substitute for trial testimony. <em>(Bryant, supra, </em>562 U.S. at p. 360.) Therefore, appellants did not have a Sixth Amendment right to cross-examine each other or their accomplices about the jail classification admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">\n<em>Prejudice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">The erroneous admission of a jail classification statement obtained in violation of <em>Miranda </em>is reviewed for prejudice under the standard articulated in <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824]. <em>(Elizalde, supra, </em>61 Cal.4th at p. 542.) The People must show, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error did not contribute to the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201c \u2018To say that an error did not contribute to the ensuing verdict is ... to find that error unimportant in relation to everything else the jury considered on the issue in question, as revealed in the record.\u2019 [Citation.] Thus, the focus is what the jury actually decided and whether the error might have tainted its decision.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Neal </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 63, 86 [1 Cal.Rptr.3d 650, 72 P.3d 280].) The error in <em>Elizalde </em>was found to be harmless because the defendant\u2019s gang connections were established through independent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>Focusing on what the jury actually decided in this case, we cannot ignore its findings as to Rivas. Both Leon and Rivas denied having gang ties during their jail classification interviews, but only Rivas was exonerated. Rivas stood apart from his coconspirators as the only member of the conspiracy from California. The other men resided in or around Phoenix, Arizona. Rivas\u2019s only apparent connection to the group was that he had dated Estevan Landeros\u2019s sister during the relevant time period. When Rivas took the stand in the first phase of trial, he denied having any involvement in the robberies and claimed to be barely acquainted with Landeros.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\">A trier of fact can rationally infer a crime was committed \u201cin association\u201d with a criminal street gang within the meaning of section 186.22, subdivision (b) if the defendant committed the offense in concert with gang members. <em>(People v. Morales </em>(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 1176, 1198 [5 Cal.Rptr.3d 615].) \u201cThere is no further requirement that the defendant act with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist a gang; the statute requires only the specific intent to promote, further, or assist criminal conduct by gang members.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Albillar </em>(2010) 51 Cal.4th 47, 67 [119 Cal.Rptr.3d 415, 244 P.3d 1062], italics omitted.) Rivas was convicted of participating in all five robberies, and there was overwhelming evidence that the crimes were committed in association with gang members, yet the jury found the section 186.22, subdivision (b) allegations not true. Assuming jurors followed the instructions they were given, the only logical explanation for this outcome is that they believed Rivas did not actually know his accomplices were members of a gang. In assessing the potential for prejudice in the admission of Centeno\u2019s jail classification statements, we must consider whether the absence of such evidence could have raised similar doubts as to Leon, Centeno, and/or Palofox.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Only Leon and Rivas were convicted on count 9, i.e., the robbery which took place in Kerman on March 15, 2010. Because Centeno was not accused of participating in this offense, it stands to reason that his jail classification statements did not impact the jury\u2019s findings with respect to Leon on that count. Since the jury impliedly found Rivas was neither a gang member nor gang associate, it would appear Leon\u2019s culpability under section 186.22 was based on his association with the third party accomplices, most likely Estevan Landeros and Christian Rodriguez. Numerous victims had identified Landeros and Rodriguez to police and/or during their trial testimony, and both men were alleged to have participated in all five robberies.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Cell phone evidence showed Leon was in contact with Landeros during the course of the conspiracy. Eyewitness testimony also placed Leon and Landeros together on various dates. Their connection to one another was sufficiently established even without the information contained in the Phoenix police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>reports, which certainly reinforced the other evidence of Leon\u2019s gang ties. Unlike with Rivas, Leon\u2019s familiarity with the Sure\u00f1os could be inferred from the gang graffiti displayed outside of his residence. The graffiti evidence was based on Detective Simonson\u2019s personal observations rather than hearsay, and the corresponding photographs were admitted at trial. In summary, the record demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that the gang finding for Leon on count 9 would have been the same with or without evidence of Centeno\u2019s jail classification admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Counts 11 and 16 respectively pertained to the robberies in Atwater and Selma on March 16, 2010. Since each appellant was convicted of these crimes, Palofox\u2019s admission of gang membership effectively forecloses any claims of prejudice by Leon and Centeno. As to them, the section 186.22 findings were further substantiated by the admissions of their coconspirators, most of whom were further shown to be Sure\u00f1o members through evidence of their gang tattoos. Cell phone records indicated that Centeno had calls on March 16, 2010, to or from phones associated with Gilbert Beltran, Christopher Escobedo, and Christian Rodriguez. His phone was in regular contact with a number associated with Christian Rodriguez during February and March of that year. Thus, even without evidence of his jail classification admission, it was firmly established that Centeno committed counts 11 and 16 in association with gang members and with the intent to further or assist in the conduct of gang members.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">Palofox\u2019s gang findings were established through his own admissions and by evidence of codefendant Leon\u2019s gang associations. The victim of the count 11 robbery had also identified Estevan Landeros and Christian Rodriguez as being among the perpetrators who entered his home, thus removing any doubt about the gang-related nature of that offense. The count 16 findings were further established by evidence of Gilbert Beltran\u2019s involvement. Beltran pawned a ring that was stolen during this robbery after the group returned to Arizona. Palofox was reportedly living with Beltran at the time of his arrest, and the jury heard recordings of a discussion between Palofox and Beltran in which both incriminated themselves. For all of these reasons, it is evident beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury\u2019s verdict was not tainted by the erroneous admission of Centeno\u2019s jail classification statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">VII. <em>Sentencing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">\n<em>A. Consecutive Sentences for Gang-related Home Invasion Robberies</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">Centeno, Leon, and Palofox received consecutive sentences of 15 years to life for their gang-related robbery convictions pursuant to the trial court\u2019s conclusion that such punishment was mandatory under the holding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number><em>People </em>v. <em>Felix </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 651 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 54, 995 P.2d 186] <em>(Felix). </em>As a result, Leon\u2019s convictions on counts 9, 11, and 16 resulted in an aggregate term of 45 years to life in prison. Centeno and Palofox each received sentences of 30 years to life for their convictions on counts 11 and 16. On appeal, Centeno and Palofox argue the trial court misconstrued the <em>Felix </em>decision and acted under a mistaken belief that it had no discretion to impose concurrent sentences for any of the robbery convictions. Leon summarily joins in this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">The Attorney General submits that the issue is forfeited as a result of appellants\u2019 failure to object at the time of sentencing. However, she impliedly concedes the merits of appellants\u2019 argument by urging us to find, to the extent the claim is reviewable, that \u201cthe trial court fully understood its discretionary power\u201d and \u201cproperly exercised its discretion to select consecutive sentences.\u201d We conclude appellants have carried their burden of establishing error.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">Regarding forfeiture, the error complained of may fall within a narrow class of sentencing issues that are reviewable in the absence of a timely objection. \u201c \u2018Failure to exercise a discretion conferred and compelled by law constitutes a denial of a fair hearing and a deprivation of fundamental procedural rights, and thus requires reversal. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.] Where, as here, a sentence choice is based on an erroneous understanding of the law, the matter must be remanded for an informed determination.\u201d <em>(People v. Downey </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 899, 912 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 627].) In any event, we would exercise our discretion to resolve the claim in the interests of fairness and judicial economy, since the matter is already being remanded for other sentencing matters, and to forestall unnecessary ineffective assistance of counsel claims. (See <em>People v. Williams </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 148, 161-162, fn. 6 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 917, 948 P.2d 429]; <em>People v. Lewis </em>(1990) 50 Cal.3d 262, 282 [266 Cal.Rptr. 834, 786 P.2d 892].)</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">1. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">At Leon\u2019s sentencing hearing, defense counsel made statements regarding the anticipated length of his client\u2019s sentence given the section 186.22, subdivision (b) findings. Following a response by the prosecutor, the trial court said: <em>\u201cPeople </em>[v.] <em>Felix, </em>22 Cal.4th 651 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 54, 995 P.2d 186] in 2000. California Supreme Court directly concluded that indeterminate terms of this nature must be served fully consecutive to each other .... We all fully understand it whether we agree with it or not. When I say \u2018we,\u2019 I mean the defense, not necessarily the court.\u201d Later, during the pronouncement of sentence, the court stated: \u201cI\u2019m ordering you committed to the Department of Corrections on count \u2014 each of these counts Nine, Eleven, and Sixteen as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>required by law to the term of 15 years to life. Each of those 15[-]year-to-life terms to run consecutive to each other as pursuant to the case authority that I just referenced here on the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">While sentencing Centeno, the trial court indicated that it would have been inclined to grant him leniency if it had discretion to do so. The relevant statements were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-6\">\u201cThe issue, of course, is what sentence the court should impose. And it seems to me I would agree with the prosecution that in light of everything that I\u2019ve read here, that the court really does not have authority to do otherwise but to impose the sentences with respect to Counts Eleven and Sixteen. But I want to say, in fairness to Mr. Centeno here, and to some future court evaluating this, that if the court believed and understood that it did have the authority to exercise discretion, I might. I might have done that with respect to Mr. Centeno, primarily because of his age and his involvement with a lot of other adults who certainly should have known better.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-7\">\u201cAnd so, you know, I think I want to make \u2014 leave that door open here, because I don\u2019t know what the Appellate Court might do in the future on this subject. But this is a situation where, given his limited involvement in this matter and his age as a minor \u2014 that\u2019s the most important thing in this court\u2019s view, being a minor at the time of the commission of these crimes \u2014 that the court might have exercised its discretion to do other than impose life terms on this case. But in the court\u2019s view, for the reasons that counsel here from the People have a cited authority which is primarily the case of <em>[People v. Jones, supra, </em>47 Cal.4th 566] [the] California Supreme Court has made it clear that sentencing for the crime of robbery in concert, you know, in a home invasion robbery scenario for gang purpose, which is what the jury found to be true here, that that\u2019s not an enhancement. And in this court\u2019s view, therefore, is not subject to relief under [section] 186.22(g) that the defense has asked the court to make \u2014 grant a motion to strike. This is, in fact, an alternate sentence for this crime. And the court has no authority but to impose that alternate sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-8\">\u201cAnd under the cases that I think I\u2019ve cited earlier, and I\u2019ll make reference to now, which is <em>People </em>[v.] <em>Felix, </em>that\u2019s 22 Cal.4th 651, F-E-L-I-X, that\u2019s a 2000 decision of the California Supreme Court, Mr. Lindahl. 22 Cal.4th 651. Essentially, what that says is where there is separate home invasion robberies they are required to be served fully consecutive \u2014 mandatory full consecutive terms .... [T]he mandatory sentence, the only sentence this court can impose is 30 years to life.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b910-9\">The trial court referenced <em>Felix </em>yet again during the pronouncement of sentence for Palofox: \u201cI do agree with your attorney, however, that in light of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>your personal involvement that there is no good reason in this court\u2019s view to impose any consecutive sentencing on the other counts which are, essentially, derivative. Therefore, under <em>People </em>[v.] <em>Felix </em>which I\u2019ve cited earlier and in light of the jury\u2019s findings in this matter, I am ordering you with respect to Counts Eleven and [Sixteen] to be committed to the Department of Corrections for the term of 15 years to life in each of those counts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">2. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">Contrary to the statements of the trial court, the <em>Felix </em>case does not involve alternate penalty provisions, nor does it reference home invasion robberies or section 186.22. The opinion addresses how <em>enhancements </em>are applied to indeterminate sentences. <em>(Felix, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at pp. 654-659.) A term of imprisonment for life or a specified number of years to life is an indeterminate sentence for purposes of California\u2019s statutory sentencing scheme (\u00a7 1170 et seq.). <em>(Felix, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at pp. 657-659.) The <em>Felix </em>opinion merely holds that <em>if </em>a trial court elects to impose consecutive sentences for two or more offenses that require indeterminate life terms, any enhancements attached thereto must be imposed for the full term of the enhancement, rather than one-third of the term as would ordinarily be done under the determinate sentencing laws. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 655-656.)</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">Under section 669, a trial court has discretion to determine whether to impose sentences consecutively or concurrently. The existence of such discretion is explicitly recognized in the <em>Felix </em>opinion. <em>{Felix, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 655 [\u201cWhenever a person is convicted of two or more crimes, the court must impose either concurrent or consecutive sentences. (\u00a7 669.)\u201d].) The Legislature may remove this discretion for certain crimes, but exceptions are typically made clear in the statutory language of the offense. (See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a7 667.6, subd. (d) [sex crimes committed under specified circumstances], 4501.5 [battery committed by a prisoner against a non-prisoner].) Unless otherwise prohibited by statute, sentences for crimes that carry indeterminate life terms may be imposed concurrently. \u201cThat the court\u2019s authority to impose either concurrent or consecutive sentences includes life sentences is made clear by further language in section 669, which provides: \u2018Life sentences, whether with or without the possibility of parole, may be imposed to run consecutively with one another, with any term imposed for applicable enhancements, or with any other term of imprisonment for a felony conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>(In re Maes </em>(2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 1094, 1099 [110 Cal.Rptr.3d 900].)</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">The trial court seems to have conflated two different provisions of section 186.22. Subdivision (b)(1) of the statute provides: <em>\u201cExcept as provided in paragraphs (4) and (5), </em>any person who is convicted of a felony committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with any criminal street gang, with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in any criminal conduct by gang members, shall, upon conviction of that felony, in addition and consecutive to the punishment prescribed for the felony or attempted felony of which he or she has been convicted, be punished [in accordance with subdivision (b)(1)(A), (B) or (C)] . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) In contrast, subdivision (b)(4) of section 186.22 provides, in pertinent part: \u201cAny person who is convicted of a felony enumerated in this paragraph committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with any criminal street gang, with the specific intent to promote, further, or assist in any criminal conduct by gang members, shall, upon conviction of that felony, be sentenced to an indeterminate term of life imprisonment with a minimum term of the indeterminate sentence calculated as the greater of [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] (B) Imprisonment in the state prison for 15 years, if the felony is a home invasion robbery, in violation of subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 213____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">As previously discussed, section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1) is an enhancement provision, while subdivision (b)(4) of the statute is an alternate penalty provision. <em>(Jones, supra, </em>47 Cal.4th at p. 576; <em>People v. Briceno </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 451, 460, fn. 7 [20 Cal.Rptr.3d 418, 99 P.3d 1007].) The latter does not expressly require consecutive sentencing. Trial courts have discretion under section 669 to impose concurrent sentences for multiple convictions of crimes subject to the alternate penalty of 15 years to life under section 186.22, subdivision (b)(4)(B), and <em>Felix </em>does not hold otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">Relief from a trial court\u2019s misunderstanding of its sentencing discretion is available on direct appeal when such misapprehension is affirmatively demonstrated by the record. (See <em>People v. Meloney </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 1145, 1151 [135 Cal.Rptr.2d 602, 70 P.3d 1023]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fuhrman </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 930, 945 [67 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 941 P.2d 1189].) Here, the trial court\u2019s repeated citation to <em>Felix, </em>combined with statements regarding its purported lack of discretion to impose anything other than consecutive sentences for the gang-related home invasion robberies, is most reasonably interpreted as confusion over the scope of its sentencing authority. Since the record does not conclusively show whether the trial court would have exercised its discretion to impose concurrent terms on the robbery convictions if it had known that it had such discretion, appellants are entitled to relief. <em>(People v. Gamble </em>(2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 891, 901 [79 Cal.Rptr.3d 612].) The appropriate remedy is a limited remand to give the trial court an opportunity to exercise its discretion under section 669 as to counts 9, 11, and 16. <em>(Gamble, </em>at p. 901; accord, <em>People v. Belmontes </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 335, 348, fn. 8 [193 Cal.Rptr. 882, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>667 P.2d 686]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 1213, 1228 [54 Cal.Rptr.3d 887] [\u201cGenerally, when the record shows that the trial court proceeded with sentencing on the erroneous assumption it lacked discretion, remand is necessary so that the trial court may have the opportunity to exercise its sentencing discretion at a new sentencing hearing.\u201d].) On remand, the trial court shall exercise its discretion to run the sentences for these counts consecutively or concurrently, and state the reasons for its decision.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Cal.

(\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1)(A) \u2014 (C).) However, if the gang-related crime is a \u201chome invasion robbery,\u201d the defendant faces a sentence of 15 years to life. <em>(Id., </em>subd. (b)(4)(B); see <em>People </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(2009) 47 Cal.4th 566, 571 [98 Cal.Rptr.3d 546, 213 P.3d 997] <em>(Jones)) </em>Section 186.22, subdivision (b)(4)(B) is not an enhancement, but rather an \u201calternate penalty provision,\u201d meaning it sets forth an alternate penalty for the underlying offense if the jury finds the conditions specified in the provision have been satisfied. <em>(Jones, supra, </em>47 Cal.4th at p. 576.) Standing alone, a home invasion robbery conviction carries a maximum sentence of nine years in prison. (\u00a7 213, subd. (a)(1)(A).)
