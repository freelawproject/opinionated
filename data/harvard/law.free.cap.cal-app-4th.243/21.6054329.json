Introduction</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">We affirm the disposition order committing minor M.L. to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Division of Juvenile Facilities (DJF), for a maximum term of six years.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Despite the acknowledged near-absurdity of the rule, our Legislature and Supreme Court mandate that a minor is only eligible for DJF if the minor\u2019s \u201cmost recent offense\u201d alleged in a Welfare and Institutions Code section 602 petition is DJF eligible. In this case, the minor was found to have committed a robbery, which, standing alone, would unquestionably expose him to a DJF commitment. This minor, however, was also found to have committed an additional offense, gun possession, overlapping in time with the robbery. Gun possession is not a DJF-eligible offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">We conclude the \u201cmost recent offense\u201d rule does not bar a DJF commitment in this case. First, the possession offense arguably occurred before, but not after, the robbery. Second, even if the offenses were essentially simultaneous, the \u201cmost recent offense\u201d rule does not eliminate the juvenile court\u2019s discretion to impose a DJF commitment if a minor is currently violent. We further conclude the juvenile court did not abuse its discretion in selecting DJF for this minor and that trial counsel did not render ineffective assistance by not arguing for a reduced maximum commitment term. We do, however, order the trial court to correct a conceded clerical error in its commitment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">II. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b48-11\">Like both parties, we draw a description of the minor\u2019s crimes from the probation department\u2019s April 8, 2014 report.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-12\">A male and female were sitting in a parked vehicle. The minor approached, banged his knuckles on the driver\u2019s side window, and, using coarse language, demanded the male open the door. The male saw a silver gun in the minor\u2019s right hand. The female saw the minor was armed. She perceived the minor was not \u201cplaying around.\u201d The minor then demanded the pair produce their wallets and cell phones. The victims complied, handing over their belongings, including the female\u2019s purse. The minor exclaimed \u201cWest Pittsburg Nigga\u201d and fled the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>The victims contacted the police with a description of the minor and his getaway car. Police quickly located and stopped the car, which was driving evasively, and contacted the minor and a friend. These two were placed in a police car. While there, the minor saw the police talking to the man he had \u201chit.\u201d The minor told his friend \u201cit\u2019s over,\u201d that he had used a loaded gun, and so might \u201cget an armed robbery\u201d and have to go away. The female victim was able to identify the minor as the assailant and both victims identified their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">A petition under Welfare and Institutions Code section 602 alleged two counts, one per victim, of robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 211, 212.5, subd. (c)) with enhancements for personal use of a firearm (Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022.53, subd. (b)), and one count of a minor possessing a firearm capable of being concealed (Pen. Code, \u00a7 29610).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">The minor admitted one robbery charge with a modified enhancement (arming under Pen. Code, \u00a7 12022, subd. (a)(1), rather than personal use) and admitted the possession charge. The petition was sustained as to those counts and otherwise dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">The disposition hearing spanned three days over a period of a month. The juvenile court struggled with whether it had authority to commit the minor to DJF. Probation initially recommended a DJF commitment. Then, after the juvenile court tentatively decided the minor was ineligible, probation recommended a commitment to the youthful offender treatment program. Ultimately, the juvenile court decided the minor was eligible for DJF and committed the minor there for a maximum term of six years on the robbery charge, staying an additional period of eight months on the possession charge under Penal Code section 654.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On the commitment order, the juvenile court indicated that in determining this maximum period of confinement, which was the same length of term an adult might receive, the juvenile court had \u201cconsidered the individual facts and circumstances of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">The minor timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b49-9\">A. <em>Eligibility for Commitment to Department of Juvenile Justice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">\u201cOne of the primary objectives of juvenile court law is rehabilitation, and the statutory scheme contemplates a progressively more restrictive and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>punitive series of dispositions starting with home placement under supervision, and progressing to foster home placement, placement in a local treatment facility, and finally placement at the [DJF].\u201d <em>(In re M.S. </em>(2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 1241, 1250 [95 Cal.Rptr.3d 273].)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">A DJF commitment is barred in this case, asserts the minor, under the \u201cmost recent offense\u201d rule of Welfare and Institutions Code section 733, subdivision (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Section 733 (unspecified statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code) prohibits a DJF commitment when a minor \u201chas been or is adjudged a ward of the court pursuant to Section 602, and the most recent offense alleged in any petition and admitted or found to be true by the court is not described in subdivision (b) of Section 707.\u201d Section 707 lists numerous serious offenses including robbery, but not gun possession. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 733, subd. (c), 707, subd. (b)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">Our Supreme Court has recently considered how troubling and bizarre a literal interpretation of the \u201cmost recent offense\u201d language of section 733 would be, yet determined a literal interpretation was compelled in light of the statute\u2019s lack of ambiguity. <em>(In re D.B. </em>(2014) 58 Cal.4th 941, 947-948 [169 Cal.Rptr.3d 672, 320 P.3d 1136] <em>(D.B.).) </em>Therefore, when \u201ca minor has committed a series of crimes, the court\u2019s ability to impose a DJF commitment, depends <em>entirely </em>on the type of offense the minor <em>happened </em>to commit last.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 947, italics added.) This suggests \u201c \u2018[a] minor who commits a string of violent acts would be immunized from a DJF commitment if the crime spree happened to end with a nonqualifying offense\u2019 \u201d and this \u201creward[s] a minor for committing <em>more </em>crimes.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Moreover, \u201cbecause section 733(c) examines only the last offense committed\u201d not the entire slate of committed offenses enumerated in the latest petition, \u201cthe statute will sometimes require that currently violent offenders and sex offenders be placed in local settings with juveniles whose offenses are far less serious.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 947-948.) These results, said the Supreme Court, were troubling, but not absurd. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 948.)</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">Thankfully, this case does not require us to take another step toward troubling results or absurdity.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">The minor claims his possession charge, concededly not a DJF-eligible offense, occurred last in time and continued after the robbery, thus rendering his robbery charge irrelevant for disposition purposes. We do not accept the minor\u2019s premise.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>First, the minor\u2019s gun possession necessarily began <em>before </em>the robbery. The two crimes ended at the same time, shortly after the taking, when the police stopped the minor and his friend, who had been driving evasively, and located the gun and the victims\u2019 property. As our Supreme Court has held, while a defendant becomes guilty of robbery after the slightest movement of a victim\u2019s property, \u201cthe crime of robbery continues \u2018as long as the loot is being carried away to a place of temporary safety.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Navarette </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 458, 502 [133 Cal.Rptr.2d 89, 66 P.3d 1182].) While driving evasively shortly after the taking, the robbery was still ongoing. Under these circumstances, we could conclude the robbery was the \u201cmost recent offense\u201d; in any case, there is no way we could conclude the possession offense occurred last.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">At best, we might view the offenses as part of a single transaction. Indeed, the juvenile court, in light of the robbery charge, suspended imposition of sentence on the possession charge under Penal Code section 654, subdivision (a), which applies only when a single \u201cact ... is punishable in different ways by different provisions of law.\u201d Such a determination does not bar a DJF commitment under Welfare and Institutions Code section 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Section 733 was enacted to address budget concerns related to DJF by reducing \u201cthe number of juvenile offenders housed in state facilities.\u201d <em>(D.B., supra, </em>58 Cal.4th at p. 948; see <em>In re Greg F. </em>(2012) 55 Cal.4th 393, 409 [146 Cal.Rptr.3d 272, 283 P.3d 1160].) It was meant to divert from DJF those youthful offenders adjudicated for nonviolent, nonserious offenses. <em>(In re Greg F., supra, </em>55 Cal.4th at p. 409.) There was also a belief that \u201c \u2018most counties\u2019 \u201d provided rehabilitative services \u201c \u2018better and for less cost\u2019 \u201d than the state, especially for less serious offenders. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">The legislative history also \u201cconsistently stresses,\u201d however, \u201cthat only wards <em>who are not currently violent </em>will be diverted from state to local responsibility.\u201d <em>(In re Greg F., supra, </em>55 Cal.4th at p. 410, italics added.) \u201c[I]t is clear that the Legislature intended to preserve the possibility of DJF commitments for violent offenders and sex offenders. In keeping with this clear legislative intent, it is not reasonable to interpret the realignment legislation as restricting the juvenile court\u2019s ability to order an appropriate disposition for such offenders. Nothing in the legislative history surrounding the enactment of section 733(c) suggests the Legislature intended to strip juvenile courts of their long-held discretion\u201d in such matters. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">If a minor commits a violent DJF-eligible offense and a noneligible offense at the same time, there can be no question the minor is \u201ccurrently violent\u201d and the juvenile court should have discretion to select DJF. <em>(In re Greg F., supra, </em>55 Cal.4th at p. 410.) This is a reasonable reading of section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>733\u2019s \u201cmost recent offense\u201d requirement, one that accounts for the statute\u2019s legislative history and the history of juvenile court discretion. A contrary reading of section 733 is not required by its text. It would also be unreasonable. It would, defying all logic and expectations, permit a DJF commitment for a robber or other violent offender only if he or she does <em>not </em>also concurrently commit a secondary, compounding offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">For all these reasons, the minor was eligible for a DJF commitment despite section 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">B.-D.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">IV. Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">The disposition order is affirmed, but the juvenile court shall correct the commitment order to reflect a six-year maximum term. The juvenile court shall deliver the corrected order to DJF and any other pertinent person or entity.</p>\n<judges id=\"b52-9\">Humes, P. J., and Margulies, J., concurred.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b49-11\"> \u201cAn act or omission that is punishable in different ways by different provisions of law shall be punished under the provision that provides for the longest potential term of imprisonment, but in no case shall the act or omission be punished under more than one provision. An acquittal or conviction and sentence under any one bars a prosecution for the same act or omission under any other.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 654, subd. (a).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b50-10\"> DJF was formerly the California Youth Authority (CYA). A 2005 statute made the name change. (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 202, subd. (e)(5), 1000, 1703, subd. (c), &amp; 1710, subd. (a).) We use the name DJF uniformly, even when referring to older cases and statutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b52-10\">See footnote, ante, page 21.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
