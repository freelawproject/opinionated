J.</author>\n<p id=\"AbC\">\u2014 Plaintiff appeals from the judgment entered after the trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion for directed verdict in this action alleging breach of an insurance contract and bad faith denial of coverage. The trial court expressed its intention to instruct the jury that plaintiff\u2019s property damage loss was covered by his policy only if it was caused by perils specifically listed in the collapse coverage provision and no others. Because it was undisputed that other perils contributed to some extent to the loss, plaintiff conceded he could not prevail if the jury was so instructed. The trial court also granted defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on plaintiff\u2019s claim for punitive damages. Plaintiff appeals, contending the trial court\u2019s intended jury instruction violated the efficient proximate cause doctrine and there was sufficient evidence to permit the jury to determine whether plaintiff met his burden of proving his claim for punitive damages. We find no error in the ruling on the punitive damages claim. We find merit in plaintiff\u2019s challenge to the proposed jury instruction. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for retrial of plaintiff\u2019s causes of action alleging breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, but not the claim for punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">\n<em>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">Plaintiff owned a rental house covered by an insurance policy issued by defendant. On December 6, 2010, he submitted a claim that stated plaintiff believed there was water damage to the flooring that might have come from the walls, and there was mold as well. Defendant sent an independent insurance adjustor, Douglas Hoppe, to investigate the claim the next day. Hoppe viewed the condition of the house and took photographs. His initial report stated the house seemed to be settling, possibly due to a water leak. The floors in some of the rooms were sinking, the bathtub was sinking, water was drizzling out of both the shower head and the bathtub faucet, the front door would not open, and there was mold in every room. Plaintiff told the adjustor the tenants had reported the problem to him two or three months before, and he had asked them to move out so repairs could be made. Plaintiff reported his claim to defendant after the tenants moved out.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">The independent adjustor recommended defendant have an engineer inspect the house. In January 2011, Michael Jundt, a structural engineer, inspected the site and took photographs; he returned later, with plaintiff\u2019s permission, to cut a hole in the floor to gain access to the subfloor area and investigate conditions below the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">Jundt\u2019s report reflected multiple potential leaks in the roof, gutters in disrepair, downspouts that originally deposited water at the base of the walls <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>of the house, but had become disconnected from the gutters, and evidence that a faucet or hose had been spraying the wall in one area for a significant length of time. He found water damage corresponding to these areas. Jundt reported the toilet and bathtub both leaked, and the floor beneath the bathtub had sunk two and a half inches. The northwest bedroom had a depression in the floor, eight inches deep and five to six feet across; there was damage due to leakage from the toilet in the closet of that bedroom. The closet in the southwest bedroom showed evidence of past damage and multiple repairs. The kitchen was water damaged and showed evidence of past termite infestation. The wood at the base of the back door to the kitchen and the utility room floor near the exterior door were also rotted and damaged by past termite infestation. The living room floor was not level and was separating from the wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">The subfloor area lacked adequate ventilation, preventing the moisture below the house from drying. Jundt opined the original construction of the subfloor area without proper ventilation was not up to code at the time of construction. The various sources of moisture \u2014 roof leaks, gutters and downspouts that did not channel the water away from the house, a faucet spraying water on the exterior of the house, leaking toilet and bathtub, and humidity\u2014 contributed to the damage to the house, along with poor construction, termite damage and decay.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Defendant denied coverage of plaintiff\u2019s loss, citing multiple policy exclusions, including exclusions for damage caused by seepage or leakage of water from a plumbing system, deterioration, mold, wet or dry rot, settling of foundations, walls or floors, earth movement, water damage, neglect, weather conditions, acts or decisions of any person, and faulty or defective design, workmanship, repair, construction, or maintenance. Plaintiff then retained a public adjustor, Michael DeCesare, to assist him in his claim. DeCesare wrote to defendant and expressed his disagreement with defendant\u2019s conclusion that the loss was not covered by the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Dissatisfied with defendant\u2019s response to DeCesare\u2019s communications, plaintiff filed suit against defendant, alleging breach of the insurance contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Plaintiff alleged the house collapsed and the policy provided coverage for collapse. The policy, excluded coverage for collapse, \u201cother than as provided in OTHER COVERAGES 9.\u201d \u201cOther Coverage 9\u201d provided coverage for losses involving collapse of a building or part of a building \u201ccaused only by one or more\u201d of a list of perils, including hidden decay, hidden insect damage, and weight of contents, equipment, or people.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">At trial, Hoppe testified to the damage he observed in his investigation of the loss. Jundt testified to his investigation of the loss and gave his opinions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>regarding the causes of the damage to plaintiff\u2019s house. Testimony from plaintiff and the former tenants addressed the condition of the house prior to the time plaintiff reported the damage to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s expert, Robert Bresee, a general contractor, testified to perceived errors in Jundt\u2019s report, and to his opinions of the condition of the house and the cause of the damage. He had to open up the floor to investigate the cause of the damage. He noted the floors in the northwest bedroom and the living room were resting on the ground, and opined the cause was dry rot, decay, and termite damage. He opined the water in the subfloor area came from within the walls, where it was not readily visible to occupants of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">The evidence presented by both sides indicated there were multiple causes of the damage to plaintiff\u2019s house. Plaintiff\u2019s theory was that the coverage for collapse due to hidden decay or hidden insect damage applied, if either of those perils was the predominant cause of the collapse of the structure. Plaintiff requested that the trial court give a standard jury instruction explaining that, when a loss is caused by a combination of covered and- excluded risks, the loss is covered if the most important or predominant cause is a covered; risk. (CACI No. 2306.) Defendant instead proposed a special jury instruction (No. 12) placing on plaintiff the burden of proving the collapse of the house was \u201ccaused <em>only </em>by one or more\u201d of the perils listed in Other Coverage 9. Defendant\u2019s special instruction No. 12 specified that there was no coverage if the cause of the collapse involved any peril other than those listed. Plaintiff opposed giving the special instruction proposed by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">When the trial court indicated its intention to give part of defendant\u2019s proposed special instruction No. 12, plaintiff indicated that giving such an instruction was tantamount to directing a verdict in favor of defendant because there was no dispute the damage to the house was caused by perils in addition to those listed in Other Coverage 9. Defendant then moved for a directed verdict on both causes of action. The trial court granted the motion, concluding defendant\u2019s proposed special instruction was legally correct, based on the unambiguous language of the Other Coverage 9 provision of the policy. The trial court entered judgment in favor of defendant, and plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">I. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">A directed verdict is reviewed de novo. <em>(Brassinga </em>v. <em>City of Mountain View </em>(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 195, 210 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 660].) \u201c \u2018On appeal from a judgment on a directed verdict, appellate courts view the evidence in the light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number><em>most favorable to appellant. </em>All conflicts must be resolved and inferences drawn in appellant\u2019s favor; and the judgment will be reversed if there was substantial evidence . . . tending to prove all elements of appellant\u2019s case.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Colbaugh v. Hartline </em>(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1516, 1521 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 213].) Interpretation of statutes and contracts is also reviewed de novo. <em>(Morgan v. United Retail Inc. </em>(2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 1136, 1142 [113 Cal.Rptr.3d 10]; <em>Consolidated World Investments, Inc. v. Lido Preferred Ltd. </em>(1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 373, 378 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 524].)</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">II. <em>Contract Provisions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Plaintiff\u2019s insurance policy indicated coverage A covered his dwelling. The basic insuring provision of the policy, defining \u201cPERILS INSURED AGAINST,\u201d stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-7\">\u201cWe insure for risk of direct physical loss to the property described in Coverages A and B except</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-8\">\u201c1 collapse other than as provided in Other Coverage <em>9 ... .\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-9\">The Other Coverage 9 section contained a list of six items:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-10\">\u201c9 Collapse We insure for risk of direct physical loss to covered property involving collapse of a building or any part of a building caused only by one or more of the following</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-11\">\u201ca Perils Insured Against in Coverage C Personal Property These perils apply to covered building and personal property for loss insured by this other coverage</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-12\">\u201cb hidden decay</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-13\">\u201cc hidden insect or vermin damage</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-14\">\u201cd weight of contents equipment animals or people</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-15\">\u201ce weight of rain which collects on a roof</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-16\">\u201cf use of defective material or methods in construction remodeling or renovation if the collapse occurs during the course of the construction remodeling or renovation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-17\">The \u201cGENERAL EXCLUSIONS\u201d section of the policy contained exclusions for earth movement, water damage, neglect by the insured, inadequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>or defective design, workmanship, construction, remodeling, or materials, and inadequate or defective maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">Plaintiff contends Other Coverage 9 provides coverage for the damage to his house because the building, or part of the building, collapsed and the predominant cause of the loss was hidden decay and hidden insect damage. Plaintiff contends that, pursuant to the efficient proximate cause doctrine, because the predominant cause of the loss was a covered peril, the policy provides coverage for the loss despite any other peril that contributed to the loss, and the trial court should have determined that a jury instruction to that effect should have been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">III. <em>Efficient Proximate Cause Doctrine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">In California, the efficient proximate cause doctrine is \u201cthe preferred method for resolving first party insurance disputes involving losses caused by multiple risks or perils, at least one of which is covered by insurance and one of which is not.\u201d <em>(Julian </em>v. <em>Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co. </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 747, 753 [27 Cal.Rptr.3d 648, 110 P.3d 903] <em>(Julian).) </em>It is codified in Insurance Code section 530, which provides: \u201cAn insurer is liable for a loss of which a peril insured against was the proximate cause, although a peril not contemplated by the contract may have been a remote cause of the loss; but he is not liable for a loss of which the peril insured against was only a remote cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">Insurance Code section 532 appears to conflict with Insurance Code section 530: \u201cIf a peril is specially excepted in a contract of insurance and there is a loss which would not have occurred but for such peril, such loss is thereby excepted even though the immediate cause of the loss was a peril which was not excepted.\u201d (Ins. Code, \u00a7 532.) The Supreme Court resolved the apparent conflict between these sections in <em>Sabella v. Wisler </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 21 [27 Cal.Rptr. 689, 377 P.2d 889]. In <em>Sabella, </em>the insurer relied on Insurance Code section 532 in arguing that, if the loss would not have occurred \u201c \u2018but for\u2019 \u201d the excluded peril, then the exclusion precluded coverage for the loss. <em>(Sabella, </em>at p. 33.) The court rejected that argument: \u201c[I]f section 532 were construed in the manner contended for by defendant insurer, where an excepted peril operated to-any extent in the chain of causation so that the resulting harm would not have occurred \u2018but for\u2019 the excepted peril\u2019s operation, the insurer would be exempt even though an insured peril was the proximate cause of the loss.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>That result would be contrary to section 530, which provided for coverage when the peril insured against proximately caused the loss. <em>{Sabella, </em>at p. 33.) The court interpreted the \u201cbut for\u201d cause referred to in section 532 to mean the peril that proximately caused the loss, and the \u201c \u2018immediate cause of the loss\u2019 \u201d to mean the peril immediate in time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>to the occurrence of the damage. <em>(Sabella, </em>at pp. 33-34.) The court established this general rule: \u201c \u2018[I]n determining whether a loss is within an exception in a policy, where there is a concurrence of different causes, the efficient cause \u2014 the one that sets others in motion \u2014 is the cause to which the loss is to be attributed, though the other causes may follow it, and operate more immediately in producing the disaster.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 31-32; see <em>Garvey v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. </em>(1989) 48 Cal.3d 395, 404 [257 Cal.Rptr. 292, 770 P.2d 704] <em>(Garvey).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The efficient proximate cause referred to in <em>Sabella </em>has also been called the predominant cause or the most important cause of the loss. <em>(Garvey, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at p. 403; <em>Julian, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at p. 754.) \u201cBy focusing the causal inquiry on the most important cause of a loss, the efficient proximate cause doctrine creates a \u2018workable rule of coverage that provides a fair result within the reasonable expectations of both the insured and the insurer.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Julian, </em>at p. 754.)</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">\u201cPolicy exclusions are unenforceable to the extent that they conflict with [Insurance Code] section 530 and the efficient proximate cause doctrine.\u201d <em>(Julian, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at p. 754.) Thus, an insurer cannot contract around the efficient proximate cause doctrine to give broader effect to its policy exclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">In <em>Garvey, </em>the plaintiffs\u2019 house was insured with an all-risk homeowners policy issued by the defendant. <em>(Garvey, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at p. 399.) The policy insured against all risks of physical loss to the property covered, unless coverage was excluded. <em>(Ibid.) </em>It excluded losses \u201c \u2018caused by, resulting from, contributed to or aggravated by any earth movement . . . ,\u2019 and losses caused \u2018by . . . settling . . . of . . . foundations, walls, floors, roofs or ceilings.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 399-400.)</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">An addition to the plaintiffs\u2019 house began to pull away from the main structure, and they filed a claim with the insurer. The defendant denied the claim, based on the exclusions for earth movement and settling. <em>(Garvey, supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at p. 400.) The plaintiffs sued, contending the loss was caused by contractor negligence, and such negligence was not an excluded peril under the policy. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court held the efficient proximate cause rule applied to the plaintiffs\u2019 first party property damage claim, rejecting application of a concurrent proximate cause rule applicable in third party liability insurance cases. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 405-408.) The court reversed the trial court\u2019s directed verdict in favor of the plaintiffs and remanded so a properly instructed jury could decide which peril was the efficient proximate cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 loss. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 412-413.)</p>\n<p id=\"b692-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>Thus, although the policy purported to exclude coverage if earth movement or settling merely \u201ccontributed to\u201d the loss, the court held the efficient proximate cause doctrine applied, so that the exclusion precluded coverage only if an excluded peril \u2014 earth movement or settling \u2014 was the efficient proximate cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 loss. (Garvey, <em>supra, </em>48 Cal.3d at pp. 403, 412-413.)</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">In <em>Howell v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. </em>(1990) 218 Cal.App.3d 1446 [267 Cal.Rptr. 708] <em>(Howell),</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the plaintiff\u2019s property was located on a hillside subject to landslides. <em>(Howell, </em>at p. 1449.) One summer, a fire destroyed the vegetation on the slope; the following winter, unusually heavy rains combined with the bare slope to cause a landslide, which damaged structures on the plaintiff\u2019s property. The plaintiff\u2019s expert concluded the landslide probably would not have occurred if the ground cover had not been destroyed. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s homeowners policy insured against accidental direct physical loss to the dwelling and other structures. <em>(Howell, supra, </em>218 Cal.App.3d at p. 1449.) It excluded coverage of loss \u201c \u2018which would not have occurred in the absence of one or more of the following excluded events. We do not insure for such loss regardless of: a) the cause of the excluded event; or b) other causes of the loss; or c) whether other causes acted concurrently or in any sequence with the excluded event to produce the loss . . . .\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Earth movement and water damage were on the list of excluded events. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1449-1450.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">After the plaintiff\u2019s insurer denied her claim, she sued; the defendant moved for summary judgment, relying on the exclusions for earth movement and water damage. <em>(Howell, supra, </em>218 Cal.App.3d at p. 1451.) The plaintiff argued the fire was the efficient proximate cause of the loss, because it permitted the landslide to occur. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">On appeal, the defendant contended the exclusion precluded coverage because the loss would not have occurred but for the excluded peril of earth movement. The court responded: \u201cStated simply, the important question presented by this case is whether a property insurer may contractually exclude coverage when a covered peril is the efficient proximate cause of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>loss, but an excluded peril has contributed or was necessary to the loss. We conclude that a property insurer may not limit its liability in this manner, since the statutory and judicial law of this state make the insurer liable whenever a covered peril is the \u2018efficient proximate cause\u2019 of the loss, regardless of other contributing causes. Consequently, the policy exclusions at issue in this case are not enforceable to the extent they conflict with California law.\u201d <em>(Howell, </em>supra, 218 Cal.App.3d at p. 1452, fn. omitted.) Because there was a triable issue of fact regarding whether the fire or earth movement was the efficient proximate cause of the loss, the court reversed the summary judgment. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1459-1460.)</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">A. <em>Plaintiff\u2019s contentions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Plaintiff contends the language \u201ccaused only by one or more of the following\u201d in Other Coverage 9 means that this is a complete list of the perils causing collapse that are covered under the policy. If any one or any combination of the listed perils causes the collapse, the loss is covered. If some unlisted peril contributes to the collapse, the efficient proximate cause doctrine requires that the jury determine which cause is the predominant or most important. If the predominant cause is a peril listed in Other Coverage 9, then the loss by collapse would be covered. If the predominant cause is not a listed peril, then the loss would not be covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">Consistent with this interpretation, plaintiff requested that the jury be instructed with CACI No. 2306, which provides: \u201cYou have heard evidence that the claimed loss was caused by a combination of covered and excluded risks under the insurance policy. When a loss is caused by a combination of covered and excluded risks under the policy, the loss is covered only if the most important or predominant cause is a covered risk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">B. <em>Defendant\u2019s contentions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b693-9\">Defendant contends \u201ccaused only by one or more of the following\u201d in Other Coverage 9 has a more restrictive effect than plaintiff\u2019s interpretation gives it. Defendant contends the use of the word \u201conly\u201d means that a collapse is a covered loss only if no peril other than those listed contributes to the collapse. In its view, the decision in <em>Julian, </em>supra, 35 Cal.4th 747, authorizes the use of interactive perils to define an exclusion, so' it is permissible to cover collapse caused only by one or a combination of specified perils. Defendant contends the efficient proximate cause doctrine does not apply to such a provision. Under defendant\u2019s interpretation, if any peril other than those listed in Other Coverage 9 contributes to the collapse in any way or to any degree, then coverage is excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>The trial court agreed with defendant and indicated it would instruct the jury with defendant\u2019s proposed special instruction No. 12, and would not give CACI No. 2306. Defendant\u2019s proposed special instruction, as the trial court intended to give it, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-4\">\u201cMr. Vardanyan contends that the damage to his property is covered under the insurance policy\u2019s provision for \u2018collapse\u2019 to a building or any part of a building caused by \u2018hidden decay\u2019 or \u2018hidden insect or vermin damage.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-5\">\u201cIf you find that the property or a part of the property collapsed, Mr. Vardanyan bears the burden of proving that the collapse was caused <em>only </em>by one or more of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-6\">\u201c(1) Fire or lightning; windstorm or hail; explosion; riot or civil commotion; aircraft; vehicles; smoke; vandalism or malicious mischief; damage by burglars; falling objects; weight of ice, snow, or sleet; accidental discharge or overflow of water or steam from within a plumbing, heating, or air conditioning system, or [from] within a household appliance; sudden and accidental tearing apart, cracking, burning or bulging of a steam or hot water heating system, an air conditioning system, or an appliance for heating water; freezing of a plumbing, heating or air conditioning system or of a household appliance; sudden and accidental damage from artificially generated electrical current;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-7\">\u201c(2) Hidden decay;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-8\">\u201c(3) Hidden insect or vermin damage;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-9\">\u201c(4) Weight of contents, equipment, animals or people;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-10\">\u201c(5) Weight of rain which collects on a roof;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-11\">\u201c(6) Use of defective material or methods in construction, remodeling or renovation if the collapse occurs during the course of the construction, remodeling or renovation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-12\">\u201cThe insurance policy\u2019s coverage for collapse does not apply if the cause of the collapse involved any cause other than those listed above.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-13\">IV. Julian v. Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-14\">In <em>Julian, </em>heavy rains caused the slope above the plaintiffs\u2019 home to fail; this led to a landslide which caused a tree to crash into the plaintiffs\u2019 house. <em>(Julian, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at p. 751.) Their homeowners policy insured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>against risks of direct physical loss to property, unless the loss was excluded. The exclusions section provided: \u201c \u2018We do not insure against loss caused directly or indirectly by any of the following. Such loss is excluded regardless of any other cause or event contributing concurrently or in any sequence to the loss: ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The list that followed included earth movement (defined to include landslide) and water damage. A second exclusion provided a loss was not covered if it was caused by weather conditions. \u201c \u2018However, this exclusion only applies if weather conditions contribute in any way with a cause or event excluded in [the prior list] to produce the loss ....\u2019\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 751-752.) It was undisputed that losses proximately caused by weather conditions that did not contribute with an excluded cause were covered by the policy. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 750.)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">The insurer moved for summary judgment, contending the policy excluded each of the perils that might be the efficient proximate cause of the loss: earth movement, third party negligence, and weather conditions that contributed with landslide, an excluded cause. <em>(Julian, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at p. 752.) The trial court granted the motion. The court summarized the plaintiffs\u2019 argument on appeal: \u201cThe policy purports to exclude losses caused by weather conditions, but only where weather conditions \u2018contribute in any way with\u2019 earth movement (e.g., landslide), water damage (e.g., flood), or another cross-referenced, excluded peril. Under the plain terms of the policy, losses caused by weather conditions that do not \u2018contribute in any way with\u2019 earth movement, water damage, etc. are covered. Thus the coverage inquiry turns on whether earth movement, water damage, or the like \u2018contribute[d] in any way with\u2019 weather conditions to create a loss. This \u2018contribute^] in any way\u2019 language, they posit, has the same sweeping and pernicious effect as the policy terms involved in <em>Howell </em>and <em>Garvey </em>had, in that it allows the insurer to defeat coverage for a loss proximately caused by weather conditions merely by finding a remote peril somewhere \u2014 no matter how distant, minor, or independent from the weather conditions \u2014 in the causal background. Hartford, meanwhile, argues that the weather conditions clause properly excludes a specific peril, and that neither [Insurance Code] section 530 nor the efficient proximate cause doctrine prohibits it from defining excluded perils as it chooses.\u201d <em>(Julian, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at pp. 758-759.)</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">The court framed the threshold question as: \u201cwhether [Insurance Code] section 530 and the efficient proximate cause doctrine inflexibly prohibit an insurer from insuring against some manifestations of weather conditions, but not others.\u201d <em>(Julian, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at p. 759.) The court concluded they did not. <em>(Ibid.) </em>It expressed concern that, in some situations, the \u201c \u2018contribute in any way with\u2019 \u201d language linking weather conditions to other excluded perils could be used to circumvent the efficient proximate cause doctrine. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 760.) In <em>Julian, </em>however, the court addressed \u201conly the application of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>the weather conditions clause to a loss occasioned by a rain-induced landslide.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>It considered the peril of rain-induced landslide to be \u201ca genuine one, not a mere drafting fiction,\u201d and a commonly understood risk of loss. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The landslide was not an independent cause of the plaintiffs\u2019 loss, but was dependent on the weather condition of heavy rains. The court concluded: \u201c[T]o the extent the weather conditions clause excludes the specific peril of rain inducing a landslide, there is no violation of [Insurance Code] section 530 or the efficient proximate cause doctrine.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">V. <em>Application to This Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">\n<em>A. Contract interpretation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">\u201cAs a question of law, the interpretation of an insurance policy is reviewed de novo under well-settled rules of contract interpretation.\u201d <em>(E.M.M.I. Inc. v. Zurich American Ins. Co. </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 465, 470 [9 Cal.Rptr.3d 701, 84 R3d 385].) The mutual intention of the parties as it existed at the time of contracting governs interpretation. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1636.) \u201c \u2018Such intent is to be inferred, if possible, solely from the written provisions of the contract. [Citation.] The \u201cclear and explicit\u201d meaning of these provisions, interpreted in their \u201cordinary and popular sense,\u201d unless \u201cused by the parties in a technical sense or a special meaning is given to them by usage\u201d [citation], controls judicial interpretation.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Waller </em>v. <em>Truck Ins. Exchange, Inc. </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 1, 18 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 370, 900 P.2d 619].) \u201c \u2018Any ambiguous terms are resolved in the insureds\u2019 favor, consistent with the insureds\u2019 reasonable expectations.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Safeco Ins. Co. v. Robert S. </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 758, 763 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 844, 28 P.3d 889].) Policy exclusions are strictly construed; exceptions to exclusions are broadly construed in favor of the insured. <em>(E.M.M.I., </em>at p. 471.)</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">The policy\u2019s coverage for plaintiff\u2019s house is all-risk or open peril coverage; the policy provides that plaintiff is insured \u201cfor risk of direct physical loss to the property,\u201d with specified exceptions or exclusions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> One of the exceptions to coverage is \u201ccollapse other than as provided in Other Coverage 9.\u201d As provided in Other Coverage 9, the policy covers collapse caused \u201conly\u201d by one or more of specified perils. As defendant construes this provision, it runs afoul of the efficient proximate cause doctrine. Defendant\u2019s construction would exclude coverage any time a peril not listed in Other Coverage 9 contributed to the loss, even minimally. Under defendant\u2019s construction, even if the collapse was predominantly caused by a listed peril, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>such as hidden decay or hidden insect damage, if an unlisted peril contributed to it in some minor way, coverage would be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\"><em>Julian </em>does not change the result. The policy provision in issue in <em>Julian </em>defined an exclusion from coverage. It took one specified peril and provided that coverage for it was excluded, but only when it combined with specified excluded perils. The court did not hold that the provision was valid in all cases. In fact, it expressed its concern that, under other circumstances, the provision could be used to circumvent the efficient proximate cause doctrine. <em>(Julian, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at p. 760.) <em>Julian </em>held only that the combination of perils in issue in that case effectively created a single peril (rain-induced landslide) that was a genuine peril, understandable to a reasonable insured. Therefore, the court concluded the provision did not violate the efficient proximate cause doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Here, the policy provision in issue defines coverage, not an exclusion. It provides that collapse is covered if caused by specific listed perils. Under defendant\u2019s interpretation, if any of the specified perils combined with any other unspecified peril to cause the collapse, coverage would be excluded. Defendant has not shown that any of the listed perils plaintiff relies on for coverage, when combined with any unlisted peril defendant contends caused or contributed to the loss, created a single peril, that is a genuine peril, and that a reasonable insured would readily understand to be a separate, excludable peril.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">The combination of a listed, covered peril or perils, with a host of potential unspecified, unlisted perils is in itself problematic. A reasonable insured would not anticipate that a listed, covered peril, if combined with some completely unrelated, unspecified peril, would result in an exclusion of coverage. This is particularly true when the provision is a coverage provision, not an exclusion; a reasonable insured would understand that, if one of the specified perils was the predominant or most important cause of the collapse, the loss would be covered.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">Further, the combined peril in <em>Julian </em>\u2014 rain-induced landslide \u2014 was one to which each individual peril contributed substantially. It did not present a situation in which exclusion would result even though the otherwise excluded peril contributed only minimally to the loss, while the otherwise covered peril contributed the lion\u2019s share. Here, no such link has been shown between any listed and unlisted perils alleged to have contributed to the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">Defendant also cites <em>Freedman </em>v. <em>State Farm Ins. Co. </em>(2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 957 [93 Cal.Rptr.3d 296] <em>(Freedman) </em>as another case approving the policy exclusion of interactive perils. The <em>Freedman </em>court concluded <em>\u201cJulian </em>applie[d] straightforwardly\u201d to its case. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 962.) We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>In <em>Freedman, </em>a contractor drove a nail through a pipe while remodeling the plaintiffs\u2019 bathroom. <em>(Freedman, supra, </em>173 Cal.App.4th at p. 959.) The plaintiffs discovered it years later, after corrosion around the nail caused a leak and extensive water damage. The plaintiffs\u2019 all-risk policy contained exclusions for corrosion and water damage, including leakage from a plumbing system. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 960.) It provided that those exclusions would apply \u201c \u2018regardless of whether one or more of the following: (a) directly or indirectly cause, contribute to or aggravate the loss; or (b) occur before, at the same time, or after the loss or any other cause of the loss.\u2019 \u201d The list that followed included defect, inadequacy, or fault in design, workmanship, or construction of any property, which the court referred to as a third party negligence provision. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">When the defendant denied coverage, the plaintiffs sued, contending the contractor\u2019s negligence, a covered peril, was the predominant or efficient proximate cause of the loss. <em>(Freedman, supra, </em>173 Cal.App.4th at p. 959.) The defendant moved for summary judgment, contending it did not matter which peril was the efficient proximate cause of the loss because each possible efficient proximate cause was excluded: corrosion, leakage of water, and third party negligence when it interacted with an excluded peril, such as corrosion or leakage. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 961.) The court affirmed the trial court\u2019s grant of the defendant\u2019s summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The court analyzed the application of <em>Julian </em>to its facts as follows: \u201cThe third party negligence provisions of the Freedmans\u2019 policy exclude third parties\u2019 negligent conduct and defective workmanship whenever they interact with an excluded peril, just as the Julians\u2019 policy excluded weather conditions whenever they interacted with an excluded peril. Corrosion and continuous or repeated seepage or leakage of water are excluded perils under the Freedmans\u2019 policy, just as earth movement was excluded under the Julians\u2019 policy. Thus, the Freedmans\u2019 policy excludes contractor-negligence-induced corrosion and contractor-negligence-induced continuous or repeated seepage or leakage of water, just as the Julians\u2019 policy excluded a rain-induced landslide. The Freedmans have introduced no evidence that contractor negligence caused their loss in any way apart from the nail\u2019s role in triggering corrosion and a water leak, just as the Julians introduced no evidence that weather conditions caused their loss in any way apart from rain\u2019s role in triggering a landslide. Accordingly, the Freedmans\u2019 loss is not covered, just as the Julians\u2019 loss was not covered.\u201d <em>(Freedman, supra, </em>173 Cal.App.4th at pp. 962-963.)</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The Julians\u2019 policy excluded weather conditions when they combined with specified excluded perils to cause the loss. The Freedmans\u2019 policy, however, did not exclude coverage for third party negligence. Rather, it provided that the exclusions, including the exclusions for corrosion and leakage of water, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>would be effective regardless of whether other perils, including covered perils such as third party negligence, combined with the excluded perils to cause the loss. That provision violated the efficient proximate cause doctrine because it would exclude coverage even if the covered peril was the predominant cause of the loss and the excluded peril was a minimal contributing factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The <em>Freedman </em>court equated \u201ccontractor-negligence-induced\u201d corrosion and leakage with the Julians\u2019 rain-induced landslide without analysis. The <em>Julian </em>court did not conclude that every exclusion of interacting perils in a policy is acceptable and does not violate the efficient proximate cause rule. It stated that, if the exclusion of weather conditions when combined with other excluded perils would permit the insurer to deny coverage when the loss was caused 99 percent by weather conditions and 1 percent by earth movement or water damage, it \u201cwould raise troubling questions regarding the clause\u2019s consistency with the efficient proximate cause doctrine. Denial of coverage for such a loss would suggest the provision of illusory insurance against weather conditions, raising concerns similar to those implicated in Howell.\u201d <em>(Julian, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at p. 760.) The court rejected the insurer\u2019s \u201cimplicit argument that an insurer\u2019s ability to combine otherwise separate perils into a single peril will invariably render [Insurance Code] section 530 and the efficient proximate cause doctrine irrelevant.\u201d <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">The <em>Julian </em>court analyzed only the specific combination of perils before it. \u201cRain inducing a landslide is a commonly understood risk of loss and the frequent and direct causal relationship between rain and landslide is widely and easily understood. The Hartford engineer\u2019s report attested that the type of slope failure involved in this case was \u2018always\u2019 caused by water. The landslide here was not an independent causal agent in the Julians\u2019 loss; by all accounts it was dependent on' the weather condition of heavy rains. And a reasonable insured would readily grasp the difference between a loss caused by weather conditions alone and a loss caused by weather conditions that induce a landslide, undermining the threat of illusory insurance. Accordingly, <em>to the extent the weather conditions clause excludes the specific peril of rain inducing a landslide, </em>there is no violation of [Insurance Code] section 530 or the efficient proximate cause doctrine.\u201d <em>(Julian, supra, </em>35 Cal.4th at p. 760, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">The <em>Freedman </em>court did not similarly analyze the peril of \u201ccontractor-negligence-induced\u201d corrosion or \u201ccontractor-negligence-induced\u201d leakage. It did not discuss whether such combined perils were a commonly understood risk of loss, or whether there was a frequent and direct causal relationship between contractor negligence and corrosion, or between contractor negligence and leakage, that was widely and easily understood. The <em>Freedman </em>court simply seemed to assume an insurance policy could exclude any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>combination of interacting perils without violating the efficient proximate cause doctrine or Insurance Code section 530, despite the contrary statements in <em>Julian.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">We conclude plaintiff\u2019s interpretation of the Other Coverage 9 provision is the correct interpretation, consistent with the efficient proximate cause doctrine. A policy cannot extend coverage for a specified peril, then exclude coverage for a loss caused by a combination of the covered peril and an excluded peril, without regard to whether the covered peril was the predominant or efficient proximate cause of the loss. Other Coverage 9 identifies the perils that are covered when the loss involves collapse. If any other peril contributes to the loss, whether the loss is covered or excluded depends upon which peril is the predominant cause of the loss.  To the extent the term \u201ccaused only by one or more\u201d of the listed perils can be construed to mean the contribution of any unlisted peril, in any way and to any degree, would result in the loss being excluded from coverage, the provision is an unenforceable attempt to contract around the efficient proximate cause doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Accordingly, CACI No. 2306, rather than defendant\u2019s proposed special instruction No. 12, was the correct instruction to give to the jury. Because the trial court granted the motion for a directed verdict based on the effect the erroneous proposed jury instruction would have had on plaintiff\u2019s case, we must reverse the judgment and remand to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">B. <em>Burden of proof</em></p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">Plaintiff also contends defendant\u2019s proposed special instruction No. 12 was improper because it placed on plaintiff the burden of proving his loss fell within the provision of Other Coverage 9, instead of requiring defendant to prove that the loss was excluded. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">\u201cWhen an issue of coverage exists, the burden is on the insured to prove facts establishing that the claimed loss falls within the coverage provided by the policy\u2019s insuring clause. [Citations.] Once the insured has made that showing, the burden is on the insurer to prove the claim is specifically excluded.\u201d <em>(MRI Healthcare Center of Glendale, Inc. v. State Farm General Ins. Co. </em>(2010) 187 Cal.App.4th 766, 777 [115 Cal.Rptr.3d 27].) \u201c[I]n an action upon an all-risks policy . . . (unlike a specific peril policy), the insured does not have to prove that the peril proximately causing his loss was covered by the policy. This is because the policy covers <em>all risks </em>save for those risks specifically excluded by the policy. The insurer, though, since it is denying liability upon the policy, must prove the policy\u2019s noncoverage of the insured\u2019s loss \u2014 that is, that the insured\u2019s loss was proximately caused by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>peril specifically excluded from the coverage of the policy.\u201d <em>(Strubble </em>v. <em>United Services Auto. Assn. </em>(1973) 35 Cal.App.3d 498, 504 [110 Cal.Rptr. 828] <em>(Strubble).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">In <em>Strubble, </em>the plaintiffs\u2019 house was insured with an all-risk property insurance policy that included an earthquake endorsement. <em>(Strubble, supra, </em>35 Cal.App.3d at pp. 502, 504.) The house was built on a cliff that had experienced a landslide in the past. After a minor earthquake, the plaintiffs discovered a crack in the ground beneath the house, which began to cause damage to the house and other improvements. The parties disputed whether the cause was earthquake (a covered peril) or other earth movement (an excluded peril). The court held the trial court properly instructed the jury that the defendant had the burden of proving the loss was proximately caused by an excluded peril. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 503-505.) \u201c[Defendant insurer, in order to establish its defense of noncoverage of its policy, had the burden of proving that plaintiffs\u2019 loss was proximately caused by the excluded peril of earth movement other than earthquake (an included peril). To accomplish this defendant insurer had to prove that the included peril of earthquake did not proximately cause the loss that plaintiffs, the insured, suffered. In other words, it had to negative its exception (earthquake) to its exclusion (earth movement) since the burden of proof of its defense of noncoverage of the policy sued on rested on it.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 504-505, fn. omitted.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">CACI No. 2306 is consistent with <em>Strubble. </em>After instructing that a loss caused by a combination of covered and excluded risks is covered only if the most important or predominant cause is a covered risk, CACI No. 2306 continues with alternative paragraphs, either placing the burden on the defendant to prove the most important or predominant cause of the loss was a risk excluded under the insurance policy, or placing the burden on the plaintiff to prove the most important or predominant cause of the loss was a risk covered under the policy. The Directions for Use explain that \u201c[f]or all-risk homeowner\u2019s policies . . . once the insured establishes basic coverage, the insurer bears the burden of proving the loss was caused by an excluded peril. In contrast, for \u2018named perils\u2019 policies (for example, fire insurance) the insured bears the burden of proving the loss was caused by the specified peril.\u201d (Directions for Use, CACI No. 2306.)</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s policy provided all-risk coverage for his house. It did not name specific perils insured against. Rather, it provided that defendant covered the house for \u201crisk of direct physical loss to the property,\u201d with specified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>exceptions and exclusions. One exception was for \u201ccollapse other than as provided in Other Coverage 9.\u201d Thus, the burden was on defendant to prove not just collapse, but collapse other than as provided in Other Coverage 9. Defendant\u2019s proposed special instruction No. 12 instead placed the burden on plaintiff to prove that the collapse fell within Other Coverage 9. Because the instruction improperly shifted the burden of proof, the trial court erred in its decision to instruct the jury with defendant\u2019s proposed special instruction and in granting defendant\u2019s motion for directed verdict based on the decision to give that instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">VI, VIL<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">\n<em>DISPOSITION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">The judgment on plaintiff\u2019s claims for breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing is reversed and remanded for retrial.
