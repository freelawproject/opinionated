D), the current medical marijuana ordinance of the City of Los <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1033\">*1033</page-number>Angeles (the City), enacted by voters in 2013. We conclude for that and other reasons the trial court correctly dismissed appellants\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-4\">By way of further introduction, this is the first of two related appeals challenging the medical marijuana ordinances in the City. In this appeal, nearly 20 medical marijuana collectives and a handful of medical marijuana patients, who are officers of the collectives, bring numerous challenges to Prop. D.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> None of the appellants\u2019 arguments relies on any facts specific to any individual appellant; we therefore consider their arguments collectively. The sole defendant is the City. The City prevailed on a demurrer to appellants\u2019 first amended complaint. Appellants seek leave to amend their complaint to raise a previously unpled challenge to Prop. D. We conclude that Prop. D was a properly enacted ordinance, reject all of appellants\u2019 other arguments, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">\n<em>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">Appellants\u2019 principal charge on appeal is a multifaceted attack on the process by which Prop. D was enacted. They also challenge the substantive provisions of the ordinance, particularly as those terms relate to registration under the City\u2019s prior medical marijuana ordinances. The factual history of this case is, as it turns out, the legal history of medical marijuana in Los Angeles.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">A. <em>State Statutes </em>\u2014 CUA <em>and MMPA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b919-8\">The history of legalizing medical marijuana in California begins with the Compassionate Use Act of 1996 (CUA) enacted by statewide initiative. The CUA is codified at Health and Safety Code section 11362.5. It provides that two specific criminal penalties (relating to the possession and cultivation of marijuana) \u201cshall not apply to a patient, or to a patient\u2019s primary caregiver, who possesses or cultivates marijuana for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>personal medical purposes of the patient upon the written or oral recommendation or approval of a physician.\u201d (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11362.5, subd. (d).) While subdivision (a) of section 11362.5 sets forth broad purposes for the statute \u2014 \u201c[t]o ensure that seriously ill Californians have the right to obtain and use marijuana for medical purposes where that medical use is deemed appropriate and has been recommended by a physician . . .\u201d \u2014 the substantive provisions of the law are actually quite narrow, providing not an affirmative right, but merely a limited criminal immunity. <em>(Riverside, supra, </em>56 Cal.4th at p. 739; <em>Conejo Wellness Center, Inc. v. City of Agoura Hills </em>(2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 1534, 1544 [154 Cal.Rptr.3d 850] <em>(Conejo).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">In 2003, the Legislature followed the CUA with the Medical Marijuana Program Act (MMPA). (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11362.7 et seq.) The MMPA expands the criminal immunities of the CUA; qualified patients are now immune from liability for violating six different sections of the Health and Safety Code. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11362.765.) The MMPA also discusses, for the first time, the collective cultivation of marijuana. It provides that qualified patients and their primary caregivers \u201cwho associate within the State of California in order collectively or cooperatively to cultivate cannabis for medical purposes, shall not solely on the basis of that fact be subject to state criminal sanctions\u201d under the same six specified sections of the Health and Safety Code. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11362.775.)</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">Together, the CUA and MMPA constitute \u201climited exceptions to the sanctions of this state\u2019s criminal and nuisance laws in cases where marijuana is possessed, cultivated, distributed, and transported for medical purposes.\u201d <em>(Riverside, supra, </em>56 Cal.4th at p. 739.) They have no effect on the federal ban on marijuana use. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 740.) Nor do they create a state statutory <em>right </em>to use, cultivate, or collectively cultivate medical marijuana. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 762; <em>420 Caregivers, LLC v. City of Los Angeles </em>(2012) 219 Cal.App.4th 1316, 1342 [163 Cal.Rptr.3d 17] <em>(420 Caregivers); County of Los Angeles v. Hill </em>(2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 861, 869 [121 Cal.Rptr.3d 722] <em>(Hill); People v. Urziceanu </em>(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 747, 773 [33 Cal.Rptr.3d 859].)</p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">B. <em>The City\u2019s First Attempt at Legislation </em>\u2014 Interim <em>Control Ordinance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">In 2007, the City made its first attempt to regulate medical marijuana dispensaries, \u201c[i]n response to citizen complaints and law enforcement concerns about the proliferation of storefront medical marijuana dispensaries within City limits.\u201d <em>(420 Caregivers, supra, </em>219 Cal.App.4th at p. 1326.) City Ordinance No. 179027 provided as a temporary measure that no \u201cMedical Marijuana Dispensaries\u201d could be established or operated within the City. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>\u201cMedical Marijuana Dispensary\u201d was broadly defined to mean \u201cany use, facility or location, including but not limited to a retail store, office building, or structure that distributes, transmits, gives, dispenses, facilitates or otherwise provides marijuana in any manner, in accordance with State law, in particular [the CUA and MMPA] inclusive.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The ordinance came with a major exception: its prohibition did not apply to any dispensary established before the ordinance\u2019s effective date (Sept. 14, 2007) and operating in accordance with state law, if the owner or operator of the dispensary were to register with the City Clerk by filing certain identified documents within 60 days (by Nov. 13, 2007). <em>(420 Caregivers, </em>at pp. 1326-1327.) This \u201cInterim Control Ordinance\u201d was intended to allow the City the time it needed to develop a comprehensive strategy for regulating medical marijuana dispensaries.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b921-4\">C. <em>The City\u2019s Second Attempt </em>\u2014 Grandfather <em>Prior Registrant Ordinance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">In 2010, the City passed its second attempt to regulate dispensaries. City Ordinance No. 181069 (Grandfather Prior Registrant Ordinance) was the City\u2019s attempt at a more permanent ordinance. It imposed regulations on medical marijuana collectives.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It defined a \u201ccollective\u201d as an \u201cassociation, composed solely of four or more qualified patients . . . and designated primary caregivers .. . who associate at a particular location to collectively or cooperatively cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, in strict accordance with [the CUA and MMPA].\u201d (City Mun. Code, former \u00a7 45.19.6.1.) The ordinance required all collectives to register, and facially capped the maximum number of collectives in the City at 70, to be proportionally distributed by population. (City Mun. Code, former \u00a7 45.19.6.2.) However, the ordinance provided that the number of collectives could in fact exceed 70, as it included a grandfather clause that allowed previously existing collectives to remain if they were, among other things, properly registered under the Interim Control Ordinance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It appeared that there were substantially more than 70 collectives in operation that could qualify under the grandfather clause; as such, if it had become fully operational, the Grandfather Prior Registrant Ordinance would likely have had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>effect of prohibiting all collectives that had not previously registered under the Interim Control Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">D. <em>The City\u2019s Third Attempt </em>\u2014 The <em>Grandfather/Lottery Ordinance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">Many collectives brought suit against the City, challenging the terms of the Grandfather Prior Registrant Ordinance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The collectives sought a preliminary injunction, and the trial court concluded, among other things, that the Grandfather Prior Registrant Ordinance denied equal protection to collectives which had not registered under the Interim Control Ordinance. <em>(420 Caregivers, supra, </em>219 Cal.App.4th at p. 1330.)</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">The City then enacted a third ordinance, as an urgency measure, to modify the Grandfather Prior Registrant Ordinance to respond to the trial court\u2019s ruling while the City\u2019s appeal of the preliminary injunction was pending. City Ordinance No. 181530 changed the grandfathering provision of the Grandfather Prior Registrant Ordinance to allow all collectives which had been in operation on or before September 14, 2007, to register for the right to participate in a lottery, from which 100 collectives would be chosen for inspection and, if all other requirements were satisfied, registration. Pursuant to the terms of the ordinance, all collectives that met the prerequisites for the lottery were <em>required </em>to register for it shortly after the ordinance became effective.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We call this the \u201cGrandfather/Lottery Ordinance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b922-7\">E. <em>Appeal of the Injunction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b922-8\">The City appealed the preliminary injunction against the Grandfather Prior Registrant Ordinance, and, on July 3, 2012, we issued our opinion in <em>420 Caregivers </em>reversing the preliminary injunction and upholding the original grandfathering provision of the Grandfather Prior Registrant Ordinance. <em>(420 Caregivers, supra, </em>219 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1338-1339.) Specifically, we recognized that straightforward grandfathering provisions generally survive rational relation equal protection review, and we concluded that the further requirement of compliance with prior registration laws was a similarly valid basis on which to distinguish between businesses. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The case was not immediately final, however; review was granted on September 19, 2012, while the Supreme Court was considering, in <em>Riverside, </em>issues of state law preemption of local medical marijuana regulation. Ultimately, the Supreme Court would conclude that state law <em>does not </em>preempt local medical marijuana regulation, and upheld a city\u2019s total ban on collectives. <em>(Riverside, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number><em>supra, </em>56 Cal.4th at p. 762.) As a result, it dismissed review in <em>420 Caregivers </em>and, in November 2013, ordered partial publication of-the <em>420 Caregivers </em>opinion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b923-4\">F. <em>The City\u2019s Fourth Attempt </em>\u2014 A <em>Brief Ban</em></p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">In July 2012, prior to <em>Riverside </em>and finality of <em>420 Caregivers, </em>the City enacted City Ordinance No. 182190, which banned nearly all collectives. A referendary petition was brought to the City Council regarding the ordinance and, after considering comments, objections and proposals from the public, the City Council repealed the ban on October 9, 2012. (City Ord. No. 182286.) This particular ordinance has no effect on our disposition of the appeal. It is included only for historical completeness.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">G. <em>The Enactment of Prop. D</em></p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">It was in this environment that Prop. D came to be. On January 29, 2013, some four months after the repeal of the prior ban on collectives, the City Council introduced, and on February 5, 2013, it passed, an ordinance calling a special election for a public vote on Prop D. (City Ord. No. 182443.) On May 21, 2013, the voters approved Prop. D by majority vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">Prop. D enacted City Ordinance No. 182580, which repealed the existing sections of the municipal code relating to medical marijuana, and enacted new provisions. Under Prop. D, a \u201cmedical marijuana business\u201d is defined as any \u201clocation where marijuana is cultivated, processed, distributed, and delivered, or given away to a qualified patient ... or a primary caregiver.\u201d (City Mun. Code, \u00a7 45.19.6.1, subd. A.) Prop. D then provides that it is \u201cunlawful to own, establish, operate, use, or permit the establishment or operation of a medical marijuana business . . .\u201d in the City. (City Mun. Code, \u00a7 45.19.6.2, subd. A.) The next section of Prop. D, however, provides an exception for medical marijuana businesses that meet a litany of requirements, the most important of which for our purposes is that the medical marijuana business must have timely registered under <em>both </em>the Interim Control Ordinance and the Grandfather/Lottery Ordinance. (City Mun. Code, \u00a7 45.19.6.3, subds. B. &amp; C.) Other requirements include restrictions on hours of operation, limits on proximity to land zoned residential, and limits on proximity to schools, parks, religious institutions, and other medical marijuana businesses. (City Mun. Code, \u00a7 45.19.6.3, subds. G., K. &amp; L.)</p>\n<p id=\"b923-9\">Just as the CUA and MMPA provide only immunities against certain criminal statutes, not a right to use and collectively cultivate medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>marijuana <em>(Riverside, supra, </em>56 Cal.4th at pp. 739, 762-763), Prop. D does not provide a right for these excepted medical marijuana businesses to operate, but only limited immunity. City Municipal Code section 45.19.6.3 provides as follows: \u201cNotwithstanding the activities prohibited by this Article, and notwithstanding that the medical marijuana business is not and shall not become a permitted use in the City for as long as this Article remains in effect, a medical marijuana business shall not be subject to the remedies set forth in Los Angeles Municipal Code Sections 11.00 [public nuisance and misdemeanor] or 12.27.1 [administrative nuisance abatement proceedings] solely on the basis of: (1) an activity prohibited by Section 45.19.6.2 [Prop. D\u2019s ban on medical marijuana businesses]; and (2) the fact that medical marijuana business is not a permitted use in the City, . . . only if that medical marijuana business does not violate any of the [enumerated] medical marijuana business restrictions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">H. <em>Appellants\u2019 Operative Complaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">Appellants filed their complaint on September 16, 2013, and their operative first amended complaint two days later. The operative complaint contains 15 causes of action challenging Prop. D. Briefly stated, the complaint alleges that Prop. D:</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">First cause of action: denies appellants procedural and substantive due process;</p>\n<p id=\"b924-7\">Second cause of action: violates their right to equal protection;</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">Third cause of action: is an unconstitutional special law that favors old collectives over new ones (Cal. Const., art. IV, \u00a7 16);</p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">Fourth cause of action: unconstitutionally grants special privileges and immunities to some preexisting nonconforming collectives, but not others (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 7, subd. (b));</p>\n<p id=\"b924-10\">Fifth cause of action: is preempted by Health and Safety Code section 11570, governing drug house abatement;</p>\n<p id=\"b924-11\">Sixth cause of action: is not a proper exercise of local regulatory power under <em>Riverside',</em></p>\n<p id=\"b924-12\">Eighth cause of action: violates appellants\u2019 rights to privacy and association;</p>\n<p id=\"b924-13\">Ninth cause of action: constitutes improper land use discrimination based on disability (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65008);</p>\n<p id=\"b925-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>Tenth cause of action: constitutes improper discrimination by a business establishment (the City) on the basis of medical condition (Civ. Code, \u00a7 52);</p>\n<p id=\"b925-4\">Eleventh cause of action: threatens appellants with criminal sanctions for exercising their state rights to use and collectively cultivate medical marijuana (Civ. Code, \u00a7 52.1);</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">Twelfth cause of action: constitutes disability discrimination by the City (Gov. Code, \u00a7 11135); and</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">Thirteenth cause of action: constitutes an improper taking without just compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">The complaint also alleges:</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">Fourteenth cause of action: that the City\u2019s passage of a motion to instruct the City\u2019s Police Department (LAPD) to work with the federal government to create a city wide enforcement strategy is a waste of public funds;</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">Fifteenth cause of action: certain document disclosure provisions of Prop. D violate appellants\u2019 Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination; and</p>\n<p id=\"b925-10\">Sixteenth cause of action: Prop. D unnecessarily regulates access to medical marijuana without a rational basis or compelling reason.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b925-11\">The City demurred, arguing, in large part, that the court decisions in <em>Riverside </em>and <em>420 Caregivers </em>barred many of appellants\u2019 causes of action. Additional arguments addressed other causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">I. <em>Appellants\u2019 New Theory </em>\u2014 City <em>Charter Section 558</em></p>\n<p id=\"b925-13\">After the City demurred, but before appellants opposed the demurrer, appellants moved ex parte for a temporary restraining order (TRO) prohibiting enforcement of Prop. D. The basis for appellants\u2019 motion was their new theory that Prop. D was void <em>ab initio </em>because it was adopted in violation of City Charter section 558 (charter section 558). That section sets forth procedures to be applied \u201cto the adoption, amendment or repeal of ordinances, orders or resolutions by the Council\u201d concerning zoning or land use. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number><em>(Ibid.) </em>Among other procedures, charter section 558, subdivision (b)(2) requires that, after initiation, such a proposed ordinance is to be referred to the City Planning Commission before action by the City Council. Appellants argued that, because Prop. D was not referred to the planning commission, it was void.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">The City opposed the application for a TRO, arguing that charter section 558 applies to the adoption of <em>ordinances </em>\u201cby the Council,\u201d while Prop. D was adopted by the <em>electorate. </em>The City therefore took the position that no submission to the planning commission was required, and Prop. D was properly adopted. The trial court denied the TRO.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">J. <em>The Court Sustains the Demurrer</em></p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">In response to the City\u2019s demurrer, appellants argued that <em>Riverside </em>and <em>420 Caregivers </em>were distinguishable \u2014 in part because appellants had a <em>right </em>that the City would comply with charter section 558. In other words, appellants incorporated their argument that Prop. D was void <em>ab initio </em>into an argument that Prop. D\u2019s substantive provisions violated their rights.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> At the hearing on the demurrer, the trial court specifically asked appellants\u2019 counsel how the complaint would be amended if leave were granted. Counsel responded that appellants would flesh out their argument based on charter section 558. The court replied that it was accepting appellants\u2019 allegations regarding charter section 558 and considering them as if formally made.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">The court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend. The court addressed each cause of action and concluded none stated a claim. Specifically, the court found that most of appellants\u2019 complaint was barred by <em>Riverside </em>and <em>420 Caregivers. </em>The court rejected appellants\u2019 charter section 558 argument, concluding the provision simply did not apply to( ordinances adopted by referendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">K. <em>The Court Denies Appellants\u2019 Motion for Reconsideration</em></p>\n<p id=\"b926-9\">Appellants then moved for reconsideration, in an attempt to better allege their charter section 558 argument. The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>L. <em>Judgment and Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b927-4\">Judgment of dismissal was entered on June 6, 2014. Appellants filed a timely notice of appeal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">M. <em>Appellants\u2019 New Theory on Appeal </em>\u2014 Government <em>Code Section 65804</em></p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">On appeal, appellants argue for the first time they should be granted leave to amend to assert a new theory \u2014 that Prop. D was adopted in violation of Government Code section 65804, a section of the state Planning and Zoning Law (Gov. Code, \u00a7 65000 et seq.), which imposes minimal procedural standards for city zoning hearings. This argument was not advanced either in opposition to the demurrer or in support of the TRO. We consider this argument in our Discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">It is not entirely clear from appellants\u2019 briefing which causes of action, and which arguments, appellants intend to pursue on appeal.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In an abundance of caution \u2014 and because we conclude none of appellants\u2019 arguments has merit \u2014 we address each of them. We first consider appellants\u2019 arguments based on the alleged improper enactment of Prop. D \u2014 including the charter section 558 and Government Code section 65804 arguments to which appellants devote the bulk of their briefing. We then turn to the challenges to the substance of Prop. D on which appellants\u2019 complaint was in fact founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">\n<em>A. Standard of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">\u201cIn reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint against a general demurrer, we are guided by long-settled rules. \u2018We treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law. [Citation.] We also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.\u2019 [Citation.] Further, we give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context. [Citation.] When a demurrer is sustained, we determine whether the complaint states <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1042\">*1042</page-number>facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. [Citation.] And when it is sustained without leave to amend, we decide whether there is a reasonable possibility that the defect can be cured by amendment: if it can be, the trial court has abused its discretion and we reverse; if not, there has been no abuse of discretion and we affirm. [Citations.] The burden of proving such reasonable possibility is squarely on the plaintiff. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Blank </em>v. <em>Kirwan </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318 [216 Cal.Rptr. 718, 703 P.2d 58].) \u201cTo meet [the] burden of showing abuse of discretion, the plaintiff must show how the complaint can be amended to state a cause of action. [Citation.] However, such a showing need not be made in the trial court so long as it is made to the reviewing court.\u201d <em>(William S. Hart Union High School Dist. v. Regional Planning Com. </em>(1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 1612, 1621 [277 Cal.Rptr. 645].)</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">B. <em>Prop. D Was Lawfully Enacted by Referendum</em></p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">Appellants\u2019 challenge to the enactment of Prop. D encompasses four different arguments. First, appellants argue that Prop. D was enacted in violation of Government Code section 65804. Second, appellants argue that recently enacted legislation supports their Government Code section 65804 argument. Third, appellants argue that Prop. D was enacted in violation of charter section 558. Fourth, appellants argue that Prop. D grants the equivalent of a conditional use permit or variance to the grandfathered collectives, without satisfying the requirements for a conditional use permit or variance. Each argument is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">1. <em>Prop. D\u2019s Enactment Did Not Violate Government Code Section 65804</em></p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">Government Code section 65804 provides for certain minimal procedural requirements for all local zoning hearings.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The statute is part of the state\u2019s zoning act. While the bulk of the zoning act\u2019s requirements do not apply to charter cities, such as Los Angeles (\u00a7 65803), the minimal procedures of section 65804 do.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>By its terms, the zoning act is intended \u201cto provide only a minimum of limitation in order that counties and cities may exercise the maximum degree of control over local zoning matters.\u201d (\u00a7 65800.) It provides that the legislative body of any county or city may adopt zoning ordinances, - which establish restrictions on land use.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (\u00a7 65850.) When zoning ordinances are adopted or amended, certain procedures must be followed. (\u00a7 65853.)</p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\">The minimal procedural requirements all cities (including charter cities like Los Angeles) must follow in section 65804, include the following, \u201cAll local city and county zoning agencies shall develop and publish procedural rules for conduct of their hearings so that all interested parties shall have advance knowledge of procedures to be followed. <em>The procedural rules shall incorporate the procedures in Section 65854.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) The \u201cprocedures in Section 65854\u201d include a planning commission hearing. Appellants argue that such a hearing is required before a zoning ordinance is adopted; the City does not appear to disagree in principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">The City argues, however, that the zoning act requirements apply only to the enactment of ordinances by <em>local legislative bodies </em>and not to the enactment of ordinances by <em>initiative or referendum </em>(whether in a charter city or general law city). The City is correct. In 1976, the Supreme Court concluded that zoning act \u201cnotice and hearing provisions govern only ordinances enacted by city council action and do not limit the power of municipal electors, reserved to them by the state Constitution, to enact legislation by initiative.\u201d <em>(Associated Home Builders etc., Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Livermore </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 582, 588 [135 Cal.Rptr. 41, 557 P.2d 473] <em>(Associated Home Builders).) </em>In rejecting previous authority (e.g., <em>Hurst </em>v. <em>City of Burlingame </em>(1929) 207 Cal. 134 [277 R 308]), the court stated that \u201cthe Legislature never intended the notice and hearing requirements of the zoning law to apply to the enactment of zoning initiatives.\u201d <em>(Associated Home Builders, </em>at p. 594.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>Appellants try to distinguish <em>Associated Home Builders </em>by arguing that the case applies only to matters of strictly municipal concern, whereas the zoning act\u2019s notice and hearing requirements are themselves matters of statewide concern. Appellants rely on <em>Committee of Seven Thousand </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 491, 511 [247 Cal.Rptr. 362, 754 P.2d 708] <em>(Committee of Seven Thousand) </em>for the proposition that <em>Associated Home Builders </em>was limited to matters of municipal, not statewide, concern. Dicta in <em>Associated Home Builders </em>had suggested that if the zoning act were interpreted to extend to matters enacted by initiative, that conclusion itself would be of doubtful constitutionality, as interfering with the constitutional right of municipal initiative. <em>(Associated Home Builders, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d at pp. 494 \u2014 595.) <em>Committee of Seven Thousand </em>held that this language in <em>Associated Home Builders </em>was limited to the context of matters of municipal concern; that is, a state law cannot interfere with the constitutional right of municipal initiative on wholly municipal matters, but can override the power of municipal initiative on statewide matters. <em>(Committee of Seven Thousand, </em>at p. 511.) That the power of municipal initiative can be limited by the state in matters of statewide concern is an adjunct of the law of state/local preemption. <em>Committee of Seven Thousand </em>made no attempt to limit the holding of <em>Associated Home Builders </em>\u2014 that the notice and hearing provisions set forth in the zoning act did not limit the power of municipal initiative because the zoning act had never been intended to apply to local initiatives. <em>{Committee of Seven Thousand, </em>at p. 510.) That the zoning act, like nearly every other state statute, reflects a matter of statewide concern does not mean that it was intended to apply to initiatives. Putting it another way, the holding of <em>Associated Home Builders </em>is that when the Legislature enacted the zoning act as a matter of statewide concern, it chose not to apply its procedural protections to municipal initiatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">In their reply brief, appellants place reliance on language from <em>Taschner </em>v. <em>City Council </em>(1973) 31 Cal.App.3d 48, 64 [107 Cal.Rptr. 214] <em>(Taschner) </em>stating that presenting one\u2019s case to the electorate in the course of an initiative or referendum is no match for presenting one\u2019s case to the planning commission. But <em>Taschner </em>was expressly disapproved in <em>Associated Home Builders, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d at page 596, footnote 14. The same argument was also rejected in <em>Arnel Development Co. v. City of Costa Mesa </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 511, 524 [169 Cal.Rptr. 904, 620 P.2d 565], which concluded that landowners\u2019 rights are adequately protected. \u201cWhen zoning is enacted by the city council, land owners by statute are entitled to notice and hearing. [Citation.] When zoning is enacted by initiative, land owners have the same opportunity as their opponents to present their case to the electorate.\u201d (I<em>bid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b931-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>We conclude that any failure to follow the zoning act notice and hearing requirements for council-enacted ordinances has no effect on the validity of Prop. D.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\">2. <em>Recent State Legislation </em>\u2014 Medical <em>Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">While this appeal was pending, California enacted the Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act (MMRSA), which, among other things, creates a state licensing scheme for medical marijuana. (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 19300 et seq., added by Stats. 2015, ch. 689, \u00a7 4.) We sought additional briefing on whether this act had any impact on this appeal. In response, appellants argue that MMRSA demonstrates that regulation of medical marijuana is now a matter of statewide concern, which therefore preempts municipal regulation by initiative without a planning commission hearing. The conclusion does not follow. If regulation of medical marijuana is a matter of statewide concern, Prop. D, which regulates medical marijuana solely within the City\u2019s borders, is still a municipal initiative on a wholly municipal matter \u2014 which was properly enacted without a planning commission hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">3. <em>Prop. D\u2019s Enactment Did Not Violate City Charter Section 558</em></p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">Pursuant to the zoning act, charter cities may develop their own procedures for adopting and amending zoning ordinances. (\u00a7 65803.) The City did so. (See City Charter, \u00a7\u00a7 550-566.) As part of its responsibilities, the City Planning Commission is required to \u201cmake recommendations concerning . . . proposed zoning ordinances in accordance with [Section] 558.\u201d (City Charter, \u00a7 551, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">Charter section 558, subdivision (a) states: \u201cThe requirements of this section shall apply to the adoption, amendment or repeal of ordinances, orders or resolutions by the Council concerning\u201d a list of matters, including zoning. Subdivision (b) of section 558 states, \u201cProcedures for the adoption, amendment or repeal of ordinances, orders or resolutions described in subsection (a) shall be prescribed by ordinance, subject to the following limitations . . . .\u201d Appellants direct our attention to subdivision (b)(2), which provides that, after initiation, \u201cthe proposed ordinance . . . shall be referred to the . . . Planning Commission for its report and recommendation . . . .\u201d Appellants argue that Prop. D is void because it was enacted in violation of charter section 558, as it was not referred to the planning commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>The flaw in appellants\u2019 argument is that charter section 558, by its plain language, does not apply to ordinances enacted by referendum, such as Prop. D. \u201c \u2018Generally, the same principles of construction applicable to statutes apply to the interpretation of municipal charters. [Citations.] The courts must always look first to the express language of the [law] to ascertain its meaning.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(City of San Diego v. Shapiro </em>(2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 756, 789 [175 Cal.Rptr.3d 670].) Subdivision (a) of charter section 558 specifically states that it applies only \u201cto the adoption, amendment or repeal of ordinances, orders or resolutions by the Council.\u201d Prop. D was not adopted by the City Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">Appellants claim that referenda must satisfy the requirements of charter section 558 because of charter section 460. Charter section 460, entitled \u201cSubject of Referendum\u201d provides, in pertinent part, that \u201cthe Council is authorized to submit to a vote of the registered voters of the City, at any election for any purpose at which all the registered voters of the City are entitled to vote, any proposed ordinance, order or resolution, <em>that the Council itself might adopt.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) They argue that the emphasized language is a procedural limitation on referenda; that is, the council may only submit a proposed ordinance to the voters when that proposed ordinance had proceeded through all necessary procedures before the council itself could have adopted it by council vote alone. We disagree. Section 460 is concerned with the subject matter of referenda; the emphasized language means only that the City Council cannot submit to the voters any proposed ordinance which it is not within the lawful jurisdiction of the council to enact.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">Our conclusion is supported by charter section 450, entitled \u201cSubject of Initiative.\u201d Section 450 is identical to charter section 460\u2019s referendum requirement except it applies to initiatives. It provides, \u201cAny proposed ordinance <em>which the Council itself might </em>adopt\u201d may be submitted to the council by initiative petition. (Italics added.) Were appellants\u2019 interpretation of the italicized language correct, it would mean that before an initiative petition could be submitted to the City Council, its proponents would have to satisfy all of the necessary procedural requirements for enactment of an ordinance by the council \u2014 an absurd conclusion, and one at odds with the populist spirit of the initiative process. It is apparent that \u201cwhich the Council itself might adopt,\u201d as used in both charter sections 450 and 460 is simply a limit on substantive subject matter and not an incorporation of procedural requirements imposed on the council before the council may enact an ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>4. <em>Prop. D Does Not Grant the Equivalent of a Conditional Use Permit or Variance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\">In their last procedural challenge to the enactment of Prop. D, appellants suggest that Prop. D, in effect, grants a conditional use permit or variance to those medical marijuana businesses qualifying for exemption without satisfying the procedural or substantive requirements for a conditional use permit or variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Conditional use permits and variances differ from each other. <em>(Essick v. Los Angeles </em>(1950) 34 Cal.2d 614, 623 [213 P.2d 492].) A conditional use permit grants the permittee the right to one of an enumerated list of uses or activities which are allowed <em>only </em>by individual permit. (City Mun. Code, \u00a7 12.24, subds. U., V. &amp; W.) Depending on the use or activity, a different decision maker is authorized to hold a hearing and make an initial decision on whether to grant the permit. (City Mun. Code, \u00a7 12.24, subds. C. &amp; D.) In contrast, a variance grants an individual exception to the City\u2019s zoning ordinances when strict application of the zoning ordinance would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships (among other requirements). (City Charter, \u00a7 562, subd. (c).) An application for a variance results in a hearing before the zoning administrator. (City Mun. Code, \u00a7 12.27, subds. B. &amp; C.) The granting of conditional use permits and variances are administrative or quasi-judicial acts. (Essick, at p. 623.)</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">Facially, Prop. D does not grant either a conditional use permit or a variance. By definition, it is not a conditional use permit, as medical marijuana businesses are <em>not </em>among the itemized uses permitted only by conditional use permit. Nor does Prop. D grant a variance; it does not mention any specific parcel of property at all, or make any determinations regarding any specific parcel. On the contrary, Prop. D expressly provides that a medical marijuana business is not enumerated as a permitted use, and that the zoning administrator \u201cshall not have the authority to determine that the use of any building, structure, location, premises or land as a medical marijuana business may be permitted in any zone; to add medical marijuana business to the Official Use List of the City; or to grant any variance authorizing any medical marijuana business.\u201d (City Mun. Code, \u00a7 45.19.6.5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">Appellants argue that Prop. D effectively grants conditional use permits or variances because it provides that collectives meeting its requirements \u201cshall not be subject\u201d to misdemeanor prosecution or nuisance abatement proceedings solely on the basis of operating a medical marijuana business that is not a permitted use. (City Mun. Code, \u00a745.19.6.3.) This is not an affirmative grant of any land use right (permit or variance) but a limited immunity applicable only when certain conditions are met. Whether or not this type of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>immunity is unconstitutionally unfair (an issue we consider below), the grant of immunity itself was a legislative act, not subject to the administrative requirements of a conditional use permit or variance.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">C. <em>Prop. D Survives All of Appellants\u2019 Substantive Challenges</em></p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">We now turn to appellants\u2019 substantive challenges to the terms of Prop. D. As discussed above, Prop. D bans all medical marijuana businesses, but grants a limited exemption from civil or criminal liability to collectives meeting a list of requirements, including registration pursuant to both the Interim Control Ordinance and the Grandfather/Lottery Ordinance. None of the appellant collectives met those prior-registration requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">We pause to observe that running freely throughout appellants\u2019 arguments as to each cause of action is appellants\u2019 claim that there is a \u201cright\u201d created by state law to the use, sale and cultivation of medical marijuana. As we explain: there is no such right.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">1. <em>There Is No Statutory Right to Medical Marijuana</em></p>\n<p id=\"b934-8\">It is too late in the day for appellants to argue that the CUA and MMPA grant a statutory right to use and/or collectively cultivate medical marijuana. Our Supreme Court held in <em>Riverside </em>that (1) the CUA and MMPA are merely limited exceptions to the sanctions of the state\u2019s criminal laws <em>(Riverside, supra, </em>56 Cal.4th at p. 739); (2) exempting certain activities from state prohibitions does not constitute an <em>authorization </em>of those activities <em>(id. </em>at p. 758); and (3) the CUA and MMPA do not grant a right \u201cof convenient access\u201d to medical marijuana <em>(Riverside, </em>at p. 762). In addition, we have expressly held that neither the CUA nor the MMPA creates \u201ca state right to cultivate, distribute, or otherwise obtain marijuana collectively, and thereafter to possess and use it, for medical purposes.\u201d <em>(Conejo, supra, </em>214 Cal.App.4th at p. 1553.)</p>\n<p id=\"b935-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>Appellants repeatedly assume such a right throughout their brief. For example, the reply brief states that the CUA \u201crecognizes a \u2018right\u2019 for seriously ill Californians with a medical recommendation to possess and cultivate marijuana pursuant to a medical recommendation. [The MMPA] recognizes that collective cultivation is required to implement the right recognized in [the CUA].\u201d This is an incorrect statement of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-4\">Appellants point to the newly enacted MMRSA as a legislative rejection of the appellate cases that have held no right to medical marijuana exists. Appellants\u2019 direct our attention to a section of MMRSA that provides that any <em>advertisement </em>for physician recommendations for medical marijuana must include a reference to \u201cthe right to obtain and use\u201d medical marijuana.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">This language is taken directly from that part of the CUA found in Health and Safety Code section 11362.5, subdivision (b)(1)(A), which states the <em>purposes </em>of the CUA include \u201cto ensure that seriously ill Californians have the right to obtain and use marijuana for medical purposes where that medical use is deemed appropriate and has been recommended by a physician who has determined that the person\u2019s health would benefit from the use of marijuana . . . .\u201d The Supreme Court has already held that this broad language of <em>intent </em>in the CUA does not change the fact that the actual substantive provisions of the CUA create only a limited immunity and not a right. <em>(Riverside, supra, </em>56 Cal.4th at p. 746.) We reject appellants\u2019 suggestion that a newly enacted statute setting forth a <em>warning </em>to be included in advertisements somehow constitutes a silent legislative overruling of Supreme Court and Court of Appeal precedent. (Cf. <em>Even Zohar Construction &amp; Remodeling, Inc. v. Bellaire Townhouses, LLC </em>(2015) 61 Cal.4th 830, 838 [189 Cal.Rptr.3d 824, 352 P.3d 391] [statutes are to be harmonized whenever possible; all presumptions are against repeal by implication].)</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">We dispose quickly of appellants\u2019 claim that MMRSA preempts local medical marijuana regulation in general or Prop. D in particular. MMRSA expressly addresses both issues. It first states that nothing in its regulatory scheme \u201cshall be interpreted to supersede or limit existing local authority for law enforcement activity, enforcement of local zoning requirements or local ordinances, or enforcement of local permit or licensing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>requirements.\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 19315, subd. (a).) It then states that issuance of a state medical marijuana license \u201cshall in no way limit the ability of the City of Los Angeles to prosecute any person or entity for a violation of, or otherwise enforce, Proposition D . . . .\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 19321, subd. (d).)

Before the trial court, appellants argued for leave to amend in order to state new theories; they did not indicate any new facts they could allege if leave to amend were granted. The same is true on appeal as appellants continued to raise even more new theories. We have rejected all of those theories, which are for the most part new facial challenges to Prop. D.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> As for potential new factual allegations, the occasional references appellants make to facts that might be alleged if leave to amend were granted contain no clear statement of those facts, only that there are facts.

(E.g., Cal. Const., art. II, \u00a7 8.) \u201cReferendum\u201d usually refers to the situation where an enactment has been initially passed by the legislative body and, if sufficient electors oppose the enactment, it will be placed on the ballot for a vote. (E.g., Cal. Const., art. II, \u00a7 9.) The City Charter provides for an alternative type of referendum, in which the City Council proposes the enactment and decides to submit the proposed law to the electors for a vote. (City Charter, \u00a7 460.) Prop. D was enacted in this manner. This type of referendum is, in some ways, more like an initiative, in that the proposed enactment is placed on the ballot without having been enacted by the legislative body. There is no difference between either type of referendum or initiative for our purposes. In each method, \u201cit is the vote of the electors at the ballot-box that finally determines whether or not a proposed measure shall be a law at all, and it can make no difference in principle whether the proposition originates with electors or with the council.\u201d <em>{In re Pfahler </em>(1906) 150 Cal. 71, 76 [88 P. 270].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b931-9\"> The Appellate Division of the Los Angeles County Superior Court recently reached the same conclusion in <em>People v. Optimal Global Healing, Inc. </em>(2015) 241 Cal.App.4th Supp. 1 [194 Cal.Rptr.3d 913],</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b934-9\"> Appellants rely on <em>Trancas Property Owners Assn. </em>v. <em>City of Malibu </em>(2006) 138 Cal.App.4th 172, 182 [41 Cal.Rptr.3d 200] and <em>League of Residential Neighborhood Advocates v. City of Los Angeles </em>(9th Cir. 2007) 498 F.3d 1052, 1052 for the proposition that the City cannot <em>by settlement or contract </em>grant a conditional use permit or variance and bypass the procedural requirements for a conditional use permit or variance. In order to fit the square peg of Prop. D into the round hole of these cases, appellants must argue that the <em>immunities </em>granted by Prop. D are conditional use permits or variances and that the voter-approved Prop. D was in fact a City contract. Both premises are untrue. Prop. D is a voter-approved referendum which merely grants immunities from City enforcement, in much the same way the CUA is a voter-approved initiative which grants immunities from certain criminal liabilities.

Recommendations must come from an attending physician as defined in Section 11362.7 of the Health and Safety Code. Cannabis is a Schedule I drug according to the federal Controlled Substances Act.

County of Fresno </em>(2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 940 [195 Cal.Rptr.3d 815]. At appellants\u2019 request, we allowed the parties to brief the impact of the <em>Kirby </em>decision on this appeal. <em>Kirby </em>was concerned with state preemption (by means of the CUA and MMPA) of local regulation of medical marijuana. The <em>Kirby </em>court concluded that a very narrow portion of the county ordinance at issue was preempted; specifically, the county\u2019s absolute ban on individual cultivation, punishable as a misdemeanor, was preempted by that portion of the MMPA which protects qualified patients with valid medical marijuana identification cards from arrest for possession or cultivation of medical marijuana. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11362.71, subd. (e); <em>Kirby, supra, </em>at p. 960.) The MMPA\u2019s protection of those individuals against arrest prohibits prosecutions under local ordinances for the same conduct. <em>(Kirby, supra, </em>at p. 960.) <em>Kirby </em>confirmed, however, that local ordinances could still prohibit this conduct as a matter of land use. <em>(Kirby, supra, </em>at p. 964.) To the extent appellants argue that they should be granted leave to amend their complaints to argue that Prop. D is preempted under <em>Kirby, </em>we disagree. Prop. D\u2019s criminal penalties apply only to medical marijuana businesses; the MMPA does not provide immunity from arrest or prosecution generally for the collective cultivation of marijuana.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
