After three mistrials in which juries deadlocked, appellant Joseph Verducci was convicted of the first degree murder of Corona (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187, subd. (a)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Verducci was sentenced to an indeterminate prison term of 50 years to life. On appeal, Verducci contends the trial court abused its discretion and deprived him of due process by denying his motions to dismiss and admitting hearsay evidence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">In 2008, Verducci was charged by information with murder (\u00a7 187, subd. (a)) and criminal street gang and firearm enhancements (\u00a7 186.22, subd. (b)(1); former \u00a7 12022.53). The first jury trial began in November 2009, and the following December the court declared a mistrial when the jury deadlocked eight to four in favor of a guilty verdict. A second trial in March 2011 ended after that jury reported it was hung 11 to one in favor of a guilty verdict. Both sides made additional arguments to the jury. After deliberating further, the jury repeated it could not reach a verdict and the court declared a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">A third trial began in April 2012,.and the jury reported on May 1 that it was hung, \u201cnine not guilty and three guilty.\u201d The court asked the jury to continue deliberating. On May 3, the jury again stated it could not reach a unanimous verdict. The court once again declared a mistrial. A fourth trial began in April 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">\n<em>The Prosecution\u2019s Evidence at the Fourth Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AeT\">Thomas Covey\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">Thomas Covey testified that he and Coby Phillips were among the cofounders and leaders of a white supremacist gang, the Family Affiliated Irish Mafia (FAIM). Verducci joined FAIM in 2001 or 2002. FAIM\u2019s primary purpose was to make money from selling drugs, primarily methamphetamine, in the area between the counties of Alameda and Napa. As time went on, FAIM began moving larger amounts of methamphetamine. At its peak, FAIM dealt 10 to 15 pounds per week. The source for FAIM\u2019s methamphetamine was two Mexican nationals with connections to the Mexican Sinaloa cartel\u2014 Jose Vega-Robles (known as Carlos) and Sergio Vega-Robles.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In order to collect money owed from drug sales, FAIM members routinely inflicted violence, including beatings, stabbings, shootings, and murder.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">In 2006 and early 2007, most of the FAIM leadership responsibilities fell to Thomas because Coby was in federal custody. In 2006, Coby and Thomas suffered a falling out. While Coby was in prison, his wife, Stacey Phillips, began an affair with Thomas\u2019s brother, Tim Covey. Soon thereafter, Coby learned of the affair and ordered Thomas to kill Tim. Thomas promised to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>shoot Tim, but ultimately took no action. Further tension was created by Thomas\u2019s physically abusive relationship with Stacey\u2019s sister, Tina Cates.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">Toward the latter part of 2006, Coby and Thomas began threatening to kill one another and their respective families. On at least one occasion, Thomas pulled a gun on Coby. In November 2006, Thomas took a stolen .45-caliber handgun and drove to Coby\u2019s house, intending to kill him. On the way, he led police on a high-speed chase and was arrested. Thomas remained in custody until he posted bail in January 2007.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">On January 14, 2007, Thomas and fellow FAIM member Kyle Galal spent the day watching football and drinking heavily. That evening they went to the My Office bar, which was around the corner from Coby and Stacey\u2019s house in Vallejo. Thomas stepped outside to smoke a cigarette and saw Stacey\u2019s black Impala pull into the bar\u2019s parking lot and then speed off. He could not see who was in the car because the windows were tinted and rolled up. Thomas called Stacey on his cell phone, asked who was in her car, and apologized for the conflict between him and Coby. He was emotional, but Stacey did not accept his apologies. Instead, she asked if Thomas wanted her to send Verducci to the bar. She said Verducci was high on drugs and acting \u201ccrazy.\u201d Thomas assumed Stacey had learned where he was from the people in the Impala or had been in the Impala herself. Not overly concerned, Thomas went back into the bar. Not long thereafter, Thomas and Galal again left the bar and walked around the comer of the building to urinate. Thomas noticed a maroon Ford Taurus, which he recognized as belonging to Carlos, pulling into the parking lot. Thomas was immediately concerned and began moving towards the bar\u2019s front door, as Carlos was a good friend of Coby\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Thomas saw Verducci and Carlos get out of the car. Thomas initially focused on Carlos, who Thomas knew to be a very violent person. Thomas saw that Carlos had a knife, but never saw Carlos with a gun. Thomas then glanced in Verducci\u2019s direction and saw Verducci point a gun at him and begin firing. Thomas ran towards the bar\u2019s front door and then inside, ducking and weaving as he ran. Jose Corona, who had been sitting on a bar stool near the front window of the bar, was shot in the head. The bullet entered Corona\u2019s left temple and brain, killing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>When police arrived, Thomas was arrested on an outstanding warrant. After his arrest, Thomas refused to speak to police. He posted bail and remained out of custody until May 2007. When Thomas returned to custody in May 2007, several other FAIM members were incarcerated in the same unit. Thomas tried to regain his good standing in FAIM. Thomas was subpoenaed to testify \u00e1t Verducci\u2019s preliminary hearing in July 2008, but he refused because he was \u201cstill living by the code that we don\u2019t tell on each other.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thomas was subpoenaed a second time to testify at Verducci\u2019s first trial. He again refused. Thomas decided to cooperate in 2009 after FAIM members tried to kill him in prison. In exchange for a favorable plea deal in another case, Thomas agreed to testify against Verducci. Thomas, his wife, and his son were placed in a witness protection program.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">Even before reaching the favorable plea agreement, however, Thomas had implicated Verducci in the shooting. In March 2007, Thomas\u2019s father called Thomas and accused Thomas of a second burglary at his home. Thomas was unaware the police were recording the call. Thomas denied involvement in the burglary.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, when the conversation turned to the My Office bar shooting, Thomas said, \u201cThey tried to take my fuckin head dad. . . . [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] Joe Verducci, that\u2019s the one who did it. Punk ass Joe did it for Coby.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">Steve Buchanan\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">Steve Buchanan joined FAIM in 2000, after meeting Thomas in state prison. Buchanan thought FAIM gang members were \u201c[his] caliber of people\u201d because the gang had a violent reputation that matched his own. In 2005 or 2006, Buchanan met Coby and Verducci, who was called \u201cJoe Rue.\u201d Buchanan thought Verducci and Coby were related, as Verducci called Coby \u201ccousin.\u201d Verducci frequently stayed at Coby\u2019s house, sleeping on a blanket and pillow on the floor next to Coby\u2019s bed. Buchanan had seen Verducci with a nine-millimeter automatic handgun.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">Buchanan became aware of a conflict between Coby and Thomas when, on one occasion in late 2006, Coby called Thomas and put him on speakerphone. Buchanan heard Coby tell Thomas to get his FAIM tattoos <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>removed. Coby also threatened to kill Thomas. Buchanan explained that telling a gang member to remove his gang tattoos is a \u201cgreen light,\u201d which meant there would be no repercussions from the gang if that person was injured. Buchanan himself was \u201cgreen lighted\u201d by FAIM in 2008, after he agreed to testify against FAIM members in another murder case. He received a $1,000 stipend every month thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">Clayton Cates\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Between 2004 and 2008, Stacey\u2019s brother, Clayton Cates, lived with Stacey and Coby. Clayton helped FAIM traffic drugs by transporting methamphetamine between Los Angeles and the Bay Area.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Clayton knew Verducci as Coby\u2019s close associate.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">On the evening of January 14, 2007, Clayton was at Joanna N\u00fa\u00f1ez\u2019s house with Carlos, Verducci, and Melesa Wright. Verducci told Clayton that Stacey had just called him and said Thomas was threatening her family. Verducci asked Clayton to give him a ride to \u201cthe bar.\u201d Thereafter, Clayton drove Verducci, Wright, and Carlos to the My Office bar in Carlos\u2019s Ford Taurus. Verducci was seated in the front passenger seat with his backpack. Clayton did not see a gun, but he knew Verducci always carried a gun in this backpack. Clayton knew of a plan to shoot Thomas, but said he \u201cdidn\u2019t think [Verducci] would do it.\u201d Clayton recalled Verducci using his cell phone while in the car. Clayton said Verducci\u2019s cell phone number at the time was (707) 712-1152.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">After arriving at the My Office bar, Clayton saw Verducci touch his backpack and then exit the car, followed by Carlos. Clayton and Wright stayed behind in the car. Next, Clayton heard six or seven gunshots. When the shots ended, Verducci and Carlos ran back to the car and got in. Verducci said, \u201c[I] got him.\u201d Clayton drove away and learned later that night Thomas had not been killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">At the time, Clayton did not report the events to police. In November 2008, Clayton was arrested on drug charges and questioned about the shooting. Initially, Clayton did not tell the truth, but he eventually admitted being in a car when someone got out and shot at Thomas. Clayton pled no contest to manslaughter and agreed to testify in exchange for probation with an 11-year suspended sentence. Clayton was also placed in a witness protection program and thereafter received $1,200 each month for rent. Clayton understood the checks would stop coming and he would go to jail if he refused to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>Police Investigation</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">Police arrived at the bar around 8:00 p.m. Bullet strike marks were located on a front window, on the exterior wall near the door, and on the wooden doorframe. The glass in the front window was shattered. Officers found Corona lying face up on the ground, close to that window, with a gunshot wound to his head. A bullet was recovered from Corona\u2019s body. Another bullet fragment was recovered from a pool table. Police also found five bullet casings in the parking lot outside the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Firearms Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Five days before the My Office bar shooting, on January 9, 2007, Verducci had used a gun to shoot Casey Holmes in the leg. A firearms expert examined the bullet casings collected from the parking lot outside the My Office bar and compared them to the bullet casing recovered on January 9, 2007. The expert determined all the casings were of the same caliber and fired from the same gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">Michael Whisenhunt\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">Although he claimed not to recall the call itself, Michael Whisenhunt testified that two male voices on a January 13, 2007 recorded jail phone call were his and Coby\u2019s. In the recording, which was played for the jury over Verducci\u2019s hearsay objection, Coby calls Whisenhunt\u2019s landline from jail. Coby reports to Whisenhunt that \u201cBubba\u201d is out of jail and conveys that they are not on good terms.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Coby then asks Whisenhunt, \u201cCan you call (Joanna) on your cell phone and see if she has a number for [\u2018Joe Rue\u2019]?\u201d While still on the phone with Coby, Whisenhunt makes a call to \u201cJoanna\u201d and then indicates he is dialing 712-1152 on his cell phone. Whisenhunt says, \u201c(Tina)\u2019s on the phone\u201d and that \u201cshe\u2019s with (Joe).\u201d Coby says, and Whisenhunt repeats, \u201c[P]ut [Joe Rue] on the phone.\u201d Whisenhunt then acts as go-between in a conversation between Coby and \u201cJoe Rue.\u201d During that conversation, Coby expresses, and Whisenhunt conveys to \u201cJoe Rue,\u201d Coby\u2019s desire that \u201cJoe\u201d stay at Coby\u2019s house to protect his children now that Thomas is \u201cout.\u201d However, Whisenhunt testified that he had never met Verducci and could not identify his voice.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-9\">Phone Records</p>\n<p id=\"b855-10\">Phone records from Metro PCS showed calls from Thomas\u2019s phone at 7:22, 7:31, 7:40, and 7:58 p.m. on January 14, 2007. Metro PCS records also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>show the phone number (707) 712-1152 received a call at 7:55 p.m. When it received that phone call, the (707) 712-1152 cell phone used the same cell tower Thomas\u2019s phone had used between 7:22 and 7:58 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Gang Expert Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">The prosecution\u2019s gang expert believed Verducci was a member of FAIM. The expert opined the attempt to kill Thomas benefited the gang because it was an attempt to get rid of a gang member who posed a threat to the gang\u2019s leader.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">\n<em>Defense Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AxQl\">Stacey\u2019s Prior Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">At the fourth trial, Stacey was called by Verducci but refused to testify after her immunity agreement was withdrawn by the People. She was found unavailable to testify, and portions of her testimony at prior trials were read into the record. In January 2007, Stacey\u2019s marriage to Coby was strained' because they were both having affairs \u2014 Coby with Joanna N\u00fa\u00f1ez and Stacey with Tim. In the early morning hours of January 1, 2007, Coby and Stacey had an argument. Coby threw Stacey to the ground in their master bathroom and began punching her in the face. He bloodied her face and blackened her eyes. Stacey\u2019s brother, Michael, had been spending the holidays with Stacey and Coby. Michael tried to leave with Stacey, but Coby rammed Michael\u2019s car with Stacey\u2019s car. Police arrived and arrested Coby.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">At the 2012 trial, Stacey testified that after his arrest, Coby left a cell phone with the number (707) 712-1152 at the house for Verducci. However, when she testified in 2009, Stacey had denied giving Verducci that phone. Stacey\u2019s testimony at prior trials also conflicted as to whether she called Verducci on the night of January 14, 2007. In 2009, she denied calling Verducci. However, Stacey acknowledged that, after making a deal with prosecutors, she testified in 2011 to having in fact talked to Verducci that night. Stacey also admitted lying throughout her testimony at Coby\u2019s trial for domestic violence, wherein he was acquitted. She also admitted lying in her past testimony in this case. Stacey recalled a debt owed to Carlos. According to Stacey, Coby owed a large sum because Thomas and his brother Tim had not paid their share for drugs they had obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">Jamie Beckwith\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">Jamie Beckwith, who was Carlos\u2019s former girlfriend, testified Carlos sold large quantities of drugs for a living and usually carried a firearm. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>latter part of 2006, Beckwith and Carlos were living with N\u00fa\u00f1ez in Vallejo. Coby and Stacey also lived in Vallejo. Beckwith and Carlos were frequent visitors in their home.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Beckwith remembered Coby\u2019s arrest at the end of 2006. After his arrest, Beckwith recalled an evening in January 2007 when she and Carlos went to Stacey\u2019s home for dinner. They drove over in Carlos\u2019s maroon Ford Taurus. Stacey, Tina, Clayton, and Timothy were also at Stacey\u2019s house. At one point, the women were in the kitchen and the men were in the living room. Beckwith overheard one of the men say \u201cTommy [was] snitching\u201d and \u201ca rat.\u201d All the men then left. She also heard the phrase \u201cat the bar.\u201d Beckwith did not know where they went, but she saw a news bulletin about a shooting that same night. The bulletin included footage of the My Office bar.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Beckwith was concerned that Carlos might have been involved in the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Beckwith testified she had met Verducci once. At the third trial, she testified she did not know Verducci at all. Beckwith claimed she had not recognized him until after she got on the witness stand and simply failed to correct her mistaken assertion. Verducci was not present at Stacey\u2019s home when the men discussed Tommy being a snitch.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">\n<em>Closing Argument</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">The shooter\u2019s identity was the focus of closing arguments. The prosecutor argued that Clayton\u2019s and Thomas\u2019s testimony identifying Verducci as the shooter was corroborated by the firearms evidence, phone records, and motive evidence. Verducci\u2019s trial counsel, on the other hand, argued that the prosecution\u2019s witnesses should not be believed, given their criminal pasts and incentives to testify against Verducci. The defense also relied on Beckwith\u2019s testimony, as well as the debt evidence, to suggest Carlos was the shooter.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">\n<em>Verdict and Sentence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">The jury found Verducci guilty of first degree murder and found the enhancement allegations true. The trial court denied Verducci\u2019s motion to dismiss and sentenced Verducci to a term of 25 years to life on the murder count, plus a consecutive term of 25 years to life for the firearm enhancement \u2014 for a total of 50 years to life. The court ordered the sentence to be served concurrently with a term Verducci was already serving for a separate 2007 conviction. Verducci filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">On appeal, Verducci contends the trial court abused its discretion and deprived him of due process by denying his motions to dismiss and admitting hearsay evidence contained in the January 13, 2007 phone call. Neither argument has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">A. <em>Denial of the Motions to Dismiss</em></p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">First, Verducci maintains that the trial court abused its discretion when it failed to grant his motions to dismiss after his three previous trials ended in hung juries. Verducci contends that his due process rights were violated by the fundamental unfairness of a fourth trial relying on virtually the same evidence. According to Verducci, \u201c[t]he sequence of trials shows that [his] conviction was the outcome of a process of attrition whereby the prosecution learned the defense strategy and fine-tuned its case until it finally obtained a conviction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">Verducci concedes that double jeopardy principles do not mandate a dismissal and bar of retrial when juries deadlock. \u201cIt is well established that the Fifth Amendment\u2019s double jeopardy clause bars reprosecution <em>following a defendant\u2019s acquittal.\u201d (People v. Batts </em>(2003) 30 Cal.4th 660, 679 [134 Cal.Rptr.2d 67, 68 P.3d 357], italics added.) And some prosecutorial misconduct resulting in mistrial \u201cnot only constitutes a due process violation but also a double jeopardy violation, and hence warrants not only reversal but dismissal and a bar to reprosecution.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 692.) However, double jeopardy principles do not bar retrial when a mistrial is justified by \u201c \u2018manifest necessity\u2019 \u201d \u2014 for example, when jurors are unable to agree on a verdict. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 679.) Verducci instead relies on section 1385, subdivision (a), which provides in relevant part: \u201cThe judge or magistrate may, either of his or her own motion or upon the application of the prosecuting attorney, and in furtherance of justice, order an action to be dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">\u201c \u2018Dismissals under section 1385 may be proper before, during and after trial.\u2019 [Citation.] Because the poncept of \u2018furtherance of justice\u2019 (\u00a7 1385) is amorphous, we have enunciated some general principles to guide trial courts when deciding whether to dismiss under section 1385. Courts must consider \u2018the constitutional rights of the defendant, and the interests of society represented by the People,\u2019 and \u2018[a]t the very least, the reason for dismissal must be \u201cthat which would motivate a reasonable judge.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hatch </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 260, 268 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 80, 991 P.2d 165].)</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">\u201cA determination whether to dismiss in the interests of justice after a verdict involves a balancing of many factors, including the weighing of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>evidence indicative of guilt or innocence, the nature of the crime involved, the fact that the defendant has or has not been incarcerated in prison awaiting trial and the length of such incarceration, the possible harassment and burdens imposed upon the defendant by a retrial, and the likelihood, if any, that additional evidence will be presented upon a retrial. When the balance falls clearly in favor of the defendant, a trial court not only may but should exercise the powers granted to him by the Legislature and grant a dismissal in the interests of justice.\u201d <em>(People v. Superior Court (Howard) </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 491, 505 [72 Cal.Rptr. 330, 446 P.2d 138]; accord, <em>People v. Carmony </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 367, 375 [14 Cal.Rptr.3d 880, 92 P.3d 369].) We review a trial court\u2019s refusal to dismiss for abuse of discretion. (Carmony, at p. 374.)</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">1. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">Verducci invited the trial court to dismiss the case on two relevant occasions \u2014 in advance of the fourth trial and after the jury\u2019s verdict. In both instances, the defense filed a motion to dismiss the case in the interests of justice. Verducci cited the three prior hung juries and argued a fourth trial would be vindictive and violate due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">In denying Verducci\u2019s pretrial invitation to dismiss, the court explained: \u201cIt is pretty unusual ... to have a fourth trial after three hung juries. And there was quite a wide swing in the votes, if you will. . . . [\u00b6] The first trial was 8 to 4 for guilt. The second trial was 11 to 1 for guilt. The third trial was 9 to 3 for acquittal. . . . [\u00b6] And the difference between the first trial and the second trial was [Thomas] testified in the second trial, not the first. . . . [\u00b6] The holdout juror in the second trial, as I recall, had some issues. I think at one point I had to inquire of all the jurors as to whether or not that juror was deliberating. And it was a discretionary call on my part to find that he was and not remove him. [\u00b6] And then the difference between the second trial and the third trial was, in terms of evidence . . . was Jamie Beckwith. [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] What I do know is that. . . apparently Ms. Beckwith has . . . made statements now that . . . contradict portions of her trial testimony. [\u00b6] Apparently, [Wright], who has not yet testified in any of these trials and is purported to be . . . the right front passenger in the car that allegedly brought Mr. Verducci and Mr. Robles to the bar. She is now in custody, apparently. I signed a removal order to bring her to trial. . . . Whether she\u2019ll actually testify or not, I don\u2019t know.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">\u201cAnd Mr. Verducci has been in custody this entire time. But, as I understand it, he\u2019s serving a sentence. Even if this case were dismissed, he\u2019d still be in custody. . . . [\u00b6] These are serious charges. The evidentiary landscape has changed. There is some likelihood of additional evidence being offered. There really is no dispute that the gun used . . . was the same gun <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>that Mr. Verducci had in his possession to commit the [Casey Holmes] offense some days before. It wasn\u2019t a matter of months or years. They were closely connected in time. [\u00b6] I just think considering all the evidence, society\u2019s interest, I don\u2019t view this as harassment or vindictiveness on the part of the People. It\u2019s just a difficult case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">The trial court also denied Verducci\u2019s postverdict motion to dismiss. It acknowledged an absence of binding authority to support Verducci\u2019s argument, but explained: \u201cThere are a couple of cases from other states . . . . [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] I thought, for the sake of clarity of this record, that the factors that those states\u2019 Courts set out to govern the Court\u2019s discretion might be [instructive] here. [\u00b6] One of the factors is the severity of the offense charged. Well, this is quite a severe charge. First degree murder, the discharge of a firearm, and a gang enhancement. [\u00b6] A number of prior mistrials and the circumstances of the jury deliberations in those trials, ... the first jury . . . was hung 8 to 4 for guilt. The second, 11 to 1 for guilt. . . . [\u00b6] And then kind of in the turnaround, the third trial ended with a hung jury that was reported to me ... to be 9 to 3 for acquittal. [\u00b6] In that third trial, [Beckwith] had been called ... by the defense .... [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6] And then [Buchanan] ... did not testify in that trial. [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] So there was kind of a different flavor or mix of witnesses the last trial round. [\u00b6] [Stacey], the People basically withdrew their offer of immunity, under which she had testified previously. . . . [\u00b6] [T]he primary reason I allowed a fourth trial in the first place was because . . . there was this different information regarding [Beckwith]; [Wright] had been located and was expected to testify; and ... I thought that was the right decision, and still do think that. [\u00b6] ... I think this is a relatively strong case, particularly given the fact that the firearm used to commit this crime is the same firearm [Verducci] used just a few days earlier in Pinole to commit a crime that he stands convicted of and for which he\u2019s still serving a sentence. [\u00b6] . . . I have no reason ... to question [the prosecutor\u2019s] professional competence or how she acted in the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">The court continued: \u201c[Verducci] has been incarcerated for a long time, but all of that time ... he\u2019s been serving a sentence out of Contra Costa County, that\u2019s eleven plus years in length. [\u00b6] . . . He would have been in custody regardless of whether this case went to trial once, twice, three times, or four. [\u00b6] And in terms of harassment, given the severity of the charges, the difficult circumstances under which the People found themselves with witnesses refusing to testify, this just doesn\u2019t strike me as a case where the Court should grant a motion to dismiss because the defendant feels like he\u2019s been harassed. [\u00b6] . . . And basically, the evidence was strong enough I think it warranted a fourth trial. [\u00b6] And I just have in mind the type of case this was, the circumstances under which it was committed. And I think in terms of the protection to society in case the defendant should actually be guilty ... I just think all of that weighs against granting the motion to dismiss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>2. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Our Courts of Appeal have not addressed whether successive trials after jury deadlock that do not violate double jeopardy principles may still violate a defendant\u2019s due process rights.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> For this reason, Verducci relies on authority from other jurisdictions concluding that \u201cprecepts of fundamental fairness, together with the judiciary\u2019s need to create appropriate and just remedies, and its general responsibility to assure the overall efficient administration of the criminal justice system, confirm an inherent power in a trial court to dismiss an indictment with prejudice following general mistrials attributable to repeated jury deadlocks.\u201d <em>(State v. Abbati </em>(1985) 99 N.J. 418 [493 A.2d 513, 517] <em>(Abbati); </em>accord, <em>State v. Sauve </em>(1995) 164 Vt. 134 [666 A.2d 1164, 1168]; <em>State v. Moriwake </em>(1982) 65 Haw. 47 [647 P.2d 705, 712]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Witt </em>(Tenn. 1978) 572 S.W.2d 913, 917.)</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">The <em>Abbati </em>court held that \u201ca trial court may dismiss an indictment with prejudice after successive juries have failed to agree on a verdict <em>when it determines that the chance of the State\u2019s obtaining a conviction upon further retrial is highly </em>unlikely.\u201d <em>(Abbati, supra, </em>493 A.2d at p. 521, italics added.) It also announced a set of factors to govern a trial court\u2019s decision whether to dismiss the indictment: \u201c(1) the number of prior mistrials and the outcome of the juries\u2019 deliberations, so far as is known; (2) the character of prior trials in terms of length, complexity, and similarity of evidence presented; (3) the likelihood of any substantial difference in a subsequent trial, if allowed; (4) the trial court\u2019s own evaluation of the relative strength of each party\u2019s case; and (5) the professional conduct and diligence of respective counsel, particularly of the prosecuting attorney. The court must also give due weight to the prosecutor\u2019s decision to reprosecute, assessing the reasons for that decision, such as the gravity of the criminal charges and the public\u2019s concern in the effective and definitive conclusion of criminal prosecutions. Conversely, the court should accord careful consideration to the status of the individual defendant and the impact of a retrial upon the defendant in terms of untoward hardship and unfairness.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>(Abbati, </em>at pp. 521-522.)</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">The People urge us not to follow Verducci\u2019s nonbinding authority, asserting a double jeopardy violation provides the sole basis for the remedy Verducci seeks. We agree with the People that a dismissal \u201cin furtherance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>justice\u201d would not necessarily afford Verducci a bar to further prosecution. (See \u00a7 1387, subd. (a) [except in circumstances not relevant here, \u201c[a]n order terminating an action pursuant to this chapter ... is a bar to any other prosecution for the same offense if it is a felony . . . <em>and the action has been previously terminated pursuant to this chapter\u2019\u2019\u2019 </em>(italics added)]; <em>People v. Hatch, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 270 [\u00a7 1387 \u201cestablishes that <em>two dismissals </em>pursuant to section 1385 . . .bar retrial on felony charges except in limited circumstances\u201d (italics added)].) And our Supreme Court has cautioned that \u201c[t]he remedy mandated by the double jeopardy clause \u2014 an order barring retrial and leading to the dismissal of the criminal charges against the defendant without trial- \u2014 is an unusual and extraordinary measure that properly should be invoked only with great caution.\u201d <em>(People v. Batts, supra, </em>30 Cal.4th at p. 666.)</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">Yet unlike the People, we do not read <em>Richardson v. United States </em>(1984) 468 U.S. 317 [82 L.Ed.2d 242, 104 S.Ct. 3081] as necessarily foreclosing that remedy. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 322-323.) The <em>Richardson </em>defendant was charged with two counts of distributing a controlled substance and one count of conspiring to distribute a controlled substance. The jury acquitted him of one count but was unable to reach a verdict on the other two. A mistrial was declared as to those counts, and they were set for retrial. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 318-319.) The defendant unsuccessfully moved for a judgment of acquittal based, in relevant part, on the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment. <em>(Richardson, </em>at p. 319.)</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">The United States Supreme Court rejected the argument. It explained: \u201cIt has been established for 160 years . . . that a failure of the jury to agree on a verdict was an instance of \u2018manifest necessity\u2019 which permitted a trial judge to terminate the first trial and retry the defendant, because \u2018the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated.\u2019 [Citation.] Since that time ... we have constantly adhered to the rule that a retrial following a \u2018hung jury\u2019 does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.\u201d <em>(Richardson </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>468 U.S. at pp. 323-324.) \u201c[A] trial court\u2019s declaration of a mistrial following a hung jury is not an event that terminates the original jeopardy to which petitioner was subjected. The Government, like the defendant, is entitled to resolution of the case by verdict from the jury, and jeopardy does not terminate when the jury is discharged because it is unable to agree. Regardless of the sufficiency of the evidence at petitioner\u2019s first trial, he has no valid double jeopardy claim to prevent his retrial.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 326.)</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">Verducci\u2019s circumstances are distinguishable from those presented in <em>Richardson v. United States, supra, </em>468 U.S. 317. Unlike the <em>Richardson </em>defendant, Verducci relies on the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, under which \u201ccriminal prosecutions must comport with prevailing notions of fundamental fairness.\u201d <em>(California </em>v. <em>Trombetta </em>(1984) 467 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>479, 485 [81 L.Ed.2d 413, 104 S.Ct. 2528].) Furthermore, Verducci had been tried not once before, but on three prior occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">We will assume without deciding that the trial court had discretion to dismiss the action against Verducci. Nonetheless, the authority Verducci cites is distinguishable because those reviewing courts did not reverse a trial court\u2019s order declining to dismiss. <em>(People v. Steinbrook, supra, </em>85 Cal.App.3d at p. Supp. 9; <em>Abbati, supra, </em>493 A.2d at p. 516; <em>State v. Moriwake, supra, </em>647 P.2d at p. 708; <em>State v. Witt, supra, </em>572 S.W.2d at pp. 914, 917.) Under <em>Abbati, </em>\u201c[a]n appellate court reviewing the decision of a trial court to dismiss an indictment' with prejudice must ensure that the correct standard was employed by the trial court. [Citation.] Presupposing that that threshold is met, the trial court\u2019s decision is entitled to deference for the obvious reasons that the trial court saw the witnesses and heard the testimony. The decision should be reversed on appeal only when it clearly appears that the exercise of discretion was mistaken.\u201d <em>(Abbatti, </em>at p. 522.)</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">Here, the trial court implicitly recognized that, because Verducci\u2019s prior trials had ended in repeated jury deadlock, another trial on the same charges would not violate the double jeopardy clauses of the federal and state Constitutions. It also proceeded on the apparent assumption that it had the authority and discretion to dismiss if a fourth trial was not \u201cin furtherance of justice,\u201d considering the relevant factors in balancing a defendant\u2019s rights with the interests of society as a whole, but declined to dismiss. The trial court provided a well-reasoned explanation for its decision. It specifically examined the nature of the charges, discussed the strength of the evidence, considered the burdens imposed on Verducci by retrial, and the likelihood that additional evidence would be presented at a fourth trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">Verducci does not contend that any of the factors considered by the court were not relevant to the exercise of its discretion. He merely contends that the trial court should have given more weight to his interests. We will not second-guess the trial court\u2019s ruling, which found particularly relevant the strength of the People\u2019s evidence, the seriousness of the charges, and the limited prejudice to Verducci of a fourth trial.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"968\">*968</page-number>B. <em>Admission of the January 13, 2007 Phone Call</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">III.
