(mother) appeals from orders under Welfare and Institutions Code<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> section 366.26 terminating her parental rights to A.A. and V.A. (the children). Mother contends (1) the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdictional orders finding the children were dependents within the meaning of section 300, subdivision (b)(1), were not supported by substantial evidence; (2) the juvenile court abused its discretion by terminating reunification services and setting a section 366.26 permanency planning hearing; (3) the juvenile court abused its discretion by denying mother\u2019s request to continue the permanency hearing to allow her time to file a petition under section 388 requesting additional reunification services; (4) the juvenile court\u2019s orders finding the children were likely to be adopted were not supported by substantial evidence; and (5) the juvenile court erred by concluding legally sufficient notice was provided to relevant Indian tribes pursuant to the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1901 et seq.; ICWA).</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-9\">Respondent San Bernardino County Children and Family Services (CFS) argues mother waived her right to challenge the jurisdictional orders by not appealing from the dispositional orders, and mother waived her right to challenge the orders terminating reunification services by not filing a petition for extraordinary writ challenging the orders setting a permanency hearing. CFS contends the juvenile court did not abuse its discretion by not continuing the permanency hearing. Although CFS concedes the juvenile court did not consider a possible legal impediment to the children being adopted by their paternal grandmother, CFS contends the court correctly found they were likely to be adopted. Finally, CFS concedes the ICWA notice was inadequate and that a conditional reversal and limited remand to provide adequate notice is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1044-10\">In the published portion of this opinion, we conclude mother waived her claim of error regarding the jurisdictional orders by not appealing from the dispositions. Mother was absent from the continued jurisdictional hearing and was not entitled to notice of her right to appeal under California Rules of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1227\">*1227</page-number>Court, rule 5.590(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because we conclude the juvenile court did not provide mother with timely and adequate notice of her right to challenge the orders setting a permanency hearing, as mandated by rule 5.590(b), mother did not waive her claim of error respecting the termination of reunification services.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-4\">In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we conclude the juvenile court did not abuse its discretion by terminating reunification services or by denying a request to continue the permanency hearing because mother did not comply with her case plan and did not visit with the children. However, we agree with mother that the juvenile court erred by not considering legal impediments to the children being adopted by their paternal grandmother when it found the children were likely to be adopted, and we agree with mother and CFS that the ICWA notice was inadequate. Therefore, we reverse the orders terminating parental rights and remand for the juvenile court to consider legal impediments to the children being adopted, for CFS to provide new ICWA notice, and for the juvenile court to determine whether that notice is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-6\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"ApL\">A. <em>Referral to CFS and Detention</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1045-7\">CFS received a referral alleging general neglect of the children when mother appeared at V.A.\u2019s elementary school and acted strangely. Mother requested V.A. be called from her classroom so mother could take her to juvenile hall. The school principal reported the incident to law enforcement. V.A. told school officials that earlier in the morning mother told her to change her clothing because she did not approve of her jeans. V.A. said mother became irate, grabbed her, and tried to force her into mother\u2019s car to take her to juvenile hall. The children\u2019s father<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> intervened and told V.A. to run to school. Mother admitted to the school principal she was under the influence of methamphetamines. Law enforcement officers who responded also observed mother was under the influence of methamphetamines, and placed her under arrest. The referral also stated both mother and the father used methamphetamines and lived in the children\u2019s paternal grandmother\u2019s garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-8\">The paternal grandmother told the social worker she was concerned about the children\u2019s welfare because the parents used drugs and would leave for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>days at a time without telling the paternal grandmother when they would return or how they could be contacted. The parents would leave the children in the paternal grandmother\u2019s care, but would not provide resources or provisions for the children. The paternal grandmother also told the social worker she was concerned about mother\u2019s mental health because she acted strangely. Finally, the paternal grandmother told the social worker she wished to continue caring for the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">When interviewed, mother told the social worker the paternal grandmother kicked mother out of the house and she did not have a permanent place to stay. However, mother told the social worker she could stay at the home of the children\u2019s maternal grandfather as long as she did not use drugs. Mother admitted she used methamphetamines on a daily basis, but told the social worker she had not used since her arrest. Although mother told the social worker she was not under the influence of drugs during the interview, the social worker reported mother had \u201cpressured speech, flight of ideas, paranoid ideations, [and] auditory hallucinations.\u201d Mother told the social worker she experienced visual hallucinations in the past, and reported experiencing an auditory hallucination earlier that day. While standing on a balcony, smoking a cigarette, mother heard a voice say, \u201cJump! Just do it.\u201d Mother denied she was suicidal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-6\">Although mother told the social worker she would seek drug treatment and would follow through with a mental health assessment, the social worker reported mother lacked insight into how her drug use and behavior affected the children. Mother did not believe her behavior was attributable to her drug use, and instead attributed the change in her behavior to the fact a ruby was stuck in her body. The social worker reported this appeared to be \u201ca paranoid ideation and tactile hallucination of \u2018feeling like something is in her body.\u2019 \u201d The social worker reported her concern that mother\u2019s drug use, hallucinations, and inability to provide for the children placed them at risk of harm, and her erratic behavior was disruptive to the children\u2019s school and living situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-7\">During a \u201cteam decision making\u201d meeting, mother experienced sporadic hallucinations, became irate, and walked out of the meeting. When it was decided the father would care for the children and take them to the paternal grandmother\u2019s home, mother began shouting obscenities at A.A. and the paternal grandmother. CFS concluded mother\u2019s mental health issues and substance abuse placed the children in imminent risk of harm, and concluded the children should not remain in the custody of the parents or the grandparents. An officer with the San Bernardino Police Department served a detention warrant, and the children were detained and placed in the custody of CFS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>In petitions filed with the juvenile court, CFS alleged the children were dependents within the meaning of section 300, subdivision (b)(1), because mother and the father\u2019s substance abuse, as well as mother\u2019s history of mental health issues, rendered them unable to properly and appropriately care for the children. CFS also alleged the children suffered severe emotional damage as a result of mother\u2019s verbal abuse during a psychotic episode, within the meaning of section 300, subdivision (c). CFS recommended the juvenile court order the children be detained and placed in foster care.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-5\">Mother appeared for the detention hearing, during which her appointed attorney entered a denial of the allegations and requested the juvenile court appoint a guardian ad litem for mother. The juvenile court appointed a guardian ad litem for mother, made a prima facie finding that the children were dependents within the meaning of section 300, and ordered the children detained and placed in foster care. The court ordered mother to submit to random drug testing, and ordered supervised visitation with the children a minimum of once a week for two hours. CFS was ordered to provide reunification services to mother and the children. At CFS\u2019s request, the court ordered unsupervised visitation by the paternal grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-6\">B. <em>Jurisdictional and Dispositional Orders</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1047-7\">In the report submitted for the jurisdictional hearing, the social worker stated neither parent had made contact with CFS since the children\u2019s removal. The social worker spoke to the paternal grandmother, who said the father\u2019s whereabouts were unknown and mother was hospitalized in the psychiatric unit at the Community Hospital of San Bernardino. The paternal grandmother also reported mother planned on entering a residential treatment program upon release from the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-8\">Although the social worker stated mother\u2019s entry into a psychiatric facility was a significant step toward addressing her mental instability, the social worker continued to express concern that mother\u2019s mental health issues and her unstable lifestyle had a detrimental impact on the children\u2019s emotional well-being. The social worker also reported the children displayed deficits in their education and basic life skills. Finally, the social worker reported the paternal grandmother was a consistent source of support for the children, and she was being assessed as a potential caretaker for the children. CFS recommended the juvenile court find true the allegations in the petitions, declare the children to be dependents, order the children to remain in their current placement and not be returned to their parents, and approve the case plan prepared for mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-9\">Mother did not appear for the continued jurisdictional hearing. Without objection, the juvenile court received into evidence the social worker\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>detention and jurisdictional reports. Mother\u2019s counsel objected to the allegations in the petitions, but offered no affirmative evidence. The juvenile court found true the allegations of neglect under section 300, subdivision (b)(1). On the allegations of severe emotional damage within the meaning of section 300, subdivision (c), mother\u2019s counsel argued what mother said to the children might not have been nice but did not have \u201cany lasting effect on the [children] to rise to the level of emotional abuse.\u201d The juvenile court agreed mother did not cause the children to experience serious emotional damage, and found the allegation not true. The court declared the children to be dependent children.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">With respect to the disposition, the juvenile court ruled continuance of the children in the parents\u2019 home was contrary to the children\u2019s welfare, reasonable efforts had been made to prevent or eliminate the need to remove the children, and the children were to be placed with the paternal grandmother. Mother did not appeal from the disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-6\">C. <em>ICWA Notice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-7\">The social worker\u2019s report for the detention hearing indicated ICWA might apply to the children. At the detention hearing, mother\u2019s guardian ad litem informed the juvenile court mother believed she had Indian ancestry through her father (the children\u2019s maternal grandfather), and mother submitted a Judicial Council form ICWA-020 indicating she may have Indian ancestry. CFS gave notice of the proceedings to the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and to 27 California Indian Tribes. The notices included mother\u2019s name, current address, and her date of birth. The notices also included the maternal grandfather\u2019s name and current address, but did not include the date and place of his birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-8\">When CFS reported that none of the Indian tribes who responded had concluded the children were members or eligible for membership in the tribes, the juvenile court found that proper ICWA notice had been given.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-9\">D. <em>Six-month Review Hearing and Order Setting Permanency Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1048-10\">In a status review report, the social worker reported mother\u2019s whereabouts were unknown and she had only made contact with CFS three times in the prior five months. The social worker asked mother to provide a mailing address, but mother said she was homeless. The paternal grandmother told the social worker she did not know where mother or the father resided. She further reported she would only hear from mother about every three months, and mother had not once visited with the children since they were placed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1231\">*1231</page-number>the paternal grandmother\u2019s care. The social worker reported the children continued to do well in the paternal grandmother\u2019s care and in school, and V.A. told the social worker that \u201cshe is okay with her grandmother becoming her adoptive parent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-4\">The social worker informed the juvenile court the current plan was for the paternal grandmother to adopt the children, and recommended the juvenile court terminate reunification services and set a permanency planning hearing under section 366.26.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-5\">At the six-month review hearing conducted on November 12, 2014, mother\u2019s counsel informed the juvenile court mother\u2019s whereabouts were still unknown and \u201c[tjhere is no address in the report or contact information.\u201d Mother\u2019s counsel acknowledged the social worker\u2019s report indicated mother had not visited the children in six months, which was the basis of the recommendation for terminating reunification services. However, counsel asked the court to consider providing mother with an additional six months of reunifications services. \u201cA lot of things can change in six months. The children are over the age of three. If not, I would object.\u201d Mother\u2019s counsel also indicated it was unclear \u201cwhat the wishes of the children are in terms of mom having six more months of services or not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-6\">The juvenile court stated that the social worker\u2019s report indicated V.A. was \u201cokay with her grandmother becoming the adoptive parent.\u201d When asked if that was correct, V.A. responded, \u201cYes.\u201d Based on the information included in the social worker\u2019s report, the juvenile court found no reason to continue reunification services. Counsel for CFS concurred with the court\u2019s assessment, and counsel for the children agreed, stating, \u201calthough [the children] probably would like more time for the mom, I don\u2019t see where there is any likelihood of reunifying within the continuing review period.\u201d In response, mother\u2019s counsel asked the juvenile court to order CFS to assess the paternal grandmother for both guardianship and adoption. Counsel for the children and for CFS agreed that all options should be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-7\">The juvenile court adopted the social worker\u2019s recommendations, findings and orders, found that mother had failed to visit and maintain contact with the children during the last reporting period, terminated reunification services, limited mother\u2019s supervised visits with the children to once a month, and set a permanency hearing under section 366.26. The court directed the clerk of the court to \u201csend notice of intent to file a writ and the writ petition to the parents by first class mail to the last known address.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-8\">Five days after the six-month review hearing, the clerk of the juvenile court served mother by first class mail with copies of Judicial Council forms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>JV-820 (\u201cNotice of Intent to File Writ Petition\u201d) and JV-825 (\u201cPetition For Extraordinary Writ\u201d). The clerk mailed the forms to an address on 6th Street in San Bernardino. Almost two months later, the United States Postal Service returned the envelope to the juvenile court, marked \u201cRETURN TO SENDER.\u201d Handwritten on the envelope are the words, \u201cNot live here.\u201d Mother did not file a notice of intent to file a petition for extraordinary writ challenging the order setting a permanency hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-5\">E. <em>Permanency Hearing and Termination of Parental Rights</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1050-6\">In a report filed for the permanency hearing, the social worker reported that mother\u2019s first visit with the children was on March 3, 2015, almost four months after the juvenile court had set the permanency hearing. Mother did not appear for the next scheduled monthly visit, but showed up the next day, telling the social worker \u201cshe had her days mixed up.\u201d The social worker rescheduled the visit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-7\">The social worker reported the children were suitable for adoption by the paternal grandmother. Although at first the paternal grandmother preferred guardianship to establish permanency for the children, she changed her mind when she realized adoption would provide her with more control in raising the children without the interference of extended family members, and because the children expressed their preference for adoption. The social worker requested a continuance of the permanency hearing to allow for assessment of the paternal grandmother as the prospective adoptive parent. The juvenile court granted the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-8\">In an addendum report, the social worker reported the paternal grandmother was nurturing, employed, and had no medical issues. The paternal grandmother\u2019s home was located in a quiet neighborhood, nicely furnished, well maintained, and close to parks, schools, shopping, and emergency facilities. The paternal grandmother occasionally drinks alcohol socially, and reported having no counseling or psychological evaluations. The paternal grandmother told the social worker she is able and willing to meet the children\u2019s social, medical, psychological, and financial needs, and understands the responsibilities she will be taking on. The paternal grandmother also expressed her belief she is the person best suited to adopt the children, and the children told the paternal grandmother they would rather she adopt them than be their guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-9\">The social worker reported the paternal grandmother had no criminal or child abuse history. However, the social worker reported the paternal grandmother is still married to her estranged husband, so legal proof of the husband\u2019s consent was needed to proceed with adoption. The social worker <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>recommended the juvenile court find that the children are appropriate for adoption and select adoption as the permanent plan; find that termination of mother\u2019s parental rights would not be detrimental to the children; and find inapplicable the benefit exception to termination of parental rights under section 366.26, subdivision (c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">At the June 9, 2015 continued permanency hearing, mother filed documentation of her attendance at Narcotics Anonymous (NA) meetings. Counsel for mother requested a continuance of the hearing so mother could file a petition for change of order pursuant to section 388, but stated she was prepared to proceed if the juvenile court was not inclined to continue the hearing. The juvenile court denied the request and directed counsel to file a petition under section 388 forthwith. The court noted the permanency hearing had originally been set for March 12, 2015, indicated that it had already been continued once, and stated: \u201cIt\u2019s now June 9th. If the mother was going to file a [section] 388 petition, she had plenty of time to do so before today\u2019s date.\u201d Mother\u2019s counsel objected, but indicated she was prepared to proceed with a contested hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">Without objection, the juvenile court received into evidence the social worker\u2019s report and addendum report. Mother\u2019s counsel objected to the recommendation of terminating parental rights, and asked the juvenile court to consider legal guardianship as a lesser alternative to adoption. Counsel argued the paternal grandmother had initially expressed a preference for guardianship, and mother had made progress in her substance abuse treatment as demonstrated by the documentation submitted to the juvenile court. Mother\u2019s treatment, according to counsel, showed mother had \u201cmade progress in becoming more stable and more able to interact with her children.\u201d Counsel also argued that mother\u2019s recent visits with the children went well and again requested the juvenile court consider legal guardianship and grant mother additional visitation so \u201cshe might in the future have an opportunity to file a 388 to request return of the children.\u201d Because the children are older and have an established relationship with mother, counsel asked the juvenile court not to sever mother\u2019s relationship with the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-7\">Counsel for the children informed the juvenile court both children agreed with the social worker\u2019s recommendation of adoption by the paternal grandmother, and informed the court she saw no evidence termination of mother\u2019s parental rights would be detrimental to the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-8\">Counsel for CFS argued the children were generally and specifically adoptable and, given the children\u2019s ages, stated CFS would not have recommended termination of parental rights if the children were not in agreement. Counsel stated Y.A. was 13 years old and could have vetoed the termination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1234\">*1234</page-number>of parental rights, so the recommendation was in the best interests of the children. Moreover, counsel argued the children would remain in their extended family and their family relationship would continue. Finally, counsel argued there was no evidence to support finding an exception to the preferred permanent plan of adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-5\">The juvenile court stated it \u201cconsidered the wishes of each child consistent with each child\u2019s age,\u201d and found by clear and convincing evidence each child is likely to be adopted. The court therefore terminated mother\u2019s parental rights, selected adoption as the children\u2019s permanent plan, and referred each child to the State Department of Social Services or to a local, licensed adoption agency for placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-6\">Mother timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-9\">A. <em>Mother Waived Her Challenge to the Jurisdictional Findings by Not Timely Appealing from the Dispositions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1052-10\">Mother contends there is no substantial evidence to support the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdictional findings under section 300, subdivision (b)(1), and argues she did not waive her right to assert those claims of error. CFS contends mother waived her right to challenge the jurisdictional orders by not timely appealing from the disposition. We agree with CFS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-11\">\u201c \u2018Dependency appeals are governed by section 395, which provides in relevant part: \u201cA judgment in a proceeding under [sjection 300 may be appealed from in the same manner as any final judgment, and any subsequent order may be appealed from as from an order after judgment . . . .\u201d [\u00b6] This statute makes the dispositional order in a dependency proceeding the appeal-able \u201cjudgment.\u201d [Citation.] Therefore, all subsequent orders are directly appealable without limitation .... [Citations.] A consequence of section 395 is that an unappealed disposition or postdisposition order is final and binding and may not be attacked on an appeal from a later appealable order.\u2019 [Citation.] This \u2018waiver rule\u2019 holds \u2018that an appellate court in a dependency proceeding may not inquire into the merits of a prior final appealable order,\u2019 even when the issues raised involve important constitutional and statutory rights. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Z.S. </em>(2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 754, 769-770 [185 Cal.Rptr.3d 571].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1052-12\">Mother does not dispute she did not appeal from the dispositional orders, but she argues the waiver rule is inapplicable because the juvenile court did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1235\">*1235</page-number>not advise her of her right to appeal. Rule 5.590(a) provides: \u201cIf at a contested hearing on an issue of fact or law the court finds that the child is described by Welfare and Institutions Code section 300, 601, or 602 or sustains a supplemental or subsequent petition, the court after making its disposition order other than orders covered in (b) must advise, orally or in writing, the child, if of sufficient age, and, if present, the parent or guardian of: [\u00b6] (1) The right of the child, parent, and guardian to appeal from the court order if there is a right to appeal; [\u00b6] (2) The necessary steps and time for taking an appeal; [\u00b6] (3) The right of an indigent appellant to have counsel appointed by the reviewing court; and [\u00b6] (4) The right of an indigent appellant to be provided with a free copy of the transcript.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-5\">The courts have consistently held that when a parent is not properly advised of his or her right to challenge the setting order by extraordinary writ, and consequently the parent does not timely file a writ petition, good cause exists to consider issues relating to the setting hearing in an appeal from the order terminating parental rights. <em>(In re Frank R. </em>(2011) 192 Cal.App.4th 532, 539 [121 Cal.Rptr.3d 348]; <em>In re Lauren Z. </em>(2008) 158 Cal.App.4th 1102, 1110 [70 Cal.Rptr.3d 583]; <em>In re Harmony B. </em>(2005) 125 Cal.App.4th 831, 839 [23 Cal.Rptr.3d 207]; <em>In re Maria S. </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 1032, 1038 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 655]; <em>In re Rashad B. </em>(1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 442, 450 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 462]; <em>In re Cathina </em>W (1998) 68 Cal.App.4th 716, 722-726 [80 Cal.Rptr.2d 480].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-6\">Recently, this court extended the reasoning from those decisions to the juvenile court\u2019s failure to advise a parent under rule 5.590(a) of her right to appeal from the disposition when the mother\u2019s presence was not disputed. <em>(In re A.O. </em>(2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 145, 147-149 [194 Cal.Rptr.3d 826].) We held \u201cthat a [juvenile] court\u2019s failure to provide the appeal advisement contained in the same rule of court as the writ advisement is a \u2018 \u201cspecial circumstance[] constituting an excuse for failure to [timely appeal].\u201d \u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 149.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-7\">If the juvenile court in this case was required to notify mother of her right to appeal from the dispositional orders, this court\u2019s decision in <em>In re A.O., supra, </em>242 Cal.App.4th 145 dictates a finding of good cause to consider mother\u2019s challenge to the jurisdictional orders in this appeal. CFS contends we should not find good cause because the juvenile court was <em>not </em>required to advise mother of her right to appeal under rule 5.590(a) for two reasons: (1) the jurisdictional hearing was not \u201ccontested,\u201d and (2) mother was not \u201cpresent\u201d at the hearing. We disagree with the first assertion, but agree with the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-8\">Unless waived, the juvenile court at the jurisdictional hearing must read and explain the allegations in the petition and advise the parent of her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1236\">*1236</page-number>rights at the hearing. (Rule 5.682(a), (b).) If the parent admits the allegations in the petition or pleads no contest to them, the hearing is not contested and the juvenile court is required to enter an order finding the children are dependents pursuant to section 300. (Rule 5.682(c)-(f).) In that case, there is no requirement that the juvenile court advise the parent of her right to appeal. (Cf. <em>In re Joseph B. </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 952, 959 [196 Cal.Rptr. 348, 671 P.2d 852] [former rule 251 (current rule 5.590(a)) did not require advisement of appeal rights when minor admitted allegations of delinquency petition].) \u201cIf the parent or guardian denies the allegations of the petition,\u201d however, \u201cthe court must hold a contested hearing and determine whether the allegations in the petition are true.\u201d (Rule 5.684(a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-5\">\u201cBy submitting on a particular report or record, the parent agrees to the court\u2019s consideration of such information as the only evidence in the matter. Under such circumstances, the court will not consider any other evidence in deciding whether the allegations are true. [Citation.] [\u00b6] Notwithstanding a submittal on a particular record, the court must nevertheless weigh evidence, make appropriate evidentiary findings and apply relevant law to determine whether the case has been proved. [Citation.] In other words, the parent acquiesces as to the state of the evidence yet preserves the right to challenge it as insufficient to support a particular legal conclusion. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re Richard K. </em>(1994) 25 Cal.App.4th 580, 589 [30 Cal.Rptr.2d 575].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-6\">Mother offered no affirmative evidence and did not object to the juvenile court receiving into evidence the social worker\u2019s report, but her attorney affirmatively objected to the allegations in the petition and did not submit on the social worker\u2019s recommendations. \u201cOnly when a parent submits on a social worker\u2019s recommendation does he or she forfeit the right to contest the juvenile court\u2019s decision if it coincides with that recommendation. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(In re T.V. </em>(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 126, 136 [157 Cal.Rptr.3d 693].) Because mother objected to the allegations in the petition and did not agree with the social worker\u2019s recommendations, she \u201ccontested]\u201d the jurisdictional findings for purposes of rule 5.590(a). <em>(In re A.O., </em>supra, 242 Cal.App.4th at p. 149.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-7\">Although we conclude the jurisdictional hearing was contested, the juvenile court was not required to advise mother of her right to appeal the dispositional orders because she was not present at the continued jurisdiction hearing. Rule 5.590(a) requires the juvenile court to provide oral or written notice of appeal rights to \u201cthe child, if of sufficient age, and, <em>if present, </em>the parent or guardian.\u201d (Italics added.) Mother argues \u201c[i]t does not make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1237\">*1237</page-number>sense to interpret the provision as requiring no notice of appeal rights, simply because the parent is not present,\u201d and instead suggests this court should interpret rule 5.590(a) to require notice to absent parents. Mother\u2019s suggested interpretation violates the general rules of statutory interpretation, which we use when interpreting the California Rules of Court. <em>(Alan v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc. </em>(2007) 40 Cal.4th 894, 902 [55 Cal.Rptr.3d 534, 152 P.3d 1109].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">When interpreting a rule, we first look to the words of the rule to ascertain the intent of the drafters and give effect to their plain meaning.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>(In re Joshua A. </em>(2015) 239 Cal.App.4th 208, 214-215 [190 Cal.Rptr.3d 655].) If the language of the rule is clear and unambiguous, we must presume the drafters meant what they said and the plain meaning of the rule governs. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 215.) The language of rule 5.590(a) is clear and unambiguous \u2014 the juvenile court is only required to advise a parent of her appeal rights if she is present at the jurisdictional hearing.  Adopting mother\u2019s interpretation would render the language \u201cif present\u201d in rule 5.590(a) to be surplusage, a result we must avoid. (See <em>In re Joshua A., </em>at p. 215.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-6\">Rule 5.590(a)\u2019s history supports our interpretation. Rule 5.590(a) traces its origin to former rules 251 and 1435(d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (Historical Notes, 23 pt. IB West\u2019s Ann. Court Rules (2006 ed. &amp; 2015 Supp.) foil, rule 5.590, p. 367.) Former rules 251 and 1435(d), which since their adoption applied to juvenile dependency cases,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> always limited advisement of appeal rights to parents who were present for the jurisdiction hearing. (E.g., <em>In re Ryan R. </em>(2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 595, 599 [18 Cal.Rptr.3d 832] [because mother was not present for the permanency hearing, she was not entitled to advisement under former rules 1463(h) and 1435(d) of her right to appeal from termination of her parental rights]; <em>In re Arthur N., supra, </em>36 Cal.App.3d 935, 940 [quoting former rule 251].) The fact that advisement of a parent\u2019s right to appeal from the disposition has always been predicated on presence at the jurisdictional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1238\">*1238</page-number>hearing, despite numerous opportunities for the Judicial Council to provide otherwise, is strong evidence that the plain language of rule 5.590(a) accurately expresses the intent of its drafters.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-5\">Moreover, when interpreting rule 5.590(a), we must read the rule as a whole. <em>(In re Joshua A., supra, </em>239 Cal.App.4th at p. 215.) When a juvenile court sets a hearing under section 366.26, it must give oral notice of the right to file an extraordinary writ \u201cto those present\u201d and provide written notice to \u201cany party who is not present.\u201d (Rule 5.590(b)(1), (2).) We must assume the drafters of rule 5.590(b) knew what they were doing when they required advisement of writ review rights to absent parents but did not similarly require advisement of appeal rights to absent parents.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1056-6\">Notwithstanding the plain language of rule 5.590(a), mother contends she was entitled, as a matter of constitutional due process, to notice of her right to appeal the disposition. We decline to find a due process exception to the application of the waiver rule in this case. (E.g., <em>In re Janee J. </em>(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 198, 208 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 634] [\u201cthe waiver rule will be enforced unless due process forbids it\u201d].) \u201cParents are entitled to due process notice of juvenile court proceedings affecting the care and custody of their children, and the absence of due process notice to a parent is a \u2018fatal defect\u2019 in the juvenile court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d <em>(In re Claudia S. </em>(2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 236, 247 [31 Cal.Rptr.3d 697], quoting <em>In re B. G. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 679, 688-689 [114 Cal.Rptr. 444, 523 P.2d 244].) There is no dispute mother was present for the detention hearing and original jurisdiction hearing and consequently had actual notice of the continued jurisdictional hearing. Mother cites no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1239\">*1239</page-number>decision holding due process requires that a parent who is absent from the jurisdiction hearing must be given notice of his or her right to appeal from the disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-5\">Moreover, mother does not contend she was actually ignorant of her right to appeal from the disposition, she does not contend she would have actually appealed the disposition had she been advised of her right to appeal, and she did not attempt to file a late notice of appeal. <em>(In re Arthur N, supra, </em>36 Cal.App.3d at pp. 938-941 [minor\u2019s failure to timely appeal jurisdictional order under \u00a7 602 was excused where the juvenile court failed to advise minor of his rights to appeal and to appointed counsel on appeal; minor was actually ignorant of appellate rights and diligently filed a late notice of appeal once he learned of his appeal rights].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-6\">In sum, we conclude the juvenile court was not required to advise mother of her right to appeal the dispositional order. Because mother did not appeal the disposition, she may not challenge the jurisdictional finding in this appeal from the termination of parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-7\">B. <em>Although Mother Did Not Challenge Orders Made at the Setting Hearing by Petition for Extraordinary Writ, Good Cause Exists to Address Her Claim of Error in This Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1057-8\">Mother did not challenge the setting order by filing a petition for extraordinary writ, but she argues there is good cause to consider her claim of error on appeal from the order terminating parental rights because the juvenile court did not give her notice of her right to file such a petition. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-9\">\u201cSection 366.26, subdivision (Z), provides that an order setting a section 366.26 hearing \u2018is not appealable at any time\u2019 unless \u2018[a] petition for extraordinary writ review was filed in a timely manner,\u2019 the petition raised the substantive issues and they were supported by an adequate record, and the writ petition \u2018was summarily denied or otherwise not decided on the merits.\u2019 (\u00a7 366.26, subd. (Z)(l); see \u00a7 366.26, subd. (Z)(2).) This writ requirement is implemented by the California Rules of Court. (See \u00a7 366.26, subd. (Z)(3); rules 8.450, 8.452; see also rule 8.403(b)(1).)\u201d <em>(In re A.H. </em>(2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 337, 346 [159 Cal.Rptr.3d 891].) \u201cFailure to file a petition for extraordinary writ review within the period specified by rule, to substantively address the specific issues challenged, or to support that challenge by an adequate record shall preclude subsequent review by appeal of the findings and orders made pursuant to this section.\u201d (\u00a7 366.26, subd.

If the parent is not present for the setting hearing, notice must be given \u201c[w]ithin one day after the court orders the hearing under Welfare and Institutions Code section 366.26, [and] the advisement must be sent by first-class mail by the clerk of the court to the last known address of any party who is not present when the court orders the hearing under Welfare and Institutions Code section 366.26.\u201d (Rule 5.590(b)(2).)

Mother contends good cause is shown here to excuse her failure to timely file a writ petition because the written notice sent to her was incomplete, untimely, and was not mailed to her last known address. We conclude the notice to mother was untimely and was not mailed to an address where she would likely receive it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-7\">Mother was not present at the six-month review hearing conducted on November 12, 2014, when the juvenile court terminated reunification services and set the permanency hearing. After setting the permanency hearing, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1241\">*1241</page-number>juvenile court directed the court clerk \u201cto send notice of intent to file a writ and the writ petition to the parents by first class mail to the last known address.\u201d On November 17, 2014, a deputy clerk of the juvenile court served mother by first class mail with copies of Judicial Council forms JV-825 and JV-820. The clerk mailed the forms to mother at an address on 6th Street in San Bernardino. On February 9, 2015, the forms were returned to the juvenile court by the United States Postal Service marked \u201cRETURN TO SENDER,\u201d and handwritten on the envelope are the words, \u201cNot live here.\u201d .</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-5\">With respect to the content of the notice, mother contends the juvenile court did not comply with rule 5.590(b) because the clerk merely mailed blank copies of Judicial Council forms JV-825 and JV-820. Mother argues the juvenile court was required to also mail her a separate notice of writ review rights, a copy of the minute order indicating the date of the permanency hearing, and to inform her of the date on which a notice of intent to file a writ petition had to be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-6\">True, rule 5.590(b) requires an advisement of writ review rights <em>accompanied </em>by copies of Judicial Council forms JV-825 and JV-820. (Rule 5.590(b)(4).) However, by itself form JV-820 sufficiently informed mother (1) the juvenile court \u201cdecided it will make a permanent plan for this child that may result in the termination of your parental rights and adoption of the child\u201d; (2) if mother wished to challenge that decision she was required to file a notice of intent; and (3) because she was absent when the juvenile court set the permanency hearing, mother was required to file her notice of intent within 12 days of the date the court clerk mailed the forms. (See <em>In re A.H., supra, </em>218 Cal.App.4th at pp. 346-347 [summarizing the advisements contained in Judicial Council form JV-820].) Moreover, the social worker, and not the court, is required to give a parent notice of the date and time of the permanency hearing. (\u00a7 294, subd. (e)(1).) Including with the notice of writ rights a copy of the minute order setting a permanency hearing is certainly a good idea, but rule 5.590(b) does not require it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-7\">The content of the juvenile court\u2019s advisement may have satisfied rule 5.590(b), but there is no dispute the juvenile court clerk did not serve mother with notice of her writ review rights within one day of the juvenile court setting a permanency hearing, as expressly mandated by rule 5.590(b)(2). A parent who is absent from the setting hearing has only 12 days after the date the notice is mailed to file her notice of intent to file a writ petition (rule 8.450(e)(4)(B)), so strict compliance with the time for giving notice is crucial to implementing the Legislature\u2019s stated intent that reasonable efforts be made to complete appellate review within the applicable time periods for conducting the permanency hearing (\u00a7 366.26, subd. (/)(4)(A)). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1242\">*1242</page-number>The juvenile court\u2019s five-day delay in giving mother notice thwarted that legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-5\">More importantly, the juvenile court clerk did not mail the notice to an address where mother would likely receive it. As noted, <em>ante, </em>the juvenile court clerk mailed the notice on November 17, 2014, to an address on 6th Street in San Bernardino. This address first appears in the record in the social worker\u2019s April 15, 2014 report filed for the jurisdictional/dispositional hearing. But as early as March 25, 2014, the juvenile court was aware that mother had no address where she could be reached. Moreover, in a May 12, 2014 declaration of due diligence regarding the father\u2019s whereabouts, the social worker informed the juvenile court that the father did not live at the 6th Street address and that the current residents \u2014 who were clearly unrelated to the father and mother \u2014 had lived there for three years. In a November 12, 2014 status review report, the social worker informed the juvenile court that mother\u2019s address was \u201cunknown\u201d and reported mother told the social worker she was homeless. And at the six-month review hearing, mother\u2019s attorney reiterated that mother\u2019s whereabouts and current address were unknown, and informed the court that mother calls the paternal grandmother but does not leave a number where she can be reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-6\">Although the 6th Street address was literally the \u201clast known address\u201d on file for mother, we conclude service of notice to that address did not comply with rule 5.590(b)(2). \u201cAt the first appearance by a parent or guardian in proceedings under section 300 et seq., the court must order each parent or guardian to provide a mailing address. [\u00b6] (1) The court must advise that the mailing address provided will be used by the court, the clerk, and the social services agency for the purposes of notice of hearings and the mailing of all documents related to the proceedings. [\u00b6] (2) The court must advise that until and unless the parent or guardian, or the attorney of record for the parent or guardian, submits written notification of a change of mailing address, the address provided will be used, and notice requirements will be satisfied by appropriate service at that address.\u201d (Rule 5.534(m); see \u00a7 316.1, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-7\">When the juvenile court strictly complies with section 316.1, subdivision (a), and rule 5.534(m), but the parent fails to inform the court of his or her new mailing address, the parent\u2019s failure to receive advisement of writ review rights mailed pursuant to rule 5.590(b)(2) does not constitute good cause to excuse the parent\u2019s failure to file a petition for extraordinary writ. <em>(In re A.H., supra, </em>218 Cal.App.4th at pp. 348-351.) At the detention hearing, the juvenile court directed mother to complete Judicial Council form JV-140 (\u201cNotification of Mailing Address\u201d). But there is no indication the juvenile court informed mother of the importance of updating her mailing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1243\">*1243</page-number>address, and there is no indication in the record the court inquired into mother\u2019s address when she failed to submit the form.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1061-5\">Even if we were to conclude the juvenile court complied with section 316.1, subdivision (a), and rule 5.534(m), and even if mother failed to keep the court apprised of her current mailing address, we would still conclude the juvenile court did not comply with rule 5.590(b)(2). The juvenile court knew for almost seven months that neither mother nor the father lived at the 6th Street address, yet the court clerk mailed the advisement of writ review rights to that address. That mother was apparently homeless at the time of the setting hearing did not excuse the juvenile court in mailing notice of writ review rights to an address it knew was no longer good.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-6\">The decision in <em>In re Rashad B., supra, </em>76 Cal.App.4th 442 is instructive. There, the juvenile court did not mail notice of writ review rights to a mother who was absent from a setting hearing. On appeal, the county social services agency argued the failure to mail notice was harmless because the mother was homeless and had no address. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 448-449.) After finding the juvenile court failed to comply with section 316.1 and former rule 1412(1) (current rule 5.534(m)), the appellate court held that the court\u2019s error was not harmless simply because the mother was homeless. <em>(Rashad B., </em>at pp. 449-450.) \u201cA permanent mailing address, designated for purposes of receiving notices, need not be the address at which a parent is actually residing. Many homeless people are capable of designating a permanent mailing address at which they can receive mail.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 450.) The court noted the children\u2019s maternal grandmother, in whose custody one of the children was placed at the detention hearing <em>(id. </em>at p. 445), \u201cwas a logical candidate for designation of a permanent mailing address by appellant\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 450).</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-7\">In this case, the most logical place to mail the advisement of mother\u2019s writ review rights would have been to the paternal grandmother\u2019s house, where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1244\">*1244</page-number>the children had been placed since the jurisdictional/dispositional hearing. Mother\u2019s attorney told the juvenile court mother had been in telephone contact with the paternal grandmother. Had the juvenile court mailed the notice to mother at the paternal grandmother\u2019s home, there was at least a reasonable chance mother would either actually receive the notice or at least would have been told such notice was mailed to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">In its brief, CFS argues we should find mother is barred from challenging the order terminating reunification services because, even if the juvenile court did not provide adequate notice under rule 5.590(b)(2), the decision not to file a writ petition was vested in the sound authority and discretion of mother\u2019s guardian ad litem. \u201cThe effect of the guardian ad litem\u2019s appointment is to transfer direction and control of the litigation from the parent to the guardian ad litem, who may waive the parent\u2019s right to a contested hearing. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re James F. </em>(2008) 42 Cal.4th 901, 910 [70 Cal.Rptr.3d 358, 174 P.3d 180].) \u201c[A] guardian ad litem\u2019s role is more than an attorney\u2019s but less than a party\u2019s. The guardian may make tactical and even fundamental decisions affecting the litigation but always with the interest of the guardian\u2019s charge in mind. Specifically, the guardian may not compromise fundamental rights, including the right to trial, without some countervailing and significant benefit.\u201d <em>(In re Christina B. </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1441, 1454 [23 Cal.Rptr.2d 918].) The cases cited by CFS do not support the proposition that a guardian ad litem appointed for a parent in a juvenile dependency proceeding has the authority to forgo filing a petition for extraordinary writ \u2014 with the consequence of waiving the parent\u2019s right to challenge orders made at the setting hearing \u2014 without first consulting with the parent and the parent\u2019s attorney. The record does not reflect such a consultation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">Finally, CFS argues mother was not prejudiced by the guardian ad litem\u2019s decision not to file a petition for extraordinary writ and, by extension, was not prejudiced by not receiving proper notice under rule 5.590(b), because the juvenile court\u2019s order terminating reunification services was not an abuse of discretion, and a writ petition would have been denied anyway.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-6\">In <em>In re Cathina W., supra, </em>68 Cal.App.4th 716, the social services agency argued the mother could not challenge the setting order on appeal from the termination of parental rights because substantial evidence supported the setting order. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 724.) The appellate court rejected the notion that a parent must show prejudice from the juvenile court\u2019s failure to correctly and timely advise the parent of their rights before he or she may challenge the setting order by petition for extraordinary writ. \u201cWe will not impose such a condition upon the mother\u2019s right to appellate review of the merits of the setting order. Under respondent\u2019s argument, as we understand it, we cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1245\">*1245</page-number>evaluate the merits of the setting order unless we find that the order was the result of prejudicial error by the juvenile court and, consequently, that a writ reversing the order would have issued had the mother filed a timely and proper . . . notice and petition. However, a determination that the setting order was infected with prejudicial error obviously requires an evaluation of the merits of the order. We therefore do not see any purpose to be served by adopting the rule advocated by respondent.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>So too here. We decline to impose a prejudice requirement when the parent\u2019s failure to challenge a setting order by writ petition is the result of the juvenile court\u2019s failure to comply with rule 5.590(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">On these facts, we conclude the juvenile court did not provide mother with timely and adequate notice of her right to seek appellate review of the setting order, as mandated by rule 5.590(b). Therefore, notwithstanding mother\u2019s failure to file a petition for extraordinary writ challenging orders made at the setting hearing, we find good cause to consider her claim of error in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">C.-E<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1063-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-8\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-9\">The orders terminating mother\u2019s parental rights are reversed. On remand, the juvenile court shall order CFS to comply with the notice provisions of ICWA and to file all required documentation with the juvenile court for its inspection. If, after proper notice, a tribe claims the children are Indian children, the juvenile court shall proceed in conformity with all provisions of ICWA. And, the children, mother, and any Indian tribe claiming the children are Indian children may petition the juvenile court to invalidate any orders that may have violated ICWA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-10\">If, on the other hand, no tribe makes such a claim, prior defective notice becomes harmless error.

At the time, former section 600 governed juvenile dependency proceedings. (Stats. 1971, ch. 1729, \u00a7 1, p. 3676.) The Legislature subsequently repealed former section 600 and enacted section 300. (Stats. 1976, ch. 1068, \u00a7\u00a7 6, 20, pp. 4759, 4782.) Effective July 1, 1978, the Judicial Council amended former rule 251 to substitute section 300 for former section 600. (Historical Notes, 23 pt. IB West\u2019s Ann. Court Rules (2006 ed.) foil, rule 5.590, p. 574.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1056-7\"> Rule 5.590(b) implements a specific legislative mandate that the Judicial Council adopt a rule to ensure a parent is given notice of the right to challenge by extraordinary writ an order setting a permanency hearing. (\u00a7 366.26, subd. (Z)(3)(A).) No similar legislative directive governs the giving of notice to parents of the right to appeal from the dispositional order. (See \u00a7 395.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-8\">We may easily surmise the reason behind this distinction. An order setting a permanency hearing under section 366.26 places a parent in immediate peril of losing his or her parental rights, and the need to timely bring an appellate challenge is paramount. Providing notice of the right to challenge the order to an absent parent is an additional layer of protection to the parent\u2019s rights. In contrast, except for in those limited circumstances where the juvenile court finds jurisdiction but bypasses reunification services and immediately sets a permanency hearing (in which case the parent in entitled to notice under rule 5.590(b) whether or not they are present), a jurisdictional finding does not place a parent in immediate peril of losing his or her parental rights. The parent will have a period of reunification services, and the ability to establish fitness and prevent the setting of a hearing under section 366.26. Because failure to timely appeal from the jurisdictional order is not of the same magnitude as failure to challenge the order setting the permanency hearing, the Legislature and Judicial Council could reasonably conclude notice need not be given to parents who are absent from the jurisdictional hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1061-8\"> In its report filed for the jurisdictional/dispositional hearing, CFS recommended the juvenile court find a \u201cJV-140 dated March 25, 2014 is on file.\u201d The juvenile court adopted that finding, and the May 12, 2014 minute order from the jurisdictional/dispositional hearing states, \u201cThe court finds that mother has/have a current JV-140 on file with the court.

If mother had actually filed with the juvenile court a form JV-140 dated March 25, 2014, that form \u2014 like mother\u2019s form ICWA-020 bearing the same date \u2014 would have been included in the record on appeal.
