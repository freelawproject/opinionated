Four men got out of the car: defendant Marvin Douglas Johnson, defendant Simon Thornton, AJ Schnebly and William (Buck) Crocker. Crocker, wearing a red bandana that covered his face from the nose down, ran towards the group at the campsite, and with a gun in his hand, shouted for everybody to get down on the ground. Within minutes, Joe Litteral, who had been staying at the campsite, was shot to death and Brandon Haggett, another visitor, was shot and seriously wounded. It was stipulated at trial that a fingerprint lifted from the shotgun later collected in evidence belonged to Crocker, and it was undisputed at trial that defendants Johnson and Thornton, who were tried jointly, were not the shooters. Johnson and Thornton were tried on three counts: murder, attempted murder, and attempted kidnapping. The murder charge was based on two theories: first degree felony murder in connection with attempted robbery or attempted kidnapping, and second degree murder based on aiding and abetting another who acted with malice aforethought. Johnson and Thornton were convicted of first degree murder and attempted murder, and were acquitted of attempted kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-8\">The defendants appealed, contending that (1) the trial court erred in instructing the jury pursuant to CALCRIM No. 335 that they were accomplices as a matter of law, and (2) the court erred in instructing the jury pursuant to CALCRIM No. 548 that the jury did not have to unanimously agree on a theory of murder. Johnson separately contended that the court erred in giving an instruction regarding voluntary intoxication pursuant to CALCRIM No. 404. Thornton separately argued that he was denied effective assistance of counsel and cumulative error compelled reversal. We held that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that it did not have to unanimously agree on a theory of murder where, as here, one theory of murder was first degree murder and the other theory was second degree murder, and that this error was prejudicial. We therefore conditionally reversed the first degree murder convictions and remanded the case to permit the district attorney to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1252\">*1252</page-number>retry the cases or to accept a reduction of the murder convictions to second degree murder. We found the remaining grounds for appeal without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-4\">The California Supreme Court granted defendants\u2019 petitions for review and transferred the case back to this court with directions to vacate our prior opinion and reconsider the matter in light of the recently issued <em>People v. Banks </em>(2015) 61 Cal.4th 788, 809-810 [189 Cal.Rptr.3d 208, 351 P.3d 330] <em>(Banks).) </em>The specific page references in the Supreme Court\u2019s order focused our reconsideration on a point relevant to our discussion of implied malice as a theory underlying defendants\u2019 murder convictions. As we will explain, we conclude that <em>Banks </em>does not apply to the issue presented here, and no change in our disposition of the case is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-6\">In July 2011, Johnson and his wife, Deborah Cano, were homeless and living on the \u201coutside\u201d in a field in a tent in Mendocino County. They had a 12-year, troubled relationship that Cano described as \u201cups and downs, abusive, controlling.\u201d Johnson hit, beat and threatened her on many occasions and was also verbally and emotionally abusive. She was afraid of Johnson and many times tried to leave him. When she left he would send people to find her, or he would look for her himself. She could never get very far away from him, and \u201c[s]o I never really had any out, no way out.\u201d They sometimes lived in Nebraska where she had family, but would regularly return to California, where they were frequently homeless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-7\">According to Cano, Johnson was doing drugs and drinking and would be gone for several days at a time. In July 2011, Cano decided to get away from him. Initially, she went to AJ Schnebly\u2019s house. She did not stay with Schnebly, however, because he was Johnson\u2019s friend and that made her feel unsafe. She \u201ctook off walking\u201d until she ran into Joe Litteral, who was also homeless. She and Johnson had hung out with Litteral in the past; he was an \u201cacquaintance that became a friend.\u201d According to Cano, Litteral and Johnson had a good relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-8\">Litteral offered to take Cano to the Pine Cone Motel where he had a room. A lot of people were in and out of the motel, and three or four people spent the night in Litteral\u2019s room. Cano did not leave the room because she did not feel safe. After she arrived, Johnson sent Schnebly and two other people to check on her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-9\">The next day Cano, still at the Pine Cone Motel, overheard Johnson and a friend of Litteral\u2019s named Brandon Haggett on the phone. Johnson, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1253\">*1253</page-number>yelling at Haggett and she overheard Johnson saying, \u201cI am going to kill you. I am going to come there and I am going to kill you.\u201d He said this two or three times.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">Cano and the other people who were staying with her and Litteral at the Pine Cone Motel decided to go to the Bu-Shay campground at Lake Mendocino. Cano estimated that there were at least nine people at the campground, including two children. Brandon Haggett and Joe Litteral were among this group.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-6\">The day after they arrived, Johnson came up over the ridge \u201cyelling and screaming.\u201d He sent two or three people into the campground ahead of him. Cano did not know them by name, but was familiar with them. Cano did not speak with Johnson directly. Instead, she went inside her tent. Johnson stayed at the campsite into the evening hours eating, talking, smoking marijuana and drinking with, among others, Litteral and Haggett.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-7\">Toward the end of the evening, Johnson approached her. He said things like \u201cI am going to get you. I am going to get you back. I know I am going to get you, and you better watch what you are doing. You better not have them do anything, and if I see you doing anything, Pm going to hurt somebody.\u201d Cano testified that Johnson said \u201cif he seen me with Joe Litteral\u201d in a romantic way, \u201che was going to hurt us.\u201d After Johnson left, Litteral told her that she should stay in the tent with him because \u201cwe\u2019re not going to let nobody scare us.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-8\">Johnson went to the campsite next to theirs, where six or seven other people were staying. He stayed the night. The next morning he was back at Cano\u2019s campsite \u201ctalking with all the guys.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-9\">On July 20, as it was becoming evening, a car pulled up \u201creally quick\u201d to the tent where Cano was staying. The doors flew open. The first person Cano recognized was AJ Schnebly, who had a pistol grip shotgun in his hands. Cano did not see anything in Johnson\u2019s hands. Schnebly racked the shotgun. Moments later, Cano saw Brandon Haggett \u201cfighting with a guy with a handgun.\u201d This man (later identified as Crocker) was wearing a bandana over his nose and mouth. Cano heard a gunshot and saw Haggett drop to his knees.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-10\">Litteral, who was about 55 feet away, ran toward Haggett. Cano saw the man with the gun \u201cshoot him, point blank.\u201d She heard a second shot, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1254\">*1254</page-number>testified \u201cI seen Joe [Litteral] go down. ... I screamed, and I started running over there . . . .\u201d At that point, Johnson ran toward her and grabbed at her. As he did so he yelled, \u201cGet in the fucking car, bitch.\u201d She ran the other way towards Haggett and Litteral.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-4\">Brandon Haggett, one of the shooting victims, testified about the days that led up to the incident and the shooting itself. In July 2011, Haggett was staying at the Pine Cone Motel with his friend Joe Litteral. Cano came to stay at the motel. Over the course of Cano\u2019s first day at the motel, Haggett answered five or six calls from a man who identified himself as Cano\u2019s husband. This man, who Haggett later learned was Johnson, told Haggett, \u201cI want her back,\u201d \u201c[bjetter bring my wife back. I am going to kill you. I am going to find you.\u201d Johnson was \u201cvery angry, very upset.\u201d Haggett was under the impression that \u201che felt like we were keeping her against her will. So he was very upset with us.\u201d All of the conversations he had with Johnson contained threats of some kind, including threats to kill.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-5\">At several points, Cano spoke with Johnson on the phone. Haggett heard her yelling at Johnson, and at one point she agreed to meet Johnson to see if they could work things out.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-6\">Haggett did not take Johnson\u2019s threats seriously because \u201cpeople threaten people all the time when they are hurt. They never act on it.\u201d But because the calls were creating \u201ca lot of strain\u201d among the people at the motel, they decided to leave and go to a campground at Lake Mendocino.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-7\">A day after they arrived at the campground, Johnson showed up with three other people. He was yelling at his wife, and she was yelling back at him. Haggett told him \u201cif you are looking for a fight, I am going to stop you right here because you are not bringing this into the campground.\u201d Johnson and his friends accepted Haggett\u2019s invitation to stay to eat, drink beer and smoke marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-8\">The next day, July 20, 2011, at around dinner time, a car came speeding into the campground about 60 miles an hour. The car skidded about five feet before it stopped. Four doors swung open, and four men came out. One had a shotgun and one had a .45. Johnson came out of the right-hand passenger side rear door. Haggett did not see who came out of the driver\u2019s side.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-9\">The man with the shotgun (Schnebly) stood by the car. The man with the .45 (later identified as Crocker) was moving toward the campground. He was running fast, and wore a wig and a red bandana that covered his face. There were about 15 or 20 people at the campground. Crocker pointed the gun in the air and then moved it around in a circle toward the people at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>campground and yelled \u201c[everybody down on the ground.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the same time, Johnson was yelling at Cano, \u201c \u2018See what we can do? Get in the car.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-5\">Haggett told one of the women at the campsite to \u201c \u2018[g]et the kids out of here.\u2019 \u201d Haggett then \u201cmade a split decision to protect the girls and [Litteral\u2019s] life.\u201d He ran up to Crocker, grabbed Crocker\u2019s gun, put it to his own chest and told Crocker \u201cto pull the trigger a couple of times.\u201d When Crocker did not pull the trigger, Haggett started fighting with him over the gun. In the struggle over the gun, Crocker dropped to the ground on his back. Haggett was on top of him, and it felt like Crocker was losing his grip on the handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-6\">At that point, Haggett felt three \u201csevere blows\u201d to the back of his head. It sounded like metal hitting a rock. Haggett turned around to face the person who was hitting him. He identified that person at trial as Thornton. As Haggett pulled back his fist to hit Thornton, Haggett was shot point blank in the chest by Crocker.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-7\">Haggett tried to get up and saw Litteral start fighting with Thornton. Crocker ran toward the car and then \u201ctum[ed] back around and start[ed] firing in Joe [Litteral]\u2019s direction.\u201d Haggett heard three shots.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-8\">Litteral dropped to his knees, and Haggett heard him yelling, \u201c \u2018Oh shit. I am dead.\u2019 \u201d All the men ran toward the car. Johnson was by the car and yelled to Cano to get into the car again.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> During the entire incident, Johnson stayed by the car. When the men got in the car, Cano was over where Litteral had fallen and Johnson \u201cmade no attempt to make sure he got Deborah to leave . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-9\">Litteral bled to death from a gunshot wound that perforated his right lung. His right arm was fractured by a blow with such significant force that there was a tremendous amount of hemorrhage around the broken bone. The forensic pathologist believed the bone was fractured by something round and wooden that could create this amount of force and type of injury, such as a baseball bat or a bowling pin. Haggett was shot in the left arm and is now unable to extend his fingers or move his wrist on that arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1073-10\">Schnebly\u2019s nephew, Kenny Kumpula, testified that after the shooting, Thornton told him that he had gone to Lake Mendocino with Schnebly and Crocker \u201c[o]ver some money and a woman,\u201d and \u201cto beat some people up.\u201d Thornton also told Kumpula that \u201cpeople at the lake owed him money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>\n<em>Defendant Johnson\u2019s Statements to Police</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-4\">Defendant Johnson gave several interviews to the police, substantial portions of which were played for the jury. Johnson admitted he drove Schnebly, Crocker and another person to and from the campsite where the shootings took place. He told the police that he had told \u201cAJ and those guys\u201d that there was \u201cweed and cash\u201d at the campground, and that while at \u201cthe creek\u201d in Willits the morning of the shootings, he knew that they were \u201cgoing out there to rob these mother fuckers.\u201d Put another way, Johnson told the police that he knew they were going out to the campsite to \u201chandle some shit.\u201d \u201cI thought they were going out there to argue and fight maybe and try to get their money or whatever but not like that.\u201d At another point he explained that everybody was \u201cout there for the money and the weed that\u2019s out there.\u201d He also admitted that he saw Schnebly\u2019s and Crocker\u2019s guns before they arrived at the campsite. Johnson told the police that when he was driving the men to the campsite immediately before the shootings, he \u201cknew they were driving out there to go rob some people.\u201d Johnson related that the others told him \u201cyou\u2019re just going for the lady. We\u2019re getting all the money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-5\">After he was arrested, Johnson took the police to the place in Potter Valley where the guns had been dumped after the shootings. He told them a bat was there too, but no bat was recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-6\">\n<em>Defendant Thornton\u2019s Phone Calls from Jail</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1074-7\">Thornton made three recorded phone calls from jail. He was aware he was being recorded, and spoke cryptically. In one call, Thornton spoke to \u201cJustin,\u201d and told him that \u201cthere\u2019s some things out I need to get, make sure that are disposed of.\u201d He told him where to find the items in \u201cP.V.\u201d and explained that they were in a \u201clot of bush.\u201d Thornton said, \u201cWhen you find the stuff \u2014 . . . [\u00b6] \u2014 when you find what I need disappearing, you\u2019ll know what to do.\u201d (When Thornton testified at trial, he admitted he was talking about the guns used at the incident.) In another recorded phone call, Thornton told his fianc\u00e9 Tanya Thurman to tell Schnebly that \u201cwe got rid of\u2019 the thing that Thornton \u201cwanted to get from [Schnebly],\u201d and told her to \u201c[t]ell [Schnebly] all of that, nothing to worry about unless somebody that was with us says something.\u201d Apparently referring to Kenny Kumpula (Schnebly\u2019s nephew and Thurman\u2019s friend, and the person whose car was borrowed so the entourage could drive to the lake on the day of the shootings), Thurman told Thornton that Kumpula \u201cwants to know why he got lied to by his uncle and you and that he doesn\u2019t care and that anyone who lies to him is dead to him.\u201d Thornton replied, \u201cWe did it to protect him because if he knew what was really going on, it could be bad for him. And it wasn\u2019t planned to go the way it went.\u201d Kumpula was apparently in the room when Thornton made this comment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1257\">*1257</page-number>because Thurman then replied, \u201cHe just walked out of the room because he was like shaking.\u201d To which Thornton responded, \u201cShut your fucking trap and listen. It\u2019s because we were protecting him and the other thing is nothing went according to plan. . . . [\u00b6] You need to go find him and tell him he, he needs to fucking make sure to keep it under wraps.\u201d When Thurman replied that she did not know if he would, because he was so angry, Thornton replied, \u201cIt\u2019s my future.\u201d In the third phone call, again to his flane\u00e9, Thornton asked her to tell Kumpula that a \u201cgood soldier\u201d \u201cfollows orders.\u201d Thornton told Thurman to tell Kumpula that he \u201cwas looking at the bigger picture. I was looking at making our life more comfortable. All of ours.\u201d It\u2019s apparent from the recording that as Thornton spoke Thurman was relaying his words to Kumpula.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-5\">\n<em>Defendant Thornton\u2019s Defense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-6\">Thornton testified in his own defense that on July 20, the day of the incident, he was at a \u201cfree meal place\u201d in Willits when Schnebly, who was his friend\u2019s uncle, showed up, followed by Johnson and Crocker. Thornton testified that \u201c[wjhile we were eating, some things were discussed, just random shoot the breeze kind of thing. Introductions to each other, introduction to people that were with us. [\u00b6] I know that [Schnebly, Crocker] and I\u2019m not sure but possibly Johnson . . . stepped aside at one point and had a conversation on the side. I\u2019m not 100 percent sure though if [Johnson] did. And they came back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-7\">At that point, \u201csomebody\u201d said he needed \u201cto make a trip\u201d and Thornton was asked to go along with them. Thornton wanted to join them: \u201c[W]hy not. It\u2019s just a joyride as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d He also wanted Schnebly to like him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-8\">Schnebly called Kenny Kumpula to use his car, and soon the four men got into the car and left town. Johnson drove. On the way, Crocker \u201cwanted to stop by the place where he was staying to grab a backpack. So we did that. . . . [H]e came out with a green . . . Jansport backpack, it might have been a duffel bag.\u201d Crocker put the backpack into the trunk of the car. Thornton was under the impression from what the other people in the car were saying that they were going to Ukiah.</p>\n<p id=\"b1075-9\">However, \u201cat some point a detour was made. I don\u2019t know who decided it. It was decided that we would detour and go out to Lake Mendocino. So as we\u2019re going out there at one point we pull over, the backpack was taken out of the trunk and put on the floorboard in front of [Schnebly] and we continued on our way.\u201d They stopped at the check-in booth at the campground and told the ranger that \u201cwe were just going to drop off something real quick.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1258\">*1258</page-number>They drove into the campground and \u201c[a]t that point all I remember . . . was [Schnebly] leaned forward to his feet area where the backpack was. And he starts unzipping. I see [Crocker] put on like a mask over his face. I see [Schnebly] start assembling what looked like a shotgun. I didn\u2019t know for sure if it was a shotgun or a rifle at first because I wasn\u2019t paying attention, I was kind of \u2014 I honestly was freaking out. I was scared because all of a sudden there\u2019s a gun coming out of nowhere. Then I also saw that [Crocker] had at one point he had like a black bag . *. . and I saw him at some point unzip that and there was a gun in there, there was some clips and ammunition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-4\">Thornton had just met Crocker that day, and had met Johnson once or twice before, casually at the homeless shelter. He had only known Schnebly for about a week and a half.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-5\">A lot of thoughts ran through Thornton\u2019s head, including the possibility that the men were going to hurt him or Johnson. He did know \u201cat one point when we were heading toward Ukiah that we were detouring for that purpose [picking up Johnson\u2019s wife] but I didn\u2019t know what the point of the guns were .... Why do you need guns to go pick somebody up?\u2019 He did not \u201cknow if she wanted to go willingly or I was not informed of that. I assumed that it was willingly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-6\">They \u201cproceeded to go up into the campground. At one point they stopped. [Schnebly] opens the door to [the] passenger front seat and gets out with the shotgun across his body. . . . As he\u2019s doing that, [Crocker] got out behind him . . . .\u201d Defendant Johnson \u201c[j]ust sat in the driver seat driving, scared pretty much as much as I was from the look of him.\u201d Thornton testified that at some point, Johnson may have \u201cstood up outside the car,\u201d but he went no further than that.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-7\">\u201cAnd so then all of a sudden I hear arguing, and I\u2019m still in the car, and I look over from the car and I see [Crocker] arguing with . . . Brandon Haggett. And I hear arguing and \u2018shoot me, shoot me,\u2019 being yelled at him by Haggett towards [Crocker] and then somebody else came up, who I didn\u2019t know it was at the time, with what it almost looked like a baseball bat but I guess was a tree branch. . . . [A]nd he proceeded to try to whack [Crocker] with it.\u201d He thought Crocker was hit two or three times with the tree branch. He then heard gunshots and saw Haggett fall to the ground and then Litteral fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b1076-8\">Thornton testified that all this time he was in the car, \u201cfreaking out.\u201d He \u201cdidn\u2019t expect guns to be showing up, you know, I didn\u2019t know what the hell we were doing. I was just going along for a ride. If I would have known then I would have never got in that car because people dying is not a cool thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1259\">*1259</page-number>Crocker and Schnebly got into the car, and they all left. There was an argument in the car about where to go next. Johnson wanted to get out of the car and leave, as did Thornton. Thornton did not say anything. They went to Potter Valley to drop off the guns, and then on to Ukiah. According to Thornton, Johnson said, \u201cI had nothing to do with this. I didn\u2019t have no reason to be involved in this. I didn\u2019t touch no gun, my hands are clean. . . .\u201d Johnson got out of the car. Schnebly and Crocker had an argument about who would drive the car, and Thornton volunteered to take it back to Willits. On the way, Schnebly and Crocker threatened Thornton that if he said anything, they would hurt him and his fianc\u00e9, who was pregnant at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-5\">Thornton admitted that he made a telephone call to \u201cJustin\u201d \u2014 his mother\u2019s boyfriend \u2014 from jail, and that his cryptic instruction to Justin was to retrieve the guns from Potter Valley (referred to in the phone call as P.V.). Thornton tried to minimize the phrase \u201cmake them disappear\u201d as meaning only that he was afraid that Crocker and Schnebly would go back for the weapons, and what he actually wanted was for Justin to take the guns to the police. He admitted he told his fianc\u00e9 in a phone call that he did it \u201cto make our lives more comfortable,\u201d but testified that he was not referring to money.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-6\">Thornton admitted that when he voluntarily spoke to the police in September while being held in jail pending trial, he told them that possibly Johnson had a bat, since Schnebly and Crocker had the only other weapons identified at the scene. At trial, he denied saying that he believed Johnson swung the bat, and tried to explain the inconsistency by stating that when he was told by police that there was a bat, he deduced it must have been Johnson\u2019s. He never saw Johnson use a bat at the scene. If he had told the police that Johnson had swung the bat and that he was afraid to talk about it because he was afraid of Johnson, he had only done so under the influence of the medication he was taking at the time of the interview in September. In fact, he was not afraid of Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-7\">Thornton admitted he had given conflicting statements about his understanding about why they were going to the lake. At trial, he said he did not know the intentions of the other men in the car; when he spoke to the police in September, he said he thought Johnson wanted to go to the lake to \u201cpick up\u201d his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-8\">Thornton denied carrying a baseball bat. He explained: \u201cI didn\u2019t carry a bat around. I carry ... a six-foot tall galvanized steel pipe that I use for walking purposes because I have back problems. I use it as basically a hiking stick and I actually found that in the dumpster.\u201d He admitted that three or four days before the shooting he had \u201ca confrontation with somebody and used a wooden bat and it was broken in the process.\u201d He described this bat as a small Giants memorabilia bat.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1260\">*1260</page-number>Thornton testified that although he had earlier told a police officer that he had gotten out of the car at the campground, he was wrong. He attributed this to medication he was taking at the time he spoke to the police in September. Similarly, although he had earlier told Detective Whiteaker that he saw someone destroy the bat, and that there were two bats in the car, he denied the truth of those two statements at trial, explaining again that the medication he was taking at the time made it difficult for him to understand Whiteaker\u2019s questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-4\">\n<em>Defendant Johnson\u2019s Defense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-5\">Lorraine Strom, Cano\u2019s mother, testified that she never witnessed nor was told by her daughter that Johnson was physically abusing her. According to Strom, her daughter is a chronic liar, something Strom believed stemmed from the fact that in her first marriage \u201cshe got hit in the head with a baseball bat\u201d by her husband. Cano and Johnson had verbal arguments, although nothing physical.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-6\">Defendant Johnson testified in his own defense. He described his relationship with Cano. Their main problem was with \u201cher being unfaithful.... She was cheating on me with my own friends . . . .\u201d When he first met her, they were both using drugs. They had frequent arguments, and although those arguments were verbally abusive, they were not physical. He described Cano as \u201cvery jealous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-7\">Towards the middle of July, Cano left him over an incident involving a woman. Johnson went looking for Cano and learned she was with Joe Litteral and Brandon Haggett and others at the Pine Cone Motel. He went to the motel to find out whether she was planning to come back to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-8\">Cano told him at the motel that she was not going with him. She accused him of cheating on her. She was not crying; she was angry. Johnson went to the park and began to drink; he was a little upset. He called the motel once to speak to Cano, and she told him not to call her. He denied calling Cano more than that one time, and denied being mad at her when he called.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-9\">The next time Johnson saw Cano was at Lake Mendocino. He went there to \u201ctalk to my wife and maybe she was going to come back with me. I\u2019m not sure. I wasn\u2019t going to make her.\u201d At first, the conversation was \u201cheated\u201d but ultimately, the man to whom he was speaking, Joe Litteral, invited him into the campsite. He was familiar with Litteral from running into him in Willits. Litteral told Johnson that he thought Cano needed some time away from him. Litteral said that Cano thought Johnson was cheating on her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-10\">Johnson told Litteral it was fine; he was \u201ckind of hurt but I wasn\u2019t going to bust a grape over it.\u201d He decided to continue trying to talk to Cano about it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1261\">*1261</page-number>so he stayed overnight at the next campsite. He heard Cano crying in the tent she was sharing with Litteral. He understood she was crying because she did not want him to be there. He also felt that she was trying to make people feel sorry for her. He did not go to her tent to talk to her that evening.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">At the end of the evening, someone asked Johnson if he could help them get some marijuana. Johnson talked to someone at another campsite and made a deal with a man named Brackett whereby Johnson would receive $100 for every pound that was bought. At that point Johnson did not know how big the deal would be; he anticipated he would be paid by the people who bought the marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-6\">The next morning, July 20, Johnson introduced Brackett to Litteral and a man named River to set up the marijuana deal. Johnson then left the campground and went back to Willits. He met Crocker and some other men \u201cat the creek.\u201d At some point Schnebly showed up. The men were talking, \u201csmoking some pot, drinking some whisky, some beer.\u201d After Schnebly said he was going to Lake Mendocino with some girls, Johnson told him that \u201cWell, okay if you guys go up there, ask them if a weed deal went through because they owe me a couple hundred bucks.\u201d When Schnebly asked him to elaborate, Johnson told him there might be \u201cweed and money\u201d up there. Johnson admitted he was \u201cdrinking so I kind of, you know, blabbed a lot to him\u201d; he was \u201crunning [his] mouth, . . . [\u00b6] . . . talking big talk.\u201d Johnson bragged that he had set up a big marijuana deal<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1079-7\">Schnebly left to get some food. Johnson and Crocker met up with him a little while later and also had lunch together. Schnebly was with defendant Thornton and Thornton\u2019s flane\u00e9. Johnson had seen Thornton before but did not know him. Johnson \u201cnoticed [Crocker] and [Schnebly] talking but [he] wasn\u2019t up close enough to know what they were saying.\u201d Afterwards Schnebly told him that their ride out to the lake had cancelled. He told Johnson he was going to borrow a car and asked Johnson if he had a driver\u2019s license. Johnson said he did not want to go back out to the lake. He had just been there, and he wanted to stay in Willits. Schnebly said \u201cwe just want to go out and drink a lot out there and talk to these people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1079-8\">Johnson said he was not sure and left to get some food. At this point it was about 4:30 or 5:00 p.m. Johnson assumed that while he was gone Thornton and Schnebly continued to talk about this plan. They approached him again and asked him to give them a ride. His response was \u201c[w]ell, I guess, I could try see if my wife\u2019s ready to go home yet or not.\u201d He explained that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1262\">*1262</page-number>\u201c[u]sually after a few days of being pissed [she] comes straggling in . . . .\u201d Johnson\u2019s intent then was to go up to Lake Mendocino to talk to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-4\">He realized in \u201cbits and pieces\u201d what Schnebly and Crocker intended to do at the lake. When Johnson, Schnebly and Crocker went to Burger King where Schnebly\u2019s nephew Kenny Kumpula<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> had a car, he may have heard a conversation about robbing the people at the campground, but he did not quite remember because he \u201chad quite a bit to drink that day.\u201d He thought he probably heard \u201cbits and pieces\u201d of what was being said. Because Johnson had a driver\u2019s license, Kenny loaned him the car. At that point, his intention was to give the three men a ride to the campsite. He knew they wanted \u201cto do something\u201d but he \u201cwasn\u2019t really sure what. . . they wanted to do. Little bits and pieces were coming out but not all at once.\u201d He described the men in the car as \u201ctalking amongst themselves like back and forth mumbling and stuff like that, what was going to be going on. But I mean, I had a little inkling of what was kind of going to go on, they were going to handle something, but not for sure exactly what until we got there and everything went bad.\u201d Thornton was involved in this conversation \u201c[b]ut not really as much as [Crocker].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">Johnson testified that he might have heard about a handgun before they went to Crocker\u2019s trailer in Willits. Crocker got out of the car, went into his trailer and got back in with a duffel bag. Johnson was \u201cgetting a little suspicious here and there off of some things that were being said . . . .\u201d Johnson attributed his inability to remember some of the details of these events to being \u201ca little bit drunk\u201d that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-6\">When Johnson was asked why he changed his mind and agreed to drive to the campsite, he said he \u201cwas thinking on what they were going to be doing and my wife was out there I didn\u2019t want her to get hurt or whatnot.\u201d He changed his mind because of \u201c[t]heir actions, the way they were talking.\u201d The \u201cbits and pieces\u201d he was hearing included \u201ctalk about going out there and handling some business, coming up.\u201d To him \u201chandling some business\u201d meant \u201cthey want to go out there [and] take whatever they were getting that I set them up with.\u201d He admitted he understood that \u201cthey were going to go out and take the stuff [he] had bragged to them about that might be up there.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-7\">Even knowing this, Johnson agreed to drive the others because he \u201cwanted to go out and try to see if I could get my wife to leave with me. And I wasn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1263\">*1263</page-number>even sure if that\u2019s what they were insinuating that they were going to do is do that. I just \u2014 -I was getting bad vibes on the way going to get the car they were stopping talking to a few people on the way, and they kept on saying . . . we\u2019re going to be coming up on them.\u201d To Johnson, the phrase \u201ccoming up,\u201d meant \u201c[tjhey\u2019re going to come up with some money and weed\u201d when they went out to the campsite.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-5\">Although they had stopped by Crocker\u2019s trailer for a duffel bag, Johnson did not know until they were close to the lake that Crocker and Schnebly had weapons. He was worried when they were talking about \u201crobbing,\u201d and Crocker came out with some bags.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-6\">Johnson drove the car, Schnebly sat in the front passenger seat, Crocker sat behind Schnebly, and Thornton sat behind Johnson. In the car \u201c[njothing straight up came out. They were \u2014 they were just like saying that they\u2019re going to [go] ... out there and talk. Like I said, okay, I\u2019m going to try to get my wife. And that\u2019s pretty much all I was gathering.\u201d Again, Johnson blamed his faulty memory on being \u201ca little bit drunk\u201d that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-7\">Before they arrived at the campground, Johnson pulled off the road and stopped the car. Thornton got out and took the duffel bag out of the trunk. He handed it to Schnebly and then got back in the car. Schnebly unzipped the duffel bag and started piecing together a shotgun sitting right next to Johnson in the front seat. Johnson asked him what he was doing, but still continued driving. Johnson did not get out of the car and leave because he was \u201ckind of freaked out ... I don\u2019t mess with guns.\u201d This was the first time Johnson realized there was a shotgun inside the bag. At that point he knew \u201cwhat we\u2019re going to be doing,\u201d but he did not want any part of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-8\">Johnson continued to drive through the guard gate to the campground. He told the guard he was dropping off some supplies. A short way beyond that, he stopped the car again. Crocker and Schnebly put on bandanas. Crocker also unzipped his bag and put a magazine into his gun. Johnson saw people putting clips in guns and racking a round into the shotgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-9\">Crocker and Schnebly told him to drive up to the campsite. Johnson agreed but \u201cI was real hesitant on what I was wanting to do because I was just stunned.\u201d He described himself as being a little scared and a little anxious. But he knew \u201cexactly [what] was going on at that point.\u201d He knew they were going to use the guns and maybe commit a robbery. And he kept driving them into the campground.</p>\n<p id=\"b1081-10\">Johnson did not get out of the car and run, however, but instead took them to where his wife was. He drove into the campground at a normal speed and turned the car off when they arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1264\">*1264</page-number>Schnebly opened his door first, pulled out the shotgun, cocked it and said \u201c \u2018Everybody on the ground.\u2019 \u201d Crocker got out of his seat behind Schnebly and \u201cwith his handgun out ... he started pointing it at people as he was walking.\u201d Crocker told everyone to get on the ground as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-4\">Johnson \u201cgot out of the car and . . . was standing with one leg in, one leg out, and was holding the door ... I was yelling \u2018what the fuck? What the fuck?\u2019 \u201d He yelled out to Cano, \u201cget \u2014 get fucking over here and get in the fucking car.\u201d It was his intention to take Cano away as quickly as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-5\">At this point, Thornton was still in the car. He got out when \u201c[Schnebly] asked [him] to get out of the car and go help [Crocker] while [Crocker] was . . . getting jumped . . . .\u201d \u201cHaggett was hitting [Crocker] in the face with his fist. And Joe [Litteral] took off running with a log in his hand, going, \u2018Ahh,\u2019 like that, going toward them and then Joe started hitting [Crocker] and he hit him right across the bridge of his nose with a stick. . . . [\u00b6] And then [Schnebly] tells [Thornton] to get out of the car and go help [Crocker]. So [Thornton] got out of the car with the baseball bat, went over there and he starts swinging on Mr. Haggett and then Mr. Litteral got hit in the arm. . . . [\u00b6] . . . That\u2019s how the log got dropped . . . [Litteral] had the log in the arm that he was swinging with and when he got hit in the arm the log fell.\u201d Johnson recalled that the bat was a beat -up aluminum bat with a black piece on the handle.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1082-6\">In the meantime, Johnson was \u201cyelling a lot of shit out. . . . everything went so fast . . . .\u201d His main concern was with his wife. He testified he did not leave the car and get her, however. He knew she wouldn\u2019t go with him \u201cespecially after the gun got fired.\u201d The gun was fired after \u201c[Litteral] hit [Crocker] in the face with the log and [Crocker] went down and he was on his knee when he was pointing upward . . . .\u201d Johnson heard the gun go off two times. Haggett \u201cwas probably on one knee from getting hit with the baseball bat.\u201d Crocker got up and Johnson \u201cheard the gun go off ... as [Crocker] was running away from them.\u201d Johnson thought Crocker was going to fire the gun again, but Schnebly told him to stop. Johnson restarted the car and drove off with Thornton, Schnebly and Crocker.</p>\n<p id=\"b1082-7\">All the way back to Lake County, Crocker and Schnebly argued about where they were going to hide out. Johnson took them to Potter Valley and told them where to put the guns. Johnson thought Schnebly or Buck might \u201cwant to get rid of him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1265\">*1265</page-number>Schnebly and Crocker put the guns in the bushes and Thornton threw the bat \u201cdeep into the bushes on the driver\u2019s side of the car . . . .\u201d Johnson was dropped off in Ukiah. He told them \u201cYou guys are on your own. I\u2019m not hiding from nobody. I\u2019m going to walk right down the street. I didn\u2019t do nothing.\u201d He did not go to the sheriff because he was scared. He felt he had some responsibility for what happened because he drove the others to the campsite.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-5\">Johnson was arrested the next day. He testified that in his interviews with the police he began by minimizing his involvement altogether because he was worried about \u201csnitching\u201d and what would happen to him and his family. Ultimately, however, he claimed he told the police the truth about what happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-6\">Johnson testified he did not intend to aid Schnebly and Crocker in the robbery. He stated that he \u201cdidn\u2019t want nothing of whatever they were doing. I didn\u2019t want no money, I didn\u2019t want no weed. I was just wanting my wife. That it was it. ... [\u00b6] ... I just wanted my wife back safe. I didn\u2019t want her getting hurt.\u201d .</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-7\">Johnson also testified that while he was in jail he had an altercation with Thornton in which Thornton told him he was a \u201cfucking snitch\u201d and that he (Thornton) was going to \u201cfucking kill you.\u201d This was not the first time Thornton had threatened him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-8\">\n<em>Prosecution Rebuttal Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-9\">Deputy Steven Adams testified in the prosecution\u2019s rebuttal case that he heard Thornton yelling in the jail \u201cYou\u2019re a fucking snitch\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d As Thornton said this, he was pointing at Johnson\u2019s cell.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-10\">In the prosecution\u2019s rebuttal case, the medical program manager at the county jail testified that as of the date of Thornton\u2019s interview with the police in September 2011, Thornton was not taking any medications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-11\">\n<em>Verdicts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1083-12\">Defendants Johnson and Thornton were convicted of first degree murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7 187, subd. (a))<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and attempted murder (\u00a7\u00a7 187, subd. (a), 664). The jury also found true the firearm use allegations as to both charges. (\u00a7 12022, subd. (d).) The jury found both defendants not guilty of attempted kidnapping. Thornton had been charged with personally using a deadly and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1266\">*1266</page-number>dangerous weapon (\u201cto wit, bat\u201d) as an enhancement to each of the counts, pursuant to section 12022, subdivision (b)(1). These enhancements were found not true.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Johnson was sentenced to state prison for 25 years to life. Thornton was sentenced to state prison for 25 years to life, plus nine years.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-5\">A. <em>CALCRIM No. 335 </em>\u2014 Accomplices <em>as a Matter of Law (Johnson and Thornton)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1084-6\">Johnson and Thornton were charged with identical crimes. Each took the stand in his own defense and denied culpability, and each gave testimony that incriminated the other. Johnson proposed that the court instruct the jury pursuant to CALCRIM No. 335 regarding accomplice testimony.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Thornton did not object to the court giving this instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1084-7\">The court read the CALCRIM No. 335 instruction on accomplice testimony, modified to fit this case, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-8\">\u201cIf any of the crimes charged in this case were committed then Simon Thornton and Marvin Johnson were accomplices to that crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-9\">\u201cYou may not convict a defendant on any crime charged based on the statement or testimony of an accomplice alone. You may use the statement or testimony of an accomplice to convict the defendant only if, one, ... the accomplice\u2019s statement or testimony is supported by other evidence that you believe; two, that supporting evidence is independent of the accomplice\u2019s statement or testimony; and three, that supporting evidence tends to connect the defendant to the commission of the crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-10\">\u201cSupporting evidence, however, may be slight. It does not need to be enough by itself to prove the defendant is guilty of the charged crime, and it does not need to support every fact about which the witness testified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-11\">\u201cOn the other hand, it is not enough if the supporting evidence merely shows that a crime was committed or the circumstances of its commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1084-12\">\u201cThe supporting evidence must tend to connect the defendant to the commission of the crime. The evidence needed to support the statement or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1267\">*1267</page-number>testimony of one accomplice cannot be provided by the statement or testimony of another accomplice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1085-5\">\u201cAny statement or testimony of an accomplice that tends to incriminate the defendant should be viewed with caution. You may not, however, arbitrarily disregard it. You should give that statement or testimony the weight you think it deserves after examining it with care and caution and in light of all the other evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1085-6\">Thornton and Johnson now argue that the court erred in instructing the jury that they were accomplices as a matter of law.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> They also argue that the trial court erred in not clarifying that incriminating accomplice testimony is to be treated with suspicion, but testimony that a defendant gives in his own defense is to be judged with the ordinary rules for judging the credibility of witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-7\">As a preliminary matter, we first consider the Attorney General\u2019s argument that any error with regard to the accomplice jury instructions is forfeited because Johnson proposed CALCRIM No. 335, and Thornton did not object to it. This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-8\">Defendants may assert instructional error on appeal when it affects their substantial rights. (\u00a7 1259 [\u201cappellate court may . . . review any instruction given, refused or modified ... if the substantial rights of the defendant were affected thereby\u201d]; <em>People v. Coffman and Marlow </em>(2004) 34 Cal.4th 1, 103, fn. 34 [17 Cal.Rptr.3d 710, 96 P.3d 30] [permitting defendant to raise instructional error in accomplice instructions where defendant did not object to instruction at trial].) Further, our Supreme Court has written that \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s duty to fully and correctly instruct the jury on the basic principles of law relevant to the issues raised by the evidence in a criminal case is so important that it cannot be nullified by defense counsel\u2019s negligent or mistaken failure to object to an erroneous instruction or the failure to request an appropriate instruction. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Avalos </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 216, 229 [207 Cal.Rptr. 549, 689 P.2d 121].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1085-9\">The Attorney General also contends that because Johnson requested CALCRIM No. 335 by number and defendant Thornton did not object, any error in giving this instruction was invited. We disagree. \u201c \u2018When a defense attorney makes a \u201cconscious, deliberate tactical choice\u201d to [request or] forego a particular instruction, the invited error doctrine bars an argument on appeal that the instruction was [given or] omitted in error.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. McKinnon </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1268\">*1268</page-number>(2011) 52 Cal.4th 610, 675 [130 Cal.Rptr.3d 590, 259 P.3d 1186].) \u201cThe existence of some conceivable tactical purpose will not support a finding that defense counsel \u2018invited\u2019 an error in instructions. The record must reflect that counsel had a deliberate tactical purpose.\u201d <em>(.People v. Avalos, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d at p. 229.) \u201cEven where counsel has suggested an erroneous instruction, the doctrine of invited error is not invoked unless counsel articulated a tactical basis for the choice.\u201d <em>(People v. Wickersham </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 307, 332 [185 Cal.Rptr. 436, 650 P.2d 311], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Barton </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 186, 201 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 569, 906 P.2d 531].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-4\">The record does not reflect that either defense counsel ever expressed a tactical or deliberate reason for proposing, or in the case of Thornton\u2019s counsel, not objecting to, CALCRIM No. 335. The request from codefendant Johnson came in the form of a numeric list of jury instructions, with CALCRIM No. 335 identified solely by number. Thornton\u2019s counsel did not object. When the jury instructions were settled, there was no discussion as to whether CALCRIM No. 335 or another instruction on accomplice instructions (e.g., CALCRIM No. 334) was appropriate.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1086-5\">The Attorney General argues that when each defendant testified, each placed blame on the other, and that this was the \u201cobvious tactical reason[]\u201d for requesting the instruction. Johnson repeatedly linked Thornton to holding and using a baseball bat. Thornton also sought to cast blame on Johnson by telling the police that Johnson had swung the bat during the attempted robbery, and then later destroyed it. Further, the Attorney General points out that Thornton\u2019s counsel argued in closing that the only evidence that showed Thornton was guilty of the underlying robbery were \u201cwords that Mr. Johnson spoke. That\u2019s it.\u201d From this the Attorney General concludes that the \u201cthrust of appellant Thornton\u2019s case was essentially that the jury should view appellant Johnson\u2019s statements with \u2018care and caution.\u2019 \u201d This is insufficient to show the deliberate choice necessary to find that defendants invited error by allowing the court to instruct the jury with CALCRIM No. 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b1086-6\">Turning now to defendants\u2019 claim that the court erred in giving the accomplice as a matter of law instruction, our task is to determine \u201c \u2018whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1269\">*1269</page-number>there is a \u201creasonable likelihood\u201d that the jury misconstrued or misapplied the law in light of the instructions given, the entire record of trial, and the arguments of counsel.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Fiu </em>(2008) 165 Cal.App.4th 360, 370 [81 Cal.Rptr.3d 32].) As we will explain, we conclude the trial court did err in giving this instruction, although we also conclude that this error was not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-5\">The law is clear that \u201c[wjhether a person is an accomplice is a question of fact for the jury unless the facts and the inferences to be drawn therefrom are undisputed.\u201d <em>(People v. Coffman and Marlow, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th at p. 103; accord <em>People v. Whisenhunt </em>(2008) 44 Cal.4th 174, 214 [79 Cal.Rptr.3d 125, 186 P.3d 496].) The Bench Notes to CALCRIM No. 335 are in accordance with this statement of the law and, in no uncertain terms, advise that a trial court should: \u201cGive this instruction only if the court concludes that the witness is an accomplice as a matter of law or the parties agree about the witness\u2019s status as an accomplice. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Verlinde </em>(2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 1146, 1161 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 322] [only give instruction \u201c \u2018if undisputed evidence established the complicity\u2019 \u201d], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People v. Cook </em>(2015) 60 Cal.4th 922, 939 [183 Cal.Rptr.3d 502, 342 P.3d 404].) If there is a dispute about whether the witness is an accomplice, give CALCRIM No. 334, Accomplice Testimony Must Be Corroborated: Dispute Whether Witness Is Accomplice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-6\">Moreover, the CALCRIM No. 335 Bench Notes caution that \u201cWhen the witness is a codefendant whose testimony includes incriminating statements, the court should not instruct that the witness is an accomplice as a matter of law. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hill </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 536, 555 [58 Cal.Rptr. 340, 426 P.2d 908].) Instead the court should give CALCRIM No. 334, <em>Accomplice Testimony Must Be Corroborated: Dispute Whether Witness Is Accomplice, </em>informing the jury that it must decide whether the testifying codefendant is an accomplice. In addition, the court should instruct that when the jury considers this testimony as it relates to the testifying codefendant\u2019s defense, the jury should evaluate the testimony using the general rules of credibility, but if the jury considers testimony as incriminating evidence against the non-testifying codefendant, the testimony must be corroborated and should be viewed with caution. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Coffman and Marlow[, supra,] </em>34 Cal.4th [at p.] 105 .. . .)\u201d (Original boldface.) The substance of this portion of the CALCRIM No. 335 Bench Notes is repeated in the CALCRIM No. 334 Bench Notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1087-7\">The Attorney General contends that the Bench Notes and the CALCRIM jury instructions are not themselves legal authority. This is true, as far as it goes. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Morales </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 34, 48, fn. 7 [104 Cal.Rptr.2d 582, 18 P.3d 11] [\u201cjury instructions, whether published or not, are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1270\">*1270</page-number>not themselves the law, and are not authority to establish legal propositions or precedent. They should not be cited as authority for legal principles in appellate opinions. At most, when they are accurate, . . . they restate the law.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-4\">The Attorney General also contends the case authority cited in the CALCRIM No. 335 Bench Notes does not support the proposition that, when a witness is a codefendant whose testimony includes incriminating statements, the court should not instruct that the witness is an accomplice as a matter of law. The Attorney General is referring to <em>People v. Hill, supra, </em>66 Cal.2d 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-5\">In <em>People v. Hill, </em>three codefendants were tried together, but only one (Madorid) testified at trial. Madorid\u2019s testimony constituted a \u201cjudicial confession\u201d as to him and, \u201cstanding alone, implicated [the other codefendants] sufficiently to support their convictions if properly presented to the jury.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hill, supra, </em>66 Cal.2d at p. 555.) The trial court instructed the jury that \u201cif it found the crimes charged to have been committed, \u2018and if you further find that defendant Madorid was an accomplice . . . , then as against codefendants ... his testimony must be corroborated.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>On appeal, the non-testifying defendants claimed that the trial judge erred in \u201cinstructing the jury in a manner which permitted it to conclude that Madorid was not an accomplice, and thus avoid the necessity of finding corroboration, when it appears and the jury should have been so advised that Madorid was an accomplice as a matter of law\u201d since he was charged with the identical crimes, and all of the evidence placed Madorid with the other defendants at the commission of the crime. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The Supreme Court rejected this argument, holding that \u201cwhere a codefendant has made a judicial confession as to crimes charged, an instruction that as a matter of law such codefendant is an accomplice of other defendants might well be construed by the jurors as imputing the confessing defendant\u2019s foregone guilt to the other defendants.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The Attorney General argues that <em>People v. Hill </em>thus does not apply to this case because neither defendant here made a judicial confession.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1088-6\">The facts of <em>People v. Hill </em>are different from the present case, as the testifying codefendant in <em>Hill </em>confessed to the crimes, and the codefendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1271\">*1271</page-number>argued on appeal that the trial court should have given the accomplice as a matter of law instruction. Here, both defendants denied guilt, and they now argue that giving the accomplice as a matter of law instruction was error. Nevertheless, the significance of <em>Hill </em>is the court\u2019s recognition that that jurors \u201cmight well. . . construe[]\u201d an accomplice as a matter of law instruction in a way that could adversely affect a codefendant. <em>(People v. Hill, supra, </em>66 Cal.2d at p. 555.) By choosing not to instruct the jury that the codefendants were accomplices as a matter of law, the trial court \u201cavoid[ed] imputations of the guilt of [the codefendants] which might have flowed from the court\u2019s direction that the confessing [codefendant] was their accomplice as a matter of law.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 556.) While neither of the defendants in the present case confessed, both were charged as aiders and abettors of crimes perpetrated by other individuals. Since the evidence clearly showed crimes committed by those other individuals, the instruction effectively imputed guilt to defendants in a similar manner to that cautioned against in <em>Hill.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1089-5\">As we have said, whether a person is an accomplice is ordinarily a question of <em>fact </em>for the jury. Here, each defendant testified, and each denied that he was guilty of the crimes charged. Put another way, there is no contention that undisputed evidence established that defendants were accomplices. <em>(People v. Coffman and Marlow, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th at p. 103.) It was thus error to describe either defendant as an \u201caccomplice as a matter of law.\u201d <em>(People v. Hill, supra, </em>66 Cal.2d at p. 556.) The evidence simply did not support giving CALCRIM No. 335. The trial court should have used CALCRIM No. 334, which would have left to the jury the factual determination as to whether a witness was an accomplice, and instructed at length as to how the jury was to make that determination.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1089-6\">This error was not prejudicial, however, because it is not reasonably probable that a properly instructed jury would have found either Johnson or Thornton was not an accomplice. CALCRIM No. 334 instructs: \u201cA person is an <em>accomplice </em>if he or she is subject to prosecution for the identical crime charged against the defendant. Someone is subject to prosecution if: [\u00b6] 1. He or she personally committed the crime; [\u00b6] OR [\u00b6] 2. He or she knew of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1272\">*1272</page-number>criminal purpose of the person who committed the crime; [\u00b6] AND [\u00b6] 3. He or she intended to, and did in fact, (aid, facilitate, promote, encourage, or instigate the commission of the crime[;]/[or] participate in a criminal conspiracy to commit the crime.)\u201d These requirements are essentially the same as those necessary to find a person aided and abetted commission of a crime. (CALCRIM No. 401.)<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1090-4\">Putting aside the testimony of either defendant against the other, there was overwhelming evidence that both Johnson and Thornton were aware Schnebly and Crocker intended to perpetrate an attempted robbery, and that defendants intended to and did in fact facilitate the attempted robbery by driving them to the campsite (in Johnson\u2019s case) and at the very least standing guard while the robbery occurred (in Johnson and Thornton\u2019s case).</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-5\">Johnson admitted to the police that he told Schnebly there was \u201cweed and cash\u201d at the campground, that on the morning of the shootings he knew they were \u201cgoing out there to rob these mother fuckers\u201d and \u201chandle some shit,\u201d that while driving to the campsite he knew the others intended to \u201crob some people\u201d and that he saw Schnebly\u2019s and Crocker\u2019s guns before they arrived at the campsite. Johnson testified that Schnebly pieced the shotgun together while sitting next to him in the front seat. Johnson continued driving and never attempted to part ways with the group. He told the guard at the campground that they were there to drop off supplies and continued driving to the campsite even after a stop during which Schnebly and Crocker put on bandanas, put a clip in the gun and racked a round into the shotgun. Additionally, prior to the shootings, while Cano was at the motel with Haggett and Litteral, Johnson had threatened to kill Haggett.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-6\">After the shootings, Thornton told Kumpula that he had gone to the campground with Schnebly and Crocker \u201c[o]ver some money and a woman,\u201d and \u201cto beat some people up,\u201d as well as that \u201cpeople at the lake owed him money.\u201d He told his fianc\u00e9 that he and Schnebly had lied to Kumpula about why they were borrowing his car: \u201cWe did it to protect him because if he knew what was really going on, it could be bad for him. And it wasn\u2019t planned to go the way it went.\u201d Thornton told his fianc\u00e9 to tell Kumpula to \u201ckeep it under wraps,\u201d that a \u201cgood soldier\u201d \u201cfollows orders\u201d and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>Thornton \u201cwas looking at the bigger picture. I was looking at making our life more comfortable. All of ours.\u201d He told his mother\u2019s boyfriend that the guns needed to be disposed of and where to find them. And Haggett identified Thornton as the person who had attacked him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-5\">In light of this evidence, defendants\u2019 testimony that they did not intend to facilitate the robbery was simply not credible. Apart from the dissonance between the claimed lack of intent and the obvious inferences arising from the above evidence, Thornton\u2019s testimony was replete with inconsistencies, and his attempt to explain away certain of his statements to the police as products of the medication he was taking at the time was contradicted by the county jail medical program manager\u2019s testimony that Thornton was not taking any medication at the time of the police interview. Johnson\u2019s argument that the evidence of the \u201cstate of his intoxication\u201d made his version of events more credible is meritless. As we discuss more fully in part C., <em>post, </em>there was no evidence that Johnson\u2019s ingestion of alcohol and drugs on the day of the murder affected his ability to understand that Crocker intended to commit robbery or kidnapping or his ability to form an intent to aid and abet Crocker in committing the intended offenses. Johnson made no claim that his intoxication rose to that level; he only blamed his alleged inability to clearly recall <em>at trial </em>certain conversations that occurred the day of the murder on the fact that he was \u201cjust a little bit drunk, little bit\u201d or \u201cbuzzed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-6\">In sum, we find no reasonable probability that the jury would have found defendants were not accomplices if it had been instructed pursuant to CALCRIM No. 334 rather than CALCRIM No. 335. <em>(People v. Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wilkins </em>(2013) 56 Cal.4th 333, 351 [153 Cal.Rptr.3d 519, 295 P.3d 903].) Once the factual question was resolved against defendants, CALCRIM No. 334 would have directed the jury to analyze defendants\u2019 testimony in exactly the same manner as did CALCRIM No. 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-7\">Defendants argue that CALCRIM No. 335 undermined their defenses by directing the jury to view their testimony with caution, and as requiring independent corroboration, without clarifying that this applied only to incriminating testimony given by each defendant against the other and not to exculpatory testimony by either defendant in support of his own defense. They rely on <em>People v. Coffman and Marlow, </em>to claim the trial court erred in failing to explicitly instruct that the jury should apply the normal rules relating to witness credibility in analyzing testimony supporting the testifying defendant. But that case does not so hold. In <em>Coffman and Marlow, </em>the jury was instructed on accomplice testimony given by codefendants, with the trial court drawing a distinction between types of testimony; \u201c \u2018You are to apply the general rules of credibility when weighing [defendant] Coffman\u2019s testimony in her own defense. [\u00b6] But if you find her to be an accomplice, then in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1274\">*1274</page-number>weighing her testimony against [defendant] Marlow you ought to view it with distrust. [\u00b6] This does not mean that you may arbitrarily disregard such testimony. [\u00b6] But give to it the weight to which you find it to be entitled after examining it with care and caution and in the light of all the evidence in the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Coffman and Marlow, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th at p. 104.) The trial court then repeated the same instruction, substituting the name of the other testifying defendant. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1092-4\">On appeal, the defendants in <em>Coffman and Marlow </em>challenged the distinction the trial court had drawn between \u201cdefensive and offensive testimony,\u201d and contended that the instruction was virtually impossible for the jurors to follow in that it required them to \u201cperform the \u2018impossible mental gymnastic\u2019 of simultaneously distrusting (when offered against [defendant] Marlow) and not distrusting (when offered in her own behalf).\u201d <em>(People v. Coffman and Marlow, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th at pp. 103-104.) The Supreme Court in <em>Coffman and Marlow </em>disagreed. \u201cBecause the evidence abundantly supported an inference that each defendant acted as an accomplice to the other, and because each testified and, to some extent, sought to blame the other for the offenses, the court was required to instruct the jury that an accomplice-defendant\u2019s testimony should be viewed with distrust to the extent it tended to incriminate the codefendant.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 104-105.) The Supreme Court found that there was \u201cno reason to believe this relatively straightforward task was beyond the jury\u2019s capabilities,\u201d and that it did not undermine the presumption of innocence or due process. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 105.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-5\">Although the Supreme Court approved the instruction that was given in <em>Coffman and Marlow, </em>which explicitly addressed how the jury should treat an accomplice\u2019s testimony in his or her own behalf, it did not require this instruction. In fact, the court referred to <em>People v. Guiuan </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 558, 569 [76 Cal.Rptr.2d 239, 957 P.2d 928], in which it had directed that the standard accomplice testimony instruction should refer only to testimony \u201cthat tends to incriminate the defendant\u201d and instruct the jury to view an accomplice\u2019s testimony with \u201ccaution\u201d rather than with \u201cdistrust.\u201d (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Coffman and Marlow, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th at pp. 104-105.) In <em>Guiuan, </em>the court explained that \u201c[t]he word \u2018caution,\u2019 connoting \u2018care and watchfulness,\u2019 signals the need for the jury to pay special heed to <em>incriminating </em>testimony because it may be biased, but avoids the suggestion that <em>all </em>of the accomplice\u2019s testimony, including favorable testimony, is untrustworthy.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Guiuan, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 569, fn. 4.) Because the accomplice testimony instructions expressly single out \u201cincriminating\u201d testimony to be viewed with care and caution, they do not suggest the jury must apply this standard to <em>all </em>testimony given by an accomplice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-6\">We discern a potential for prejudice of the nature defendants suggest only if testimony by one of the defendants was at once incriminating as to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1275\">*1275</page-number>other defendant (and so to be viewed with caution and as requiring corroboration) and self-exculpatory (and so to be viewed according to the usual standards). This might have been true of the testimony regarding the assault with the bat, which Johnson attributed to Thornton and Thornton attributed to Johnson. Since each blamed the other, and only one such assault occurred, the same testimony that tended to incriminate the other defendant also tended to exonerate the testifying defendant. But, since the jury found the charges related to use of the bat as a weapon not true, neither defendant was prejudiced in this regard. The essence of each defendant\u2019s defense was that he did not intend to facilitate an attempted robbery or kidnapping, Johnson because he had independent motives for going to the campground and Thornton because he was unaware of the direct perpetrators\u2019 intent. As there was nothing in either defendant\u2019s defense of \u201cI did not intend to do this\u201d that could be viewed as incriminating the other defendant, nothing in CALCRIM No. 335 directed the jury to view this testimony under anything other than the usual rules for evaluating a witness\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-5\">Nothing in the record suggests that the jury in the case before us would have understood CALCRIM No. 335 to direct that they could not apply the usual rules of credibility as to each defendant. That special scrutiny was to be applied only to testimony one defendant gave against the other and was further directed by CALCRIM No. 301, which instructed the jurors that a single witness\u2019s testimony was sufficient to establish any fact <em>except </em>that neither defendant could be convicted solely on the testimony of the other.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u201cJurors are presumed able to understand and correlate instructions and are further presumed to have followed the court\u2019s instructions.\u201d <em>(People v. Sanchez </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 834, 852 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 129, 29 P.3d 209].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-6\">Defendants also contend that CALCRIM No. 335 amounted to an unconstitutional mandatory presumption that they aided and abetted the charged offenses \u2014 that is, that they were guilty as charged. As we have said, since CALCRIM No. 335, unlike CALCRIM No. 334, does not define the term \u201caccomplice,\u201d and no other instruction defined it, the jury was left on its own to determine the meaning of this term. The jury w\u00e1s given the standard instruction that \u201cwords and phrases not specifically defined in these instructions are to be applied using their ordinary and everyday meanings\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>(CALCRIM No. 200), and ordinary dictionaries essentially treat \u201caccomplice\u201d and \u201cabettor\u201d as synonyms.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> According to defendants, the jurors would have understood CALCRIM No. 335\u2019s statement that if a crime was committed, defendants were accomplices as a matter of law, as establishing that defendants were aiders and abettors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-4\">We disagree. A similar argument was made and rejected in <em>People v. Hardy </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 86, 151-152 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 796, 825 P.2d 781], There, the jury was instructed that a number of witnesses were accomplices as a matter of law to the extent that crimes alleged in an information \u2014 including murder \u2014 were committed. The defendants in <em>Hardy </em>argued the witnesses were clearly accomplices and, therefore, the jury was improperly allowed to conclude that a conspiracy did, in fact, exist. The court disagreed, holding that \u201cno reasonable juror would have so interpreted the instruction in light of the other instructions,\u201d including an instruction that the jury was required to determine as to each defendant individually whether he was a member of a conspiracy. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 151.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-5\">The same is true here. The jury was instructed on guilt as an aider and abettor and the elements of aiding and abetting. The jury was instructed that it had to consider the evidence separately as to each defendant, and \u201cdecide whether defendants on trial here committed the crimes charged.\u201d The jury was told that each count was a separate crime, and each was to be considered separately. Finally, the jury was repeatedly instructed on the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and told that defendants were presumed innocent. The burden of proof was repeated in closing arguments by the prosecution and by defense counsel, and the prosecution referred to the presumption of innocence. If the jurors had understood CALCRIM No. 335 as stating that the defendants were aiders and abettors as a matter of law, all these instructions and arguments would have appeared to be irrelevant. Indeed, the entire trial would have appeared to be irrelevant, since aiding and abetting was the only theory of guilt. The term \u201caccomplice\u201d appeared solely in the instruction informing the jury how to view testimony given by \u201can accomplice\u201d against \u201cthe defendant.\u201d A reasonable juror would have understood CALCRIM No. 335 as directing that neither defendant could be convicted solely upon the testimony of his codefendant without independent supporting evidence, and that the testimony of each defendant against the other should be viewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1277\">*1277</page-number>with \u201ccare and caution\u201d \u2014 not that the entire trial was without purpose because the court\u2019s instruction on how to view an accomplice\u2019s testimony was really a direction to find defendants guilty of aiding and abetting the charged offenses. \u201cWe credit jurors with intelligence and common sense [citation] and do not assume that these virtues will abandon them when presented with a court\u2019s instructions. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Coddington </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 529, 594 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 528, 2 P.3d 1081], overruled on other grounds in <em>Price v. Superior Court </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 1046 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 409, 25 P.3d 618].) \u201c[N]o reasonable juror would have interpreted [CALCRIM No. 335] in the manner now argued by defendants.\u201d <em>(People v. Hardy, supra, </em>2 Cal.4th at p. 151.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">B. <em>CALCRIM No. 548 (Johnson and Thornton)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1095-6\">The trial court instructed the jury that \u201c[t]he defendants have been prosecuted for murder under two theories: (1) aiding and abetting another who acted with malice aforethought; and (2) felony murder. [\u00b6] Each theory of murder has different requirements, and I will instruct you on both. [\u00b6] You may not find a defendant guilty of murder unless all of you agree that the People have proved that the defendant committed murder under at least one of these theories. You do not all need to agree on the same theory.\u201d This jury instruction was based on CALCRIM No. 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-7\">Defendants argue that the court erred in giving this instruction. They contend that when the jurors were told that they need not \u201call agree on the same theory\u201d they were misled into thinking that they need not all agree on whether defendants were guilty of first or second degree murder in reaching a verdict of murder, which is contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-8\">In making this argument, defendants rely on <em>People </em>v. <em>Sanchez </em>(2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 1012 [164 Cal.Rptr.3d 880] <em>(Sanchez). </em>In <em>Sanchez, </em>the victim was shot and killed in a dispute over drugs and money. Sanchez was not alleged to be the perpetrator. Instead, he was charged with murder on two distinct theories of aiding and abetting. One scenario was first degree felony murder, if he aided and abetted a kidnapping that resulted in the death of the victim. The other scenario was second degree murder, if the murder was the natural and probable consequence of an assault or kidnapping. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1014.) At the request of the prosecution, the jury was instructed on these two theories of murder. During jury deliberation, the jurors asked a question about the definition of second degree murder. In part of its response to the question, the jurors were instructed pursuant to CALCRIM No. 548: \u201c \u2018You may not find the defendant guilty of murder unless all of you agree that the People have proved that the defendant committed murder under at least one of these theories. You do not all need to agree on the same theory.\u2019 \u201d (221 Cal.App.4th at p. 1019, italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1278\">*1278</page-number>In <em>Sanchez, </em>the majority held that because the prosecutor put forward theories that supported both degrees of murder, an instruction that the jurors did \u201cnot all need to agree on the same theory\u201d was error because it misled the jury into thinking it need not reach a unanimous conclusion as to the degree of murder for which the defendant was liable. <em>(Sanchez, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.4th at p. 1019.) The <em>Sanchez </em>court wrote: \u201cDefendant contends the trial court\u2019s instruction expressly negating the need for juror unanimity as to the theory of guilt was error. Defendant reasons the prosecution\u2019s two theories of murder supported different degrees of murder, and juror unanimity was therefore required as to the theory of guilt. If the jury followed the instruction, defendant argues that all the jurors may have agreed defendant committed murder, but it cannot be determined whether the jurors unanimously agreed defendant committed first degree murder. This is correct.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cThe final instruction the jury received on unanimity was that it need not agree on the theory of guilt, even though presented with alternate theories of liability which led to different results as to the degree of murder. Unanimity was required in this case as to the theory of guilt as a result of different theories supporting different <em>degrees </em>of murder.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1025.)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1096-4\">In reaching its conclusion that there was prejudicial error, the court in <em>Sanchez </em>considered all of the pertinent instructions that the trial court had given. These included the trial court\u2019s instruction after closing arguments \u201cwith respect to the deliberations and the verdict forms\u201d pursuant to CALCRIM No. 640. <em>(Sanchez, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.4th at p. 1022 &amp; fn. 9.) The <em>Sanchez </em>jury was told specifically that \u201c \u2018[a]s with all of the charges in this case, to return a verdict of guilty or not guilty <em>on </em>a count, you must all agree on that decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1022, fn. 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">Where a defendant is charged with first degree murder, the jurors are not required to agree on \u201cone or more of several theories proposed by the prosecution; it is sufficient that each juror is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of first degree murder as that offense is defined by the statute.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Milan </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 185, 195 [107 Cal.Rptr. 68, 507 P.2d 956].) However, the law is also clear that the jury must unanimously determine whether murder is in the first or second degree. <em>(People v. Jones </em>(2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 373, 376 [178 Cal.Rptr.3d 636].) Section 1157 states in part that \u201c[w]henever a defendant is convicted of a crime . . . which is distinguished into degrees, the jury, or the court if a jury trial is waived, must find the degree of the crime ... of which he is guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1279\">*1279</page-number>The Attorney General does not dispute these general legal propositions, or that the jury was presented with one theory of first degree murder, namely, first degree felony murder, and one theory of second degree murder, namely, malice murder.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Instead, the Attorney General contends that this case is distinguishable from <em>Sanchez </em>because in the circumstances of this particular case it is not reasonably likely the jury misunderstood the trial court\u2019s instructions.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1280\">*1280</page-number>The Attorney General first attempts to distinguish <em>Sanchez </em>on the ground that the jury in <em>Sanchez </em>was presented with a single theory upon which to base a first degree murder verdict, but here the jury could have found first degree felony murder based on attempted kidnapping or attempted murder. The Attorney General argues that because there were, in fact, two bases for felony murder, instructing the jury with CALCRIM No. 548 that it need not agree on which one of the two is applicable made giving this instruction appropriate. Whether there were one or two theories of felony murder is a distinction without a difference. The flaw in giving CALCRIM No. 548 was that it suggested to the jury that it need not agree on the <em>degree </em>of murder. The fact that the jury was not in fact required to agree on a <em>theory </em>of first degree felony murder is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-4\">The Attorney General also argues that because the prosecutor did not \u201cmention\u201d second degree murder as an \u201coption\u201d in his closing argument, CALCRIM No. 548 was not problematic, since it was inapplicable to the jury\u2019s deliberations. We do not find this argument persuasive. The jury was given a verdict form for second degree murder and it was instructed on the law as it pertained to second degree murder. The prosecutor told the jury in closing argument that murder starts out as second degree murder and discussed implied malice, which pertains to second degree murder and not to felony murder. The instruction, therefore, was relevant to the jury\u2019s deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-5\">The Attorney General points out that the version of CALCRIM No. 520 given to the jury in this case (see fn. 22, <em>post) </em>differed from the version before the <em>Sanchez </em>jury. <em>(Sanchez, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1023-1024.) Here, the jury was told that \u201cIf you find the defendant guilty of murder, it is murder of the second degree.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The Attorney General sees this instruction as having expressly advised the jury that if it found appellants committed murder, it had to find second degree murder unless the prosecution proved first degree murder. But even assuming the jury shared this understanding, it is difficult to see how this instruction cured the error in giving CALCRIM No. 548, which essentially told the jury it need not reach a unanimous decision as to the degree of murder. The Attorney General also attempts to distinguish <em>Sanchez </em>because the jury there inquired about the definition of second degree murder, indicating that they were confused on the issue. However, the Attorney General cites no requirement that a jury inquiry need be made before a jury instruction can be found to have been given in error. Finally, the Attorney General notes that in <em>Sanchez </em>the trial court made an additional error not present here by misinstructing the jury on malice. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1281\">*1281</page-number>additional error in <em>Sanchez </em>does not take away from the fact that CALCRIM No. 548 was an erroneous statement of the law as applied to that case and to the present case.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1099-5\">We now turn to the question of remedy. In <em>Sanchez, </em>the court set forth the applicable standard: \u201c \u2018When the jury is \u201cmisinstructed on an element of the offense . . . reversal... is required unless we are able to conclude that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.] Our Supreme Court has explained that instructional error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in situations in which both proper and improper theories of guilt are presented to the jury, if other aspects of the verdict or the evidence leave no reasonable doubt that the jury made the finding necessary for malice. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Chun </em>(2009) 45 Cal.4th 1172, 1204-1205 [91 Cal.Rptr.3d 106, 203 P.3d 425] . . . .)\u201d <em>(Sanchez, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1026-1027.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-6\">The <em>Sanchez </em>court found that there were no \u201c \u2018other aspects of the verdict or the evidence\u2019 \u201d in that case to \u201cindicate the jurors unanimously found defendant committed first degree felony murder.\u201d <em>(Sanchez, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.4th at p. 1027.) It concluded that \u201c[t]he instruction advising the jury that unanimity was not required as to the theory of guilt was therefore prejudicial error as to the finding of first degree murder.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>However, because the error affected only the <em>degree </em>of murder, it held that the \u201cproper remedy is to reverse the conviction of first degree murder and remand the cause to the trial court with directions to allow the prosecution to either retry the case or accept a reduction of the offense to second degree murder.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1099-7\">The parties argue this remedy should not be employed here, the Attorney General maintaining that any error was harmless and defendants arguing that their first degree murder convictions must be reversed without conditions. Having reconsidered our analysis of this question in light of <em>Banks, supra, </em>61 Cal.4th 788, we disagree with defendants\u2019 position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-8\">As in <em>Sanchez, </em>in the present case there are \u201cno \u2018other aspects of the verdict or the evidence\u2019 in this case to indicate the jurors unanimously found [Johnson and Thornton each] committed first degree felony murder,\u201d the error was prejudicial as to the finding of first degree murder. <em>(Sanchez, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.4th at p. 1027.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-9\">Also as in <em>Sanchez, </em>this error in the present case only affected the question of degree of the murder. The court in <em>Sanchez </em>concluded that conditional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1282\">*1282</page-number>reversal was appropriate because \u201c[a]ssuming some jurors relied on felony murder and others on the natural and probable consequences doctrine, we hold that all 12 jurors found the elements of malice aforethought necessary for second degree murder.\u201d <em>(Sanchez, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.4th at p. 1027.) First, the court found that any jurors who voted guilty based on the felony murder theory necessarily found malice. The court reasoned that \u201c[a] verdict based on murder during the course of a kidnapping . . . was a murder committed with malice, which supports a minimum finding of second degree murder\u201d because simple kidnapping \u201c \u2018has . . . been held to be a felony inherently dangerous to human life which may support a conviction of second degree felony murder . . . [citation],\u2019 \u201d and the felony-murder rule \u201c \u2018 \u201cimputes the requisite malice for a murder conviction to those who commit a homicide during the perpetration of a felony inherently dangerous to human life.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 <em>(Chun, supra, </em>45 Cal.4th at p. 1184.)\u201d <em>{Sanchez, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.4th at p. 1028.) With respect to the natural and probable consequences theory, since the trial court had instructed that second degree murder required either express or implied malice, \u201cany juror who may have voted for guilt under the natural and probable consequences theory also found malice.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>On the facts of <em>Sanchez, </em>\u201c[g]iven the nature of the killing \u2014 an apparent execution related to a large drug trafficking organization- \u2014 the existence of malice sufficient for second degree murder on the part of the actual killer cannot be disputed.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1026.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">Johnson takes issue with <em>Sanchez, </em>as we understand his argument, for equating the imputed malice underlying a felony-murder verdict with a factual finding of implied malice. Absent reliance on the felony-murder doctrine, implied malice is demonstrated where the defendant performs \u201c \u2018 \u201can act, the natural consequences of which are dangerous to life\u201d \u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018 \u201cknows that his conduct endangers the life of another and . . . acts with a conscious disregard for life.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Chun, supra, </em>45 Cal.4th at p. 1181 <em>(Chun), </em>quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Patterson </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 615, 626 [262 Cal.Rptr. 195, 778 P.2d 549].) <em>Sanchez, </em>Johnson argues, ignores the fact that a juror finding guilt based on felony murder did not have to consider whether the facts showed the defendant acted with conscious disregard for life. While the facts in <em>Sanchez </em>might support a conclusion that any juror who found felony murder based on the kidnapping in that case necessarily believed the defendant acted with conscious disregard for human life, Johnson maintains this cannot be said here because there was evidence that he had independent motives in going to the campground and did not act with such conscious disregard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-5\">Johnson is incorrect in stating that the jury was required to find that he acted with conscious disregard for human life in order to convict him of implied malice murder. Johnson was convicted as an aider and abettor of the murder and attempted murder committed directly by Crocker and Schnebly. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1283\">*1283</page-number>While \u201c[t]he actual perpetrator must have whatever mental state is required for each crime charged,\u201d the requirement for an aider and abettor is to \u201c \u2018act with knowledge of the criminal purpose of the perpetrator and with an intent or purpose either of committing, or of encouraging or facilitating commission of, the offense.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Beeman </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 547, 560 [199 Cal.Rptr. 60, 674 P.2d 1318].)\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mendoza </em>(1998) 18 Cal.4th 1114, 1123 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 428, 959 P.2d 735] <em>(Mendoza), </em>italics omitted.) \u201c \u2018[A] defendant whose liability is predicated on his status as an aider and abettor need not have intended to encourage or facilitate the particular offense ultimately committed by the perpetrator.

But the trier of fact must also find that (4) the defendant\u2019s confederate committed an offense <em>other than </em>the target crime; and (5) the offense committed by the confederate was a natural and probable consequence of the target crime that the defendant aided and abetted.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Prettyman, supra, </em>14 Cal.4th at p. 262, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-6\">Here, to convict under the implied malice theory, the jury would have had to find that defendants knew Crocker and Schnebly intended to commit an attempted robbery or attempted kidnapping; that defendants intended to encourage or facilitate the target offense and in fact aided, promoted or encouraged commission of that offense; and that Crocker and/or Schnebly committed a murder and attempted murder that were a natural and probable consequence of the target offense.

We disagree with their analysis of <em>Banks. </em>First, contrary to defendants\u2019 understanding, the mental state at issue in <em>Banks </em>is not \u201cvirtually identical\u201d to the one at issue here. Second, defendants\u2019 analysis ignores the distinction, for purposes of criminal liability, between the mental state required for an aider and abettor as opposed to the direct perpetrator of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-4\"><em>Banks </em>addressed the circumstances required for an accomplice who lacks intent to kill to be statutorily eligible for the death penalty (or life imprisonment without parole), holding that these penalties may be imposed upon felony murderers who did not personally kill \u201conly when their involvement is substantial and they demonstrate a reckless indifference to the grave risk of death created by their actions.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>(Banks, supra, </em>61 Cal.4th at p. 794.) To be eligible for the death penalty, the defendant must be a \u201c \u2018major participant\u2019 \u201d <em>{Banks, </em>at p. 798, quoting \u00a7 190.2, subd.

There was no evidence that Matthews played a role in planning the robbery or obtaining weapons, or that he or the other participants had previously committed murder, attempted murder or another violent crime; he was not at the scene; and there was no evidence he saw or heard the shooting, had a role in instigating it or could have prevented it. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 805.) In these circumstances, Matthews\u2019s conduct did not amount to major participation in the offense; he was \u201cno more than a getaway driver.\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>With regard to his mental state, although there was evidence he knew he was participating in an armed robbery, \u201cnothing at trial supported the conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that Matthews knew his own actions would involve a grave risk of death.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 807.) Consequently, although guilty of felony murder as an accomplice to the robbery, he was not eligible for the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1285\">*1285</page-number>Defendants argue that the mental state discussed in <em>Banks, </em>\u201creckless indifference to human life,\u201d is \u201cvirtually identical\u201d to the one at issue in the present case, \u201cconscious disregard for human life.\u201d According to <em>Banks, </em>one acts with \u201c \u2018reckless indifference to human life\u2019 \u201d when one \u201c \u2018 \u201cknowingly engag[es] in criminal activities known to carry a <em>grave risk of death\u201d </em>\u2019 \u201d and is \u201caware of and willingly involved in the violent manner in which the particular offense is committed, demonstrating reckless indifference to the <em>significant risk of death </em>his or her actions create.\u201d <em>(Banks, supra, </em>61 Cal.4th at pp. 800-801, italics added.) Conscious disregard for human life, the mental state required for implied malice, \u201crequires a defendant\u2019s awareness of engaging in conduct that <em>endangers the life of another </em>\u2014 no more, and no less.\u201d <em>(People v. Knoller </em>(2007) 41 Cal.4th 139, 143 [59 Cal.Rptr.3d 157, 158 P.3d 731], italics added.) Implied malice does <em>not </em>require \u201ca defendant\u2019s awareness that his or her conduct had a <em>high probability </em>of resulting in death.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>If implied malice does not require a defendant\u2019s subjective awareness that his or her conduct has a high probability of resulting in death, but only an awareness that it endangers life, it surely does not require a subjective awareness that the conduct poses a \u201cgrave\u201d risk of death. Thus, consistent with the principle that only the most culpable may be subjected to the death penalty <em>(Banks, supra, </em>61 Cal.4th at p. 797), the \u201creckless indifference to life\u201d necessary for death penalty eligibility requires subjective awareness of a higher degree of risk than the \u201cconscious disregard for human life\u201d required for conviction of second degree murder based on implied malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-5\">In emphasizing the <em>Banks </em>court\u2019s focus on the requirement that an aider and abettor of murder have a subjective awareness of the grave risk of death posed by his conduct, defendants in the present case ignore the fact that <em>Banks </em>was concerned not with criminal liability but with the state of mind necessary to render the aider and abettor eligible for the death penalty or life imprisonment without parole. The critical point in <em>Banks </em>was that eligibility for these extreme punishments required something more than criminal liability under the felony murder rule \u2014 a measure of <em>personal </em>responsibility demanded for sentencing.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The <em>Banks </em>court did not address the mental state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1286\">*1286</page-number>required for implied malice murder and nothing in its analysis suggests any change to the proof necessary to <em>convict </em>an aider and abettor of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-4\">Here, as in <em>Sanchez, </em>any jurors who found defendants guilty under the natural and probable consequences theory necessarily found malice; The instructions on second degree murder, the only theory presented other than felony murder, required a finding of either express or implied malice. The critical question is whether jurors who found defendants guilty of felony murder necessarily found the facts required for a conviction of second degree implied malice murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-5\"><em>Sanchez </em>concluded that all 12 jurors unanimously found the malice necessary for second degree murder because, in addition to those who made the requisite factual findings for implied malice, any who found guilt based on the felony murder rule \u201cfound\u201d malice by virtue of that rule imputing malice. Defendants are correct, in the abstract, that this reasoning ignores the fact that jurors finding felony murder did not have to make factual determinations concerning defendants\u2019 awareness of and disregard for danger to human life. But, as we have said, this is the mental state required for the direct perpetrator, not the aider-and-abettor defendant. As to the perpetrator, <em>Sanchez </em>noted, \u201c[g]iven the nature of the killing \u2014 an apparent execution related to a large drug trafficking organization \u2014 the existence of malice sufficient for second degree murder on the part of the actual killer cannot be disputed.\u201d <em>(Sanchez, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.4th at p. 1026.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-6\">Here, all the jurors necessarily found that the direct perpetrators committed an attempted robbery. The jury could not have found defendants guilty as aiders and abettors under either theory \u2014 felony murder or natural and probable consequences \u2014 without finding that the perpetrators committed one of the target offenses (attempted robbery or attempted kidnapping). The jury was instructed that before deciding whether a defendant was guilty of murder or attempted murder as an aider and abettor, it had to decide whether the defendant was guilty of attempted robbery or attempted kidnapping. Since the jury found defendants not guilty of attempted kidnapping, and defendants could be convicted of aiding and abetting the murder only if they intended to and in fact aided commission of the crime the perpetrators intended to commit, the jury must have viewed robbery as the target offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1287\">*1287</page-number>As in <em>Sanchez, </em>it is clear that the direct perpetrators of the murder in the present case acted with the malice required for second degree implied malice murder. Attempted robbery, in the abstract, is an \u201c \u2018inherently dangerous\u2019 \u201d offense, as demonstrated by its inclusion among the felonies supporting a first degree felony murder conviction. <em>(Banks, supra, </em>61 Cal.4th at p. 810; see \u00a7 189.) While this fact does not necessarily mean a given participant in a given robbery was aware his or her act was dangerous to human life and acted with conscious disregard for human life <em>(Banks, supra, </em>61 Cal.4th at p. 810),<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> it does point to the foreseeability, from an objective standpoint, of danger to life. Here, Schnebly and Crocker went to the campground armed with a shotgun and a handgun; they loaded the weapons on the way, covered their faces with bandanas before arriving, and emerged from the car at the campground pointing their weapons and yelling for people to get on the ground. On these facts, \u201cthe existence of malice sufficient for second degree murder on the part of the actual killer cannot be disputed.\u201d <em>(Sanchez, supra, </em>221 Cal.App.4th at p. 1026.) Under a second degree implied malice theory, defendants\u2019 convictions rest not on their own conscious disregard for human life, which is not required, but on their aiding and abetting of an attempted robbery in which the direct perpetrators acted with implied malice. Accordingly, having found defendants aided and abetted Crocker and Schnebly\u2019s attempted robbery, all 12 jurors, whether relying on a theory of felony murder or a theory of implied malice murder, found the requisite malice to support convictions of second degree murder.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1105-5\">We conclude that the matter should be remanded to the trial court. The prosecution may elect to retry defendants, or allow a conviction of murder in the second degree to be entered against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-6\">C. <em>CALCRIM No. 404 (Johnson)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1105-7\">Johnson requested a jury instruction on voluntary intoxication by simply listing \u201cCALCRIM 404\u201d on defendant\u2019s proposed instructions filed with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1288\">*1288</page-number>trial court. The court gave the following instruction pursuant to CALCRIM No. 404: \u201cIf you conclude that defendant Marvin Johnson was intoxicated at the time of the alleged crime, you may consider this evidence in deciding whether the defendant: 1. Knew that Buck Crocker intended to commit murder or attempted murder [\u00b6] AND [\u00b6] 2. Intended to aid and abet Buck Crocker in committing murder or attempted murder. [\u00b6] Someone is intoxicated if he or she took any drug, drink, or other substance that caused an intoxicating effect.\u201d The court also instructed the jury \u201cDo not consider evidence of intoxication in deciding <em>whether attempted kidnapping or attempted robbery is a natural and probable consequence of murder or attempted </em>murder.\u201d (Italics added.) In this last sentence, the court reversed the offenses of murder and attempted murder with the target offenses of kidnapping and robbery.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> No one objected to this obvious error, nor did Johnson object to (or even comment on) the scope of the intoxication instruction as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\">Johnson now argues that the trial court erred in two ways in giving this instruction. First, the instruction was incomplete because it failed to instruct the jury that it could consider whether voluntary intoxication affected Johnson\u2019s knowledge that Crocker intended to commit robbery and kidnapping, and Johnson\u2019s requisite intent to aid and abet the attempted robbery and attempted kidnapping \u2014 issues which underlay the first degree felony-murder charge. Johnson argues that, as instructed, the jury was told only how it could consider the effect of intoxication in connection with forming the intent for second degree malice murder.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Second, Johnson contends that the last sentence of the jury instruction was completely garbled and made no legal sense. The last sentence should have read: \u201c[d]o not consider evidence of intoxication in deciding whether <em>murder or attempted murder </em>is a natural and probable consequence of <em>attempted robbery or attempted </em>kidnapping.\u201d (CALCRIM No. 404, italics added.) There was no question as to the target offense and the non-target offense; the instruction, likely through a word processing error, just got it backwards. Johnson thus claims that he was deprived of the benefit of the intoxication instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1289\">*1289</page-number>The Attorney General contends that Johnson\u2019s claim that CALCRIM No. 404 is incomplete was waived because Johnson failed to request a modification of CALCRIM No. 404 to include an instruction regarding requisite intent to aid and abet the attempted robbery and kidnapping underlying the felony murder. We nevertheless address the underlying issue in the event the failure to request a modification of the instruction gives rise to an ineffective assistance of counsel argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-4\">A defendant may present evidence of intoxication on the question whether he is liable for criminal acts as an aider and abettor. <em>(Mendoza, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 1133.) However, \u201c[o]nce a jury finds a defendant did knowingly and intentionally aid and abet a criminal act, intoxication evidence is irrelevant to the <em>extent </em>of the criminal liability. A person who knowingly aids and abets criminal conduct is guilty of not only the intended crime but also of any other crime the perpetrator actually commits that is a natural and probable consequence of the intended crime. . . . [\u00b6] We also stress that although evidence of intoxication is admissible on the question of aider and abettor liability, a jury can still find an intoxicated person guilty as an aider and abettor. Evidence of intoxication, while legally <em>relevant, </em>may be factually unconvincing. . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1133-1134.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">\u201cIf the court gives any instruction at all on the relevance of intoxication (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Castillo </em>[(1997)] 16 Cal.4th [1009,] 1014 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 648, 945 P.2d 1197] [no sua sponte duty to instruct on intoxication]), it might simply instruct that the jury may consider intoxication in determining whether a defendant tried as an aider and abettor had the required mental state. It might also instruct that the intoxication evidence is irrelevant on the question whether a charged crime was a natural and probable consequence of the target crime. The court would not additionally be required to parse out those elements of each crime charged for which the evidence could be considered or distinguish between the knowledge and the intent requirements.\u201d <em>(Mendoza, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 1134.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">Our Supreme Court has further written in <em>Mendoza </em>that \u201cThe applicable legal standards are settled. ... [A] trial court has no sua sponte duty to instruct on the relevance of intoxication, but if it does so instruct... it has to do so correctly. [Citation.] The appellate court should review the instructions as a whole to determine whether it is \u2018reasonably likely the jury misconstrued the instructions as precluding it from considering\u2019 the intoxication evidence in deciding aiding and abetting liability. [Citation.] Any error would have the effect of excluding defense evidence and is thus subject to the usual standard for state law error: \u2018the court must reverse only if it also finds a reasonable probability the error affected the verdict adversely to defendant.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Humphrey </em>[(1996)] 13 Cal.4th [1073,] 1089 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 142, 921 P.2d 1].)\u201d <em>(Mendoza, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at pp. 1134-1135.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1290\">*1290</page-number>Viewing the instructions as a whole, it is not reasonably likely the jury believed it was precluded from considering intoxication evidence. The jury was instructed on felony murder, including that the jury had to first find that Johnson aided and abetted an attempted kidnapping or an attempted murder in order to be found guilty of felony murder. The jury was instructed on \u201caiding and abetting,\u201d including that the jury had to find that defendant \u201cknew that the perpetrator intended to commit the crime\u201d and \u201cintended to aid and abet the perpetrator in committing the crime.\u201d The jury was also told that it was to consider all of the instructions together as a whole. Even if the intoxication instruction was incomplete, it did not inform the jurors that they were precluded from considering evidence of intoxication in connection with the knowledge and intent required for aiding and abetting felony murder. Nor did counsel malee any such suggestion; the issue of voluntary intoxication was never even addressed by the prosecutor in closing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-4\">As to the garbled last sentence of the jury instruction on intoxication, any error was harmless. It did not preclude the jury from considering relevant intoxication evidence. It was an attempt to instruct the jurors that they could not consider intoxication on whether one crime was a natural and probable consequence of the other, because such instruction would not be relevant. <em>(,Mendoza, supra, </em>18 Cal.4th at p. 1134.) Because the instruction was garbled, it failed in that regard. But it did not \u201chave the effect of excluding defense evidence,\u201d and was not error. (Ibid.; see <em>People v. Letner and Tobin </em>(2010) 50 Cal.4th 99, 187 [112 Cal.Rptr.3d 746, 235 P.3d 62] [even if instructions on voluntary intoxication were inadequate, error harmless where, among other things, prosecutor did not argue that jury could not consider voluntary intoxication and defendants did not \u201cactually argue[] a voluntary intoxication defense to the jury\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-5\">Finally, the asserted errors were not prejudicial because there was no evidence that Johnson\u2019s ingestion of alcohol and drugs on the day of the murder affected his ability to understand that Crocker intended to commit robbery or kidnapping, or his ability to form an intent to aid and abet Crocker in committing robbery or kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-6\">As we have discussed, before lunch on the day of the shootings, Johnson was \u201cdown at the creek\u201d drinking beer, whisky and smoking marijuana. He described this as getting \u201ca buzz on.\u201d Johnson testified that the most significant effect of his intoxication was that it led him to brag about the possibility that there was a great deal of money and marijuana at the campsite. Further, he sometimes blamed his alleged inability to clearly recall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1291\">*1291</page-number><em>at trial </em>certain conversations that occurred the day of the shootings on the fact that he was \u201cjust a little bit drunk, little bit\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> or \u201cbuzzed.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1109-4\">However, neither Johnson nor any other witness testified that Johnson\u2019s drinking and drug use made him unable to understand Crocker\u2019s intentions. Nor is there any evidence that because of drinking or drug use Johnson was unable to form an intent to aid and abet Crocker. Far from attributing his ignorance of Crocker\u2019s intentions to alcohol or drug use, Johnson testified that he did not put together what was happening because he was only given information in \u201cbits and pieces.\u201d Moreover, Johnson admitted on several occasions that he was aware that Crocker and Schnebly were going out to the lake \u201cfor the money and the weed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-5\">Defense counsel did not argue to the jury that Johnson\u2019s capacity to understand the events was affected because he was intoxicated. At most, defense counsel argued that Johnson displayed bad judgment in drinking and then bragging about the money and drugs at the campground.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-6\">In light of the paucity of evidence that Johnson\u2019s drug and alcohol use earlier in the day had any impact on his ability to understand there was a plan afoot to rob the people at the campsite or to aid and abet this plan, and the record described above, any error in giving this instruction was not prejudicial.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1292\">*1292</page-number>D. <em>Effective Assistance of Counsel (Johnson and Thornton)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1110-4\">Both Johnson and Thornton argue that to the extent we find that any claimed error was waived, such a waiver occurred through ineffective assistance of counsel. Having made no such finding, we need not reach this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-5\">E. <em>Cumulative Error (Thornton)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1110-6\">Given our conclusion that defendants\u2019 convictions must be conditionally reversed, Thornton\u2019s claim of cumulative error adds nothing to this appeal. The error in the accomplice instructions was harmless, and Thornton\u2019s only other claim of error, ineffective assistance of counsel, is moot since we did not find any of the claimed errors waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-7\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-8\">Johnson and Thornton\u2019s first degree murder convictions are reversed and the matter is remanded for a new trial on count 1 of the information. Unless the prosecution brings each defendant to trial within the period prescribed by law after the remittitur in this case issues, the trial court shall proceed as though the judgment on appeal had been reduced on count 1 to second degree murder for each defendant.

This instruction began, \u201cThe defendants are charged in Count One with murder.\u201d It then explained the elements of murder, and the two kinds of malice aforethought (express malice and implied malice). This instruction explained the elements of implied malice, and introduced the concept of \u201cthe natural and probable consequence[] of [an] act [being] dangerous to human life.\u201d It concluded, \u201cIf you find the defendant guilty of murder, it is murder of the second degree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-8\">The jury was next instructed on felony murder.

The potential distinction between the theories of murder was particularly significant because only one of the two target offenses, kidnapping, would have supported a verdict of first degree felony murder; the other target offense, assault, could support only second degree implied malice murder. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1019.)

Johnson was asked whether Schnebly and Thornton were \u201ctalking about what was going to happen up there, anything like that?\u201d Johnson testified, \u201cNothing straight up came out. They were \u2014 they were just like saying that they\u2019re going to \u2014 we\u2019re going to go out the lake. We\u2019re just going out there and talk. Like I said, okay, I\u2019m going to try to get my wife. And that\u2019s pretty much all I was gathering. I mean, I was just a little bit drunk, little bit, so I really can\u2019t quite remember exactly what was being talked about because I was drinking some whisky that day.\u201d If anything, Johnson attempted to minimize his drinking, as he did generally with his involvement in the crimes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b1109-8\"> Johnson testified that when he mentioned to Schnebly, Crocker, and Cory (the other man who was with them that afternoon) that there was money and marijuana at the Lake Mendocino campsite he had been \u201cdrinking. I was \u2014 I was talking about, you know, what was out there and everything, you know. I \u2014 I talk a lot when I drink.\u201d At that point, he probably had \u201ca 12-pack and a fifth of whisky. We were halfway tanked.\u201d He was drinking because he wanted to \u201ccop a buzz.\u201d He was also smoking marijuana and had a \u201cbuzz on.\u201d He described himself as \u201cquite toasted\u201d that day. On another occasion during his testimony he described this conversation as one in which he \u201chad a little bit too much to drink\u201d and so \u201csaid a little too much.\u201d Finally, he also acknowledged that he set the action in motion by bragging about the marijuana and money at the campsite. He attributed that to having \u201ca big mouth when I was drinking.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b1109-9\"> Johnson argues that this instructional error rose to the level of a due process violation and, therefore, we must consider whether this error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1292\">*1292</page-number><em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 23-24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824].
