It is, however, to be optional with said Drury, to give the note to said King or not. If said Drury shall refuse to give up the note within mentioned to said King, said King not to pay said Drury any thing. N. Drury.\u201d Annexed to the bond was the deposition of E B. Penniman, stating that the bond was drawn by him, and executed by the defendant in his presence; that the agreement of said Drury, on the back of the bond, was drawn by the deponent; also, that the memorandum on the back of the bond was made by him, at the same time, \u201c down to figures of $ 580, and also the lower date of December 22d 1837 ; \u201d and that the other writing and figures of said memorandum were in the handwriting of Nathan Drury, but were not put upon the bond when it was executed: That said Drury gave to the defendant two notes of hand, one of $ 500, and one of $ 80, at the time of the execution of the bond, and according to said memorandum; that the sum of $580 was the amount of two different transactions, one for the note, the other for an execution against Otis Hodge. The deponent further stated, that he \u201c should say,\u201d but was \u201c not positive as to the fact,\u201d that Otis Hodge gave to Drury, at the time the bond was executed, a quitclaim deed of \u201c the premises named in the bond.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b592-11\">In the court of common pleas, the defendant admitted a breach of the condition of the bond, and submitted to a default <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>He then moved for a hearing in chancery, to ascertain the sum for which execution should issue. The plaintiff objected to this motion, on the ground that the sum of $580 and interest was not a penal sum, but liquidated damages. The court overruled this objection, and decided that the sum mentioned in the bond was a penal sum, and accordingly ordered that judgment should be entered for said sum and interest thereon from the date of the writ, and that execution should issue for such sum as should be adjudged by the court, on a hearing in chancery, according to the Rev. Sts. <em>c. </em>100, &lt;\u00a7&gt; 9. The plaintiff thereupon alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b593-5\"><em>Robinson &amp; D. N. Dewey, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZV\">The sum mentioned in the bond was liquidated damages. Drury\u2019s purpose was to obtain title to the land under the mortgage, by an assignment of the mortgage by Turner &amp; Laflin; and the time within which that assignment was to be made was limited to one year. If not made within a year, the defendant was to pay $ 580 and interest. Drury was not to wait and see whether he sustained any damages by not having an assignment of the mortgage. Heath, J. says, <em>\u201c </em>where it is agreed that if a party do such a particular thing, such a sum shall be paid by him, then the sum stated may be treated as liquidated damages.\u201d <em>2 </em>Bos. &amp; Pul. 353. The rule must be the same where a party agrees that if he does not do a certain thing he will pay a certain sum. See <em>Lowe </em>v. <em>Peers, </em>4 Bur. 2228. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>4 Wend. 468. <em>Knopp </em>v. <em>Maltby, </em>13 Wend. 587. <em>Heard </em>v. <em>Bowers, </em>23 Pick. 455. <em>Pierce </em>v <em>Fuller, </em>8 Mass. 223.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b593-6\">The memorandum on the bond shows that the defendant received $580; and the provision that interest should be paid on that sum tends to show that the sum was liquidated damages. The deposition of Penniman was admissible for the purpose of showing that liquidated damages were intended by the parties. <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Lyman, </em>11 Mass. 81.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b593-7\"><em>Byington, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3M\">The testimony of Penniman is inadmissible, as it <em>adds to </em>the bond, instead of merely showing the circumstances that attended its execution. But if that testimony be admissible, then it shows that Drury received an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>execution for <em>$ </em>80; and the presumption is, that he collected it. If he did collect it, then he has not suffered damage to the amount of $580, and should not recover that amount. And if he received a quitclaim deed from Otis Hodge, as Penniman believes he did, he has suffered no damage at all from the defendant\u2019s failure to obtain an assignment of the mortgage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b594-5\">The sum of $580 is more than the admissible evidence shows that the defendant received of Drury, with the addition of lawful interest thereon for one year, viz. nearly 24 per cent, per annum on $500.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b594-6\">Hubbard, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AP\">The only question in this case is, whether the sum of money which the defendant promised to pay, if he did not procure an assignment of the mortgage, is to be considered merely as a penalty, or whether it is the sum agreed upon to be paid, in case he fails in his engagement. This, as has been determined in <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Lyman, </em>11 Mass. 81, is a question of construction; therefore the subject matter of the contract may be inquired into, so far as respects the situation of the parties and the facts relating to the agreement; not however for the purpose of controlling the language, where that is clear and explicit, but to ascertain the circumstances out of which the contract originated, and especially in regard to the consideration <em>Clapp </em>v. <em>Tirrell, </em>20 Pick. 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">If this agreement had not been expressed in the form of a bond with condition, it would then, we think, be very clear that the actual sum to be paid by the defendant was adjusted and settled at the time of making the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">Agreeably to what we have observed before, the deposition of Penniman, though not competent to control the construction of the instrument declared on, is admissible to explain the circumstances under which the bond originated ; to show that the indorsement on the instrument was made at the same time, and is to be taken as part of it; and to give the facts in relation to the consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">From this it appears that the sum of $ 580 had been actually advanced by Drury in his notes to King, one for $500 and another for $80, for which he received no other consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>than the note of Otis Hodge, on which was due about $500, and an execution against Hodge for $80. The note of Hodge was originally secured by mortgage; but the mortgage had been assigned without the note, and at that time was not in the possession of King. By the instrument in suit, King agreed to procure the assignment of the mortgage to Drury within a year, and if not, to pay back the sum of $ 580 with interest: And upon these facts, we are of opinion that this instrument is not to be considered as in the nature of a penalty, and the damage sustained to be ascertained by the value of the mortgaged property, but as an agreement to payback the $580 with interest, if the assignment of the mortgage could not be procured, upon Drury\u2019s giving back the note of Hodge.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The only doubt as to this arises from the sum of $80, said to be paid for an execution ; and it has been suggested that thiii was a mere cover for usury. But this suggestion is not brought forward in such a manner as to authorize the court to take notice of it; and in relation to the execution, very little information is given, and no evidence of its value. And we cannot, on the whole, consider it as affecting the agreement of the parties as to the actual amount to be paid, in case the mortgage should not be assigned, and to convert the instrument into a mere penal engagement.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">It is often a doubtful question whether the sum stipulated to be paid on the non-performance of a condition is in the nature of a penalty, or is the amount settled by the parties for the purpose of making that certain which would be otherwise uncertain In a case like the present, but little light can be derived from authorities. It must rest on the construction to be given to the language used, aided by the facts proved, which gave birth to the instrument. And here it appears that the defendant, having received $ 580 from Drury, did agree to procure for him the as signment of a certain mortgage, and in default of it, to pay him back the $580 and interest, without reference to the execution. And we think this was settling the actual sum to be paid, and that it was not intended to leave the amount in uncertainty and to depend upon unforeseen contingencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>The bond has indeed a condition ; but that is matter of form, and cannot turn that into a penalty which, but for the form, is an agreement to pay a precise sum under certain circumstances. And the agreement to pay interest on the sum is a strong cor roboration of this construction of the instrument; as in penal bonds such a provision is not made, but the party relies on the penalty as the means of furnishing full indemnity for all that may be payable for a breach of the condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">On the whole, we are of opinion that the damages were liquidated by the parties. The exceptions are therefore sustained, and as no payment is shown to have been made, judgment will be entered for the sum of \u00a75580, with interest from the time it was payable.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
