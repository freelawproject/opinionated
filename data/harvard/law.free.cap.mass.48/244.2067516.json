Swain &amp; Co.\u201d to the plaintiffs: That said brig had sailed on said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>voyage about the 1st of July 1840, and that she returned to New Bedford in June 1841: That the defendant was agent of the owners of the brig; that he sold her cargo, as such agent; and that the proceeds of the sale came to his hands : That the plaintiffs, before the commencement of this action, demanded of the defendant one eighth of said proceeds, claiming the same as mortgagees as aforesaid ; and that the defendant refused to pay them any part thereof. No question was made as to the amount which the plaintiffs were entitled to recover, if entitled to recover at all. No evidence was offered by the plaintiffs to show that A. Bullard was authorized to act as attorney of said Joseph Bullard.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-5\">The defendant objected, that Swain had no right, as one of the firm, to execute said mortgage in the name of the partners, and that nothing passed to the plaintiffs thereby. This objection was overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-6\">The defendant then introduced evidence tending to show, that on the 17th of February 1840 the said brig was at sea, and was under a mortgage to Samuel Dale to secure payment of <em>$ </em>570-78 &gt; that said Swain &amp; Co., on that day, made a mortgage of all their right, title and interest in her, viz. one eighth part thereof, to Andrew Carney, to secure a note held by him against said Swain for 1816-96, payable on demand; that said mortgage was duly recorded on the 22d of said February ; that said brig returned from sea in the spring of 1840; and that about ten days before the brig sailed on her last voyage, viz. about the 18th of June 1840, an agent of said Carney went on board of her and took formal possession, under the said mortgage to Carney. The defendant thereupon contended that the one eighth part of the proceeds of the sale of the cargo, which was taken after said agent took possession, belonged to said Carney, and not to the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b253-7\">There was nd evidence that when the agent of Carney so took possession, any person interested in the property was on board the brig, or that said Swain <em>&amp; </em>Co. had any notice of that fact, or that any demand had been made upon them for payment of the note given to Carney as aforesaid</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>The plaintiffs then offered evidence tending to show that Swain <em>&amp; </em>Co. furnished one eighth part of the outfits for the last voyage of said brig, and that she sailed without any notice to them that Carney had taken possession as aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-5\">There was evidence that after the return of the brig, in June 1841, said Carney, with the consent of Swain &amp; Co., the mortgagors, sold one eighth part of her hull, and demanded of the defendant one eighth part of the proceeds of the cargo.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b254-6\">The judge instructed the jury, that if the foregoing facts, of which evidence had been given, were proved to their satisfaction, the plaintiffs were entitled to a verdict. A verdict was returned for the plaintiffs, and the defendant alleged exceptions to said instruction.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b254-7\"><em>Coffin, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqs\">No proper execution of the plain tiffs\u2019 mortgage was shown. It does not appear that it was made to secure a partnership debt. On the contrary, the inference is, that it was for Swain\u2019s private debt; as a person, claiming to act as attorney for Bullard, signed the deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-8\">The mortgage to Carney transferred a right superior to that of the plaintiffs. His right was to one eighth of the brig, as she then was at sea; and upon her return, he took possession of her, and finally sold her under his mortgage. A mortgagee in possession is entitled to the earnings of the vessel, and is liable for her outfits and repairs. Abbott on Ship. (4th Amer. ed.) 17 &amp; <em>seq. </em>3 Kent Com. (3d ed.) 134 &amp; <em>seq. </em>And a mortgagee not in possession is entitled to the profits of the vessel. <em>Moss </em>v. <em>Gallimore, </em>1 Doug. 279. In <em>Westerdell v. Dale, </em>7 T. R. 312, Lord Kenyon said, that as to a mortgagee, \u201c whether in or out of possession, he is the legal owner, and must be so considered in a court of law, notwithstanding his title is subject to equitable interests,\u201d &amp;c. By the authority of that case, Swain, who furnished the outfits of the brig, may recover of Carney the amount of such outfits; at least for all beyond the amount which he owed Carney. Probably, however, it was necessary that Swain should fit out the brig, in order to make her security for the amount of Carney\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b254-9\">The owner of a vessel is owner of her return cargo, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>entitled to her earnings, unless some special contract to the con trary is shown. In the present case, the other owners, or strangers, may have claims for outfits and expenditures, one eighth ol which Carney must pay. Abbott on Ship. (4th Amer. ed.) 19, <em>note.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-5\">That Carney relied for security as well upon the cargo as the brig, is apparent on the papers. His demand on one eighth was for $1816-96, subject to a previous mortgage of $572-78.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-6\">As the defendant received nothing for the plaintiffs, but was agent only for the owners of the brig, and the proceeds of the sale came into his hands as such agent, the plaintiffs, not claiming as owners, cannot recover of him in this action, whatever may be the relative rights of the plaintiffs and Carney.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b255-7\"><em>Clifford, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AnL\">The mortgage was valid without proof of A. Bullard\u2019s authority, as attorney of J. Bullard. His execution of the instrument was merely <em>ex abundanti cautela, </em>and was not necessary to make it a valid transfer of the property. The execution by Swain, one of the firm, was sufficient, as it was a conveyance of partnership property, to secure payment of a partnership debt. The condition states that the mortgage was given to secure a note of $825, given to the plaintiffs by the firm. This is conclusive, until it is shown that it was not a partnership debt. As this was a transfer of personal property, it was not necessary that the instrument should be under seal; and the transaction being within the scope of the business of the partnership, it is not vitiated by the annexation of a seal to the signature of the firm. <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Barber, 4 </em>Day, 428. <em>Tapley </em>v. <em>Butterfield, </em>1 Met. 515. Story on Part. \u00a7 122.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b255-8\">Carney, by his own acts, is estopped to claim tne mortgagors\u2019 interest in the proceeds of the voyage for which they furnished the outfits. He gave them no notice that he had taken or intended to take possession of the brig. He stood by and suffered them to incur all the expense and risk of the enterprise ; and after they have conveyed their interest in the adventure to another creditor, and the risk has terminated, he claims the proceeds The circumstances show his implied permission that the mortgagors might use the brig for another voyage; and that he did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>not intend to rely upon any thing but the brig itself. The facts are not fully stated in the judge\u2019s report; but it is not to be presumed that one eighth of the brig was the only property conveyed to him to secure his claim of <em>$ </em>1816\u201896. And if he had relied at all on the earnings of the brig, he would have claimed them on her return from her first voyage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-5\">On the facts of the case, the instruction of the judge was correct, and did not depart from any legal position maintained in the cases cited for the defendant.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b256-6\">Dewey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3H\">1. The defendant insists that the mortgage to the plaintiffs was not duly executed, so as to be effectual to secure a partnership debt or liability of Swain &amp; Co. There is no signature by Bullard, the other partner, and no authority is shown on behalf of the agent who acted as attorney in the signature of Bullard\u2019s name; and this would be fatal, if the separate signature of each of the partners was necessary to give validity to the mortgage. But this is not necessary. One partner is competent to transfer personal property by way of mortgage, by executing such mortgage in the partnership name; and as such mortgage requires no seal, the addition of a seal by one partner did not vitiate the conveyance. This mortgage, having been executed by one of the partners in the name of both, and being on the face of it a security given for a partnership debt, is well executed, and the further attempted execution of it, though ineffectual as a further execution by Bullard, does not divest it of its legal character.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\"><em>2. </em>The defendant contends that the effect of the prior mortgage to Carney, and his acts under it, were such as to vest in Carney the right to the money held by the defendant, and which the plaintiffs demand in this action. This was a mortgage of one eighth of the brig; and the defendant insists that this mortgage, accompanied by the taking of formal possession by Carney, in the manner stated in the report of the case, transferred to Carney .all the interest that Swain &amp; Co. had in the cargo and catchings during the subsequent voyage.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">We do not understand that a mortgagee of a ship, who is not in possession, is necessarily connected with or answerable foi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Mitfits, or entitled to the earnings of the ship. The mortgagee might have taken possession of her, and insisted upon his right to retain possession. He might have insisted upon his right to cooperate in fitting her out, and to participate in her earnings. But not having done so, and contenting himself with a mere formal entry, and allowing others to fit her out, and to act osten - sibly as the owners of cargo, catchings and profits, their interest in the earnings made by the voyage might be well transferred in mortgage, to secure others for liabilities or for advances made by them. The secret entry made by Carney, without giving notice thereof to the mortgagors, or to the other part owners, was nugatory and void, and no rights attached by reason of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The defendant holding the avails of the earnings of the voyage, for distribution, the plaintiffs may well recover, in the present action, the amount they are entitled to, as mortgagees thereof, by virtue of their mortgage covering the cargo and catchings.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
