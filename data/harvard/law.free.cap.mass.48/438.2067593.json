Dill and his associates, that their contract with the town for taking oysters must cease after this year.\u201d The plaintiffs likewise gave evidence, that on the 29th of May 1839 they were duly served with notice of these last mentioned votes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-5\">The plaintiffs then showed that they sent a vessel to Ware-ham, in the spring of 1840, for the purpose of obtaining oysters under their contract, as they had done in preceding years; that their agent applied, as formerly, to the chairman of the selectmen for the statute permit which had previously been given, and was refused; that the vessel, after waiting a number of days, during which some town meetings were held, returned empty; and that no oysters had since been taken by the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-6\">There was much evidence tending to show that there were, in said town, oysters to which the plaintiffs were entitled by the terms of their said contract, and which might have been taken without injury to the fishery. There was also much evidence tending to prove the contrary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-7\">It was insisted by the defendants, and they requested the court to instruct the jury, that the town, in its corporate capa= city, had no authority to make the contract declared on, or to bind the town by any contract for the taking of oysters by the plaintiffs; that the town had made no such ontract with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>plaintiffs, as was set forth in the plaintiffs\u2019 declaration; that the town had done no act to deprive the plaintiffs of the benefit of said contract, and that the plaintiffs had not proved any breach of said contract by the defendants; that the damages for the breach of said contract would not embrace the whole unexpired term of it; and that the evidence respecting the $500 was not sufficient to justify the jury in returning a verdict for the plaintiffs for that amount.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-5\">The court declined to give the instructions requested, and charged the jury that the contract adduced in evidence supported the plaintiffs\u2019 declaration, and was a legal and valid contract, obligatory on the defendants; that if there had been a breach of said contract by the defendants, the plaintiffs were entitled to recover, in this action, the damages which they had sustained by reason of the non-fulfilment thereof, including therein the unexpired term of said contract; that the votes of said town, of the 11th of March 1839, if notified to the plaintiffs, as the evidence tended to prove, was a breach of said contract, provided there were oysters in said town which the plaintiffs, by said contract, were entitled to take and could have taken without injury to the oyster fishery in said town and to the inhabitants thereof; that the plaintiffs were bound by the contract to make such use only of the oyster beds, as would leave the inhabitants of the town fish enough for their own reasonable consumption, and not injure the fishery as a property; and that, if the plaintiffs\u2019 fishing had in fact proved injurious in these respects, the defendants had lawfully terminated the contract, and had not broken it. The court also instructed the jury, that the plaintiffs, on the evidence, were entitled to recover the $500.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-6\">A verdict was returned for the plaintiffs for $4560-42, which was to be set aside, and a new trial granted, if the foregoing rulings and instructions were erroneous ; otherwise, judgment to be rendered upon the verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-7\">This case was fully argued on all the points raised at the trial.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"ALA\">Many questions were raised and discussed, in the argument of the present case, which the court have not found it necessary to decide. It is an action against the inhabit- ' ants of the town of Wareham, on a special executory contract, and the claim is to recover damages for the brea\u00bb, h of it. If the contract on which the action is brought be held to grant any interest or property in the oyster fishery, or any franchise or vested right whatever which has been invaded, the remedy of the plaintiffs must be sought in an action on the case for a disturbance, or by other appropriate proceedings, and against those who caused the disturbance. It is proper therefore to repeat, that this is an action on the contract, as an executory contract, and a non-fulfilment thereof on the part of the town, in which the plaintiffs seek to recover damages for the loss sustained by such nonfulfilment</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>One ground of defence was, that if this instrument, which is extremely guarded and cautious, contained any stipulation that the town should perform any act, it was not averred or proved that the town have failed or refused to do such act, and so there was no such breach or non-fulfilment as would enable the plaintiffs to maintain this action. This agreement on the part of the town is certainly much more in the nature of a grant, lease, or release of right, or other executed contract, than an executory undertaking to do any act; and such stipulation, if found at all in it, must arise from implication, and as something incident to a benefit or right granted, and not in terms. But if the town had no interest or property in the subject, and no legal authority, as a corporation of very limited powers, to make such an executory contract, then the vote passed by the inhabitants, purporting to vest power in a committee, was unauthorized and void, and the undertaking of the committee, professing to bind the town, was merely void. This is the first question ; and if it appears that the contract was not the binding contract of the town, it becomes unnecessary to consider another question, which was largely discussed, namely, whether there was any such implied stipulation, what was its legal effect and operation, and whether any violation of it had been averred and proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">By the common law of England, the property of the coasts, bays, and arms of the sea, and of the fishery therein, was in the king; but in trust, as to fisheries, for all the king\u2019s subjects, except when otherwise especially granted ; so that in effect such fisheries were regarded as common to all the king\u2019s subjects. 9 Petersd. Ab. (Amer. ed.) 451, 452. By the colony charters, this right of the crown was transferred, with the territory and jurisdiction, to the colonies, for the use and benefit of the inhabitants. This vested the power in the colonial governments to make laws, to regulate and protect this, as one of the common rights of the inhabitants. It is not necessary to examine all the acts upon this subject. None can be found, which vests an exclusive right of the property in the oyster fisheries in towns, in their corporate capacities. If there had been, no further regulation would have been necessary; because the laws which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>secure all other rights of property would have been sufficient to enable towns to manage and defend such fisheries. In one case it has been decided that the town had no such property in the shad and alewife fisheries. <em>Randolph </em>v. <em>Braintree, </em>4 Mass. 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Still the laws recognized some rights of the inhabitants of towns; as the celebrated colony ordinance of 1641, (Anc. Chart. 148,) which secured free fishing and fowling, but limited the privileges thereby secured to householders, and to such free fishing and fowling, within the limits of their respective townships. Such regulations obviously gave the privilege, rather to the inhabitants of townships, personally and respectively, than to the town in its corporate capacity ; and rather as a common privilege, than as a right of property. It was also under this limitation ; \u201c unless the freemen of the same town, or the general court, have otherwise appropriated them.\u201d This therefore, the earliest act on the subject, recognizes the right of fishing, as a common right, and the authority of the colonial government to regulate it. And this was regulated by the provincial acts mentioned in the fifth section of <em>St. </em>1795, c. 71. These acts were revised and repealed by the last mentioned statute. The preamble to this statute recites, that \u201c oysters and other shell fish have long been considered the property of the towns ; \u201d but the same preamble speaks of them as \u201c common property,\u201d which requires some further special provisions. And the statute proceeds to make regulations, which secure a right to all the inhabitants severally, and vests in the selectmen certain powers of granting permits. By this act, taking all its parts together, we are of opinion that whatever right vested in the inhabitants of towns was a qualified right, and subject to be regulated by the general court; and that the whole subject was thereby regulated, and nothing remained for towns, in their corporate capacity, to do. The same provisions were reenacted by Rev. Sts. c. 55, \u00a7\u00a7 11, 12. They are, that the selectmen \u201cmay give permits in writing to any person, to take oysters from their beds, at such times, in such quantities, and for such uses, as the said selectmen shall think reasonable, and shall express in their said permits ; and every inhabitant, without such permit, may take oysters for the use of his family.\u201d And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>all persons are prohibited from taking oysters otherwise^ under a penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Whether, under these statute provisions, the selectmen have authority to take money or valuable consideration for permits, or, in other words, to sell the right to take oysters ; or, if they have such power and exercise it, whether they are not to be regarded as trustees for the town, and bound to account to the town for the proceeds, it is not necessary to decide in this case, and we give no opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">But the court are of opinion, that the selectmen, in giving permits under the authority thus conferred on them, are not the agents of the town, subject to be directed, restrained or controlled by its votes. They act under an authority conferred on them by statute, to be executed according to their own judgment, and do not act ministerially, according to the will of the town, expressed by its votes. It is like the authority given to selectmen, by other statutes, to lay out town ways; under which it has been held, that a vote of the town, directing them to lay out a particular town way described, is irregular and void. <em>Kean </em>v. <em>Stetson, </em>5 Pick. 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">We are therefore of opinion, that whatever right the inhabitants of towns have to the oysters in the natural beds within their limits, beyond the right of the inhabitants severally to take them for the use of their families, is not an absolute property or franchise, capable of being transferred to others by the town, in its corporate capacity, but is a qualified right, to be sought through the selectmen, executing a statute power; that such a transfer of the fishery, and the power of making contracts respecting it, is not within the jurisdiction of towns, nor one of the corporate powers conferred on them by law. The supposed contract, therefore, upon which this action is brought, was one which the town of Wareham had no authority, as a corporation, to make, and the town is not bound by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">In regard to the sum of five hundred dollars, as it appears that it was received by the treasurer and went to the use of the town, and was so received in advance, upon a consideration which has failed, it must be regarded as money had and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>received by the town to the plaintiffs\u2019 use; and therefore the action for that sum will lie. No special demand was necessary. Where there is a debt, a duty to pay money presently, not dependent upon any condition or contingency, an action may be brought to recover it, without a previous demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">If the defendants would have avoided the inconvenience of having the suit, on the other points, conducted at their expense, and of having to pay the costs, in consequence of their liability for this sum of five hundred dollars, they should have brought the money into court, at the commencement of the suit, when a small amount of costs had accrued.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">With the plaintiffs\u2019 consent, the verdict may be amended, to stand as a verdict for <em>$500, </em>with interest from the date of the writ, and judgment may be entered upon it; otherwise, the verdict is to be set aside and a new trial granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
