I give and bequeath to my sisters, Lucy Perkins and Lois Perkins, the use and profit and benefit of my whole real estate, for the term of their natural lives, except such parts thereof as are specially disposed of hereafter. 2. I give and bequeath to my nephew, Jesse Perkins,\u201d (the mortgagor) \u201c all my real and personal estate, to come into possession at the decease of the aforesaid Lucy and Lois, with the privilege to let the farm annually, and sell my hill pasture (called Ten Acres) with my stock, tools, hay, &amp;c.; with the income of the farm; to pay my just debts, if the income of the farm should be any thing more than a comfortable support for my aforesaid sis ters ; the aforesaid privileges to come into possession at my decease ; the said Jesse to come into possession of the whole estate at the decease of the aforesaid Lucy and Lois. 3.

I hereby appoint the said Jesse Perkins sole executor of this my last will and testament, enjoining it on him to pay all my just debts, and the aforesaid legacies, in one year from my decease.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b339-9\">The said Lucy Perkins and Lois Perkins were supported by said Jesse Perkins, during the'r joint lives, agreeably to the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>visions of said will. Said Lois died on the 20th of August 1842, and said Jesse died on the 20th of February 1843. After the death of said Lois, and until the death of said Jesse, said Lucy was supported by him. Said Jesse came into the actual possession of said estate on the decease of said testator, viz. on the 18th of January 1834, and continued in possession until his death. Said Lucy and Lois resided in the house that belonged to the testator, and were supported therein, by said Jesse, during their joint lives; and said Lucy was supported therein, after the decease of said Lois, by said Jesse, who occupied a part of the same house. After the death of said Jesse, his widow, who was administratrix of his estate, offered to continue to furnish the necessary supplies for the comfortable support of said Lucy, in the same manner in which they had before been furnished, and is still ready to furnish them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-5\">Said Jesse paid the testator\u2019s debts, amounting to about $700. The whole real estate of the testator is included in the mortgage deed made to the demandant by said Jesse, except a parcel of peat meadow. The testator\u2019s heirs at law were two brothers, and the said Lucy and Lois, his two sisters. The said Jesse was a son of one of the testator\u2019s brothers.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b340-6\">Perkins, for the demandant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b340-7\"><em>Ward, </em>for the tenants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b340-8\">The court delivered their opinion at November term 1844.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b340-9\">Wilde, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AVn\">This case depends on the construction of the will of Jacob Perkins, and the principal question to be decided is, whether Jesse Perkins, the demandant\u2019s grantor, took by the said will a life estate, or an estate in fee, in the demanded premises. The will is very unskilfully drawn, and some of the clauses are apparently inconsistent with each other; but taking into consideration the whole will, we think the intention of the testator is manifest, and that there can be no reasonable doubt of its true construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">By the first clause, an estate for life in the testator\u2019s real estate is given to his two sisters, Lucy and Lois Perkins; and by the second clause, his whole estate, real and personal, is given to his nephew Jesse Perkins, he to come into possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>at the decease of the two sisters. If the will had stopped here, its construction would be very clear. The sisters would have taken an estate for life, respectively; and the nephew would have taken a remainder in fee, which would vest in him on the death of the testator, although the possession was postponed until after the decease of the sisters.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">That a devise of a testator\u2019s whole <em>estate </em>will pass a fee, he being seized of such an estate, is unquestionable, unless given in such words as go merely to describe the lands devised, and not the extent of his interest therein. <em>Randall </em>v. Tuchin, 6 Taunt. 410. <em>Godfrey </em>v. <em>Humphrey, </em>18 Pick. 537. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>17 Mass. 73. <em>Kellogg </em>v. <em>Blair, </em>6 Met. 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">It has been argued, that the power given by a subsequent part of the will to the nephew, to sell a part of the lands and personal property devised, is inconsistent with this construction ; but we think not. This was necessary, in order to give the purchaser a good title against the two sisters. The only doubt, therefore, arises from other parts of the will, by which it was provided that the nephew might come into possession of the farm at the testator\u2019s decease, and let the same annually, and with the surplus annual income of the farm pay the testator\u2019s debts, \u201c if the income of the farm should be any thing more than a comfortable support \u201d for the testator\u2019s said sisters. And by the third clause it is provided, that \u201cif the said Jesse Perkins shall neglect to provide for the said Lucy and Lois a comfortable support, in sickness and in health, during their natural lives, then the said Lucy and Lois to have the improvement of the farm during their natural lives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">These provisions are inconsistent with the first clause, by which the whole use, profit and benefit of the testator\u2019s whole real estate is given to the two sisters unconditionally. There is, however, an exception in this clause, in the words following \u2022 \u201c except such parts thereof as are specially disposed of hereafter.\u201d This exception does not extend in terms to the whole estate given to the sisters; but it clearly evinces an intention ot qualifying that clause according to the subsequent provisions ; so that if they could not be reconciled, the former should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>modified by the latter. And without that exception, such would be the rule of construction. A part of the second clause, and the whole of the third, would be considered as annexed to the first clause, in the nature of a condition or proviso quali fyi\u00f1g and limiting the generality of the previous language of the devise. That this was the intention of the testator, will not admit of a doubt. He expressly directs that his nephew shall come into possession at his decease, and he directs how the income is to be disposed of. And by the third clause it is provided, that if the nephew should neglect to provide a comfortable support for the two sisters, then the sisters were to have the improvement of the farm during their natural lives; which conclusively implies that they were not to have the improvement, if they should be supported as the will directs.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">We have therefore no doubt as to the true meaning and construction of this will. We consider the whole estate to have passed to Jesse Perkins, on the death of the testator, subject to a condition in favor of his two sisters, by the nonperformance of which by the said Jesse, they would become entitled to the improvement and income of the farm. The demandant accordingly is entitled to judgment for possession of the whole premises demanded, as it appears that the said Jesse did comply with the condition and requisition of the will in favor of the two sisters during his life time, and that since his decease, his widow and administratrix offered to do the same; and always has been, and still is, ready to comply with the said condition. There has therefore been no forfeiture of the estate, for there is no foundation for the argument that the will created a personal trust, which could be performed only by the said Jesse Perkins. There is nothing in the will from which such a personal trust can be inferred; and there is nothing in the condition, to be performed by Jesse Perkins, in the nature of a personal trust. The condition in favor of the testator\u2019s two sisters might unquestionably be well performed by his executor or administrator, or by his heirs and assigns. <em>Simonds </em>v. <em>Simonds, </em>3 Met. 558.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">\n<em>Judgment nisi for the demandant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
