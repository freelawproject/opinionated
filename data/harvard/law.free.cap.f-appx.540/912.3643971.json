After reviewing the record and Mr. Carter\u2019s brief, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-14\">On August 30, 2011, Mr. Carter filed a <em>pro se </em>complaint alleging that Clinton Wells Killingsworth\u2019s pest control company damaged his home by not inspecting or treating it for rot or termite damage, in violation of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2301-2312. His complaint was referred to a magistrate judge, who took judicial notice of the public docket of the Circuit Court in and for Escam-bia County, Florida. According to the state court docket, Mr. Carter sued Mr. Killingsworth in 2009 for fraud, negligence, and violation of Florida\u2019s Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act, <em>see </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 501.201 <em>et seq., </em>for the same alleged conduct. The state court granted summary judgment in Mr. Killingsworth\u2019s favor. That ruling was affirmed on appeal, and the Florida Supreme Court dismissed Mr. Carter\u2019s subsequent petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-15\">The magistrate judge recommended that Mr. Carter\u2019s complaint should be dismissed on two alternative grounds: (1) Mr. Carter failed to satisfy the $50,000.00 amount-in-controversy requirement of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2310(d); and (2) the claim was barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. The district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation in full and dismissed Mr. Carter\u2019s action for lack of jurisdiction. Mr. Carter appealed, and we affirmed on the ground that he had failed to satisfy the amount-in-controversy requirement. We did not address the alternative ground for dismissal under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>See Carter v. Killingsworth, </em>477 F.App\u2019x 647 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>On August 20, 2012, Mr. Carter filed a second pro <em>se </em>complaint with the same claim against Mr. Killingsworth, but he now alleged that a new inspection placed the total cost of repair for rot and termite damage resulting from Mr. Killingsworth\u2019s actions at $53,000.00, thereby satisfying the amount-in-controversy requirement of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2810(d). This time, the magistrate judge recommended that the district court apply the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine because Mr. Carter brought his failed state court action to a federal court for appellate review. Additionally, the magistrate judge noted that Mr. Carter could have brought his federal claim in his state court action because the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act allows plaintiffs to sue in state court. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2310(d)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">In his objection to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, Mr. Carter acknowledged that he did not prevail in state court because the state court granted summary judgment and his appeals were rejected. But he argued that there was no resolution of his state-court case because \u201cthe [entry of] summary judgment ... prevented [him] from getting [his] case settled in state court.\u201d D.E. 6 at 1. He also claimed that filing suit in federal court was his \u201clast resort.\u201d After considering Mr. Carter\u2019s objections, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and dismissed his case for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>See Casale v. Tillman, </em>558 F.3d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.2009). The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine \u201cbars federal district courts from reviewing state court decisions.\u201d <em>Nicholson v. Shafe, </em>558 F.3d 1266, 1270 (11th Cir.2009). <em>See also Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 415-16, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923); <em>Dist. of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 476, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983). This is because appellate authority over final state-court decisions rests with the Supreme Court of the United States. <em>See Doe v. Fla. Bar, </em>630 F.3d 1336, 1341 (11th Cir.2011). The doctrine applies when the \u201closing party in state court file[s] suit in federal court after the state proceedings end[ ], complaining of an injury caused by the state-court judgment and seeking review and rejection of that judgment.\u201d <em>Nicholson, </em>558 F.3d at 1273 (quoting <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 291, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005)). The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, however, does not prohibit a \u201cdistrict court from exercising subject-matter jurisdiction simply because a party attempts to litigate in federal court a matter previously litigated in state court.\u201d <em>Exxon Mobil, </em>544 U.S. at 293, 125 S.Ct. 1517. Instead, the losing party must \u201cin effect seek[] to take an appeal\u201d of a state-court decision. <em>Lance v. Dennis, </em>546 U.S. 459, 466, 126 S.Ct. 1198, 163 L.Ed.2d 1059 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine applies both to claims that were raised in the state court proceeding and those \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the state judgment. <em>See Casale, </em>558 F.3d at 1260. \u201cA claim is inextricably intertwined if it would effectively nullify the state-court judgment or it succeeds only to the extent that the state court wrongly decided the issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted). But the doctrine does not apply unless the plaintiff was given a \u201creasonable opportunity to raise his federal claim in state proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Powell v. Powell, </em>80 F.3d 464, 467 (11th Cir.1996)).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">In this case, the requirements for the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine are met. First, Mr. Carter obtained an unfavorable judgment in state court, and was unsuccessful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>in his state appeals. He even concedes that he was forced to litigate in federal court as a \u201clast resort\u201d because of the outcome of his state court proceedings, which had ended and were no longer pending when he pursued his federal action. Second, it is clear from his objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and his appellate brief that Mr. Carter desires appellate review by the district court of his state court judgment. For example, Mr. Carter has argued that \u201cthe [state court\u2019s grant of] summary judgment ... prevented [him] from getting [his] case settled in court.\u201d <em>See </em>D.E. 6 at 1. And, on appeal, Mr. Carter continues to argue that the state court\u2019s judgment denied him the opportunity to argue his case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Essentially, Mr. Carter has asked the district court to review and, hopefully, abrogate the state court summary judgment so he can prevail in federal court. The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine precludes the district court from hearing this exact type of case.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-4\">Mr. Carter nevertheless argues that his federal suit should not be dismissed because he has raised a new federal claim that was not adjudicated in state court. We disagree. First, the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act allows plaintiffs to bring claims in state court, regardless of the amount in controversy. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2310. Mr. Carter, therefore, had a reasonable opportunity to bring his federal claim in state court when he first sued Mr. Killingsworth. <em>See Casale, </em>558 F.3d at 1260. Second, Mr. Carter\u2019s federal claim is inextricably intertwined with the state court judgment. His federal claim relies on allegations that Mr. Killingsworth\u2019s company engaged in fraud and acted negligently; his claims against Mr. Killings-worth in state court were for fraud, negligence, and engaging in unfair or deceptive trade practices. Thus, in order for Mr. Carter to prevail on his federal claim, the district court would have to reject the state court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. Accordingly, we hold that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine applies to Mr. Carter\u2019s case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">In sum, the district court correctly dismissed Mr. Carter\u2019s complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b945-5\">. Mr. Carter mistakenly suggests that his claims have not been heard in state court because he did not have an opportunity to present those claims to a jury. <em>See id. </em>at 1 (\"[The magistrate said that the] MMWA authorized me to raise a claim in my state court litigation. Which state court litigation does [the magistrate] refer to? I never had a state court litigation!\u201d). The state court docket, however, shows that Mr. Carter had an opportunity to be heard. He filed a response to Mr. Killingsworth's motion for summary judgment. The state court granted summary judgment, which is an adjudication on the merits of his claims. <em>See </em>Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.510(b). And he had the right \u2014 which he exercised \u2014 to appeal that decision to Florida\u2019s First District Court of Appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b945-12\">. On appeal, Mr. Carter also argues the merits of his claim and raises a new factual issue \u2014 that the judge who granted summary judgment to the defendants in his state court case was bribed \u2014 not raised below. Because we lack subject-matter jurisdiction over this case, we do not address those arguments. <em>See Powell, </em>80 F.3d at 465, n. 1 (11th Cir.1996) (\"Because of our <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>holding, we need not address the other issues raised on appeal.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
