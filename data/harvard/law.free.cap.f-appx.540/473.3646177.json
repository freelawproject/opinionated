The district court granted summary judgment in Aetna\u2019s favor, holding that the plan administrator did not abuse its discretion in determining that Nugent was not eligible for benefits. Nugent appeals on the grounds that the plan administrator did not afford sufficient weight to the Social Security Administration\u2019s earlier determination that she is disabled and that it failed to fully evaluate some of the medical evidence. Because we find that the plan administrator\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and is neither arbitrary nor capricious, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">While working as a bookkeeper for Total Safety USA, Inc., Susan Nugent purchased a long-term disability insurance policy through her employer with Aetna Life Insurance Company. Nugent was later diagnosed with colorectal cancer, and she left her position to undergo treatment, including chemotherapy, which lasted until October 2009. Nugent filed a claim for longterm disability benefits with Aetna based on her cancer and related side-effects, including chemotherapy-induced neuropathy. Aetna\u2019s plan administrator approved her application for benefits on April 30, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">After approving her application, Aetna assisted Nugent in applying for disability insurance benefits through the Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d). On February 19, 2010, the SSA determined that Nugent was disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act as a result of the physical limitations resulting from her cancer and its treatment, and it granted her application for benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">Nugent\u2019s cancer treatment was successful. In December 2009 and March 2010, PET scans confirmed that her cancer was in remission. However, Nugent believed that she could not work due to residual side effects of her treatment, including the pain from her neuropathy and incontinence issues. As time passed, though, medical testing revealed that many of her side effects diminished. On May 10, 2011, Aet-na notified Nugent that her long-term disability benefits would be terminated because the plan administrator found that she was no longer disabled as defined by her insurance plan. The plan administrator relied on medical records evincing the improvement in her condition after the SSA awarded her benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">Nugent appealed Aetna\u2019s denial of benefits, but Aetna upheld its determination. Nugent filed this lawsuit against Aetna in federal court on January 10, 2012. The parties discovered that due to a technical error, Aetna had not received the complete SSA determination, so the parties jointly moved to resubmit the claim to Aetna. The district court granted the motion, and Aetna reconsidered the claim in light of the full SSA opinion. It issued a supplemental determination on November 5, 2012, in which it again determined that it would terminate Nugent\u2019s benefits because she was no longer disabled under the terms of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>The matter returned to district court, and the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The district court denied Nugent\u2019s motion, granted Aetna\u2019s motion, and entered judgment in Aetna\u2019s favor. It held that: the plan administrator\u2019s denial of benefits was supported by substantial medical evidence; a conflict of interest existed in the case, but there were no facts showing that this conflict should be given additional weight in reviewing the decision; and that the plan administrator properly considered the SSA award in making its determination. The district court explained that some of the medical evidence showed that Nugent\u2019s condition had improved after the SSA made its determination. Based on this evidence, the plan administrator\u2019s decision was neither arbitrary nor capricious. Nugent timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s conclusion that an Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d) plan administrator did not abuse its discretion in denying disability benefits. <em>Crowell v. Shell Oil Co., </em>541 F.3d 295, 312 (5th Cir.2008). Under this approach, we review the plan administrator\u2019s decision from the same perspective and with the same standard of review as the district court. <em>Anderson v. Cytec Indus., </em>619 F.3d 505, 512 (5th Cir.2010). When a benefits plan\u2019s terms grant the plan administrator discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or construe the terms of the plan, which it does here, we review the determination to deny benefits for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>We will affirm a plan administrator\u2019s determination to deny benefits if it is \u201csupported by substantial evidence and is not arbitrary or eapricious[.]\u201d <em>Ellis v. Liberty Life Assurance Co. of Boston, </em>394 F.3d 262, 273 (5th Cir.2004). \u201cThe fact that the evidence is disputable will not invalidate the decision; the evidence need only assure that the administrator\u2019s decision fall somewhere on the continuum of reasonableness \u2014 even if on the low end.\u201d <em>Porter v. Lowe\u2019s Cos., Inc.\u2019s Business Travel Accident Ins. Plan, </em>731 F.3d 360, 363-64 (5th Cir.2013) (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">In reviewing Aetna\u2019s decision to terminate Nugent\u2019s long-term disability benefits, we weigh several case-specific factors. <em>Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Glenn, </em>554 U.S. 105, 117, 128 S.Ct. 2343, 171 L.Ed.2d 299 (2008). Any one factor may serve \u201cas a tiebreaker when the other factors are closely balanced, the degree of closeness necessary depending upon the tiebreaking factor\u2019s inherent or case-specific importance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Factors may include the medical evidence, structural conflicts of interest, and whether the SSA has awarded benefits. <em>Schexnayder v. Hartford Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., </em>600 F.3d 465, 469-71 (5th Cir.2010). When one of the factors is an existing SSA determination finding that a claimant is disabled, the plan administrator must address the SSA\u2019s decision in its determination; failure to do so renders a determination procedurally unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 471. However, the duty to acknowledge a contrary SSA determination is not a duty to afford the determination any specific weight. A plan administrator need only consider the SSA\u2019s determination, but it may conclude that the medical evidence supporting denial is more credible. <em>Id. </em>at 471 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">On appeal, Nugent challenges the plan administrator\u2019s treatment of the SSA\u2019s February 2010 determination that she is disabled. Specifically, she argues that the administrator should have given more deference to the SSA\u2019s determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>since the definition of \u201cdisability\u201d applied by the SSA is arguably more stringent than the definition employed by Aetna. However, Nugent\u2019s argument contains two fatal flaws. First, we only require that a claim administrator address a contrary decision as a factor. Nugent urges us to give the SSA\u2019s decision more weight because of her belief that its definition of disability is arguably harder to meet. Without opining on whether the SSA\u2019s definition is more or less stringent than the definition of disability in Nugent\u2019s plan, Nugent\u2019s proposed treatment of the SSA determination is contrary to this circuit\u2019s clear requirement that the plan administrator need not afford the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions any special deference. <em>Id. </em>The ultimate weight afforded the determination is case-specific and depends on the balancing of the competing factors. Aetna discussed the SSA determination, so its decision is not procedurally unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Second, Nugent\u2019s fixation on the meaning of \u201cdisability\u201d suggests that Aet-na ultimately afforded the SSA determination little weight because of the technical differences between Aetna\u2019s and the SSA\u2019s definitions. This characterization is incorrect. Aetna\u2019s decision not to give the SSA\u2019s determination weight stemmed largely from the fact that it was based on outdated medical records. According to Aetna, medical evaluations of Nugent following the SSA\u2019s determination in February 2010 revealed that Nugent\u2019s cancer was in remission and her neurological symptoms had lessened. Nugent argues that Aetna has not pointed to any medical records that would support this conclusion, but the record contains PET scans from 2009 and 2010, which reveal that her cancer was in remission; several \u201cbenign\u201d and \u201cnormal\u201d neurological exams between February 2010 and May 2011; an EMG study from December 2010 that was \u201cnormal\u201d and revealed no evidence of neuropathy, plexopathy or radiculopathy; and numerous \u201cnormal\u201d examinations by her primary care physician. Furthermore, in April 11, 2011, a neurologist performed a peer review of the medical record and opined that there was no objective evidence that Nu-gent had any functional impairments that would preclude work. Thus, Nugent\u2019s suggestion that the plan administrator dismissed the SSA\u2019s determination solely based on the difference in the definitions of \u201cdisability\u201d ignores the fact that there was ample evidence in the record to show that the SSA\u2019s determination no longer reflected Nugent\u2019s physical limitations as of May 2011. Given the change in Nu-gent\u2019s condition, we find no error in the plan administrator\u2019s evaluation and consideration of the SSA opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Nugent only vaguely challenges Aetna\u2019s determination that the record demonstrates an improvement in her medical condition between February 2010 and May 2011. She argues that Aetna failed to fully consider three documents that support her claim that she experiences neuropathy and cannot work. However, Nugent does not claim that this evidence is so persuasive as to overwhelm the contrary medical evidence and render the plan administrator\u2019s decision unreasonable. As the district court correctly noted, these medical documents make Aetna\u2019s determination debatable but not arbitrary and capricious. Since Nugent does not expressly challenge the sufficiency of the medical evidence supporting the plan administrator\u2019s decision to terminate her benefits, we will not consider it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">For the aforementioned reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b504-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
