Hayward\u2019s pro se motion for the appointment of a new appellate attorney is DENIED. Hayward\u2019s motion to file an out of time reply to the Government\u2019s Brief is GRANTED. However, we have reviewed the merits of Hayward\u2019s pro se reply brief and for the reasons stated below, AFFIRM the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-21\">Hayward argues that the district court clearly erred in holding her responsible for an intended loss of over $400,000 and that the court should have granted her a reduction in offense level for acceptance of responsibility. She contends that the court erred by rejecting her testimony that she did not intend to negotiate all of the stolen and counterfeit checks found in her apartment. The sentencing court\u2019s estimate of the amount of intended loss in this case was reasonable in light of the evidence, and does not amount to clear error. <em>United States v. Harris, </em>597 F.3d 242, 250-51 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-22\">The court rejected Hayward\u2019s sentencing testimony regarding the amount of intended loss and adopted the findings contained in the Presentence Report, including that she had falsely denied or frivolously contested relevant conduct. Thus, the court\u2019s decision to deny a reduction in offense level for acceptance of responsibility is not \u201cwithout foundation.\u201d <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number><em>States v.
