Ramirez contends that the district court\u2019s imposition of a two-year term of supervised release was procedurally and substantively unreasonable in light of a sentencing guidelines provision and related commentary which state that a \u201ccourt ordinarily should not impose a term of supervised release ... [on] a deportable alien[,]\u201d unless \u201csupervised release ... would provide an added measure of deterrence and protection based on the facts and circumstances of a particular case.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 5Dl.l(c) &amp; cmt. n. 5. He further maintains that the imposition of a term of supervised release was substantively unreasonable because this was his first illegal reentry conviction, because his criminal history was minor, and because he is unlikely to return to the United States because most of his family resides in Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-24\">To preserve the argument, Ramirez asserts that the district court\u2019s imposition of a supervised release term constituted a departure from the guidelines sentence range and that advance notice of the departure was required. As Ramirez correctly concedes, his argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d 324, 329 (5th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-25\">As Ramirez challenges the imposition of the term of supervised release for the first time on appeal, we review his claims for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d 324, 327 (5th Cir.2012) (procedural reasonableness); <em>see United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007) (substantive reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>ableness). Ramirez maintains that his substantive unreasonableness claims should not be subject to plain error review to preserve the argument for further review. As Ramirez concedes, this argument is foreclosed by <em>Peltier.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Under the plain error standard, Ramirez must show a clear or obvious forfeited error that affected his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135-86, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If Ramirez makes such a showing, we have discretion to correct the error but should do so \u201conly if the error seriously affeet[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Although the district court did not explain why it was imposing a term of supervised release, it expressly adopted, without objection, the findings and applications in the presentence report, which specifically referenced the guidelines provisions applicable to supervised release. The presen-tence report stated in part: \u201cPursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.1, the Court ordinarily should not impose a term of supervised release in a case in which supervised release is not required by statute and the defendant is a deportable alien who likely will be deported after imprisonment.\u201d There is no indication that if the district court had been required to give reasons, it would have concluded that a term of supervised release was not warranted. <em>See United States v. Cancino-Trinidad, </em>710 F.3d 601, 607 (5th Cir.2013). Furthermore, Ramirez cannot show that any error, if left uncorrected, would seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423; <em>see also Cancino-Trinidad, </em>710 F.3d at 607 n. 11. Accordingly, he has not shown, under the applicable plain error standard, that the district court committed reversible procedural error by failing to provide an adequate explanation of its decision to order a term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">Ramirez\u2019s assertion that the district court committed substantive error by failing to account for \u00a7 5Dl.l(c) is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness applicable to Ramirez\u2019s within-guidelines term of supervised release. <em>See Cancino-Trinidad, </em>710 F.3d at 607-08. Likewise, Ramirez\u2019s factual assertions regarding his criminal history and his personal circumstances are insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness, and he has not shown substantive plain error. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 339 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b404-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
