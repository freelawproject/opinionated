Estrada seeks to challenge the reasonableness of his sentence. He implicitly acknowledges that the argument he seeks to raise is barred by the appeal waiver in his plea agreement. He argues that he did not knowingly and voluntarily enter into the appeal waiver because a defendant cannot knowingly and voluntarily waive his right to appeal a sentence prior to the sentence being imposed. He concedes that this argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent, but he requests that this court reexamine and overturn this precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-22\">The Government has moved for summary affirmance of this case based on the appeal waiver in the plea agreement. The record shows that Estrada knowingly and voluntarily agreed to the appeal waiver, making the appeal waiver enforceable. <em>See United States v. McKinney, </em>406 F.3d 744, 746 (5th Cir.2005). As the argument Estrada seeks to raise on appeal does not fall within the exceptions to the appeal waiver, his appeal is barred by the appeal waiver. <em>See United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544 (5th Cir.2005). As Estrada concedes, this court has rejected his argument that a defendant cannot knowingly and voluntarily waive his right to appeal a sentence prior to the sentence being imposed, and this court has held that \u201cthe uncertainty of Appellant\u2019s sentence does not render his waiver uninformed.\u201d <em>United States v. Melancon, </em>972 F.2d 566, 567-68 (5th Cir.1992). While Estrada asserts that we should reconsider the holding in <em>Melancon, </em>we may not overrule the decision of another panel absent a superseding en banc or Supreme Court decision. <em>United States v. Lipscomb, </em>299 F.3d 303, 313 &amp; n. 34 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-23\">The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED. The Government\u2019s alternative motion to extend the time to file its brief is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b455-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
