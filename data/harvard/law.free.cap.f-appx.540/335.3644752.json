Castillo asserts that he is actually innocent of the relevant conduct used to ascertain the pertinent drug quantity for sentencing purposes, that he should be held responsible for only the 500 grams alleged in the indictment, and that he is entitled to immediate release. The district court concluded that Castillo\u2019s claims were more properly raised under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and dismissed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-22\">As a general rule, a federal prisoner who seeks to collaterally challenge the legality of his conviction or sentence must file a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 426-27 (5th Cir.2005). Such claims may be raised in a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) only if the prisoner shows that the \u00a7 2255 remedy is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d \u00a7 2255(e). Castillo has not made such a showing, as he has not established that his claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision establishing that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense. <em>See Padilla, </em>416 F.3d at 426-27; <em>Wesson v. U.S. Penitentiary Beaumont, TX, </em>305 F.3d 343, 348 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Reyes-Re</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number><em>quena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). Because Castillo is not entitled to relief, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b365-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
