He received a 13-month prison sentence to be followed by three years of supervised release. Hernandez-Lobaton has appealed, contending that the district court did not adequately explain its reasons for imposing supervised release and failed to account for the advice in the Sentencing Guidelines that deporta-ble aliens ordinarily should not be sentenced to terms of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-22\">Because Hernandez-Lobaton has been released from prison and deported to Mexico, however, his appeal is moot, <em>see United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 383 (5th Cir.2007), and accordingly is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b349-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
