His sole claim on appeal is that his sentence is substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Because Chavez-Aldaba does not contend that the district court committed any procedural error in imposing the sentence, our review is confined to whether the sentence is substantively reasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), sentences are ordinarily reviewed for substantive reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>619 F.3d 469, 471-72 (5th Cir.2010). Because Chavez-Aldaba failed to challenge the reasonableness of his sentence on the same grounds that he raises on appeal, however, we review the substantive reasonableness of his sentence for plain error. <em>See United States v. Dunigan, </em>555 F.3d 501, 506 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Chavez-Aldaba argues that the illegal reentry Guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2\u2014 which he contends has had a \u201cproblematic development\u201d \u2014 double-counted his criminal history and overstated the seriousness of his illegal reentry offense, resulting in a guidelines range that was greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals of \u00a7 3553(a). Any argument that \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009). Further, we have repeatedly rejected the arguments that a sentence imposed pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2 is greater than necessary to meet \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s goals as a result of any double counting inherent in that Guideline, <em>see id. </em>at 529-31, and that \u00a7 2L1.2 overstates the seriousness of illegal reentry because it is an international trespass offense, <em>see United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006). In addition, although Chavez-Alda-ba contends that there were mitigating factors for his reentry into the United States, the district court did not fail to take those factors into account.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Accordingly, because we find no error, plain or otherwise, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b485-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
