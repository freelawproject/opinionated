He argues that his sentence should be vacated and the case remanded so that the district court may conform the written judgment to its oral pronouncement by removing a special condition of supervision requiring him to participate in a mental health program and assist in the cost of the treatment. The Government asserts that there is no conflict between the written judgment and the oral pronouncement of sentence and that consideration of the issue is barred by a waiver provision in Cao\u2019s plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-25\">It is unnecessary to address the waiver issue because the Government is correct that there is no conflict between the district court\u2019s oral pronouncement and its written judgment. <em>See United States v. Vega, </em>332 F.3d 849, 852 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-26\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b452-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
