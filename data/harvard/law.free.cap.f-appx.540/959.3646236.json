Be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>cause the district court abused its discretion when it denied Su\u2019s motion, which argued that the district court applied an incorrect legal standard in denying the application, we vacate the order denying Su\u2019s motion for relief and remand with instructions for the district court to reconsider Su\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">Su filed a complaint against Florida International University and Bowling Green State University and an application to proceed in forma pauperis. The district court denied Su\u2019s application on the ground that it was \u201cwithout sufficient funds to finance the prosecution of civil litigants.\u201d Su then paid his filing fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">Su moved for relief from the order denying his application. Su challenged the determination that budgetary restraints prevented him from proceeding without the prepayment of fees and requested \u201cleave to proceed in forma pauperis.\u201d Su submitted a letter from the Clerk stating that \u201c[t]here was no set amount of funding for IFP applications\u201d and the decision \u201c[w]hether petitions are granted or not does not depend upon available funding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">The district court denied Su\u2019s motion. <em>See id. </em>The district court ruled that Su \u201cproduced no ... evidence\u201d that he would \u201csuffer a substantial injustice\u201d from having his application denied because he was able to \u201cborrow the $350 filing fee.\u201d The district court stated that it had \u201cbroad discretion to deny an application to proceed without prepayment,\u201d and it rejected as \u201cirrelevant\u201d Baker\u2019s argument about \u201c[t]he frequency with which ... applications [had been] granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">We review the denial of a motion for relief from a judgment for an abuse of discretion. <em>Rice v. Ford Motor Co., </em>88 F.3d 914, 918 (11th Cir.1996). An abuse of discretion occurs when the district court \u201capplies an incorrect legal standard, follows improper procedures in making the determination, ... makes findings of fact that are clearly erroneous ... [or] applies] the law in an unreasonable or incorrect manner.\u201d <em>Klay v. Humana, Inc., </em>382 F.3d 1241, 1251 (11th Cir.2004). A party may move for relief from a judgment for \u201cany ... reason that justifies relief,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(6), and that motion \u201cis to be given a liberal and remedial construction,\u201d <em>Nisson v. Lundy, </em>975 F.2d 802, 807 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">The district court abused its discretion when it denied Su\u2019s motion for relief. Su argued that the district court applied an incorrect legal standard in determining that the right to proceed without the prepayment of costs was \u201cdependent] upon available funding.\u201d When a district court considers an application to proceed in for-ma pauperis, \u201c[t]he only determination to be made ... is whether the statements in the affidavit satisfy the requirement of poverty.\u201d <em>Martinez v. Kristi Kleaners, Inc., </em>364 F.3d 1305, 1307 (11th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Watson v. Ault, </em>525 F.2d 886, 891 (5th Cir.1976)). And Su\u2019s argument is not moot based on his payment of the filing fee because a litigant who proceeds in forma pauperis is entitled to other benefits in addition to the waiver of a filing fee, like having process and subpoenas served by officers of the court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d). Because the district court applied the wrong standard when ruling on Su\u2019s application, we vacate the order that denied Su\u2019s motion for relief and remand for the district court to reconsider Su\u2019s application. On remand, the district court should determine whether Su satisfied the poverty requirement and \u201cprovide a sufficient explanation for its determination on IFP status to allow for meaningful appellate review.\u201d <em>Martinez, </em>364 F.3d at 1307.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-10\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
