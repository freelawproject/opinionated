The district court indicated that the 48-month sentence of imprisonment was a variance from the guidelines range of 18-24 months of imprisonment and that, in the alternative, the sentence was a departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-24\">Attacking the sentence as a departure, Bail\u00f3n contends that the district court erred by failing to make findings required under \u00a7 5K2.0(a)(3). It is unnecessary to consider whether the district court erred in imposing a departure because, as discussed below, the sentence may be affirmed as an upward variance. <em>See United States v. Bonilla, </em>524 F.3d 647, 656-59 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Mejia-Huerta, </em>480 F.3d 713, 723 &amp; n. 43 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-25\">Bail\u00f3n asserts that the district court abused its discretion by both (1) finding that a sentence in excess of 24 months would be greater than necessary to achieve the statutory purposes of sentencing and (2) imposing a 48-month sentence. He contends that, by operation of statute, spe-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>eifieally 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(b), the establishment of a guidelines range entails a determination that a sentence above that range is greater than necessary to achieve the goals of sentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8553(a). Relying on <em>Koon v. United States, </em>518 U.S. 81, 100, 116 S.Ct. 2085, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996), Bailon argues that the district court reached an erroneous legal conclusion when it determined that a 24-month sentence was greater than necessary and yet, by imposing a 48-month sentence, also determined that a sentence greater than 24 months was not greater than necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 245, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), which rendered the guidelines range \u201ceffectively advisory,\u201d this court identified three types of sentences that a district court could impose: (1) a sentence within the guidelines range; (2) a \u201cdeparture\u201d based on the Guidelines, and (3) a non-guidelines sentence or \u201cvariance\u201d outside the guidelines range and based on \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2008). As we noted above, the district court characterized Bailon\u2019s sentence as an upward variance or, in the alternative, an upward departure. As a variance, the sentence imposed by the district court was authorized under this court\u2019s jurisprudence and does not represent an abuse of discretion merely because it was above the advisory guideline range. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Further, although the district court adopted the presentence report (PSR), in doing so it did not indicate that it was making a determination that a sentence of no more than 24 months \u2014 the top of the guidelines range \u2014 would be sufficient to satisfy the sentencing objectives of \u00a7 3553(a). Indeed, the district court stated at sentencing that it was adopting the conclusions set forth in the PSR as modified or supplemented by any conclusions expressed from the bench. The district court went on at sentencing to express its determination that a sentence of 48 months of imprisonment was necessary to address the sentencing considerations of \u00a7 3553(a), and it explained at length its decision to upwardly vary from the guidelines range with references to Bailon\u2019s extensive criminal history and his multiple illegal reentries into the United States after removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Bail\u00f3n fails to establish that the district court reached an erroneous legal conclusion or that there was reversible error in the imposition of a non-Guidelines sentence. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b441-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
