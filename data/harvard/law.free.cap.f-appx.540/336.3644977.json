Watson asserts that his motion to reopen based on his eligibility for adjustment of status was not untimely since the time and numerical limitations do not apply to his proceedings, which were commenced prior to June 18, 1992 under former Immigration and Nationality Act \u00a7 242(b), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b). He asserts that the BIA\u2019s invocation of its <em>sua sponte </em>authority and subsequent denial of his motion to reconsider contradicts this courts\u2019s holding in <em>Rodriguez-Manzano v. Holder, </em>666 F.3d 948 (5th Cir.2012). In accordance with <em>Avilez-Granados v. Gonzales, </em>481 F.3d 869 (5th Cir.2007), Watson contends that his case should be remanded to the BIA for an adjudication of his application for adjustment of status since he has never had the opportunity to have it considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">The decision to deny a motion for reconsideration is within the discretion of the BIA. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). The motion for reconsideration must identify a legal or factual error in the BIA\u2019s prior decision and must be supported by relevant authority. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration under a highly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>See Lara v. Trominski </em>216 F.3d 487, 496-97 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-14\">Watson did not file his motion to reopen seeking adjustment of status until November 20, 2002. This motion did not seek reopening to vacate his in absentia deportation order. Thus, as the immigration judge and the BIA found, his motion was untimely. <em>See Matter of M-S-, </em>22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 349, 356-57 (1998); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c); \u00a7 1003.23(b)(1); <em>see also Jeon v. Holder, </em>354 Fed.Appx. 50, 53-54 (5th Cir.2009). Therefore, the only way the BIA could have reopened his proceedings was via its <em>sua sponte </em>authority. <em>See Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, </em>543 F.3d 216, 219-20 (5th Cir.2008); <em>Rodriguez-Manzano, </em>666 F.3d at 952 &amp; n. 3. To the extent Watson seeks review of the BIA\u2019s decision not to invoke its <em>sua sponte </em>authority, this court lacks jurisdiction. <em>See Ramos-Bonilla, </em>543 F.3d at 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-16\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Watson\u2019s motion for reconsideration. <em>See Lara, </em>216 F.3d at 496-97. Accordingly, his petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b367-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
