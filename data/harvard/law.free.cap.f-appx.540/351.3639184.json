California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and <em>United States v. Flores, </em>632 F.3d 229 (5th Cir.2011). We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant record re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>fleeted therein. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for appellate review with regard to the issues directly addressed in counsel\u2019s brief. However, counsel\u2019s brief fails to address the sentencing court\u2019s erroneous consideration of defendant\u2019s thirteen unadjudicated arrests, which were unaccompanied by a factual recitation of the underlying conduct. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>648 F.3d 273, 277-78 (5th Cir.2011) (finding that a sentencing court commits error when it considers the defendant\u2019s \u201cbare arrest record.\u201d). <em>See also United States v. Harris, </em>702 F.3d 226, 231 (5th Cir.2012) <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1845, 185 L.Ed.2d 850 (2013) (\u201cIf the factual recitation lacks sufficient indicia of reliability, then it is error for the district court to consider it at sentencing \u2014 regardless of whether the defendant objects or offers rebuttal evidence.\u201d). After review of the relevant portions of the record, we find that the district court may have committed reversible error when imposing a mid-guideline sentence based in part on its consideration of the defendant\u2019s bare arrest record contained in the Presentence Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">We do not decide today whether Flores will be able to establish, under plain error review, that the district court\u2019s error was clear or obvious and affected Flores\u2019 substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). However, when considering counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw under <em>Anders, </em>this Court does not have to find that the Appellant will necessarily prevail on the merits of his appeal; rather the panel must consider whether the appeal may present a non-frivolous argument. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>291 F.Appx 563, 567 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Accordingly, counsel is directed to file supplemental briefing under <em>Anders </em>to address this issue, or in the alternative, file a merits brief. Counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is DENIED, subject to our reconsideration of counsel\u2019s supplemental briefing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Flores\u2019 pro se motion for an extension of time to file a response to counsel\u2019s <em>Anders </em>brief is DENIED AS MOOT, subject to counsel\u2019s supplemental filing, and may be reasserted in response to counsel\u2019s further briefing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b381-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
