Silva argues that his sentences are greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He specifically contends that the guidelines sentencing range was too severe because the district court failed to consider that his reentry offense was at bottom a mere trespass and did not consider his benign motive for returning. Additionally, Silva contends that his sentences are not entitled to a presumption of correctness because the illegal reentry Guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, is not empirically based, given that it double-counts a defendant\u2019s criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-22\">We review sentences for substantive reasonableness, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). As he concedes, Silva\u2019s empirical data argument is foreclosed by this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 360 (5th Cir.2009). We have rejected the argument that a guidelines sentence under \u00a7 2L1.2 is unreasonable because illegal reentry is a mere trespass offense. <em>See United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Furthermore, Silva\u2019s sentences, which are at the bottom of the applicable guidelines range, are presumed reasonable. <em>See United States v. Newson, </em>515 F.3d 374, 379 (5th Cir.2008). His general disagreement with the propriety of his sentences and the district court\u2019s weighing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to a within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d at 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Silva has not demonstrated that the district court abused its discretion by sentencing him to within-guidelines sentences of 41 months in prison. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Consequently, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b371-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
