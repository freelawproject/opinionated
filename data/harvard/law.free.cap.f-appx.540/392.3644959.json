McLaughlin on his claims of deliberate indifference to serious medical needs. Gonzalez\u2019s claims amount to a disagreement with the medical care he received, which is not actionable under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). <em>See Gobert v. Caldwell, </em>463 F.3d 339, 346 (5th Cir.2006). Gonzalez has abandoned all other claims by failing to brief them adequately. <em>See Mapes v. Bishop, </em>541 F.3d 582, 584 (5th Cir.2008); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-21\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. McLaughlin\u2019s motion for summary affirmance and his alternative motion for an extension of time to file a brief are DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b422-19\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
