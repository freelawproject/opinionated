Prior to his guilty plea, South-erland moved unsuccessfully to dismiss his indictment on the ground that Congress improperly delegated to the Attorney General the power to decide whether SOR-NA\u2019s registration requirements applied to sex offenders, like Southerland, who were convicted before SORNA went into effect. In his plea agreement, Southerland reserved the right to raise this issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-22\">We have addressed and rejected previous challenges to SORNA based on the nondelegation doctrine. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>632 F.3d 912, 917 (5th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Whaley, </em>577 F.3d 254, 262-64 (5th Cir.2009). Southerland recognizes our precedent, but urges that <em>Reynolds v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 975, 181 L.Ed.2d 935 (2012), calls into question its continued applicability. <em>Reynolds, </em>however, did not explicitly or implicitly overrule <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Whaley; </em>accordingly, we are bound by those decisions. <em>See United States v. Short, </em>181 F.3d 620, 624 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-25\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b437-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
