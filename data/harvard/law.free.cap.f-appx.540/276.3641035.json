Missouri, </em>439 U.S. 357, 364, 99 S.Ct. 664, 58 L.Ed.2d 579 (1979); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>264 F.3d 561, 568 (5th Cir.2001). Likewise, while he claims that the district court abused its discretion by limiting his Confrontation Clause rights to cross-examine Government witnesses, he fails to cite any evidence showing that he was clearly prejudiced by the limitations of which he complains. <em>See United States v. Landerman, </em>109 F.3d 1053, 1061 (5th Cir.1997). Finally, Moreno does not identify with specificity any instance in which the district court refused to admit into evidence the criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>conviction of any Government witness. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b306-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
