He argues that the district court erred by providing in the written judgment that he was convicted of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>being an alien unlawfully present in the United States following removal subsequent to a conviction for an aggravated felony because none of his prior convictions were aggravated felony convictions. He does not challenge his guilty plea or his sentence, and he requests only that the case be remanded to the district court for reformation of the written judgment or that we reform the written judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">As the Government concedes, Garcia\u2019s prior conviction for aggravated arson was not an aggravated felony conviction because he was sentenced to less than one year of imprisonment for that offense. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 368-69 (5th Cir.2009). His other prior convictions for bail jumping and disorderly conduct were also not aggravated felony convictions. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43). Accordingly, Garcia\u2019s conviction was properly under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1), not \u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">While the written judgment identifies Garcia\u2019s conviction as being under \u00a7 1326(a) and (b) without specifying the subsection of \u00a7 1326(b), the written judgment states that the offense was being an \u201cAlien Unlawfully Found in the United States After Deportation, Having Been Previously Convicted of an Aggravated Felony.\u201d The written judgment is REFORMED to provide that the offense was being an \u201cAlien Unlawfully Found in the United States After Deportation Having Been Previously Convicted of a Felony.\u201d As reformed, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b407-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
