The district court sentenced him to 46 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. Leonardo has appealed, contending that the district court did not adequately explain its reasons for imposing supervised release and that the imposition of a term of supervised release does not advance the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-20\">Because Leonardo has been released from prison and deported to Guatemala, however, his appeal is moot, <em>see United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 383 (5th Cir.2007), and accordingly is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b310-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
