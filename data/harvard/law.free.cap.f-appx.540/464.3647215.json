The district court concluded that the probative value of the evidence of the \u201cremarkably similar\u201d prior suits, together with evidence of potentially fraudulent activity associated therewith, substantially outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice. We need not decide whether the district court erred in admitting the evidence because even if the court erred, the error was harmless. There was substantial other evidence weighing against Brown\u2019s credibility and in favor of the jury\u2019s verdict for Sport Clips.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-23\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b494-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
