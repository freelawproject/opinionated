Jackson, Texas prisoner # 667808, has filed a motion to obtain a trial transcript at the Government\u2019s expense to appeal a judgment dismissing his claim of excessive force against defendant Jacob W. Douglas in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict. He alleges that the transcript is necessary for him to pursue his appeal and that he cannot pay for the transcript. Jackson contends that Douglas\u2019s counsel provided misleading information to the jury at trial by remarking on the extent of Jackson\u2019s injuries and describing them as \u201cminor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b434-15\">To obtain a transcript at government expense, Jackson must satisfy the criteria of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 753(f). <em>See Harvey v. Andrist, </em>754 F.2d 569, 571 (5th Cir.1985). Section 753(f) provides, in part, that the United States shall pay the fees for transcripts furnished in civil proceedings to persons permitted to appeal in forma pau-peris (IFP) if the trial judge or a circuit judge certifies that the appeal is not frivolous but presents a substantial question. \u00a7 753(f). The moving party must also establish that the transcript is necessary for proper disposition of the appeal. <em>Harvey, </em>754 F.2d at 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-18\">The district court granted Jackson leave to appeal IFP but denied his motion for the production of a transcript at the Government\u2019s expense. Jackson has not alleged a particularized need for the jury-trial transcript or shown that his appeal is not frivolous and presents a substantial question. Accordingly, he has not satisfied his burden for obtaining a transcript at government expense. <em>See </em>\u00a7 753(f); <em>Harvey, </em>754 F.2d at 571. Therefore, his motion is denied, and the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-19\">The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Jackson is cautioned that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-20\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b434-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
