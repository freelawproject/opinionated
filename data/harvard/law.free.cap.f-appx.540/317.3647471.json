Saleem was convicted by a jury of two counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm. As to both counts, Saleem was sentenced to a total of 33 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. Saleem contends that the evidence failed to establish that he \u201cever exercised possession, dominion or control over a firearm\u201d on the dates alleged in the superseding indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">Saleem moved for a directed verdict based on insufficient evidence at the close of the Government\u2019s case, but did not renew his motion at the close of all the evidence. Therefore, the sufficiency of the evidence is reviewed for a manifest miscarriage of justice. <em>See United States v. Salazar, </em>542 F.3d 139, 142 (5th Cir.2008). This court will reverse only if \u201cthe record is devoid of evidence of guilt or ... the evidence is so tenuous that a conviction is shocking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). To convict a defendant of the offense of felon in possession of a firearm, the Government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant previously was convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that he possessed a firearm, and that the firearm traveled in or affected interstate commerce. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Saleem stipulated to being a convicted felon and that the firearm traveled in or affected interstate commerce. Thus, the only issue at trial, as well as on appeal, was the element of possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-12\">The record is not devoid of evidence establishing Saleem\u2019s guilt. Agent Steve McKanna testified that he observed Sa-leem pointing a firearm at another individual on April 26, 2011. Similarly, Larry Myles testified that Saleem pointed a firearm at him on November 23, 2011. In both instances, Saleem had actual possession of the firearm. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>484 F.3d 783, 787 (5th Cir.2007). To the extent Saleem challenges the sufficiency of the evidence by attacking the Government\u2019s witnesses\u2019 credibility, his argument is without merit. <em>See United States v. Polk, </em>56 F.3d 613, 620 (5th Cir.1995). When viewed in the light most favorable to the jury\u2019s verdict, the evidence is sufficient to uphold Saleem\u2019s convictions for felon in possession of a firearm. <em>See Salazar, </em>542 F.3d at 142-43. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b348-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
