Benefits were denied both in the administrative process at the Social Security Administration and after first-level judicial review by the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-20\">We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-21\">On February 7, 2011, an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) conducted a hearing on Lafleur\u2019s claim and then denied benefits. The Social Security Administration\u2019s Appeals Council affirmed. The Council\u2019s decision constitutes the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration\u2019s final decision. Lafleur appeals from the district court\u2019s affirmance of the Commissioner\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-22\">Lafleur seeks reversal based on the argument that the ALJ\u2019s residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) finding was not supported by substantial evidence. Lafleur\u2019s argument is based on three claimed errors, and we will discuss each.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>The parties agree that Lafleur has \u201cdegenerative disc disease\u201d and \u201ccarpal tunnel syndrome\u201d and was previously employed as a hotel front desk clerk. The question is whether Lafleur\u2019s conditions are sufficiently debilitating as to entitle her to an award of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Judicial review of a denial of Social Security benefits \u201cis limited to whether the decision was supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Fields v. Bowen, </em>805 F.2d 1168, 1169 (5th Cir.1986). Substantial evidence \u201cis more than a mere scintilla and less than a preponderance. A finding of no substantial evidence is appropriate only if no credible evidentiary choices or medical findings support the decision.\u201d <em>Boyd v. Apfel, </em>239 F.3d 698, 704 (5th Cir.2001). In making this determination we \u201cscrutinize the record in its entirety.\u201d <em>Fields, </em>805 F.2d at 1169. Eligibility for benefits is evaluated under a five-step process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">(1) Is the claimant currently working? (2) Can the impairment be classified as \u201cnon-severe\u201d? (3) Does the impairment meet the duration requirement of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A) and is it listed, or medically equivalent to, an impairment in Appendix 1? (4) Can the claimant perform her past relevant work? and (5) Can the claimant perform any other gainful job?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 1170.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">The ALJ denied benefits at step four, which concerns whether Lafleur could still perform past relevant work. The ALJ found that Lafleur could return to her previous work as a hotel front desk clerk. Lafleur has the initial burden of demonstrating her inability to perform her prior work. <em>See id. </em>at 1169-70. Lafleur seeks to show she carried her evidentiary burden both by contending there were errors in the RFC finding and by emphasizing the importance of certain limitations that were found to exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">One complained-of omission was that she should have been given an RFC limitation on looking down. Dr. George Smith testified at the administrative hearing that Lafleur \u201cwould have difficulty looking down on a persistent basis without the ability to change positions.\u201d Smith also testified Lafleur would \u201c[p]robably do better ... not having to change the position of her head and neck\u201d in doing computer work.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">There is contrary evidence in the record that supports the absence of this limitation. The state\u2019s medical consultant, Dr. Charles Lee, did not indicate any restrictions with respect to looking down. Also, Lafleur\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Vikram Parmar, found after two examinations that although Lafleur had \u201csevere neck tenderness .... [s]he can touch her chin to her chest. She can hyperextend her neck....\u201d For these determinations, the most weight is given to treating physicians such as Dr. Parmar, who have the greatest degree of familiarity with a patient\u2019s medical conditions. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927(c)(2). Less weight is given to the testimony of physicians who perform consultative examinations, such as Dr. Lee, and still less weight to testimony based on a review of medical records, such as the testimony of Dr. Smith. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-12\">The ALJ indicated she considered the opinion evidence \u201cin accordance with the requirements of\u2019 this and companion Social Security regulations. The ALJ also indicated she considered other medical evidence \u201cbased on the requirements of\u2019 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.929 and made a credibility finding that Lafleur\u2019s statements regarding \u201cthe intensity, persistence, and limiting effects\u201d of her symptoms were not credible insofar as they went beyond the RFC finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-13\">ALJs are required to \u201ctake into consideration all of the evidence from the treat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>ing doctors.\u201d <em>Myers v. Apfel, </em>238 F.3d 617, 621 (5th Cir.2001). The ALJ did so, and the record contains credible medical evidence upon which the ALJ could have relied to omit a finding as to limitations on looking down.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Lafleur also complains that the RFC found a limitation for overhead lifting but no limitation on overhead reaching. The RFC stated that Lafleur could perform \u201clight work ... except no overhead lifting and standing and walking for thirty minutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">After a review of medical records and consultative examination, Dr. Lee concluded that Lafleur did have a limitation in \u201c[r]eaching in all directions (including overhead).\u201d On the other hand, Dr. Par-mar, Lafleur\u2019s treating physician, indicated in treatment notes after two separate examinations, that Lafleur \u201chas 5/5 [normal] strength in the bilateral upper extremities\u201d and \u201cnormal light touch\u201d in those extremities. Earlier treatment notes state that Lafleur had \u201cfull range of motion and no restriction [in] movement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Dr. Smith testified at the hearing that Lafleur \u201cwould have difficulty in working overhead,\u201d but did not expound upon the nature or extent of this difficulty. Among the items of evidence on which Dr. Smith relied was Dr. Parmar\u2019s notes indicating \u201ca good range of motion of her cervical spine, really at that time was not having much [pain] in either extremity\u201d and evidence that Lafleur was \u201cimproving with [physical therapy] treatments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">The ALJ opinion reveals that the opinions of Drs. Smith, Parmar, and Lee were considered, and noted \u201cconsideration of the entire case record\u201d and \u201ccareful consideration of the evidence.\u201d We have already quoted the ALJ as stating she weighed opinion evidence in accordance with 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.927(c)(l)-(2), which would give more weight to the opinions of Dr. Parmar, a treating physician. Considering this testimony and other medical evidence in the record, there was substantial evidence to support the omission of an overhead reaching limitation in Lafleur\u2019s RFC. <em>See Myers, </em>238 F.3d at 621.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">Based on an RFC finding that omitted any looking-down or reaching-up limitation but included one for overhead lifting, the ALJ found that Lafleur could return to her past work as a hotel clerk. Lafleur argues that this finding is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\">At the hearing, the ALJ asked vocational expert Beverly Majors <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to assume a hypothetical individual who \u201chas no overhead lifting or downward looking [ability] and must alternate sit, stand and walk 30 minutes.\u201d The expert was asked to state an opinion about that individual\u2019s ability to work as a hotel desk clerk. This hypothetical \u201creasonably incorporated the disabilities recognized by the ALJ.\u201d <em>See Morris v. Bowen, </em>864 F.2d 333, 336 (5th Cir.1988). The hypothetical even gave Lafleur the benefit of the doubt, assuming a limitation for looking down although the ALJ did not find Lafleur was limited in this respect. The question was not \u201ctoo abstract to reflect [Lafleur]\u2019s particular disabilities\u201d and, prior to answering, Majors clarified an aspect of the question with the ALJ. <em>See id. </em>Further, Lafleur \u201chad an opportunity to correct any defect in the hypothetical by mentioning additional limitations to the vocational expert.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Majors and La-fleur engaged in a short colloquy during which time Lafleur had the opportunity to speak.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Lafleur argues that because the RFC findings underlying the hypothetical were in error, the finding of ability to return to past work which relied on the vocational expert\u2019s answer to the hypothetical, was also in error, or not supported by substantial evidence. Yet, Lafleur\u2019s premise\u2014 that the hypothetical question was flawed \u2014 incorrectly assumes the ALJ was obligated to find Lafleur was limited in her ability to reach overhead. As we have discussed above, substantial evidence supports the omission of such a limitation. In addition, we have not been pointed to any record evidence that Lafleur\u2019s prior work involved overhead work of any kind.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">The description of the hotel clerk job in section 238.367-038 of the Dictionary of Occupational Titles includes telephone, computer, and other clerical work, but does not indicate that any overhead work is a component of the job. The descriptions of Lafleur\u2019s past work in the record, including the descriptions provided by La-fleur at the hearing, similarly do not evidence an overhead work component to the job. Majors testified that Lafleur\u2019s position was largely \u201csedentary,\u201d with Lafleur \u201csitting six hours\u201d and \u201c[t]he heaviest weight lifted was two pounds.\u201d Lafleur\u2019s description of the job included standing up to answer the phone or greet customers, using a cash register, writing, retrieving flies from other offices, and lifting paper into computers.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The ALJ\u2019s finding that Lafleur could return to her past work as a hotel clerk was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b294-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
