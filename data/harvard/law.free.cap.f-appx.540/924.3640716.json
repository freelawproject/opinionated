According to the Commissioner, Nelson had a tax deficiency in 2005 of $40,153, and was assessed penalties of: (1) $9,034.43 under I.R.C. \u00a7 6651(a)(1); (2) $1,610.62 under \u00a7 6654(a); and (3) $9,837.49 under \u00a7 6651(a)(2). In 2008, Nelson\u2019s tax deficiency was $86,440, and he was assessed penalties of: (1) $12,112.20 under \u00a7 6651(a)(1); and (2) $3,499.08 under \u00a7 6651(a)(2). The record shows that, during the years in question, Nelson\u2019s tax returns indicated that his wages were zero and that his occupation was \u201cAmerican citizen.\u201d However, Nelson was employed by Northwest Airlines as a pilot and earned wages of $154,749.00 in 2005, and $264,640.00 in 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-15\">Nelson argued before the tax court that he did not receive \u201cwages\u201d because his activities did not constitute \u201cemployment,\u201d as those terms are defined in the Internal Revenue Code. He claimed that, during 2005 and 2008, he did not have any taxable income because he did not perform a \u201cservice\u201d (1) within the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, or American Samoa, (2) on or in connection with an American vessel or aircraft under a contract of service entered into within the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, or American Samoa, (3) for the United States or any instrumentality thereof. Thus, he asserted that he did not earn \u201cwages\u201d based on, <em>inter alia, </em>the definitions of \u201cemployment\u201d and \u201cemployee\u201d in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3121 and 3401(c). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>The tax court rejected Nelson\u2019s arguments as frivolous, upheld the Commissioner\u2019s deficiency determinations, and <em>sua sponte </em>imposed a $2,000 sanction against Nelson. On appeal, Nelson again argues that, in 2005 and 2008, he was not engaged in any activities subject to federal employment taxation, as defined in \u00a7 3121(b). He concedes that he was paid for his work at Northwest Airlines and essentially contends that the issue on appeal is whether his pay from 2005 and 2008 constitutes wages from \u201cemployment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">Section 1 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes a tax on the \u201ctaxable income\u201d of every individual. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 l(a)-(d); see <em>also </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101 (imposing FICA taxes on \u201cevery individual\u201d). Taxable income is gross income minus allowable deductions. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 63(a). \u201c[Gjross income means all income from whatever source derived, including (but not limited to) ... [compensation for services.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 61(a)(1). \u201cWages\u201d include \u201call remuneration for employment.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3121(a). \u201cEmployment\u201d is defined as \u201cany service, of whatever nature, performed by an employee for the person employing him, irrespective of the citizenship or residence of either, <em>within the United States.\u201d Id. </em>\u00a7 3121(b)(A)(i) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">Undisputedly, Nelson worked for Northwest Airlines as a pilot and received \u201cwages\u201d for his work. Indeed, Nelson concedes that he was paid in exchange for his services. Nelson\u2019s wages, as compensation for services, constituted taxable gross income. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 l(a)-(d), 61(a)(1), 63(a). Further, Nelson\u2019s work for Northwest constitutes \u201cemployment\u201d within \u00a7 3121(b), because his service was performed within the United States, irrespective of the citizenship or residence of either party. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3121(b)(A)(i). Nelson\u2019s reading of the statute wholly ignores subsection (i), which defines \u201cemployment\u201d as service between an employer and employee within the United States. We have repeatedly rejected arguments, such as Nelson\u2019s, asserting that private sector employment income is not subject to federal taxation. <em>See United States v. Morse, </em>532 F.3d 1130, 1132-33 (11th Cir.2008); <em>Motes v. United States, </em>785 F.2d 928, 928 (11th Cir.1986). Thus, we affirm the tax court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">Moreover, we have imposed sanctions, even against <em>pro se </em>litigants, for maintaining such frivolous arguments after being warned that the arguments are frivolous. <em>See Morse, </em>532 F.3d at 1133; <em>Motes, </em>785 F.2d at 928. Nelson has previously been warned, both by the tax court and by this Court, that his arguments are frivolous. <em>See Nelson v. United States, </em>392 Fed.Appx. 681, 682-83 (11th Cir.2010) (unpublished). Further, Nelson\u2019s reply brief was filed 24 days after the Commissioner filed a motion for sanctions, affording Nelson a \u201creasonable opportunity to respond\u201d to the motion in his brief. <em>See </em>Fed.R.App.P. 38. In addition, the docket sheet shows that Nelson has made no separate response to the Commissioner\u2019s motion. Accordingly, we conclude that sanctions are appropriate, and we will enter a separate order granting the Commissioner\u2019s motion for sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
