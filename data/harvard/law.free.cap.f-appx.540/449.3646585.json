Ortegon argues that the district court imposed a procedurally and substantively unreasonable sentence because it did not grant him a downward departure for his substantial assistance pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, p.s. Further, he contends that the sentence is otherwise procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-24\">To the extent that Ortegon challenges the district court\u2019s refusal to downwardly depart from the guidelines range, the issue is not reviewable. <em>See United States v. Burleson, </em>22 F.3d 93, 94-95 (5th Cir.1994). This court may, however, consider whether Ortegon\u2019s within-guidelines sentence is unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 375 (5th Cir.2007), <em>abrogation on other grounds recognized by United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>F.3d 750, 752 (5th Cir.2009). Pursuant to <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), we consider the procedural and substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed. <em>See Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d at 752-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">To the extent that Ortegon contends that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable in failing to account for the Government\u2019s purported unconstitutional motive in refusing to file a motion for a downward departure, because he did not raise this issue in the district court, plain error review applies, as Ortegon concedes. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009). For Ortegon to prevail on plain error review, the error must be clear or obvious and affect substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If these requirements are met, this court has the discretion to correct the error, but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>Ortegon has not established error, plain or otherwise. <em>See Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992); <em>United States v. Aderholt, </em>87 F.3d 740, 742 (5th Cir.1996); <em>Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">As Ortegon concedes, review of his substantive reasonableness challenge also is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 392 (5th Cir.2007). Although no 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factor required the district court to consider Or-tegon\u2019s cooperation, the record reflects that the district court nonetheless heard and considered Ortegon\u2019s arguments for a reduced sentence based on his cooperation but ultimately declined to impose a sentence below the guidelines range. See <em>United States v. Fraga, </em>704 F.3d 432, 440 (5th Cir.2013). Ortegon has shown no error, plain or otherwise, with respect to his argument that the sentence is procedurally or substantively unreasonable because it fails to account for his cooperation with the Government. <em>See id.; Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423. Further, he has not rebutted the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 360; <em>United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Finally, the district court did not err in not giving Ortegon credit for time spent in federal custody. It is not authorized to do so. <em>See United States v. Dowling, </em>962 F.2d 390, 393 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">Ortegon\u2019s motion to take judicial notice is GRANTED. The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b479-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
