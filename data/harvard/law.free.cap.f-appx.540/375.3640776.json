He argues that the district court violated <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>580 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), when it sentenced him for possession with intent to distribute even though the factual basis supported a conviction for only simple possession of cocaine. Melendez also contends that six \u201cspecial\u201d conditions of supervised release must be deleted from the written judgment because they were not part of the sentence pronounced orally in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">As Melendez did not object on <em>Apprendi </em>grounds in the district court, we review his claim for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Rojas-Luna, </em>522 F.3d 502, 504 (5th Cir.2008). The district court did not violate <em>Apprendi </em>because Melendez\u2019s 150-month sentence did not exceed the 20-year statutory maximum for the offense for which he was convicted. <em>See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348; \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">We review Melendez\u2019s challenge to the conditions of supervised release contained in the written judgment for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Mudd, </em>685 F.3d 473, 480 (5th Cir.2012). The conditions of supervised release of which Melendez complains are not \u201cspecial\u201d conditions but are identical to those listed in the \u201cmandatory\u201d and \u201cstandard\u201d sections of the Western District of Texas\u2019s general order of July 18, 2011, adopting conditions of probation and supervised release. Conditions that are regularly applied throughout a district are considered \u201cstandard,\u201d and \u201cexplicit reference to each and every standard condition of supervision is not essential to the defendant\u2019s right to be present at sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Vega, </em>332 F.3d 849, 852-53 n. 8 (5th Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, these conditions need not be orally pronounced, and the district court \u201cmay instead rely on the judgment to clarify that these standard conditions are indeed applicable to the case at hand.\u201d <em>United States v. Torres-Aguilar, </em>352 F.3d 934, 936 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-14\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b406-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
