He contends that the within-guidelines sentence is substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Specifically, Berrios-Ramirez argues that the guidelines range failed to account for the non-violent nature of his illegal reentry offense and his benign motive for returning to the United States, that the sentence failed to account for his personal history and characteristics, and that the district court placed too much emphasis on his criminal history. Because Berrios-Ra-mirez did not object to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence in the district court, plain error review applies. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">\u201cWhen the district court imposes a sentence within a properly calculated guidelines range and gives proper weight to the Guidelines and the ... \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we will give great deference to that sentence and will infer that the judge has considered all the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines in light of the sentencing considerations set out in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). \u201cA discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">Berrios-Ramirez contends that the presumption of reasonableness should not apply because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically based and therefore produces a sentencing range too high to fulfill \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s goals. He concedes that his argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent but seeks to preserve the issue for further review. As Berrios-Ramirez concedes, we have consistently rejected an \u201cempirical data\u201d argument. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-12\">The district court considered Berrios-Ramirez\u2019s mitigation arguments and request for a sentence at the bottom of the applicable guidelines range, and it ultimately concluded that a sentence at the middle of the guidelines range was appropriate based on the totality of the circumstances and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. We have rejected the argument that the Sentencing Guidelines overstate the seriousness of illegal reentry because it is simply a non-violent international trespass offense. <em>See United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006). Further, Berrios-Ramirez\u2019s arguments that his alcohol problem, motive for reentering, cultural assimilation, and inability to obtain fast-track relief justified a lower sentence are insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 526 (5th Cir.2008). Therefore, Berrios-Ramirez has failed to show that his 46-month within-guidelines sentence is substantively unreasonable, and there is no reversible plain error. <em>See Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 339. The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b487-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
