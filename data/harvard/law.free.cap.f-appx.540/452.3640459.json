He challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, arguing that his sentence is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), because the illegal reentry guideline includes prior convictions in arriving at the offense level, and because illegal reentry is no more than an international trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-20\">We review sentences for substantive reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard and accord within-guidelines sentences a presumption of reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). We have rejected the argument that illegal reentry is merely a trespass offense that is treated too harshly under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006). Further, Rodriguez\u2019s dissatisfaction with the Sentencing Commission\u2019s de-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>cisi\u00f3n to place significant emphasis on pri- or convictions in illegal reentry cases does not render his sentence, imposed in line with that policy, beyond the discretion of the district court. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>5B1 F.3d 3B7, 339 (5th Cir.2008). Additionally, Rodriguez\u2019s disagreement with the district court\u2019s weighing of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">Rodriguez has not demonstrated that the district court abused its discretion in sentencing him. <em>See Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b482-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
