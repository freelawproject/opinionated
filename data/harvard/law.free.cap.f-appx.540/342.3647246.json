Wiltse alleges that the lien, which secures a $68,000 loan, is invalid due to noncompliance with Article XVI, Section 50(a)(6) of the Texas Constitution. Specifically, Wiltse alleges that the amount of the loan was greater than eighty percent of the fair market value of her home, and that she was charged more than three percent of the loan\u2019s value for closing fees. Carrington removed the case to federal court and moved to dismiss Wiltse\u2019s claim as time-barred. Carrington argued that the four-year residual limitations period of Texas Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 16.051, which applies to \u201c[ejvery action for which there is no express limitations period, except an action for the recovery of real property,\u201d is applicable to Wiltse\u2019s claim. The district court granted Carrington\u2019s motion and dismissed Wiltse\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-21\">On appeal, Wiltse argues that the residual limitations period does not apply to an action under Article XVI, Section 50(a)(6) of the Texas Constitution. However, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>Wiltse recognizes, this argument is foreclosed by our holding in <em>Priester v. JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., </em>708 F.3d 667, 673-74 (5th Cir.2013). Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b372-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
