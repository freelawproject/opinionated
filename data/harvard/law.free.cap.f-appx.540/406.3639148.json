Calixto, Sr., pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting the interstate transportation of a stolen motor vehicle in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2312 and 2 and was sentenced to a within-guidelines sentence of 57 months in prison and three years of supervised release. He was also ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $309,933.78.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-17\">Calixto argues that the district court erred when it failed to adequately explain the chosen sentence. Because Calixto failed to present this argument in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009). Under the plain error standard, Calixto must show a clear or obvious forfeited error that affected his substantial rights. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). Even if Calixto makes the required showing, this court retains the discretion to correct the error only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-22\">\u201cThe district court must adequately explain the sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 360 (5th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The record reflects that the district court knew about Calixto\u2019s coconspirators\u2019 pleas and sentences, listened to Calixto\u2019s arguments for a more lenient sentence, but expressed its strong disagreement with Calixto\u2019s arguments regarding his culpability. The district court also stated that it had considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the Sentencing Guidelines in choosing Calixto\u2019s within-guidelines sentence of 57 months. The district court\u2019s explanation of the chosen sentence is procedurally sound. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 358-59, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525-26 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b436-23\">Even if the district court\u2019s reasons were not adequately stated at sentencing, the district court\u2019s statement of reasons specifically identifies the \u00a7 3553(a) factors relied upon by the district court in selecting Ca-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>lixto\u2019s sentence. A district court\u2019s failure to orally advise a defendant of its reasons for imposing a specific sentence is not reversible plain error when supported by written reasons. <em>United States v. Gore, 298 </em>F.3d 322, 325-26 (5th Cir.2002). Moreover, the district court\u2019s explanation in the statement of reasons \u201cwould render remand a meaningless formality.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b436-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
