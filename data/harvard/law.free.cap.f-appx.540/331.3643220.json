Davis contends: the court erred by dismissing his claim without further factual development; and defendants acted with deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs, in violation of the Eighth Amendment, and caused resulting physical injury. (Davis also presents ADA-based claims that were not presented in district court. \u201cIt is a bedrock principle of appellate review that claims raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered.\u201d <em>Stewart Glass &amp; Mirror, Inc. v. U.S. Auto Glass Discount Ctrs., Inc., </em>200 F.3d 307, 316-17 (5th Cir.2000).)</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">A Rule 12(b)(6) motion\u2019s being granted is reviewed <em>de novo. E.g., Atchafalaya Basinkeeper v. Chustz, </em>682 F.3d 356, 357 (5th Cir.2012). \u201c[District courts should not dismiss <em>pro se </em>complaints pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) without first providing the plaintiff an opportunity to amend, unless it is obvious from the record that the plaintiff has pled his best case\u201d. <em>Hale v. King, </em>642 F.3d 492, 503 (5th Cir.2011). An error in failing to afford a prisoner the opportunity to amend his complaint \u201cmay be ameliorated ... if the plaintiff has alleged his best case, or if the dismissal was without prejudice\u201d. <em>Bazrowx v. Scott, </em>136 F.3d 1053,1054 (5th Cir.1998) (citation omitted). The district court did not specify whether the dismissal was with, or without, prejudice; we therefore presume that the claim was dismissed with prejudice. <em>See Fernandez-Montes v. Allied Pilots Ass\u2019n, </em>987 F.2d 278, 284 n. 8 (5th Cir.1993) (\u201cit is well established that a dismissal is presumed to be with prejudice unless the order explicitly states otherwise\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-13\">When a district court dismisses a <em>pro se </em>complaint with prejudice and without opportunity to amend, our court considers whether the plaintiffs \u201callegations, if developed by a questionnaire or in a <em>Spears </em>dialog, might have presented a nonfrivo-lous ... claim\u201d. <em>Eason v. Thaler, </em>14 F.3d 8, 9 (5th Cir.1994). If, \u201c[wjith further factual development and specificity these allegations may pass ... muster\u201d, we will remand for the plaintiff to have \u201can opportunity ... to offer a more detailed set of factual claims\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 10. A review of Davis\u2019 complaint shows he should be permitted to develop the factual and legal bases for his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-14\">\u201cInadequate medical care by a prison doctor can result in a constitutional violation for purposes of a \u00a7 1983 claim when that conduct amounts to deliberate indifference to the prisoner\u2019s serious medical needs, constituting the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain proscribed by the Eighth Amendment.\u201d <em>Harris v. Hegmann, </em>198 F.3d 153, 159 (5th Cir.1999) (internal alterations and citations omitted). Additionally, \u201c[a] prison inmate can dem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>onstrate an Eighth Amendment violation by showing that a prison official refused to treat him, ignored his complaints ... or engaged in any similar conduct\u201d. <em>Easter v. Powell, </em>467 F.3d 459, 464 (5th Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">In his complaint and objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, Davis asserts Drs. Roundtree and Collins each recommended surgery on both ears; however, according to Davis, both doctors ignored his repeated requests for the recommended surgery. Davis further alleges this inaction resulted in seven ear infections, hearing loss, spells of dizziness, and loss of balance, which prevent him from walking. Davis also contends the doctors denied a necessary medical-duty status. The alleged physical symptoms would \u201cconstitute more than a <em>de minimis </em>physical injury\u201d. <em>See Brown v. Lippard, </em>472 F.3d 384, 386 (5th Cir.2006) (suggesting hand, knee, and shoulder pain would exceed a <em>de minimis </em>threshold). To the extent the district court based its dismissal on Davis\u2019 failure to allege a physical injury, the district court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\u201cUnder certain circumstances, allegations of deliberate indifference may be shown when prison officials deny an inmate recommended treatment by medical professionals.\u201d <em>Payne v. Lynaugh, </em>843 F.2d 177, 178 (5th Cir.1988). Insofar as Davis contends Assistant Warden Norris exhibited deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs by denying him recommended treatment, these allegations likewise raise a plausible deliberate-indifference claim. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 178-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">Liberally construed, Davis\u2019 allegations, concerning ear infections, hearing loss, and denial of surgery and duty status accommodations, do not raise \u201cfantastic or delusional scenarios\u201d or an \u201cindisputably merit-less\u201d legal theory. <em>See Eason, </em>14 F.3d at 9 n. 5. Rather, they arguably raise a viable claim of deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 9; <em>Easter, </em>467 F.3d at 463. Because Davis was not afforded an opportunity to amend his complaint or participate in a <em>Spears </em>hearing, the district court erred by dismissing Davis\u2019 claim with prejudice for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">The judgment granting defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss is VACATED, and this action REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We express no view on the ultimate disposition of Davis\u2019 claims.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b362-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
