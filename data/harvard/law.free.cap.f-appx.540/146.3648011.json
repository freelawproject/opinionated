We will summarily vacate the District Court\u2019s orders and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-16\">The Prison Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d) imposes filing requirements on prisoners who seek to file civil actions with IFP status. Specifically, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) precludes a prisoner from bringing IFP actions or appeals if he or she has had three or more prior actions or appeals dismissed as frivolous, malicious, or for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In such cases, the prisoner is required to prepay the filing fee before bringing another action or appeal, unless he or she shows \u201cimminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-17\">In July 2013, Parks filed a civil rights action asserting a host of constitutional claims against staff and officials at USP Lewisburg. In his accompanying IFP application, Parks answered \u201cyes\u201d to the question whether he had three or more prior cases dismissed as frivolous or for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>failure to state a claim, although Parks did not specifically identify any such case by caption or docket number. The District Court dismissed the action \u201cpursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 1915(g),\u201d concluding that Parks had not demonstrated that he was in imminent danger of serious physical injury at the time he filed the complaint. <em>Parks v. Edinger, </em>M.D. Pa. Civ. No. 13-cv-01834 (order entered July 11, 2013). In its order, the District Court did not identify three (or more) prior cases which counted as strikes for purposes of the \u00a7 1915(g) analysis. Instead, it relied solely on Parks\u2019 admission that he had three strikes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Parks\u2019 timely appeal was docketed here at C.A. No. 13-3247.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Prior to entering its dismissal order in the case described above, the District Court rejected a separate civil rights case filed by Parks, similarly relying on his putative strikes to deny his IFP application. <em>Parks v. Samuels, </em>M.D. Pa. Civ. No. 13-cv-00742 (order entered Apr. 22, 2013). There, however, Parks denied that he had three actions dismissed under circumstances described in \u00a7 1915(g), and the District Court identified Parks\u2019 strikes. Parks appealed, and the matter was docketed here as C.A. No. 13-2238.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>See Abdul-Akbar v. McKelvie, </em>239 F.3d 307, 311 (3d Cir.2001). For the reasons discussed below, we conclude that the actions and appeals which provided the basis for the District Court\u2019s 1915(g) determination in do not qualify as strikes. We note that our decision is based, in part, on two opinions that we issued after the District Court entered its order: <em>Ball v. Famiglio, </em>726 F.3d 448 (3d Cir.2013), and <em>Byrd v. Shannon, </em>715 F.3d 117 (3d Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">The District Court identified several purported strikes, including (1) <em>Parks v. Reans, </em>E.D. Ky. Civ. No. 10-cv-000278, 2012 WL 1853759 (order entered May 21, 2012), and the subsequent appeal, (2) <em>Parks v. Reans, </em>510 Fed.Appx. 414 (6th Cir.2013); (3) <em>Parks v. Williams, </em>D.D.C. Civ. No. 99-cv-02420 (order entered July 15, 2004); and (4) <em>Parks v. Williams, </em>E.D. Va. Civ. No. 01-cv-00287, 2001 WL 34780939 (order entered Nov. 6, 2001). In the case filed in the Eastern District of Kentucky, judgment was entered in favor of the defendants on the ground that they were sued only in their official capacities and were immune from suit under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(iii). The District Court did not dismiss the \u201ccomplaint under Rule 12(b)(6) or expressly state[ ] that the ground for the dismissal is frivolousness.\u201d <em>Ball, </em>726 F.3d at 463 (3d Cir.2013) (\u201cdeclin[ing] to treat a district court\u2019s dismissal due to the defendant\u2019s immunity as a <em>per se </em>dismissal for frivolousness for purposes of the PLRA\u2019s three strikes rule.\u201d). On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>\u201caffirmed,\u201d so that judgment does not qualify as a strike. <em>Id. </em>(holding that \u201can affirmance of a district court\u2019s dismissal does not\u201d count as a strike).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">In the action filed in the District of Columbia, the District Court concluded that Parks \u201cstatefd] a claim on which relief can be granted with respect to exposure to second-hand smoke,\u201d but granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants because Parks did not contradict evidence that the prison had a policy regarding smoking which it enforced. That case, therefore, does not count as a strike. <em>Cf. Blakely v. Wards, </em>738 F.3d 607 (4th Cir.2013) (en banc) (\u201choldfing] that a summary judgment dismissal stating on its face that the dismissed action was frivolous, malicious, or failed to state a claim counts as a strike for purposes of the PLRA\u2019s three-strikes provision.\u201d). Moreover, the dismissal of Parks\u2019 case in the Eastern District of Virginia does not qualify as a strike. There, the Magistrate Judge indicated that the matter was being \u201cevalu-atfed] pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2) &amp; 1915A,\u201d and recommended that Parks\u2019 claims \u201cbe dismissed.\u201d The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation, stated that the \u201caction will be dismissed,\u201d and directed the Clerk to \u201cnote the disposition of the action for purposes of the [PLRA].\u201d <em>Parks v. Williams, </em>2001 WL 34780939, at *5 (E.D.Va. Nov. 6, 2001) (not precedential). While the docket entry states, \u201c[dismissed as frivolous pursuant to [PLRA],\u201d there is no indication that the District Court concluded that the statutory criteria for a strike had been met. <em>See Byrd, </em>715 F.3d at 126-27 (stating that \u201cby merely dismissing the appeal generally under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), we cannot determine with certainty that [the] appeal was dismissed for reasons warranting a strike under \u00a7 1915(g).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">The District Court in one of the appeals before us also noted that the United States District Court for the Central District of California had recently denied Parks\u2019 motion for leave to proceed IFP because he had three strikes. <em>See Parks v. Ferguson, </em>C.D. Ca. Civ. No. 13-cv-00470 (order entered April 1, 2013). Significantly, though, that determination was later reversed on appeal by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals because \u201c[a]t least one of the prior dismissals relied on by the district court, <em>Parks v. Bledsoe, </em>[M.D. Pa. Civ. No. 12-cv-00848, 2012 WL 3764049 (order entered Aug. 29, 2012) ], was improperly counted as a strike.\u201d <em>Parks v. Ferguson, </em>No. 13-55758 (9th Cir. Aug. 26, 2013). Indeed, as the Ninth Circuit correctly concluded, Parks did not accrue a strike when the Middle District of Pennsylvania dismissed his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition without prejudice to his right to pursue challenges to the conditions of his confinement in a properly filed civil rights action. Notably, the Middle District of Pennsylvania did not dismiss the action \u201cexplicitly because it is \u2018frivolous,\u2019 \u2018malicious,\u2019 or \u2018fails to state a claim\u2019 or ... pursuant to a statutory provision or rule that is limited solely to dismissals for such reasons[.]\u201d <em>Byrd, </em>715 F.3d at 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Finally, after examining docket sheets and documents in other civil rights cases filed by Parks in District of Columbia, as well as in the Middle District of Florida and the Northern District of Georgia, we are unable to conclusively determine that any qualify as strikes. Therefore, based on our evaluation, Parks did not have three strikes when he filed his complaints, and District Court erred in requiring him to demonstrate that he was under imminent danger of serious physical injury be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>fore proceeding IFP. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Accordingly, we will summarily vacate the District Court\u2019s orders and direct the District Court to evaluate Parks\u2019 motions for leave to proceed IFP in light of this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-7\">. Even where such an admission is made, the preferred practice in \u00a7 1915(g) cases is for the District Court to make a record of the prisoner's strikes, so that, if necessary, we can evaluate those strikes on appeal. <em>Cf. Evans v. Ill. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>150 F.3d 810, 812 (7th Cir.1998) (instructing that \"in the order denying leave to proceed in forma pauperis the district court must cite specifically the case names, case docket numbers, districts in which the actions were filed, and the dates of the orders dismissing the actions\u201d); <em>but see Gibson v. City Municipality of N.Y., </em>692 F.3d 198, 200 n. 2 (2d Cir.2012) (\"[w]e do not believe ... that federal law requires a district court to specify, in an order dismissing a prisoner's complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), the particular orders on which the court relies.\u201d). Despite the District Court\u2019s failure to do so here, however, we may still review whether Parks has three strikes. <em>See Byrd, </em>715 F.3d at 125 (noting that the \"driving purpose of the PLRA [is to] ... preserv[e] resources of both the courts and the defendants in prisoner litigation.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
