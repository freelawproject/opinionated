Because H. Gordon Myrick, Incorporated (\u201cHGM\u201d), is entitled to coverage under the policy purchased by Shoemake Painting Services, Incorporated (\u201cShoe-make\u201d), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-19\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-20\">Harrison County Commercial Lot, L.L.C. (\u201cHCCL\u201d), hired HGM and H. Gordon Myrick, Jr., as general contractor for a planned office building and hired Shoe-make as a sub-contractor. HCCL sued HGM and Myrick in state court, alleging a variety of claims \u2014 including deficiencies in the building\u2019s drywall that HGM attributed to Shoemake\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-21\">Pursuant to its agreement with HGM, Shoemake purchased a policy providing commercial general liability coverage but excluding \u201c \u2018property damage\u2019 to \u2018your work.\u2019\u201d An endorsement added HGM as \u201can additional insured only with respect to liability for \u2018bodily injury\u2019, \u2018property damage\u2019 or \u2018personal and advertising injury\u2019 caused, in whole or in party, by ... [y]our acts or omissions.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-22\">State Auto sought a declaratory judgment that it was not required to provide coverage or defend HGM in the state court action. The district court denied summary judgment to State Auto and found that \u201cthe endorsement for additional insureds modified the original policy to create coverage for [HGM] for any liability resulting from Shoemake\u2019s work.\u201d On State Auto\u2019s unopposed motion, the court entered final judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) and dismissed State Auto\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>II.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-5\">We review a summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>\u201cusing the same standard as that employed by the district court under Rule 56.\u201d <em>Kerstetter v. Pac. Scientific Co., </em>210 F.3d 431, 435 (5th Cir.2000). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AlP\"><em>Newman v. Guedry, </em>703 F.3d 757, 761 (5th Cir.2012), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(June 11, 2013) (No. 12-1437).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Mississippi law governs this diversity action. \u201cThe interpretation of an insurance policy is a question of law, not one of fact.\u201d <em>Noxubee Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. United Nat. Ins. Co., </em>883 So.2d 1159, 1165 (Miss.2004). Where \u201cthe provisions of [a] policy ... are plain and unambiguous, [ ] they should be construed as written.\u201d <em>Paul Revere Life Ins. Co. v. Prince, </em>375 So.2d 417, 419 (Miss.1979). \u201cThe initial question of whether [a] contract is ambiguous is a matter of law.\u201d <em>Lamb Const. Co. v. Town of Renova, </em>573 So.2d 1378, 1383 (Miss.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">\u201cIf a court determines that ambiguity inheres in the policy language,\u201d Mississippi law \u201crequires the court to construe ambiguous terms in favor of the policyholder.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cAmbiguity arises when a term or provision is susceptible to more than one reasonable meaning, but can also result from \u2018internal conflict\u2019 between policy provisions that renders uncertain the meaning of the policy as a whole.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-13\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-14\">State Auto contends that the policy\u2019s denial of coverage to primary insured Shoemake for \u201c \u2018property damage\u2019 to \u2018your work\u2019 \u201d precludes HGM, as additional insured, from receiving coverage based on Shoemake\u2019s negligence. HGM claims coverage based on the endorsement, which \u201cmodifies\u201d the policy, adds HGM as additional insured, and expressly provides coverage for \u201c \u2018property damage\u2019 ... caused ... by ... [y]our\u201d \u2014 that is, Shoemake\u2019s<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u2014\u201cacts or omissions.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-15\">State Auto observes that an additional insured <em>generally </em>stands in shoes no larger than those worn by the primary policyholder.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In this case, however, the endorsement extends to HGM \u2014 coverage for property damage caused by Shoemake\u2019s acts \u2014 what the policy denies to Shoemake. Considering the relevant provisions together, we find ambiguity arising from internal conflict, so we construe the ambiguous terms in favor of coverage. <em>See Leonard, </em>499 F.3d at 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-16\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b308-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
