Myers, formerly Texas prisoner # 1513909, moves to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) in his appeal of the summary judgment dismissal of his pro se 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint. The district court certified that an appeal would not be in good faith. By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Myers is challenging the certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-22\">In his IFP application, Myers asserts that the district court failed to set forth in writing the reasons why it was certifying that his appeal was not taken in good faith. The district court provided its reasons by incorporating by reference the magistrate judge\u2019s previous findings and conclusions as its own reasons for certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith; that is sufficient. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 21. Myers\u2019s conclusional assertion that there was conflicting evidence, without record citations and a discussion of the evidence, and his assertion that the district court erred by weighing the evidence, without a discussion of the district court\u2019s analysis, are insufficient to establish that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; <em>Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Myers\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 219-20. Because the appeal is frivolous, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Given Myers\u2019s history of frivolous filings, <em>see Myers v. Nash, </em>464 Fed.Appx. 848, 350 (5th Cir.2012), and the frivolous nature of the instant appeal, Myers is WARNED that any future frivolous pleadings in this court or in any court subject to the jurisdiction of this court will subject him to sanctions. Myers is DIRECTED to review any pending matters to ensure that they are not frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b491-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
