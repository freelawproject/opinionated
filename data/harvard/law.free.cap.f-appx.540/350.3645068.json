The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed the I J\u2019s decision without opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The Attorney General may grant relief to aliens who qualify as refugees. <em>Jukic v. INS, </em>40 F.3d 747, 749 (5th Cir.1994). A refugee is a person who is outside of his or her country and is \u201cunable or unwilling to return because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To establish that he is a member of a particular social group, the alien must show that he shares a common immutable characteristic that he cannot change or should not be required to change because it is fundamental to his individual identity or conscience. <em>Mwembie v. Gonzales, </em>443 F.3d 405, 414-15 (5th Cir.2006). Being a businessman who was swindled and complained about it to the authorities was not beyond Rodriguez-Hidalgo\u2019s power to change or so fundamental to his identity or conscience that it should not be changed. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Rodriguez-Hidalgo\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b380-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
