We withdraw the prior opinion, 2013 WL 1831797 (May 2, 2013), and substitute the following opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-18\">John Callen, Jr., appeals his conviction, following his guilty plea, for conspiracy to distribute cocaine, possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, and money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-22\">\u00a7 1956(a)(1)(A)(i) and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(l)(A)(ii). Callen argues that the district court erred when it denied his motion to dismiss the indictment, which was based on his constitutional right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-23\">Callen pleaded guilty without a written plea agreement. The transcript of his re-arraignment indicates that Callen\u2019s guilty plea was unconditional. Although Callen\u2019s counsel expressed an intent to appeal the denial of Callen\u2019s speedy trial act motion, he did not obtain the consent of the court or the government. Nor was Callen\u2019s purported reservation of appeal reduced to writing. \u201cBecause there is no indication in the record that the government or the district court consented to a conditional plea,\u201d we must conclude that Callen\u2019s plea was unconditional. <em>United States v. Stevens, </em>487 F.3d 232, 240 (5th Cir.2007). An unconditional guilty plea \u201chas the effect of waving all nonjurisdictional defects in the prior proceedings,\u201d <em>id. at </em>238, including any claim of a speedy trial violation, <em>United States v. Bell, </em>966 F.2d 914, 915 (5th Cir.1992). Accordingly, Callen has waived his speedy trial act claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-24\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b282-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
