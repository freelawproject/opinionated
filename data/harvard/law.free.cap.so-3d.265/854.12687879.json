R.S. 40:966(F)(1), unconstitutional as applied to defendant Gary Travis. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the judgment, vacate defendant's sentence, and remand for re-sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Gary Travis was charged in April 2016 with one count of possession with intent to distribute marijuana, a violation of La. R.S. 40:966(A)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   He pled not guilty at his arraignment, and after several continuances, the State amended the bill of information to charge defendant with one count of possession of marijuana between two and one-half pounds or more, but less than sixty pounds, in violation of La. R.S. 40:966(F)(1) (2015).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Trial was set for January 8, 2018. Defendant pled guilty and was sentenced to five years in the Department of Corrections, with five years suspended, plus two years and nine months of active probation. The trial court recognized the mandatory $ 10,000 fine imposed by La. R.S. 40:966(F)(1) (2015), but counsel for defendant asked the court to hear testimony from Mr. Travis so that the court could downward depart from the $ 10,000 fine in accordance with\n   <em>\n    Bearden v. Georgia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299177\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/660/\">\n    461 U.S. 660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299177\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/660/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2064\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299177\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/660/\">\n    76 L.Ed.2d 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The trial court heard testimony from defendant, who stated that he worked for FEMA for three months ending in October or November 2017, but he had not worked for approximately five years before that time due to a car accident that resulted in\n   major back surgery. He lived with his fianc\u00e9e but did not know how much she earned in her position as a Bridge Field Counselor for the State. Defendant explained that he did not have health insurance but saw a physician every two months as a result of his back surgery and paid $ 500 for each visit, plus additional money for medication. Defendant was also responsible for child support payments for his five children who do not live with him. His fianc\u00e9e helped support the two children who lived with them; the fianc\u00e9e also paid their eleven hundred dollars monthly rent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After hearing defendant's testimony, the trial court issued a Judgment with Reasons on February 2, 2018, finding that the mandatory fine imposed by La. R.S. 40:966(F)(1) (2015) was unconstitutional as applied to Mr. Travis, but holding that the remaining sentence would be effective. The court indicated that the Attorney General should be notified of the court's ruling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. R.S. 49:257 (C).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 28, 2018, the Attorney General filed a motion to vacate the trial court's February 2, 2018 ruling finding La. R.S. 40:966(F)(1) (2015) unconstitutional. The State also filed a motion to appeal the court's February 2 decision to the Louisiana Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 8, 2018, defendant filed a Motion to Declare Mandatory Fine Unconstitutional. In the Motion, defendant argued that the fine mandated by La. R.S. 40:966(F)(1) (2015) violated his procedural due process rights, citing\n   <em>\n    Mathews v. Eldridge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p333\">\n    424 U.S. 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 333,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p333\">\n    96 S.Ct. 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 902,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p333\">\n    47 L.Ed.2d 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and argued that the fine was a \"grossly disproportionate\" penalty considering his indigent status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The State and the Attorney General jointly opposed defendant's Motion. On March 27, 2018, the trial court vacated its February 2, 2018 ruling so that the Attorney General would have an opportunity to be heard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After a hearing involving defendant, the State, and the Attorney General, the trial court issued a ruling on April 18, 2018, again finding that La. R.S. 40:966(F)(1) (2015) violated defendant's due process rights and was unconstitutional. The district court nevertheless recognized that this Court \"has consistently remanded sentences in which a judge fails to impose a mandatory fine in which the defendant is indigent.\" (Citing\n   <em>\n    State v. Lewis\n   </em>\n   , 2013-1588, p. 23 (La.

The district court also determined that defendant presented a \"persuasive argument\" that his due process rights were being violated under\n   <em>\n    Mathews v.

Finally, the court noted that even though the fine was a \"future injury,\" the injury was \"real, immediate, and direct.\" (citing\n   <em>\n    Davis v. Fed.

Here, however, the district court did not rule that former La. R.S. 40:966(F)(1) is unconstitutional on its face; instead, the court ruled that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to this particular defendant. Thus, under\n   <em>\n    State v.

R.S. 40:966(F)(1) (2015) is unconstitutional under\n   <em>\n    Bearden v. Georgia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299177\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/660/\">\n    461 U.S. 660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299177\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/660/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2064\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299177\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/461/660/\">\n    76 L.Ed.2d 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983) ; second, even if defendant's\n   <em>\n    Bearden\n   </em>\n   argument were properly alleged, the defendant is not currently facing imprisonment for failure to pay the fine, because the fine was not imposed, thus, the challenge is premature; and third, the district court should not have ruled that La. R.S. 40:966(F)(1) (2015) is unconstitutional as a violation of defendant's procedural due process rights, because defendant is provided ample opportunity to challenge an excessive sentence, either through (i) a sentencing hearing; (ii) an excessive sentence hearing under La. C.Cr.P. art. 881.1, LA. CONST. art. I, \u00a7 20, and\n   <em>\n    State v.

We address the State's assignments of error below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error Number 1\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The State argues first that defendant did not properly allege that the statute is unconstitutional under\n   <em>\n    Bearden\n   </em>\n   . To address this assignment of error, we consider whether the constitutional issue was properly preserved. We address the State's argument regarding the applicability of\n   <em>\n    Bearden\n   </em>\n   in our discussion of Assignment of Error Number 2, below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The unconstitutionality of a statute must be specially pleaded and the grounds for the claim particularized.\n   <em>\n    State v.

This Court has held that the grounds for a constitutional challenge must be particularized, but there is \"absence of a formal procedure\" for making such a challenge.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7002131\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/111/308/#p315\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , 2012-1854 at 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7002131\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/111/308/#p315\">\n    111 So.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   314 ;\n   <em>\n    State in the Interest of J.D.\n   </em>\n   , 2013-0964, p. 3 (La.

R.S. 40:966(F)(1) (2015) arose during sentencing on January 8, 2018, after defendant had pled guilty. At that time, defendant's constitutional challenge invoked\n   <em>\n    Bearden\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant's subsequent written motion to declare the mandatory fine unconstitutional, filed March 8, 2018, did not cite\n   <em>\n    Bearden\n   </em>\n   but cited\n   <em>\n    Mathews v. Eldridge\n   </em>\n   and additional United States and Louisiana Constitutional provisions\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   to support the argument that defendant's procedural due process rights were being violated. Our review of the record reveals that defendant properly preserved his constitutional challenge, articulating sufficient reasons why he believes the statute imposing a mandatory fine is unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error Number 2\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Next, the State contends that even if defendant properly challenged the constitutionality of the applicable statute,\n   <em>\n    Bearden\n   </em>\n   would not apply here because defendant is not facing mandatory jail time for failure to pay a fine-the district court never imposed the fine. In other words, defendant's challenge under\n   <em>\n    Bearden\n   </em>\n   is premature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We agree that\n   <em>\n    Bearden\n   </em>\n   does not apply to these facts. In\n   <em>\n    Bearden\n   </em>\n   , the U.S. Supreme Court held that a sentencing court could not automatically revoke a defendant's probation for the defendant's inability to pay a fine without first determining whether defendant had made sufficient bona fide efforts to pay, or that adequate alternative forms of punishment did not exist.\n   <em>\n    State v. Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7579663\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/489/286/#p291\">\n    489 So.2d 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 291 (La.

Because no fine was included in defendant's sentence in this case,\n   <em>\n    Bearden\n   </em>\n   is not the proper vehicle for traversing the constitutionality of La.

We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   First, pursuant to La.
