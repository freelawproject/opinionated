Although the trial court, at the conclusion of the hearing on the motion for summary judgment, pronounced \"[m]otion for [s]ummary [j]udgment granted,\" the trial court failed to memorialize its judgment in writing. Instead, the trial court produced written reasons for judgment. Without a valid final judgment, this Court lacks jurisdiction to exercise appellate review, and we decline to exercise supervisory review. Accordingly, this appeal is dismissed without prejudice and remanded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 3, 2016, Plaintiff-Appellant Renell Carter (\"Appellant\") entered Quicky's Discount # 3\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"the store\") to purchase food. Before making her selections, Appellant proceeded to the restroom located in the back of the store. According to Appellant, she was \"walking and talking\" and slid and fell\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   on a gray plastic garbage can lid\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   that was in the aisle. Defendant-Appellee Ameer, LLC et al (\"Appellee\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   argues that the garbage can\n   lid presented an open and obvious risk that Appellant would have noticed had she been paying attention. When deposed, Appellant conceded that had she \"been looking,\" she would have noticed the garbage can lid. In her subsequent affidavit, Appellant explained that her \"eyes were straight forward and not down toward the floor [so she] did not see a gray garbage can\" lid on the floor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 22, 2016, Appellant filed a petition for damages in First City Court, Parish of Orleans (\"trial court\"). On July 13, 2017, Appellees filed a motion for summary judgment, which was heard by the trial court on September 21, 2017. The trial court granted summary judgment. On September 25, 2017, the trial court issued its written reasons for judgment. Appellant appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Appellant raises a number of assignments of error, which address whether the trial court erred in granting summary judgment. However, before this Court considers the merits of this appeal, we must determine\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   whether \"jurisdiction has been properly invoked by a valid final judgment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Moon v. City of New Orleans\n   </em>\n   , 2015-1092, p. 5 (La.

Pursuant to La. C.C.P. art. 1911\"every final judgment shall contain the typewritten or printed name of the judge and be signed by the judge,\" and \"no appeal may be taken from a final judgment until the requirement of this Article has been fulfilled.\" Thus, a final judgment must be reduced to writing. Moreover, this Court has stated that \"an appellate court reviews written judgments ...\"\n   <em>\n    Two Canal St. Inv'rs, Inc. v. New Orleans Bldg. Corp.\n   </em>\n   , 2016-0825, (La.

Further, \"[t]o comply with the decretal language requirement, a judgment must contain the following three elements: (i) it \"must name the party in favor of whom the ruling is ordered\"; (ii) it must name \"the party against whom the ruling is ordered\"; and (iii) it must state \"the relief that is granted or denied.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12682710\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/258/107/#p109\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This Court further stated that \"[i]n addition to requiring that a judgment be precise, definite, and certain, the jurisprudence has required that a valid final judgment be self-contained; stated otherwise, \"[o]ne must be able to determine from the judgment itself-without any reference to an extrinsic source-the specific relief granted.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12682710\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/258/107/#p109\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12682710\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/258/107/#p109\">\n    at 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Finally, the Louisiana Supreme Court has pronounced that \"the job of the appellate court [is] to review the district court's judgment, not its reasons for judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Wooley v.

Because there exists no valid final judgment to invoke this Court's jurisdiction, Appellant is \"not entitled as of right to appellate review.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Bd. of Sup'rs of Louisiana State Univ. &amp; Agric. &amp; Mech.

Based on the aforementioned, this Court cannot exercise its supervisory jurisdiction since there is no written judgment.
