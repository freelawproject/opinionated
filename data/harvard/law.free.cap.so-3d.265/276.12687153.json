(\"the student\") initiated proceedings in the Limestone Juvenile Court (\"the juvenile court\") against the Limestone County Board of Education (\"the Board\") by filing a petition seeking judicial review of the decision of the Board to take disciplinary action against the student. In addition, the student asserted claims seeking injunctive relief against the Board. The Board filed a motion to dismiss the proceedings based on its claim of immunity as a state agency. The juvenile court entered an order denying the motion, and the Board has filed a petition for a writ of mandamus directing the juvenile court to vacate that order and to enter an order granting the motion. We grant the Board's petition insofar as it seeks the dismissal of the claims seeking injunctive relief, but we deny the petition insofar as it seeks to dismiss the student's petition seeking the juvenile court's judicial review of the Board's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In its petition for the writ of mandamus, the Board asserts the following facts, which have not been disputed by the student. The student had been attending a high school located within a geographic district assigned by the Board. On October 31, 2017, the student and another student made a telephone call to an elementary school. The call resulted in the evacuation of the students in the elementary school. After a number of proceedings, the Board imposed disciplinary action against the student that required the student to attend an alternative school for the remainder of the school year and, if she met certain conditions, permitted her to return to the high school within her district the following school year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 3, 2018, the student initiated the proceedings in the juvenile court, asserting that the juvenile court had original jurisdiction of the proceedings pursuant to \u00a7 12-15-115, Ala. Code 1975. Among other allegations, the student alleged that the Board had inappropriately infringed on her right to attend the public school of her district. As relief, the student sought judicial review of the Board's disciplinary decision as well as an order requiring the Board to permit her to return to her regular school pending the outcome of the proceedings and on a permanent basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 18, 2018, the Board filed a motion to dismiss the proceedings on the ground that the Board is entitled to immunity pursuant to Article I, \u00a7 14, of the Alabama Constitution of 1901. On February 19, 2018, the juvenile court entered an order denying the motion to dismiss. On March 1, 2018, the Board filed the present petition for a writ of mandamus challenging the denial of its motion to dismiss. We\n   asked for a response from the student to be filed by March 15, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On Friday, March 2, 2018, after the Board filed the present petition, the student filed in the juvenile court a \"Motion for Ruling on Temporary Relief Sought By Appellant,\" requesting an \"immediate\" return to her regular school pending the outcome of the proceedings. Later that same day, the juvenile court entered an order granting the student's motion and ordering that she be permitted to return to her high school the following Monday morning (March 5, 2018), without awaiting a response from the Board or providing a hearing on the matter. On the evening of Friday, March 2, 2018, the Board electronically filed in this court a motion seeking to stay the juvenile court's March 2, 2018, order or, alternatively, a petition for a writ of mandamus challenging that order. On March 6, 2018, we entered an order denying the motion to stay, citing Rule 8(b), Ala. R. App. P., and notified the parties that this court would treat the March 2, 2018, filing as an additional petition for a writ of mandamus, which was assigned case number 2170533. We asked for responses to be filed to the petition in case number 2170533 by March 9. The student did not file a response. On March 14, 2018, this court entered an order granting the Board's March 2, 2018, petition for a writ of mandamus and directing the juvenile court to vacate its March 2, 2018, order, citing Rule 65(b), Ala. R. Civ.

We note that this court has reviewed the judgments of juvenile courts that provided judicial review of a board of education's disciplinary decision. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Monroe Cty.

Accordingly, a court that renders a judgment finding liability on the part of the Board would violate Ala. Const. 1901, Art. I, \u00a7 14. See\n   <em>\n    John E. Ballenger Constr. Co. v.

The student's seeking judicial review does not include any possibility of imposing liability on the Board. Alabama Const. 1901, Art. I, \u00a7 14, entitles the Board to immunity only when it is named as \"a defendant in any court of law or equity.\" Excluding the claims seeking injunctive relief, the Board is not a defendant in a suit seeking monetary damages or an equitable remedy.

We, therefore, are not compelled to discuss the extent of a juvenile court's jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 12-15-115, the requirements for seeking judicial review of a board of education's disciplinary decision, or all the types of relief that can be granted by the juvenile court. From the materials submitted, we cannot conclude that the juvenile court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over the student's petition insofar as it seeks judicial review of the Board's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Based on the foregoing, we grant the Board's petition in part and issue a writ of mandamus directing the juvenile court to dismiss the student's claims seeking injunctive relief. We deny the Board's petition insofar as it sought the dismissal of any judicial review by the juvenile court of the Board's disciplinary ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   PETITION GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART; WRIT ISSUED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Thompson, P.J., concurs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Pittman, Thomas, and Moore, JJ., concur in the result, without writings.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Section 12-3-11 provides that \"[e]ach of the courts of appeals shall have and exercise original jurisdiction in the issuance and determination of writs of quo warranto and mandamus in relation to matters in which said court has appellate jurisdiction.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    We express no opinion as to whether the juvenile court had the authority to grant the injunctive relief requested if immunity did not apply to those claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
