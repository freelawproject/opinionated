Atkins\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defendant, Clifford Williams (\"Defendant\") appeals his conviction by a jury of second degree murder, a violation of La. R.S. 14:30.1, and his resulting life sentence without benefit of parole, probation or suspension of sentence. Finding no merit to his assignments of error on appeal, we affirm his conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 18, 2013, the State indicted Defendant for the March 25, 2013 second degree murder of fifteen-year-old Ralphmon Green (\"victim\"). Defendant pled not guilty at his arraignment on July 26, 2013. On August 26, 2014, the trial court denied Defendant's motions to suppress identification and statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Following numerous continuances, trial commenced on January 24, 2017, and concluded January 26, 2017, with the jury returning a verdict finding Defendant guilty of second degree murder. Defendant filed motions for post-verdict judgment of acquittal, new trial, and to reconsider sentence on March 28, 2017, all of which were denied on May 17, 2017. Immediately after denying those motions, the trial court sentenced Defendant to life imprisonment without benefit of parole, probation or suspension of sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant's motion for appeal was granted on May 17, 2017 and his appeal was timely filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Evidence at Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At trial, Officer Juan Lopez (\"Officer Lopez\") testified that he was the responding officer to a report of aggravated battery\n   by shooting in the 2100 block of Allen Street, in New Orleans on March 25, 2013. He found the victim lying on his back on the ground, unresponsive and with a gunshot wound to the head. Officer Lopez stated that there was a large crowd of people around the victim and that no weapon was found on the victim or on the scene near the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Sheryl Green (\"Ms. Green\"), the victim's mother, testified that on the day her son was killed, her son had left home on his bicycle to go to her niece and nephew's house a short distance away. She reported that she learned her son had been shot when she received a phone call from Durrell Williams (\"Durrell\"), a friend of the victim's. Later that evening, she was visited by Durrell's mother, Tina Williams (\"Ms. Williams\") and Carl \"Monster\" Moore (\"Mr. Moore\"), who were both acquainted with her son. Both Ms. Williams and Mr. Moore stated that they witnessed her son get killed. Ms. Green identified an Instagram photograph that she provided to New Orleans Police Detective Travis Ward (\"Det. Ward\"). She had suggested Det. Ward use the photograph to investigate the man depicted in the middle of the photograph. She told Det. Ward the man in the photograph attended Clark High School.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Det. Ward, the lead detective on this case, recalled that the shooting occurred on March 25, 2013, at approximately 6:15 p.m. By the time Det. Ward arrived on the scene, the victim's body had been removed to University Hospital. Det. Ward identified photographs of the crime scene. Eight 9-millimeter shell casings were located at the scene, along with four bullets, three of which had been fired into the ground and the fourth, which was located and removed from a car parked near the scene. Additional bullets were later retrieved from the body of the victim. Det. Ward explained that the location of the bullets on the scene was important because they indicated that the shooter was firing down at the victim multiple times and at a distance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Det. Ward separately interviewed Ms. Williams, Durrell, and Mr. Moore. Ms. Williams confirmed that she had witnessed the shooting. Ms. Williams, Mr. Moore and Durrell all described the shooter as having a medium build, \"bright\" skin with a small or thin beard. Det. Ward reported that none of these witnesses could provide him with the suspect's name. All three denied that the victim was armed at the time of shooting or that the victim did anything to indicate that he was armed at the time of the shooting. Det. Ward also testified that none of the witnesses on the scene reported that the victim had been armed with a firearm when he was killed. Det. Ward was unable to retrieve surveillance video of the area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Further investigation revealed that the suspect was known as \"Cliff\" and that he attended Clark High School. School personnel identified the image of the suspect from the Instagram photo as Clifford Williams (Defendant). School personnel gave Det. Ward a high school picture of Defendant along with a biographical information sheet.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Det. Ward compiled a six-person photo lineup, which included Defendant's high school picture, and he showed the photo line-up to Ms. Williams. Ms. Williams identified Defendant as the shooter. Det. Ward\n   then obtained an arrest warrant for Defendant and a warrant to search Defendant's residence. On April 2, 2013, Det. Ward executed both warrants. During the course of the search, Det. Ward confiscated a pair of blue jeans hidden under the sofa where Defendant usually slept. In the pocket of the blue jeans, Det. Ward found a semi-automatic Smith and Wesson gun. Det. Ward explained that the confiscated weapon could hold sixteen rounds of ammunition but was loaded with just eight bullets. Det. Ward reported that the weapon was submitted to the crime lab to be tested to see if it was the same weapon used to fire the shell casings that were collected at the crime scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   According to Det. Ward, Defendant was transported to police headquarters, where he was given his rights per\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant gave an audio and video-recorded statement, which the State played in court as the jury followed along with a transcription of the statement. Initially, Defendant denied being present at the shooting, and claimed he did not know the victim. Confronted with the evidence against him, however, Defendant admitted shooting the victim. Defendant claimed that he and the victim were engaged in a verbal exchange when the victim appeared to quickly reach for a gun. Defendant drew his gun, which was concealed in his waistband, and shot the victim, claiming \"he was about to kill me.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant explained that he left the scene of the shooting and rode a city bus to his father's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Continuing his testimony, Det. Ward said his investigation revealed that a person named Ernest Cloud was present at the shooting and had encouraged Defendant to shoot the victim. Det. Ward learned that Ernest Cloud was on probation and was wearing an ankle monitor at the time of the shooting. Further, Det. Ward learned that the ankle monitor indicated Ernest Cloud was present in the area at the time the victim was shot. Det. Ward identified Ernest Cloud as the individual wearing white in the Instagram photo. When he gave his statement, however, Defendant denied that anyone named Ernest was with him at the time of the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On cross-examination, Det. Ward testified he learned the victim had been on the scene for a period of time prior to the shooting and that the shooting resulted from a dispute between the victim and Defendant that had begun about a month and a half prior to the victim's murder. Det. Ward learned during his investigation that, just before the shooting, six black males arrived in response to a phone call made by \"Dominique.\" Among those six males were Mr. Moore, \"Tigger,\" \"Jermaine\" and \"Ruger,\" who were the victim's friends and who were believed to be members of the \"Money Over Everything\" gang. On redirect, Det. Ward indicated that gang members often denote their loyalty to a gang by getting tattoos on their hands, similar to those on Defendant's hands. Det. Ward further explained that gang members generally wage disputes with other gang members but the victim in this case was not known to be a member of any gang.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The State called Mr. Moore, who acknowledged currently being in jail for home invasion and having prior convictions of burglary and theft. Mr. Moore stated that he did not want to appear in court for fear of being labeled a \"rat\" and possibly\n   killed. However, he agreed to testify because of his close relationship with the victim and because the victim's family deserved justice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Mr. Moore acknowledged that he knew Ms. Williams and her son Durrell; however, Mr. Moore knew Durrell by the name of \"Ruger.\" Just prior to the shooting, Ms. Williams received a telephone call asking her to drive to the 2100 block of Allen Street because, \"Durrell was about to get into it with someone.\" Mr. Moore accompanied Ms. Williams to Allen Street where they saw the Defendant pointing a gun at the victim, with whom he was arguing. Mr. Moore positioned himself between the victim and Defendant, urging Defendant to put the gun down because \"... it's not worth it... That's a little boy (referencing the victim) right there, man.\" According to Mr. Moore, the victim was unarmed when the gun was pointed at him, and he made no gesture or movement to indicate that he was armed. Defendant lowered his weapon, momentarily pointing it at the ground. At that point, someone with Defendant said: \"Get at him [the victim]. You need to get at him.\" Defendant then started shooting at the victim. After the first shot, the victim fell down. Defendant continued to fire multiple shots at the victim and then ran away. Later that evening, Mr. Moore visited the victim's mother and told her he was present when the victim was shot. The next day, Mr. Moore gave a full recorded statement to the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The State called Durrell, who emphatically stated he did not want to testify in this matter. However, Durrell testified that he and the victim were friends and attended school together. On the day of the shooting, Durrell was with \"Tigger\" and \"Nice\" in the Seventh Ward when the victim told him that he (the victim) was \"mean mugging\" (making facial expressions) with somebody at the apartment complex. Durrell returned to the apartment complex pursuant to the victim's request. When Durrell arrived at the complex, he saw the victim arguing with Defendant. Shortly after, Durrell's mother, Ms. Williams, drove up to the complex with Mr. Moore and ordered Durrell to get into the car. He refused to comply. Defendant retrieved a gun from a car and pointed it at the victim. Durrell testified that Mr. Moore stepped in front of the victim to defuse the situation and Defendant lowered his gun. The victim said: \"He brought that whole gun out here but he's not going to use it.\" One of Defendant's friends urged Defendant to \"get at the [victim].\" Defendant began shooting the victim and continued to shoot as the victim fell to the ground. Defendant then ran away. Durrell said that neither he, the victim nor Mr. Moore were armed at the time of the shooting. A few days after the shooting, he gave a statement to the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Ms. Williams testified that, on the day of the shooting, Durrell and the victim were together on Allen Street. Ms. Williams received a telephone call from her friend informing her that Durrell and \"others\" were arguing at the apartment complex in the 2100 block of Allen Street. Ms. Williams and Mr. Moore drove to the complex. Ms. Williams told Durrell and the victim to get into her car; however, they did not do so. Someone drove up and handed something to the person the victim had been arguing with. That person walked back to the victim and pointed a gun at him. At that point, Mr. Moore stood in front of the victim and convinced the gunman to lower his weapon. As Mr. Moore and Durrell had testified before her, Ms. Williams stated that someone urged the gunman to shoot, he shot the victim multiple times, even after the victim fell to the ground, and then the gunman ran away. Ms. Williams called 911. She testified that\n   the victim, Mr. Moore and Durrell were unarmed at the time the shooting started. Ms. Williams also testified that the victim did not make any gesture to suggest he had a gun. After witnessing the shooting, Ms. Williams went to the victim's mother's house, told her that the victim was shot by \"Cliff\" and gave the victim's mother an Instagram picture of \"Cliff.\" Ms. Williams spoke to the police and identified Defendant as the gunman from a photo lineup shown to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Dr. Michael Defatta, the State's expert in forensic pathology, performed an autopsy on the victim's body and rendered a report of his findings. Dr. Defatta noted that the victim suffered four gunshot wounds - one each to his right arm, head, right chest and left leg. The fatal wounds were to the victim's head and chest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Sgt. Mark Boudreaux, the State's firearm expert, testified he received a 9-millimeter weapon and eight 9-millimeter casings for testing. Boudreaux test fired the 9-millimeter weapon. He compared the rounds he test-fired to the eight 9-millimeter casings obtained from the crime scene and the victim's autopsy. He concluded that the all of the 9-millimeter casings he received were fired by the same gun, and that the gun was the same 9-millimeter weapon confiscated from Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The defense recalled Det. Ward, who confirmed that he took a statement from Durrell on March 29, 2013, during which Durrell said his nickname was \"Ruger.\" Det. Ward stated that a \"Ruger\" was, to his knowledge, a type of firearm. He also remembered Durrell referring to guns as \"burners.\" On cross-examination, Det. Ward clarified that Durrell's statement indicated three guns were on the scene of the shooting - the weapon used by Defendant, and the guns Durrell believed were in the possession of two of Defendant's associates. Det. Ward reaffirmed that Durrell never stated that he, Mr. Moore, or the victim were armed at the time of the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The next defense witness was Lamont Anderson (\"Mr. Anderson\"), who admitted to currently being incarcerated. Mr. Anderson recounted the events of March 23, 2013, stating that when he came home from school that afternoon, he and someone named \"Dominique\" got into an argument. Defendant stepped in to de-escalate the argument. Dominique and Defendant then walked away. Dominique then called the victim who arrived on the scene and began arguing with Defendant because he thought Defendant was the person who had argued with Dominique. The victim threatened Defendant and called him names. The victim then \"went to reach - went to get a gun from Dominique.\" The victim clutched the gun in the waistband of his pants. When the shooting started, Mr. Anderson ran inside. He admitted he did not witness the actual shooting. Mr. Anderson also conceded that his sister and Defendant were involved in a dating relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On cross-examination, Mr. Anderson stated that he was currently in jail with Defendant. Mr. Anderson said he lied when he told the district attorney on multiple occasions and told the detective right after the shooting that he did not see the victim at all on the day of the shooting. He also admitted he never told the detective that he saw the victim clutching a gun. Mr. Anderson stated that he was inside for some minutes \"talking, fussing\" with his mother before he heard the gunshots. He stated that he never saw any firearms on the day of the shooting. Instead, he said he only saw the victim holding the waistband of his pants. However, during further questioning, Mr. Anderson once again stated he saw \"Dominique\" give the victim a gun. However, Mr. Anderson stated Dominique\n   gave a gun to the victim a few minutes before the shooting, when he got home \"around three o'clock\" in the afternoon. The prosecutor established that Mr. Anderson was wrong about the time frame as the victim was actually shot about three hours later. The prosecutor also impeached Mr. Anderson with a statement he made to the jury that he had not spoken to Defendant in a month, yet in a phone call from jail, Mr. Anderson stated he spoke to Defendant a couple of days before the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    Errors Patent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   A review of the record reveals one patent error. Defendant's motion for new trial was denied on May 17, 2017, after which the trial judge immediately sentenced Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   La. C.Cr.P. art. 873 states, in pertinent part, that if a motion for new trial is filed, sentence shall not be imposed until at least twenty-four hours after the motion is denied, unless the defendant expressly waives the delay. \"[T]he failure to observe the twenty-four-hour delay mandated by Article 873 is harmless where the defendant does not complain of his sentence on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Duncan,\n   </em>\n   2011-0563, p. 8 (La.

Nevertheless, \"[a]bsent a showing that prejudice resulted from the failure to afford the statutory delay, reversal of the prematurely imposed sentence is not required.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

R.S. 14:21 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Thus, the issue we must address is whether the State presented sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the homicide was not justified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   At trial, the jury was presented with two versions of the circumstances leading up to the victim's shooting death. The State presented the testimony of Mr. Moore, Durrell and Ms. Williams, each of whom testified that Defendant was the aggressor in the altercation. Although both the victim and Defendant were involved in a verbal confrontation, Ms. Williams testified that it was Defendant who escalated the conflict by retrieving a firearm from a nearby vehicle and returning to the scene to continue the argument with the victim. All three of the State's witnesses reported that Defendant was armed and the victim was not. Additionally, these witnesses reported that Defendant pointed the gun at the victim while the victim was unarmed, that the victim made no threatening gestures or physical contact toward Defendant, and the victim never physically behaved as if he was reaching for a weapon. Mr. Moore testified that, although he attempted to quell the dispute by standing between the victim and Defendant, Defendant raised his weapon and began shooting after being urged to do so by one of his associates. Mr. Moore's testimony was corroborated by both Durrell and Ms. Williams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The jury also heard testimony from the State's witnesses to indicate that Defendant fired multiple shots, including shots fired after the victim had fallen. Also, instead of reporting that he acted in self-defense at the time of the shooting, Defendant ran away from the scene of the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendant argues, as evidence that he acted in self-defense, that he never denied shooting the victim but claimed self-defense immediately. Defendant's claim is belied by the record, however, as he initially denied being at the scene of the crime and denied that he even knew the victim. The jury heard and read his recorded statement and made its own credibility determinations. Defendant was heard admitting to the shooting of the victim, allegedly in self-defense, only after he was confronted by law enforcement with the significant evidence against him, including witnesses who placed him at the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The defense's version of the shooting, on the other hand, centered on the theory that the victim, Mr. Moore and Durrell were affiliated with a gang named \"Money Over Everything\" but no definitive evidence supported this claim and, specifically, no evidence was offered to show the victim was a gang member. Although the defense attempts to attack the credibility of Mr. Moore and Durrell based on the fact they were both serving time for violent crimes, the jury was made aware of the witnesses' incarceration and crimes and made its own assessment of the weight to be given to their testimony. Also, the testimony of Ms. Williams corroborated Mr. Moore's and Durrell's accounts and the defense did not discredit her testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Furthermore, '[t]he determination of credibility is a question of fact within the sound discretion of the trier of fact and will not be disturbed unless clearly contrary to the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Richards\n   </em>\n   , 2011-0349, p. 9 (La.

Most of the defense argument that the victim was a threat to Defendant was contingent on the testimony of Mr. Anderson, who was thoroughly discredited at trial. Mr. Anderson did not see the shooting itself and could not counter the eyewitness testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Mr. Anderson's trial testimony contradicted his earlier statements to the district attorney and the detective that he did not see the victim at all on the day of the shooting. He also stated at trial that he saw the victim clutching a gun, an account he had not previously provided to law enforcement. The prosecutor established that Mr. Anderson was wrong about the time frame of the shooting and then impeached Mr. Anderson with a false statement he made to the jury that he had not spoken to Defendant in a month when, in fact, he had spoken with him just days before the trial. Finally, Mr. Anderson conceded that he was currently jailed with Defendant and that Defendant was involved in a relationship with Mr. Anderson's sister. The jury rejected his testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Based upon the evidence the State presented at trial, we find a rational trier of fact could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the killing carried out by Defendant was not justified. Moreover, under the standard of\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

Defendant asserts that this evidence would have shown the bad character of the victim and prior threats made by the victim, and by ruling the evidence inadmissible, the trial court unfairly restricted his ability to present his self-defense claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    State v.

The defense presented the testimony of Mr. Anderson, who reported for the first time at trial, having given contradictory statements to law enforcement and the district attorney on several occasions prior to trial, that the victim threatened to kill Defendant and that he witnessed the victim clutching a weapon during the verbal dispute between Defendant and the victim. However, Mr. Anderson's trial testimony was not given until\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the defense had moved to admit and been precluded from admitting character evidence of the victim. The defense did not re-urge its argument that the evidence should be admitted after Mr. Anderson had testified. Thus, at the time the trial court's ruling was made, the only evidence before the court was the eyewitness testimony establishing that the victim was both unarmed and did not behave in a threatening manner toward Defendant and no overt act showing aggression on the part of the victim was presented. Based on the record before this Court, the trial court did not err by excluding character evidence of the victim at trial as there was no appreciable evidence of an overt act by the victim.
