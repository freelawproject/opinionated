Defendant pled not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity to both charges. After the appointment of a sanity commission and consideration of its report, the trial court found Defendant competent to stand trial. The issue of sanity at the time of the offense was reserved for trial. Defendant also raised the affirmative defense of voluntary intoxication under La.R.S. 14:15(2). The jury found Defendant guilty of second degree murder, and not guilty of obstruction of justice. The trial court heard and denied Defendant's motion for new trial and motion for post-verdict judgment of acquittal. At the sentencing hearing held on March 27, 2018, Defendant received the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment at hard labor to be served without the benefit of probation, parole or suspension of sentence. Defendant now appeals his conviction and sentence. For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On April 7, 2014, police were dispatched to the Bowman Hicks apartments, in response to a call that a black male was running around with a knife chasing people and stabbing someone. Upon arrival, Officer Froehlich and Officer Frank were pointed in the direction of Unit 56, the apartment of Ralph Johnson, who witnesses identified as the person who committed the stabbing. The officers arrested Ralph Johnson for aggravated battery for stabbing Michael Kirklin. When officers were later informed the victim had died, Ralph Johnson was charged with second degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Nadia Whiting testified that, the night before the incident, she and Defendant smoked PCP at her apartment, but noted\n   that Defendant was not acting erratically. However, according to Ms. Whiting, the next day, Defendant returned to her apartment and was talking to \"Leroy\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   about he wanted to cook some crack, but he had some cocaine, but he didn't have enough cocaine. And Leroy wasn't gonna do it and he was mad.\" When Defendant's request was denied, he became angry and left.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Whiting testified that when Defendant returned to her apartment, he was very angry and threatening to kill everyone who was at her apartment. He then attempted to cut into the screen on Ms. Whiting's front door with a knife, at which point she called the police and he left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Other residents of Bowman Hicks apartments testified that Defendant then began threatening a group of teenage boys, who Defendant believed were mocking him. Eye-witness accounts and video evidence show that when Michael Kirklin, the victim, told Defendant to \"chill out\" Defendant then began to chase him, wielding his knife and threatening him. The victim ran into the home of Laura Kirklin, his grandmother, and Defendant followed him. Laura Kirklin testified through perpetuated video testimony obtained prior to trial\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   that Defendant attacked her and held a knife to her stomach. According to the testimony of Cletoria Kirklin, the victim's younger cousin, the victim rushed out of the apartment and punched Defendant in an attempt to stop Defendant from attacking his grandmother. Cletoria Kirklin further testified that the victim threw a chair at Defendant, who then began chasing the victim, at which point the victim slipped and fell. Defendant got on top of the victim and immediately began stabbing him. According to Cletoria Kirklin's testimony, Defendant stabbed the victim five or six times. Lauranna Kirklin, another cousin of the victim, also testified that Defendant stabbed the victim multiple times, then he stood up and ran to his house, dropping the knife as he ran.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The State called a total of ten witnesses who presented eye-witness accounts of the events on April 7, 2014. The State also submitted into evidence a cellphone video taken by Jahiem Kirklin, a cousin of the victim, which depicted the actions of Defendant prior to the murder. Another cellphone video was submitted into evidence by the State from Terrance \"T.J.\" Merritt, a friend of the victim, which clearly showed Defendant stabbing the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The State also presented a video of Defendant's post-arrest interview statement to Detective West on April 7, 2014. Defendant's account of events prior to the stabbing matches most of the eye-witness testimony. According to the video interview, Defendant stated that he had a knife because he was going after Leroy to get his money back because Leroy sold him baking soda instead of crack. Defendant also stated that when he was headed to Leroy's apartment, a group of teenage boys started to tease him, then the victim hit him with a chair. Defendant stated that \"Mike got in the way\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   but claims that he does\n   not remember what happened. Later in the interview, when questioned about the knife, Defendant was not able to recall whether he had a knife. According to Defendant's statements in the video interview, he did not remember anything about stabbing the victim, stating that he only remembered getting hit with a chair and then going to jail, but nothing in between those two events.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Sanity Commission Proceedings\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On June 11, 2014, Defendant entered pleas of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity. The trial court appointed a sanity commission composed of Dr. James Anderson and Dr. Garrett Ryder, who issued reports finding Defendant competent to stand trial. On May 1, 2015, the trial court issued an amended order directing Dr. Ryder and Dr. Anderson to supplement their initial evaluations with their findings as to Defendant's state of mind at the time of the offense. At the hearing on the motion to determine mental capacity, the doctors found that Defendant had the mental capacity and competency to proceed to trial and that he was sane at the time of the offense, and they so testified at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Trial and Post-Trial Proceedings\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At trial, the State presented the testimony of multiple eye-witnesses, the officers who came into contact with Defendant on the date of his arrest, and the doctors appointed to the sanity commission. The defense presented testimony of a detective, a deputy, and Mr. Carlos Robinson. The State recalled Dr. Anderson as a rebuttal witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The jury returned a verdict of guilty of second degree murder and not guilty on the charge of obstruction of justice. The trial judge ordered a pre-sentence investigation (PSI) and set sentencing for March 27, 2018. On November 30, 2017, Defendant filed a motion and order for new trial and/or motion for post-verdict judgment granting acquittal. At a hearing on January 11, 2018, the trial court denied Defendant's motions. At the March 27, 2018 sentencing hearing, the trial court considered the PSI, which indicated that Defendant was a fourth felony offender. In accordance with La.R.S. 14:30.1, second degree murder, the trial court sentenced Defendant to the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment at hard labor to be served without the benefit of probation, parole or suspension of sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant now timely appeals his conviction and sentence asserting two assignments of error through counsel and two assignments of error through a pro se brief filed by Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant submits the following counselled assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   1.

Specifically, Defendant argues that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he had the specific intent to kill due to his defenses that he was either insane at the time of the offense or that he was so intoxicated that he could not form specific intent. Alternatively, Defendant argues he was provoked such that a responsive verdict of manslaughter should be applicable, not second degree murder.

The jury heard from Dr. Ryder and Dr. Anderson, both of whom were accepted as experts in the field of forensic psychiatry. Both testified that Defendant was competent to stand trial. Both testified that they did not find Defendant to have any mental disease that would affect his ability to distinguish right from wrong at the time of the offense. Specifically, Dr. Ryder testified that Defendant's behavior at the time of the offense showed linear, goal-oriented thinking, consistent with a person who knew right from wrong and who was able to control his actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendant argued that he was suffering from a concussion at the time of the offense, claiming that the victim hit him in the head with a chair before Defendant began stabbing him. According to the testimony of the State's witnesses, there are varying reports as to whether Defendant was hit with a chair, who may have hit Defendant with a chair and where, and at what point during these events Defendant was hit with a chair, if at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   More to the point, the testimony of the interviewing detective, Detective West, stated that Defendant did not complain of any head injuries during booking, nor did he see any physical signs of injury on Defendant. Furthermore, Dr. Anderson, expert forensic psychiatrist, testified that nothing in Defendant's behavior in his interview video would indicate to him that Defendant suffered a concussion. Given the expert testimony that Defendant was not insane at the time of the stabbing and the inability of Defendant to prove he was concussed from being hit with a chair before he started stabbing the victim, there is sufficient evidence for the jury to have found that Defendant had the requisite specific intent at the time of the offense.

Some of the State's witnesses did testify that Defendant was a known drug user, and they believed Defendant to be high on the day of the incident. His demeanor on that day was abnormal, and he was acting differently than he usually does when high on drugs. Detective West testified that he believed Defendant was intoxicated, but he did not find his behavior indicated any sort of mental disturbance. Furthermore, Dr. Anderson noted that when Defendant's blood was tested on April 13, 2014, six days after his arrest, it was positive for cocaine metabolites and PCP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   However, the fact that Defendant was high is not sufficient to negate specific intent. Defendant's intoxication must be so severe that it precluded an ability to form specific intent in order for his intoxication to be an affirmative defense.

Both Dr. Anderson and Dr. Ryder testified that the cellphone videos of the events of April 7, 2014, depicted Defendant's actions to be the result of logical, calculated thinking. In particular, both experts testified that Defendant's decision to leave Ms. Whiting's home and get a knife from his own apartment to cut through her screen door and force his way inside showed intentional thought. Defendant then began chasing the victim with the knife, screaming, \"come get it,\" clearly evidencing an intent to kill the victim. When the victim went inside his grandmother's house, Defendant began attacking the victim's grandmother, who was on the porch. The victim then came out of the house and intervened in an effort to protect his grandmother. When the victim accidentally fell, the defendant then immediately pounced on the victim, stabbing him several times, resulting in the victim's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Based on our independent review of all of the evidence, we find that it was reasonable for the jury to have concluded that Defendant did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that intoxication precluded him from forming the specific intent to kill the victim. We find no abuse of the jury's discretion in its verdict of guilty of second degree murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Alternative Defense: Responsive Verdict of Manslaughter\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Lastly, in his counselled brief, Defendant argues that if neither affirmative defense is applicable, then Defendant should be found guilty of no more than the responsive verdict of manslaughter. In this regard, La.R.S. 14:31(A)(1) provides that manslaughter is \"[a] homicide which would be murder under either Article 30 (first degree murder) or Article 30.1 (second degree murder), but the offense is committed\n   in sudden passion or heat of blood immediately caused by provocation sufficient to deprive an average person of his self-control and cool reflection.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Defendant asserts that he was provoked when he was being mocked by a group of boys, including the victim. Defendant also asserts that he was provoked when he was hit in the head with a chair by the victim. At closing arguments, defense counsel argued that before being \"hit with a chair,\" Defendant and the victim were only using their fists, and that it was being hit with the chair that sent Defendant into a rage that was sufficient to deprive an average person of cool reflection. Arguments of counsel are not evidence, and the jury was able to see the video and hear all the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \"In reviewing defendant's claim, this court must determine whether a rational trier of fact, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, could have found that the mitigatory factors were not established by a preponderance of the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Lombard,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7596130\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/486/106/#p111\">\n    486 So.2d 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 111 (La.1986) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Defendant has provided no support for his contention that \"being ridiculed\" would be a sufficient provocation \"to deprive an average person of his self-control and cool reflection\" such that a second degree murder should be considered manslaughter. Furthermore, Defendant's alternative claim that he was provoked when the victim hit him in the head with a chair is likewise without support based on our review of all the evidence. Although someone randomly coming up to Defendant and hitting him in the head with a chair might be sufficient provocation to attack that person in self-defense, that is not what the witness testimony was in this case. Nearly every eye-witness, regardless of whether they saw the victim hit Defendant with a chair, agreed that Defendant had been chasing teenagers around with a knife, threatening to kill someone prior to his confrontation with the victim. He specifically threatened to kill the victim and chased the victim to his grandmother's home. Furthermore, the videos from Jahiem Kirklin and \"T.J.\" Merritt clearly show Defendant waving a knife around in a threatening manner, with Jahiem's video showing Defendant chasing after the victim at his grandmother Laura Kirklin's apartment telling him to \"come get it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Finally, Defendant can be seen on video shoving Laura Kirklin directly in front of her own door with his left hand while holding the knife in his right hand roughly fifteen seconds before he stabbed the victim to death. Defendant's argument essentially asks this court to ignore the fact that he was chasing the victim with a deadly weapon threatening to kill him, then physically battering the victim's grandmother immediately before the victim confronted him, and then jumping on top of the victim when the victim fell and was helpless, stabbing him multiple times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Our independent review of the record does not support that Defendant proved the requisite mitigating factors by a preponderance of the evidence such that the jury was clearly wrong in returning a verdict of second degree murder instead of manslaughter. To the contrary, the evidence clearly indicates that Defendant threatened the victim and stabbed the victim multiple times after chasing and threatening to kill him. We find that there was sufficient evidence to convict Defendant of second degree murder, and the jury was not clearly wrong in rejecting the responsive verdict of manslaughter. Accordingly, this assignment of error lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Assignment of Error Two: Challenge for Cause\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Defendant asserts that the trial court erred in denying defense counsel's challenge for cause of three jurors. Defendant argues that the trial court's denials amount to an abuse of discretion, therefore entitling him to a reversal of his conviction and sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Defendant contends that the challenges for cause were valid because each juror showed some form of partiality. Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure Article 797 governs the grounds on which either party may challenge a potential juror for cause, and provides in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   (2) The juror is not impartial, whatever the cause of his partiality.

With individual liberty-and, in capital cases, life-at stake, it is the defendant's prerogative, not counsel's, to decide on the objective of his defense: to admit guilt in the hope of gaining mercy at the sentencing stage, or to maintain his innocence, leaving it to the State to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Following the holding and reasoning in\n   <em>\n    McCoy\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611469\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1500/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 1500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Louisiana Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    State v.

In the present case, Defendant offered no objection to defense counsel's alternative defense of manslaughter. Defendant's trial counsel stated in his closing argument:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   [S]econd degree murder has responsive verdicts. And if you don't want to go along with the justification defense, or the intoxication defense, or the insanity\n   defense, you still have to look at all the elements for each one of those responsive verdicts .... But, the fact of the matter is Ralph Johnson was provoked. And that provocation led to, like I said, if you don't want to go with the insanity plea or the intoxication plea, it led to him having the specific intent to kill. So, if our affirmative defenses are not to your satisfaction, at [worst] Ralph is guilty of manslaughter, not second degree murder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Defendant asserts that these arguments by trial counsel amount to an admission of Defendant's guilt to the charge of second degree murder. We disagree. We find that counsel's arguments are not a specific admission of Defendant's specific intent, but are clearly presented as an alternative argument for the jury to consider a responsive verdict of manslaughter. Defense counsel's argument thus properly addresses a statutorily provided responsive verdict to second degree murder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La.Code Crim.P. art. 814. Furthermore, nothing in the record indicates Defendant ever objected to defense counsel's alternative argument asserting the responsive verdict of manslaughter.

During voir dire, the State used its second peremptory challenge on Mr. Byron Jones and defense counsel asked the record to reflect that Mr. Jones was African-American.

However, with regard to Mr. Byron Jones, the State's reason for challenging Mr. Jones was a belief that Mr. Jones was disinterested and not paying attention. The trial court ruled that a race-neutral reason was given. Defendant asserts the trial court's decision to deny his\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge as to Mr. Jones was erroneous.

Third, the trial court then must determine if the opponent of the strike has carried the ultimate burden of proving purposeful discrimination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Defendant contends that the trial court erred in failing to carry out the third step of the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   analysis by not determining whether the State was being intentionally discriminatory when exercising its peremptory challenge of Mr. Jones.

In this situation, the trial court must evaluate not only whether the prosecutor's demeanor belies a discriminatory intent, but also whether the juror's demeanor can credibly be said to have exhibited the basis for the strike attributed to the juror by the prosecutor.
