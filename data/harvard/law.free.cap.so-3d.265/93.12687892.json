We affirm Defendant's convictions and sentences, but we remand this matter to the trial court to more fully inform Defendant of the provisions of La.Code Crim.P. art. 930.8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On the night of April 11, 2016, Robert Short (\"Short\") was working at his business,\n   Busy Bee Towing, in Scott, Louisiana. While outside with a tow truck driver, he saw five men pass, then double back and pass again. Shortly thereafter, he saw Defendant pass on a bicycle, followed by another man. Later, he saw the pair returning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After the tow truck driver left, Short went into his office, locked the door, and worked at his desk. The office door had a large translucent oval-shaped window and Short was able to see that Defendant and another man were trying to look through the door window. Short then armed himself with a handgun he kept in the office and called emergency services. With guns visible, the Defendant and the other man kicked open the front door, leaving foot prints on the door, and initially fled when they saw Short armed inside. However, as Short rushed toward the open door, Defendant ran back toward the office door and pointed his handgun at Short. Short shot Defendant just outside the office door, and both the offenders fled. When law enforcement responded, they found Defendant moaning and bleeding in the tow yard, Short had security cameras and was able to provide officers with surveillance footage of the confrontation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURE AND TRIAL\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 15, 2016, the State filed a bill of information charging Defendant with aggravated burglary, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, and aggravated assault with a firearm. On July 27, 2016, the State filed an amended bill charging him with attempted first degree murder, a violation of La.R.S. 14:27 and La.R.S. 14:30, and reiterated the other two charges. Later on June 12, 2017, the State filed yet another amended bill of information, ultimately charging Defendant with three counts: Count 1, attempted second degree murder, a violation of La.R.S. 14:27 and La.R.S. 14:30.1 ; Count 2, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, a violation of La.R.S. 14:95.1 ; and Count 3, aggravated burglary, a violation of La.R.S. 14:60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 26, 2017, the parties selected a jury, and the case continued to trial. After hearing evidence on September 26 and 27, 2017, the jury deliberated and found Defendant guilty of a lesser-included offense, attempted manslaughter, on the first count, and guilty as charged on the other two counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 22, 2018, the trial court sentenced Defendant to fifteen years for attempted manslaughter, ten years and a $ 1,000 fine for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, and twenty-five years at hard labor for aggravated burglary. The trial court imposed the sentences concurrent to each other, except for five years for Defendant's possession of a firearm as a prior convicted felon which was imposed consecutive to the other sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendant, represented by appellate counsel, now seeks review by this court, assigning four errors: (1) The evidence introduced at the trial of this case, when viewed under the\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

After carefully reviewing the record, we find one error patent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The record shows the trial court advised Defendant at sentencing that he has \"two years to file any post-conviction relief petitions that he may be entitled to.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure Article 930.8 provides the defendant has two years\n   <em>\n    after the conviction and sentence become final\n   </em>\n   to seek post-conviction relief. Considering the specific provisions of La.Code Crim.P. art. 930.8, we find the trial court's advisement was insufficient because it failed to alert the Defendant that the two years commenced with the rendition of our opinion in this court. Therefore, we direct the trial court to inform the Defendant of the provisions of La.Code Crim.P. art. 930.8 by sending written notice to the Defendant within ten days of the rendition of this opinion and to file written proof in the record that the Defendant received the notice.\n   <em>\n    State v.

We have carefully viewed the video and observe that although the camera was mounted on a post aimed at the front door, it is somewhat difficult to determine to what extent Defendant's hand or arm protruded into Short's office. Nonetheless, the video clearly shows Defendant's right foot and leg crossed the threshold of the door as he kicked it. Despite Defendant's contention that his hand did not cross the threshold, Short, who was off to one side of the entry door, unequivocally testified Defendant's and the other offenders' \"hands were in the building.\" Juries are not required to abandon common sense and life experiences when they enter a jury room.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In making this argument, Defendant rests his contention on three arguments: (1) Short's testimony was inconsistent; (2) the testimony of Detective Caleb Lege (\"Detective Lege\") of the Scott Police Department was also inconsistent; and (3) the physical evidence shows that no round was chambered in the weapon and thus contradicts Short's testimony that Defendant pulled the trigger of the weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Attempt is defined by La.R.S. 14:27, which states in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Any person who, having a specific intent to commit a crime, does or omits an act for the purpose of and tending directly toward the accomplishing of his object is guilty of an attempt to commit the offense intended; and it shall be immaterial whether, under the circumstances, he would have actually accomplished his purpose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Manslaughter is defined, in pertinent part, by La.R.S. 14:31 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (1) A homicide which would be murder under either Article 30 (first degree murder) or Article 30.1 (second degree murder), but the offense is committed in sudden passion or heat of blood immediately caused by provocation sufficient to deprive an average person of his self-control and cool reflection.

As the record shows, Short testified that Defendant pointed a pistol at him and pulled the trigger. Defendant acknowledges in brief that pointing a firearm at another person and pulling the trigger is evidence of specific intent to kill, but he attacks Short's credibility. However, Defendant argues that Short's original statement to police did not mention that Defendant pulled the trigger. He also points out that Short's memory of the timeline of events did not match that of the officers who responded to the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   From the outset, we find that Short's incorrect temporal perception or memory of the relevant events is not fatal to the State's case. Although the victim testified the relevant events took place at about midnight, the responding officers testified they were called out to the scene at about 2:00 a.m. Nonetheless, it is clear from the video evidence that the incident occurred generally as Short described it in his testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Moreover, we have carefully viewed the security footage. Although the video evidence may not definitively show that Defendant pulled the trigger, it does clearly show Defendant retreated and then rushed back to the office door, stopped in the doorway, and pointed his pistol at Short, who was standing just feet away. As to whether Defendant pulled the trigger, Short's testimony is that Defendant not only pointed the weapon, he also pulled the trigger of the weapon. \"It is well-settled that a jury is free to believe some, none, or all of any witness's testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Perkins\n   </em>\n   , 11-955, p. 10 (La.App. 3 Cir. 3/7/12),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7026318\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/85/810/#p817\">\n    85 So.3d 810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 817.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In addition to Short's victim testimony, the jury also heard Detective Lege's investigative testimony regarding the recovery of the Defendant's weapon at the scene. On cross-examination Detective Lege testified that Defendant's gun had not been fired. However, later Detective Lege told the jury that his earlier testimony did not mean the trigger had not been pulled. To the contrary, he said when the gun was taken into police custody and examined, the trigger mechanism indicated the trigger had been pulled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Lastly, we now turn to Defendant's argument that physical evidence of the absence of a chambered-round in the gun contradicts the testimonies of Short and Detective Lege that Defendant pulled the trigger. The record does show that Detective Lege testified that there was not a round in the chamber when police recovered the Defendant's weapon. Without engaging in speculation regarding Defendant's knowledge of how to operate firearms, the record reflects that the jury was presented with evidence that Defendant's actions indicate that he thought he had a weapon ready to fire and tried to shoot Short with it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   standard of review is highly deferential to the fact finder as it\n   \"gives full play to the responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182418\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/307/\">\n    443 U.S. at 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182418\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/307/\">\n    99 S.Ct. 2781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It was up to the jury, not us as a reviewing court, to determine fact questions, such as whether the Defendant pointed a pistol at the victim and pulled the trigger. We, as a reviewing court, should not second-guess that determination. Considering the totality of the evidence and viewing that evidence most favorably to the prosecution, we find the record reflects that the State has satisfied its burden of proving the elements of the crime of attempted manslaughter beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, this assignment of error lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    THE VERDICT FORM\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In his third assignment of error, Defendant argues the trial court erred when it sent the jury back to clarify the jury form. He argues that the first verdict form returned a verdict of not guilty which conformed with the trial court's instructions. Arguing that the first verdict was legal, Defendant contends the trial court should have accepted it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Our review of the record shows that after being properly instructed on the completion of the verdict form, the jury returned a verdict form that said, \"as to Count 1: Not Guilty\" and then on the blank line between Count 1 and Count 2, the jury handwrote \"Guilty of Attempted Manslaughter.\" Finding it unclear what the jury verdict was as to Count 1 and after discussion with the attorneys, the trial court filed the verdict form under seal. It then addressed the jury about Count 1:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   I sent you back ... so that your jury verdict form would conform to instructions that I gave you. At this point what I will do is I will read those instructions again that are applicable to the filling out of that jury instruction form.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   If you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of attempted second degree murder, your verdict should be guilty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   If you are not convinced that the defendant is guilty of attempted second degree murder but you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of attempted manslaughter, the form of your verdict should be Guilty of attempted manslaughter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   If you are not convinced that the defendant is guilty of second degree murder but you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of aggravated battery, the form of your verdict should be Guilty of aggravated battery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   If you are not convinced that the defendant is guilty of attempted second degree murder but you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of aggravated assault with a firearm, the form of your verdict should be Guilty of aggravated assault with a firearm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   If the State has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of either the offense charged or the lesser responsive offense, the form of your verdict should be Not guilty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   After the trial court re-instructed the jury,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   it remanded the jury for further\n   deliberation in conformity with its instructions. After re-deliberation, the jury returned the second jury form that said \"guilty of attempted manslaughter\" as to Count 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure Article 809 states: \"After charging the jury, the judge shall give the jury a written list of the verdicts responsive to each offense charged, with each separately stated. The list shall be taken into the jury room for use by the jury during its deliberation.\" Louisiana Code of Criminal Procedure Article 810, in pertinent part, further states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   When a verdict has been agreed upon, the foreman shall write the verdict on the back of the list of responsive verdicts given to the jury and shall sign it. There shall be no formal requirement as to the language of the verdict except that it shall clearly convey the intention of the jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   As an ancillary to La.Code Crim.P. art. 810, La.Code Crim.P. art. 813 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   If the court finds that the verdict is incorrect in form or is not responsive to the indictment, it shall refuse to receive it, and shall remand the jury with the necessary oral instructions. In such a case the court shall read the verdict, and record the reasons for refusal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In conformity with La.Code Crim.P. art. 813, the trial court in the present case stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   The original jury verdict form that came in, I placed it under seal. That one said, \"Count 1, attempted second degree murder. We the jury find the defendant not guilty.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   And then on the second line guilty attempted manslaughter. Count 2 felony possession of a firearm, we find the defendant guilty. Count 3, aggravated burglary, we find the defendant guilty. And then they had signed and dated it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   The original count 1 when it refers to attempted second degree murder is not in conformity with my instructions. They did not find that he was - that the case was proven beyond a reasonable doubt. They were instructed to find him guilty of either a lesser and included responsive charge or not guilty. By actually putting \"We find the defendant guilty of\" whatever, exactly like I had read into the record. That's not what it did. It came out and said not guilty and then guilty of something.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   In an abundance of caution my reading, even though we all have a feeling of what this should be read, it says: Not guilty, guilty of attempted manslaughter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   So I didn't want to interpret what the jury was finding. So, therefore, I found it not in conformity with the requirements of the jury charge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   As the trial court explained, the first jury verdict clearly was \"incorrect in form\" under La.Code Crim.P. arts. 810 and 813. Simply stated, the first jury verdict did not clearly convey the jury's intention. In accordance with La.Code Crim.P. art. 813, the trial court properly refused to receive the first verdict, properly re-instructed the jury, and properly returned the jury for further deliberation with a new verdict form. In the present case, the trial court neither suggested what the verdict should be nor implied that the first verdict was incorrect other than as to its form. To the contrary, the trial court simply told the jury, \"I sent you back ... so that your jury verdict form would conform to instructions that I gave you.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

He was still claiming to be the victim and he was saying it wasn't him, even though the video was clear and he was the individual who had gotten shot upon entering the business.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   But I will give him some consideration for his act of remorse today, as well as the consideration, some mitigated, for the family unit that was involved in the person who his wife testified him to be. [sic] Despite that, I have a list of aggravating factors, including a previous history of prior felonies, of guns being used, him being on parole, the lack of remorse up until today. And the fact that he left, basically, the scene where the incident happened and then he came back and pointed the gun at the victim where there was testimony of him pulling the trigger.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   I also note the lack of his prior aggravating crimes. With that being said, -- or crimes of violence, I should say. With that being said, I think the appropriate sentence, the gun, the third felony conviction and everything, on the aggravated burglary the top of the sentence is hard labor not less than one nor more than thirty years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   I think the appropriate sentence on that for Mr. Latique would be 25 years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   On the manslaughter, it's hard labor not more than twenty because he was convicted of an attempted manslaughter. So, with that, I think the appropriate sentence is fifteen years. That will run concurrent with the aggravated burglary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   On the convicted felon in possession of a firearm, not less than ten nor more than twenty without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence,\n   and fine of not less than $ 1,000 nor more than $ 5,000, there will be $ 1,000 fine. But on the sentence part, it will be ten years hard labor without benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. Five to run concurrent with the aggravated burglary, and five to run consecutive to the aggravated burglary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Our review of the trial court's detailed, particularized reasons shows that the Defendant was a repeat felon.

Notwithstanding Defendant's assertion, when we review the totality of the trial court's reasons for sentencing, it becomes apparent to us that Defendant's possession of the weapon was clearly overshadowed by the trial court's concern with the danger that weapon posed to the victim as an aggravating factor.

It is well-settled that appellate courts have no authority to review facts not contained in the trial court record. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Waguespack\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7529161\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/589/1079/\">\n    589 So.2d 1079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La.App. 1 Cir. 1991),\n   <em>\n    writ denied\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7484873,7484786,7484827,7484899\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/596/209/\">\n    596 So.2d 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La. 1992) ;\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, we pretermit discussion of this issue as we have no record of this alleged encounter to review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    DISPOSITION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   We affirm Defendant's convictions and sentences. We direct the trial court to inform Defendant of the provisions of La.Code Crim.P. art. 930.8 by sending written notice to the Defendant within ten days of the rendition of this opinion and to file written proof in the record that the Defendant received the notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED; REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    Prior to the trial court's jury re-instruction, the trial court denied Defendant's motion for a mistrial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    This was the sentencing range at the time the offense was committed. By Acts 2017, No. 281 \u00a7 1, the legislature changed the sentencing range.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    The right of sequestration is now governed by La.Code Evid. art. 615(A), which states:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n    On its own motion the court may, and on request of a party the court shall, order that the witnesses be excluded from the courtroom or from a place where they can see or hear the proceedings, and refrain from discussing the facts of the case with anyone other than counsel in the case. In the interests of justice, the court may exempt any witness from its order of exclusion.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    This language is similar to that of former La.Code Crim.P. art. 764.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
