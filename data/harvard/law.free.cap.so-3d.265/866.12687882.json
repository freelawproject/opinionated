Atkins\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff/appellant, James Chapman, seeks to appeal the trial court's denial of his motion for summary judgment in which he sought a judgment of possession based on ten-year acquisitive prescription. This Court does not have appellate jurisdiction over a denial of summary judgment. For the reasons that follow, we convert the appeal to an application for supervisory writ, grant the writ, but deny the relief requested by Mr. Chapman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   James Chapman purchased the property at 308-310 Cherokee Street from the City of New Orleans on June 14, 2005, for $ 15,000.00. The City previously obtained ownership of the same property via tax sale in August 1988 after Ms. Dorothy Settles failed to pay her property taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The City of New Orleans held the property for approximately 17 years before Mr. Chapman purchased the property at a Sheriff's auction in 2005 pursuant to former La. R.S. 33:4720.11 (repealed in 2008). The Act of Sale between the City of New Orleans and Mr. Chapman provides: \"pursuant to La. R.S. 33:4720.11, et seq., Seller does hereby grant, bargain, sell, convey, assign, transfer, set over and deliver, without warranty of title, but with full substitution and subrogation in and to any and all actions of warranty which it has or may have against any and all preceding owners or vendors, unto Purchaser, the [property].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2016, having held the property for more than ten years, Mr. Chapman filed a Petition for Declaratory Judgment by Adverse Possession, which named the prior owner, Ms. Dorothy M. Settles, as the defendant. Mr. Chapman's petition alleges that he has been in possession of the property as owner since the Act of Sale, June 14, 2005; he has openly possessed and maintained the property as his own, without interruption; and he has continued to pay taxes on the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ms. Settles filed an Answer and Reconventional Demand, denying that Mr. Chapman could own the property because, Ms. Settles claims, she did not receive actual notice of the tax sale in accordance with her due process rights. The reconventional demand states that Ms. Settles acquired the property through a Judgment of Possession issued in succession proceedings in 1983. Ms. Settles' reconventional demand further acknowledges that Mr. Chapman purchased a claim over the subject property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mr. Chapman filed a motion for summary judgment seeking a judgment of possession based on ten-year acquisitive prescription. In opposition to the motion for summary judgment, Ms. Settles and her son submitted affidavits indicating that P.O. Box 764 was never a proper address for Ms. Settles. She argued that Mr. Chapman is not entitled to ten-year acquisitive prescription because he does not hold just title.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the summary judgment hearing, the court found that the tax collector was required to send to each taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested, notice of the delinquency and the sale, pursuant to former La. R.S. 47:2180, which was in effect at the time of the sale. The district court denied the motion for summary judgment, stating that \"it is unclear whether Ms. Settles received proper notice of the sale,\" and asked counsel for Ms. Settles to prepare a written judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mr. Chapman timely appealed the district court's ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This Court may not determine the merits of an appeal unless its jurisdiction is properly invoked by a final judgment.\n   <em>\n    Tomlinson v.

The trial court signed the Judgment denying Chapman's motion for summary judgment on July 11, 2018. The denial of a motion for summary judgment is not a final appealable judgment. La. C.C.P. art. 968 ;\n   <em>\n    Clark v. Legion Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   , 2002-2487, p. 6 (La.

However, this Court in its discretion may convert an appeal to a supervisory writ application when certain criteria are met, as expressed in\n   <em>\n    Mandina, Inc. v. O'Brien\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   In certain circumstances, this court has exercised its discretion to convert an appeal of an interlocutory judgment that is not immediately appealable into a supervisory writ application ... when the following two circumstances both are present: (i) the motion for appeal has been filed within the thirty-day time period allowed for the filing of an application for supervisory writs under Rule 4-3 of the Uniform Rules, Courts of Appeal. (ii) When the circumstances indicate that an immediate decision of the issue sought to be appealed is necessary to ensure the fundamental fairness and judicial efficiency, such as where reversal of the trial court's decision would terminate the litigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   2013-0085, pp. 8-9 (La.

In addition, we find the second prong of the\n   <em>\n    Mandina\n   </em>\n   test is met, because a reversal of the trial court's ruling would effectively terminate the litigation. Finding the\n   <em>\n    Mandina\n   </em>\n   test satisfied, we exercise our discretion to convert Mr. Chapman's appeal to a supervisory writ application, and grant a writ to address the parties' arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This Court has stated the standard of review on summary judgment as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Appellate courts review the grant or denial of a motion for summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo,\n   </em>\n   using the same criteria applied by trial courts to determine whether summary judgment is appropriate. This standard of review requires the appellate court to look at the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, to determine if they show that no genuine issue as to a material fact exists, and that the mover is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. A fact is material when its existence or nonexistence may be essential to the plaintiff[']s cause of action under the applicable theory of recovery; a fact is material if it potentially insures or precludes recovery, affects a litigant's ultimate success, or determines the outcome of the legal dispute. A genuine issue is one as to which reasonable persons could disagree; if reasonable persons could reach only one conclusion, no need for trial on that issue exists and summary judgment is appropriate. To affirm a summary judgment, we must find reasonable minds would inevitably conclude that the mover is entitled to judgment as a matter of the applicable law on the facts before the court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   The summary judgment procedure is designed to secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of actions. Summary judgments are favored, and the summary judgment procedure shall be construed to accomplish these ends.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Chatelain v. Fluor Daniel Const. Co.\n   </em>\n   , 2014-1312, p. 3 (La.

C.C. art. 3475\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   because the property is susceptible to acquisitive prescription; he has been in open possession of the property since the sale in 2005; at the time of the sale, he was in good faith; and the Act of Sale from the City constitutes \"just title.\" In addition, Mr. Chapman claims that he has continued to maintain the property and pay taxes on it. He claims there has been no interruption\n   of his possession since 2005 and points out that Ms. Settles does not dispute this contention. Mr. Chapman further states that Ms. Settles was properly notified of the tax sale but admits in his pleadings that there is no proof of service by certified mail. Nevertheless, Mr. Chapman argues that due to his peaceful possession for more than ten years, he is entitled to the benefit of ten-year acquisitive prescription based on his good-faith ownership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A possessor is in good faith when he reasonably believes that he is the owner of the thing he possesses. La. C.C. art. 3480 ; La. C.C. art. 3481.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"It is sufficient that possession has commenced in good faith; subsequent bad faith does not prevent the accrual of prescription of ten years.\" La. C.C. art. 3482.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In opposition, Ms. Settles argues that Mr. Chapman is not entitled to a judgment of possession through ten-year acquisitive prescription because he did not obtain title from a titled owner. Ms. Settles argues that the 2005 Act of Sale from the City is a non-warranty deed, \"without warranty of title,\" equivalent to a quitclaim deed, which is insufficient to begin the running of ten-year good-faith acquisitive prescription. She argues that Mr. Chapman cannot acquire the property through acquisitive prescription until he has had uninterrupted possession for 30 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Ms. Settles also alleges that the deed or title that the City passed to Mr. Chapman is an absolute nullity because she did not receive proper notice of the sale. Affidavits submitted by Ms. Settles and her son state that the \"P.O. Box 764\" address in Washington DC was never a valid address for Ms. Settles. Additionally, Ms. Settles argues that advertisements prior to the sale were not sufficient to prove notice to the owner to satisfy due process protections under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, citing\n   <em>\n    Lewis v. Succession of Johnson\n   </em>\n   , 05-1192, p. 12 (La. 4/4/06),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8446516\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/925/1172/#p1179\">\n    925 So.2d 1172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1179.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Settles evidently does not dispute that the tax sale was advertised; rather, she claims that such advertisements were insufficient to protect her due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment and Article VII, \u00a7 25 of the Louisiana Constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, it is not clear from the record whether Ms. Settles could have been \"identified or easily discovered,\" thereby necessitating that she receive written notice under\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Moreover, the 2005 Act of Sale was confected pursuant to La. R.S. 33:4720.11\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (now repealed), but the parties have not addressed whether the modified notice provisions found in\n   La. R.S. 33:4720.12 (2)(b) (now repealed),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   if adhered to, might have constituted sufficient notice of the 2005 sale.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Laney v. City of New Orleans ex Rel. Dept. of Finance,\n   </em>\n   2005-0521, p. 7 (La.

Again, the evidence in the record does not establish whether Ms. Settles was \"absent or unable to be served in accordance with Subparagraph (2)(a)\" of La. R.S. 33:4720.12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In light of the material issues of fact that have not been resolved, we decline to determine whether, if a tax sale is adjudged an absolute nullity for lack of sufficient notice, the tax sale purchaser's presumed good faith (pursuant to La. C.C. art. 3482 ) at the time of the transfer and his \"just title\" (pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Clifton v.
