Eric Sharkey was found guilty of two counts of armed robbery and one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon and received three sentences-fifteen years for each armed robbery and ten years for possession, all to run concurrently. Sharkey appeals his convictions and sentences. Finding no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62. Eric Sharkey, Madison Magee, and Marvin Bolden were indicted on two counts of armed robbery and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. The State moved to amend Sharkey's indictment to reflect his status as a habitual offender.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   No argument was raised in opposition. The trial court found Sharkey to be a habitual offender under Mississippi Code Section 99-19-81 (Rev. 2014). The State also was allowed to exclude the specific sentences of Sharkey's codefendants, both of whom had entered a guilty plea to the same crime.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63. During Sharkey's trial, Don Patterson, Woodrow Berry, Bolden, and Magee gave essentially the same account of the facts. Berry was visiting Patterson when both men were robbed by Sharkey, Bolden, and Magee. Bolden came in Patterson's home and asked for beer, cigarettes, and change for a $ 100 bill. Patterson told him that he did not have change. Magee then entered Patterson's home with a gun and ordered Patterson and Berry to lie face down on the floor. When Sharkey came inside, Magee told him to check the back bedrooms. Sharkey attempted to remove a television from one of the back bedrooms, but it fell. When Sharkey came back into the living room, Patterson noticed that Sharkey had Patterson's pistol. Magee then told Sharkey to get the television from the living room. Sharkey took the television outside and then came back into the house. As Magee began looking for drugs, Sharkey told Magee to hurry up and to get out of the house. Magee took Patterson's watch, ring, wallet, and Berry's money. Patterson testified that, aside from those items and the television, a gun, whiskey, and medicine were also taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64. Patterson testified that Sharkey was the only person who entered his bedroom, where his pistol was located. Patterson and Berry testified that the three men were all working together. Both men testified that Sharkey had tattoos on his neck and face.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65. Kevin Hinds, a patrol lieutenant for the Stone County Sheriff's Department, testified that he responded to a call regarding an armed robbery. Hinds identified Sharkey as one of the men he had arrested for the armed robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66. Captain Ray Boggs with the Stone County Sheriff's Office testified that he spoke with Patterson, who informed him that Patterson and Berry had been robbed at gunpoint. Patterson knew Bolden by name and was able to give a description of the other men. Once Boggs got to the scene of the arrest, he noticed a light-skinned, African-American male with tattoos on his face in the front passenger seat. Boggs, both at the scene and at trial, identified the passenger as Sharkey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67. Boggs searched the vehicle and found a \"Hi-Point 40 caliber pistol tucked in the [front passenger] seat.\" He also found a silver .380 pistol tucked between the front seats. In addition to the weapons, Boggs found bottles of medication prescribed to Patterson, a television, a watch, a diamond ring, and money. Boggs testified that Patterson came to the sheriff's office and identified his recovered items, including the .40 caliber pistol. Boggs showed Patterson and Berry photographic lineups, and both were able to identify Sharkey as one of the men who had robbed them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68. Immediately before the State rested, the trial court read an agreed stipulation to the jury that Sharkey previously had been convicted of the felony uttering a forgery. Sharkey moved for a directed verdict on all three counts; his motion was overruled. Sharkey elected not to testify in his defense, and no other witnesses were called.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b69. The jury was instructed and found Sharkey guilty of all three counts. Sharkey was found to be a habitual offender and was sentenced to a term of fifteen years for Count I, fifteen years for Count II, and ten years for Count III, to run concurrently. Sharkey's motions for a new trial or, alternatively, a judgment notwithstanding the verdict were denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT OF THE ISSUES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610. On appeal, Sharkey raises the following issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    I. WHETHER THE VENIRE WAS TAINTED, RENDERING SHARKEY'S TRIAL UNFAIR.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. WHETHER THE PROSECUTION'S GIVING NONVERBAL SIGNALS TO A STATE'S WITNESS DURING THAT WITNESS'S TESTIMONY WAS IMPROPER.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    III. WHETHER THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN REFUSING A DURESS JURY INSTRUCTION.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. WHETHER THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN REFUSING LESSER-INCLUDED-OFFENSE INSTRUCTIONS FOR ROBBERY OR LARCENY.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    I. WHETHER THE VENIRE WAS TAINTED, RENDERING SHARKEY'S TRIAL UNFAIR.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b611. Sharkey argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for mistrial. He urges that he is entitled to a new trial, because during voir dire the jurors were informed that witnesses Bolden and Magee had been indicted, had pled guilty, and were serving time for the same crime for which Sharkey was on trial. One venire member responded that he would have \"a little trouble getting over the statement about the other two being convicted. ...\" The State interrupted and asked to approach the bench. During the bench conference, the venire member indicated that he had already formed an opinion about Sharkey's guilt. He was struck for cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b612. Sharkey moved for a mistrial. In opposing the motion, the State argued that (1) the statement was made during voir dire and was not evidence, (2) a guilty plea was less prejudicial than a conviction by a jury, and (3) the State anticipated calling both men to testify. The State informed the court that it would not ask either witness about their guilty pleas unless Sharkey inquired about them on cross-examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b613. The trial court found that the State should not have mentioned the guilty pleas in voir dire and directed the State not to reference the pleas during examination. The trial court denied the motion for mistrial. Sharkey did not question either Bolden or Magee about their guilty pleas, and the State did not mention the pleas during their testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b614. This Court employs an abuse-of-discretion standard of review to determine whether a trial judge erred in denying a request for a mistrial.\n   <em>\n    Pitchford v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7038451\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/45/216/#p240\">\n    45 So.3d 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 240 (Miss. 2010). A trial judge need declare a mistrial only \"when there is an error in the proceedings resulting in substantial and irreparable prejudice to the defendant's case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7038451\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/45/216/#p240\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Parks v.

The jury's verdict was supported by the overwhelming evidence adduced at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b615. We find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's denial of the motion for mistrial. The statement was made during voir dire, and the only juror who told the court that he could not be impartial in light of the two accomplices' convictions was excused for cause. When Magee and Bolden were called as witnesses, their pleas and sentences were not discussed. Sharkey failed to present evidence that he\n   had suffered substantial or irreparable prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II. WHETHER THE PROSECUTION'S GIVING NONVERBAL SIGNALS TO A STATE'S WITNESS DURING THAT WITNESS'S TESTIMONY WAS IMPROPER.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b616. Sharkey claims that the prosecutor erred by giving a nonverbal cue to a witness during the witness's testimony. During direct examination of Patterson by the State, the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Q. Could you see anything on the defendant that stood out to you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Q.

In\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   , the record was clear that the prosecutor admittedly made a hand gesture, signaling his witness to \"go ahead and now give the information that the Court had previously ruled as inadmissible. ...\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7560015\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/539/1049/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7560015\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/539/1049/\">\n    at 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b618. Today's case is distinguishable, because the record does not reflect that the prosecutor gave any hand signals to the witness in front of the jury. We find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling Sharkey's objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    III. WHETHER THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN REFUSING A DURESS JURY INSTRUCTION.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b619.

Sharkey offered a proposed jury instruction on his affirmative defense of duress. Sharkey contends that he did not willingly agree to participate in the robbery and complied with Magee's commands out of fear of being shot. Sharkey submits that duress was a theory of his defense; therefore, he was entitled to proposed jury instruction D-18. In denying the instruction, the trial court noted that no evidence was offered that Sharkey was afraid of Magee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b621.

While Sharkey's attorney suggested in his opening statement and closing argument that Sharkey was in fear of Magee and committed the robbery under duress, no evidence was offered to support that suggestion. Sharkey failed to offer any evidence that he was threatened in any way while he was committing the crime. Because Sharkey failed to introduce evidence to support a defense of duress, he was not entitled to a jury instruction on duress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Sharkey argues that the trial court erred in denying his proposed jury instructions on simple robbery and petit larceny. Sharkey contends that he did not know a robbery was going to occur and that he did not actively join in the robbery. Sharkey argues that he is entitled to a new trial because the jury was not allowed to consider the lesser-included offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b624. With regard to Sharkey's claim that he was entitled to a lesser-included-offense instruction, this Court conducts a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review, because this is a question of law.\n   <em>\n    Downs v.

The majority is correct that there is no reversible error. But I write separately to address the propriety of both the State and the defendant probing potential jurors about their\n   <em>\n    biases\n   </em>\n   and preconceived views of accomplice guilty pleas. I suggest such inquiries are within the trial judge's discretion when an accomplice has pled guilty and is expected to testify.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b631. It is obvious to our bench and bar that criminal practice has changed tremendously in recent years. Gone are the days of demurrers and slews of much simpler one count, one defendant indictments. Multi-defendant, multi-count prosecutions-where defendants, through plea agreements, become accomplice witnesses-now comprise much of our criminal dockets. And unfortunately, until today, this Court has had very little opportunity to specifically discuss in any great depth whether parties may inquire into potential jurors' biases for or against these types of witnesses who have accepted plea bargains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b632. Without question, voir dire is the appropriate procedural stage for the parties to test whether prospective jurors are challengeable for cause. And one immediate and obvious cause for removal is\n   <em>\n    bias\n   </em>\n   . \"Trial judges must scrupulously guard the impartiality of the jury and take corrective measures to insure an unbiased jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Scott v.

Indeed, a \"circuit judge has an absolute duty ... to see that the jury selected to try any case is fair, impartial and competent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7505628\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/595/848/#p850\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing Miss.

Jurors bring with them a variety of life experiences and preconceived notions when they enter a courtroom. Individual views about self-interest, favorable treatment, leverage, motivation, and credibility run the gamut in cases involving accomplice testimony. Some potential jurors harbor very negative and hardened views of the veracity of a codefendant who cuts a plea deal and then shows up repackaged as a State witness. They may see the witness as a \"snitch\" not to be trusted. Other venire members cling to a completely opposite preconceived idea-that because an accomplice has already admitted guilt, the accused defendant must be guilty too.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b634. Here, the State probed the venire about their views of the accomplice guilty pleas. This resulted in the later scenario presenting itself-the judge removing a biased juror for cause. And I agree with the majority that there was no reversible error in this process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b635. With that said, I am quite aware and respectful of our longstanding precedent that evidence of an accomplice's guilty plea or conviction is not competent substantive evidence to prove the remaining defendant's guilt by association.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, it is never admissible for that purpose. To be clear, I am not suggesting we overrule this hornbook premise. But that is not what this case is about.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b636. Here, the State did not hold out the accomplices' guilty pleas as substantive evidence that Sharkey was guilty simply because he associated with them. Instead, the State questioned potential jurors about their preconceived views and biases about accomplice guilty pleas. Our evidentiary rules certainly authorize ferreting out bias and self-interest at trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   And this court has sanctioned inquiry into possible promises of leniency and the disposition of criminal charges pending against state witnesses, noting these are proper areas for\n   questioning.\n   <em>\n    Hall v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7598986\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/476/26/\">\n    476 So.2d 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Miss. 1985) (holding defendant was entitled to question witness to determine if possible motives or promises exist);\n   <em>\n    Fuselier v.

While we have never addressed the pointed question of probing jurors about accomplice guilty pleas, other jurisdictions routinely permit the practice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Perhaps the Kentucky Supreme Court put it best:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   It has long been the rule in this Commonwealth that it is improper to show that a co-indictee has already been convicted under the indictment. However, ... [the rule] bars only the \"blatant use of the conviction of a co-indictee as substantive evidence of guilt of the indictee now on trial.\" ... [To the contrary], a statement posed during voir dire is not substantive evidence. Secondly, it is quite routine practice for the Commonwealth to question prospective jurors about whether previous charges or convictions of its witnesses and/or deals made with them by the Commonwealth will prohibit the jurors from giving such witnesses a fair hearing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    Mayse v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7325375\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/422/223/#p226\">\n    422 S.W.3d 223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 226 (Ky. 2013) (internal citations and quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b637. Furthermore, while I have the utmost respect for my dissenting colleague, I strongly disagree with the dissent's assertion that the mere mention of an accomplice's guilty plea always amounts to reversible error-unless the defendant desires to bring it up. Such a view misses the intent of the original rule, is one sided, and is not the law in Mississippi. And I have not found a single American court that shares this notion in cases like this, where the plea agreement is not being offered as substantive evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b638. We must keep in mind that the original prohibition against mention of accomplice\n   guilty pleas was aimed to curb a sharp practice that is not at issue here-the State offering an accomplice's confession,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   guilty plea,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   or evidence that the accomplice had been convicted by a prior jury\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   as substantive evidence of the remaining defendant's guilt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b639. Instead of recognizing this distinction, the dissent brushes with broad strokes, stretching the original protection beyond its intended purpose. In doing so, it places heavy emphasis on\n   <em>\n    Ivy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Johns\n   </em>\n   , and similar cases like\n   <em>\n    McCray v. State\n   </em>\n   , in which this Court's \"primary concern [was] with the consequences\" of a deputy circuit clerk being called as a witness to introduce \"a certified copy of the co-indictee's conviction and sentence\" as\n   <em>\n    substantive evidence\n   </em>\n   of the remaining defendant's guilt.\n   <em>\n    McCray v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9653196\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/293/807/#p807\">\n    293 So.2d 807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 807-08 (Miss. 1974). It is also quite a leap for the dissent to claim that\n   <em>\n    McCray\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ivy\n   </em>\n   noted that \"defendants have a 'constitutional right' that protects them from having the guilt of their co-indictee made known.\" Dis. \u00b6 64. Neither of those cases say that. Rather, what was violative of the defendant's rights to a \"fair trial\" in\n   <em>\n    McCray\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ivy\n   </em>\n   was the State's use of an accomplice's guilty plea and another jury's guilty verdict as substantive evidence of the defendants' guilt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McCray\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9653196\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/293/807/#p807\">\n    293 So.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   808-09 ;\n   <em>\n    Ivy\n   </em>\n   , 301 So.2d at 293. Once more, that is not what happened here and is not what this case is about.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b640. Another pertinent truth that the dissent misses is that in recent years our Court has consistently refused to reverse where accomplice guilty pleas were broached-even by the State-for purposes other than substantive evidence. On balance, I find that\n   <em>\n    stare decisis\n   </em>\n   requires this Court to also recognize these more recent precedents-several of which expressly distinguish the very cases the dissent relies on and illustrate that the dissent's narrative is overly broad and incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b641. For example, in\n   <em>\n    White v. State\n   </em>\n   -a post-rules-of-evidence case, in which the State informed the venire \"that White's accomplices had earlier pled guilty to the burglary at issue\"-this Court found no reversible error in mentioning the guilty pleas to the venire or in the later testimony about them.\n   <em>\n    White v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7468646\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/616/304/#p305\">\n    616 So.2d 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 305 (Miss. 1993). Justice Banks, writing for the unanimous Court in\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   , coined the disclosure of the codefendants' guilty plea testimony as \"essentially an evidentiary issue.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7468646\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/616/304/#p305\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7468646\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/616/304/#p305\">\n    at 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court did not treat it as a constitutional violation or view it as the death knell that the dissent suggests. Rather, quite to the contrary, our Court openly acknowledged that \"[f]ederal and state appellate courts have found the admission of a co-conspirator's plea of guilty, while incompetent as substantive evidence of the defendant's guilt, may be admissible for other purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7468646\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/616/304/#p305\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Credibility issues are always front and center in cases built on accomplice testimony. And there is no rational reason why either the State or defendant should be hamstrung from addressing early on the inherent biases that are always afoot on jury panels about guilty pleas of accomplices expected to testify. Mention of such\n   plea agreements could be made as early as voir dire or opening, addressed through vigorous impeachment by the defendant when cross examining an accomplice, or brought up preemptively by the State to blunt credibility attacks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Any mention could certainly be accompanied by a limiting instruction crafted to caution the jury accordingly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b646. Contrary to the dissent's assertion, the pendulum obviously swings both ways on this issue. As the Missouri Court of Appeals has noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   Such\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   questions are allowed as being relevant because, any time the State enters into a plea agreement with a witness, the issues of bias and self interest arise, since plea agreements are \"double-edged swords,\" that not only support a witness'[s] credibility by showing an interest to testify truthfully, but also impeach a witness'[s] credibility by showing an interest in testifying favorably for the government, regardless of the truth.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <em>\n    State v.

App. 2001) (internal citations and quotations omitted). And one thing is certain, at least as far as voir dire is concerned. If this Court were to accept the dissent's view and find reversible error or grounds for a mistrial with any mention of an accomplice's guilty plea during voir dire, neither the State nor the defendant will ever uncover the lurking biases and preconceived notions about a question undoubtedly on the jurors' minds-an issue which history has shown will at some point in trial rear its head.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   RANDOLPH, C.J., BEAM, CHAMBERLIN AND GRIFFIS, JJ., JOIN THIS OPINION.

The overruling of this objection and admission of this testimony was reversible error. The law is well settled in this state that whe[n] two or more persons are jointly indicted for the same offense but are separately tried, a judgment of conviction against one of them is not competent evidence on the trial of the other because such plea of guilty or conviction is no evidence of the guilt of the party being tried.... Not only was this testimony designed to lead the jury to believe that since Pitts had plead [sic] guilty to the charge, that his co-indictee, Buckley, was also guilty, but it was also designed to bolster the testimony of Pitts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11297288\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/223/524/#p528\">\n    223 So.2d at 527-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   \u00b655. In\n   <em>\n    Ivy\n   </em>\n   , the Court reiterated these principles:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   The jury thus had before it evidence of the co-indictee's conviction and sentence from which it could very likely conclude that Ivy was guilty because his associate and co-indictee was convicted and sentenced, or more modernly put, the jury could find that he was guilty by association.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   We have consistently held evidence of this nature to be\n   <em>\n    inimical to fair trial\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <em>\n    Ivy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9604121,9604243\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/301/292/\">\n    301 So.2d at 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   \u00b656. These prior decisions all assign as error use of evidence of a co-indictee's conviction and sentence. That being beyond dispute, the question becomes whether the error requires reversal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   \u00b657. The State argues that the error here was harmless because the statement was made during\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   and was not introduced into evidence. First, this Court has suggested that this type of error falls under a \"definitive standard\" that requires reversal as a violation of a defendant's right to a fair and impartial trial, rather than a \"case-by-case evaluation of [harmless] error\" analysis:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   The very essence of liberty and justice requires that fundamental rights be measured and enforced by certain standards and uniform rules. These standards should not be compromised to attain a good but temporary purpose\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   since it is inevitable that some wrong will be found to exist under any rule, and extreme cases will arise making a departure from fixed principles seem advantageous for the moment. It is this Court's opinion, however, that adherence to a definitive standard will result in less injustice and enhance stability in law in the long run more than would a case-by-case evaluation of error to determine whether it was 'harmless,' 'probably harmless,' 'not so harmless,' 'harmful,' 'grossly harmful,' the last category equating to prejudice, requiring reversal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <em>\n    McCray\n   </em>\n   , 293 So.2d at 809-10. The\n   <em>\n    McCray\n   </em>\n   Court made this decision after observing that this particular issue, which implicates a defendant's \"fundamental right to a fair trial,\" cannot be deemed harmless, even when the evidence points heavily to the defendant's guilt:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   This is not one of those cases for the application of the rule that a conviction will be affirmed unless it appears that another jury could reasonably reach a different verdict upon a proper trial than that returned on the former one, but rather it is a case where the constitutional right of an accused to a fair and impartial trial has been violated. When that is done, the defendant is entitled to another trial\n   <em>\n    regardless of the fact that the evidence on the first trial may have shown him to be guilty beyond every reasonable doubt\n   </em>\n   . The law guarantees this to one accused of crime, and until he has had a fair and impartial trial within the meaning of the Constitution and Laws of the State, he is not to be deprived of his liberty by a sentence in the state penitentiary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 809 (emphasis added) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Scarbrough v.

Second, the prejudicial nature of the statement is not somehow lost because it was said during\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   rather than in the evidentiary stage of trial. In\n   <em>\n    McCray\n   </em>\n   , the prosecutor revealed the co-indictee's conviction in his opening statement,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 807, and opening statements, like statements made in\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   , do not constitute evidence.\n   <em>\n    Slaughter v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9447347\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/815/1122/#p1132\">\n    815 So.2d 1122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1132 (\u00b6 53) (Miss. 2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   \u00b659. Third, the reason that the Court has announced this rule many times is demonstrated by this record. The prosecutor gratuitously and improperly revealed that the codefendants, both of whom were State's witnesses, had been adjudicated\n   guilty of the offense for which Sharkey was about to be tried. In response to the prosecutor's revelation, a potential juror said, in the presence of the entire venire, \"I have a little trouble getting over the statement about the other two being convicted.\" During the subsequent bench conference, the venireman affirmed the following statement: \"Since those two men have pled guilty and this man is here, it makes you feel that he's guilty also.\" The venireman articulated, clearly and succinctly, the principal reason Mississippi courts have adhered to the rule for more than one hundred and fifty years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   \u00b660. The other reason courts disallow the prosecution's revelation of the convictions or guilty pleas of co-indictees is that they inform the jury that a judicial determination has been made respecting the\n   <em>\n    corpus delicti\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the crime.\n   <em>\n    West\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=169%20So.%20770\">\n    169 So. at 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This signals to the jury that it need not decide whether a crime has occurred, only whether\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   defendant had a part in committing it. This is a problem that this Court has found prejudicial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   \u00b661. Even if this Court were inclined to overrule its holding in\n   <em>\n    McCray\n   </em>\n   , which it has not done, the error in the present case cannot be deemed harmless. This Court has suggested that, under the right circumstances, a statement pertaining to the guilt of a co-indictee can be cured by proper and timely instruction from the trial judge. In\n   <em>\n    Reid v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9742917\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/266/21/#p27\">\n    266 So.2d 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 27 (Miss. 1972), the district attorney revealed, during\n   <em>\n    voir dire\n   </em>\n   , that a codefendant of Jimmy Reid had been tried and sentenced the week before his trial began. Reid moved for a mistrial, which was denied.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9742917\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/266/21/#p27\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9742917\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/266/21/#p27\">\n    at 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In affirming that decision, this Court explained that \"[t]he trial judge promptly instructed the jury to disregard any statement relative to the trial of anyone else and did everything in his power to erase from the minds of the jury the remarks of the district attorney.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9742917\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/266/21/#p27\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The trial court also granted a jury instruction that further admonished the jury to \"give absolutely no thought to the verdict of the former jury[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9742917\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/266/21/#p27\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This Court determined that any prejudice resulting from the error had been cured by the trial court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9742917\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/266/21/#p27\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   \u00b662. But\n   <em>\n    Reid\n   </em>\n   does not extend to those cases in which the trial court undertakes no curative action after a defense objection. Indeed, courts throughout the United States have recognized that, after a co-indictee's guilt is revealed, a trial court's failure to instruct the jury or to otherwise cure the prejudice necessarily renders the error reversible as opposed to harmless.\n   <em>\n    Babb v.

The special concurrence also implies that our one-hundred-and-fifty year old rule somehow restricts defendants from addressing the guilt of their co-indictees. However, the accused is not hamstrung by the rule. As noted in\n   <em>\n    McCray\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ivy\n   </em>\n   , defendants have a \"constitutional right\" that protects them from having the guilt of their co-indictee made known.\n   <em>\n    McCray\n   </em>\n   , 293 So.2d at 809 (This \"is a case where the\n   <em>\n    constitutional right\n   </em>\n   of an accused to a fair and impartial trial\" has been implicated.)

If the accused determines that the benefit of potentially uncovering bias outweighs the prejudice from which he enjoys constitutional protection, then he is free to waive that constitutional protection.\n   <em>\n    Hannah v.

By contrast, the State has no constitutional right against having the guilt of a defendant's co-indictee exposed. \"[T]he United States Constitution protects individuals from government action[,]\" not the government from individual action.\n   <em>\n    Dissmeyer v.

I fail to see how the prejudice this issue causes is at all diminished by any changes in our criminal practice, especially when this record so poignantly demonstrates otherwise. Although the prosecutor's purpose in this case ostensibly was to uncover bias-as opposed to offering the prior guilty pleas as substantive evidence-the revelation of the prior guilty pleas induced a\n   <em>\n    venire\n   </em>\n   member to believe the defendant was guilty by association with his already convicted codefendants.

To reiterate, the prejudice in this case was compounded by Juror Number 42's announcement, in the presence of the entire\n   <em>\n    venire\n   </em>\n   , that \"I have a little trouble getting over the statement about the other two being convicted.\" In light of this statement, the other prospective jurors were left to wonder whether they too had trouble getting over the revelation, especially in the absence of a judicial admonition to disregard it. On this record, we cannot know how the jurors were affected, because they were not polled, and the circuit court did not otherwise instruct the jurors following the defense's objection. The circuit court should have ordered a mistrial.

Twelve men must concur in preferring a charge of felony before one can be held to answer; and twelve men, elected, impaneled, and sworn to try the issue joined, must concur in a verdict of guilty before the humblest can by our law be deprived of his liberty; and such is the jealousy with which trial by jury is guarded that, when it is made to appear that\n   <em>\n    anything has occurred which may have improperly influenced the action of the jury\n   </em>\n   , the accused will be granted a new trial,\n   <em>\n    although he may appear to be ever so guilty\n   </em>\n   , because it may be said that his guilt has not been ascertained in the manner prescribed by law, and every one is to be judged by the law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <em>\n    Lamar v.
