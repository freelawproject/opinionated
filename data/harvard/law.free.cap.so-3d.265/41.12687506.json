Lombard, Judge Rosemary Ledet, Judge Tiffany G. Chase )\n </judges>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Judge Rosemary Ledet\n   This is a mesothelioma case. The narrow issue presented is whether the trial court abused its discretion in granting the plaintiff's motion to dismiss one of multiple defendants without prejudice, mooting the dismissed defendant's pending motion for summary judgment. Finding no abuse of discretion, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In June 2016, James Sizemore,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   a South Carolina resident, commenced this suit for damages against multiple defendants. Mr. Sizemore averred that he was diagnosed with mesothelioma due to his work-related exposure to asbestos from 1962 to 2009. During that period, he worked as a welder, pipefitter, and boilermaker at numerous industrial facilities, including shipyards, paper mills, and power plants. The facilities at which he worked were located in numerous states, including Louisiana and South Carolina. In July 2016, Mr. Sizemore filed a supplemental and amended petition adding Viking Pump, Inc. as a defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Because Mr. Sizemore's asbestos exposures from certain defendants occurred exclusively in other states, certain defendants moved for dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction and certain defendants moved for dismissal based on\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens.\n   </em>\n   In response, the plaintiff dismissed those defendants and filed a second suit in South Carolina state court in 2016 (the \"South Carolina Case\"). Viking was not one of the defendants who moved for dismissal based on lack of jurisdiction and\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After answering the petition, Viking filed three motions for summary judgment. It filed its first motion in July 2017; it filed renewed motions in September 2017 and in April 2018. Viking's trio of motions was based on lack of product identification. Citing\n   <em>\n    Lucas v. Hopeman Bros., Inc\n   </em>\n   ., 10-1037 (La. App. 4 Cir. 2/16/11),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7033763\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/60/690/\">\n    60 So.3d 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Viking contended that it was entitled to summary judgment because jobsite-only circumstantial evidence is insufficient to preclude summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 17, 2018, the plaintiff's counsel emailed Viking's counsel a proposed joint motion to dismiss without prejudice. According to Viking, it was given no notice that a week earlier, on April 9, 2018, the plaintiff amended his petition in the South Carolina Case to add Viking as a defendant. On April 23, 2018, Viking filed an \"Objection to Dismissal without Prejudice.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In support, Viking characterized\n   any forthcoming motion to dismiss without prejudice as \"a veiled, eleventh hour attempt to transfer [the plaintiff's] claims against Viking Pump to South Carolina and [thus] avoid a hearing on Viking Pump's pending Motion for Summary Judgment.\" Viking requested that its motion for summary judgment be granted and that the plaintiff's claims against it be dismissed with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In response, the plaintiff filed a \"Reply to Viking Pump, Inc.'s Objection to Dismissal without Prejudice.\" With its reply memorandum, the plaintiff filed a rule to show cause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court set the plaintiff's rule to show cause for a hearing on July 6, 2018-the same date that Viking's motion for summary judgment was set for hearing. In its reply memorandum, the plaintiff contended that a voluntary dismissal without prejudice of all his claims against Viking was proper and necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 28, 2018, Viking filed an \"Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion to Dismiss without Prejudice.\" At the July 6, 2018 hearing, the trial court granted the plaintiff's motion to dismiss without prejudice and denied Viking's motion for summary judgment as moot. This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Viking contends, as it did in the trial court, that the plaintiff's motion to dismiss without prejudice should not have been granted for the following two reasons:\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (i) the motion was untimely filed, given the trial court's scheduling order; and (ii) the purpose of the motion was to transfer the plaintiff's claims against Viking to the South Carolina Case and to avoid a hearing on Viking's pending summary judgment motion. An abuse of discretion standard applies in reviewing the trial court's ruling on both issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   We separately address each issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Violation of Pre-Trial Scheduling Order\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Addressing modifications of pre-trial scheduling orders, this court in\n   <em>\n    McDuffie\n   </em>\n   observed as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The matter of whether to modify the pre-trial order is solely within the discretion of the trial judge. Absent an abuse of discretion, the decision of the trial judge will be upheld. In deciding whether to modify a pretrial order, a trial court must be ever mindful of the fact that the objective of our legal system is to render justice between the litigants upon the merits of the controversy rather than to defeat justice upon the basis of technicalities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   00-2779, p. 3, 781 So.2d at 631. The jurisprudence also has observed that \" La.C.C.P. Art. 1551 authorizes the trial court to modify pre-trial orders to prevent 'manifest injustice' \" and that \" La. C.C.P. Art. 1551 does not authorize severe limitation of a party's rights for the technical, though justifiable, violation of a pretrial order.\"\n   <em>\n    Neff v.

The decisions also indicate the following guidance in determining whether a dismissal without prejudice would constitute an abuse of discretion:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n    The injury which would thus be occasioned to the defendant must be of a character that deprives him or her of some substantive rights concerning defenses not available in a second suit or that may be endangered by the dismissal, and not the mere ordinary inconveniences of double litigation which in the eyes of the law would be compensated by costs. Moreover, the mere fact that the plaintiff intends to institute, or in fact institutes, another suit on the same cause of action is not a sufficient ground for a denial of his or her motion to discontinue an action.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    27 C.J.S.\n    <em>\n     Dismissal and Nonsuit\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 27 (citing\n    <em>\n     Betz v.

Viking emphasizes that it has engaged in two years of extensive, expedited discovery and contends that it is entitled to a dismissal with prejudice on its summary judgment motion. The plaintiff counters that \"all of Mr. Sizemore's exposures to asbestos from Viking's pumps occurred in South Carolina, where an action is pending against other defendants\" and that the discovery that has been taken in this case may be used in the South Carolina Case. The plaintiff also contends that judicial efficiency supports the trial court's ruling granting his motion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    Agreeing with the plaintiff, the trial court, at the hearing, questioned Viking's counsel whether the discovery that Viking had done in this case could be used in the South Carolina Case. Viking's counsel answered in the affirmative but argued that Viking was entitled to a dismissal with prejudice based on its motion for summary judgment. The trial court disagreed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    On appeal, Viking again contends that the trial court was required to grant its\n    motion for summary judgment under La. C.C.P. art. 966 and that the trial court \"had no discretion to disregard summary judgment in favor of dismissal without prejudice.\" We disagree. Contrary to Viking's contention, the trial court had the discretion to grant the motion to dismiss absent evidence that Viking would have been deprived a just defense or would have lost substantive rights. Viking failed to establish either.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Summarizing, given the discovery Viking has done in this case can be used in the South Carolina Case coupled with Viking's failure to establish that as a result of the dismissal it would be deprived of a just defense or lose substantive rights, we cannot conclude the trial court abused its wide discretion in granting the motion to dismiss without prejudice.\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      DECREE\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    <strong>\n     AFFIRMED\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"10\">\n    <p id=\"p-51\">\n     Viking further points out that the motion to dismiss (rule to show cause), filed on June 7, 2018, was untimely because it should have been filed no later than April 30, 2018.
