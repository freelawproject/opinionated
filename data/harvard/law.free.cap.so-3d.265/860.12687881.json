We affirm in part, reverse in part, and render.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A.D. and J.P. have two minor daughters, B.P., six-years of age, and C.P., three-years of age.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although A.D. and J.P. were not married, they and their two children resided near Bayou Chicot in a home A.D. owned. All of them lived together for approximately five years until the father moved out of the home on or about October 5, 2017, as a result of a break-up between mom and dad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Beginning in the 2017-2018 school year, B.P. attended kindergarten at Bayou Chicot Elementary. Prior to the break-up, as she traveled to Oakdale Elementary, where she was employed as a Pre-K teacher, A. D. would bring her two children to the home of Angie, J. P.'s mother. Angie, a school secretary at Bayou Chicot Elementary, would take C.P. to daycare and would bring B.P. to the elementary school. After school, Angie would pick up her two grandchildren and bring them to her home. A. D. would then come and get her children when she returned from Oakdale Elementary, and they would go to their Bayou Chicot home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At or near Christmas 2017, after J. P. left the Bayou Chicot home, A. D. decided to transfer B.P. to Oakdale Elementary, where she was allowed to attend because A. D. was employed there. J. P. objected to B.P.'s transfer, and this litigation ensued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 9, 2018, J. P. filed suit against A.D., seeking shared custody of B.P. and C.P. A.D. answered J.P.'s lawsuit and reconvened, seeking sole custody of the two children, subject to J.P.'s supervised visitation, child support, and the issuance of a TRO, enjoining J.P. from any physical and sexual abuse or harassment of A.D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court heard this matter on two non-consecutive days, February 24, 2018\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and March 20, 2018. Shortly after the conclusion of the March 20 hearing, the trial court assigned written reasons and issued judgment. In that judgment, the trial court: (1) ordered B.P. removed from Oakdale Elementary and re-enrolled at Bayou Chicot Elementary by April 9, 2018; (2) provided A.D. and J.P. with shared custody of B.P. and C.P.; (3) designated A.D. and J.P. as \"joint domiciliary custodial parents\"; (4) ordered custody and visitation with the minor children on a \"7x7\" basis with the non-visiting parent having additional visitation every Wednesday evening for two hours \"in accordance with the attached Custody Implementation Plan\";\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (5) provided that visitational and custodial exchanges take place at the home of J.P.'s parents; (6) ordered J.P. to pay $500 monthly for child support retroactive to January 15, 2018; (7) required A.D. to continue carrying the minor children on all medical and health insurance premiums; (8) ordered J.P. to pay the child care/day care costs of the two children; (9) ordered J.P. responsible for 68% of all costs of school and extracurricular activities, as well as deductibles, copays, and non-covered medical expenses of the two children; (10) granted the parties unmonitored telephone or text messaging/conversations during the other parent's visitation; (11) ordered open communication as to the health, education and welfare of the children between the parents and prohibited the parents from making disparaging or derogatory comments about each other in the presence of the children or other persons; and (12) decreed that the jurisdiction of the custody and support matters would remain with the Evangeline Parish court and that the order would be regarded as a \"considered decree.\" Although the trial court designated A.D. and J.P. as \"joint domiciliary custodial parents,\" it did not allocate legal authority and responsibility for the children in the joint custody implementation order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On appeal, A.D. asserts the trial court committed manifest error by: (1) designating the parents as co-domiciliary parents; (2) not having the witness testimony of Brother Jerry Adams (\"Brother Adams\") received in chambers recorded and made part of the record;\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (3) refusing to allow B.P. to attend school where she (A. D.) teaches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Domiciliary Parent\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Relying on\n   <em>\n    Hodges v.

She contends that ruling should be reversed, and she should be designated as the domiciliary parent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After a trial court has decided to award joint custody to the parents, La.R.S. 9:335 governs the detailed determination of the custody arrangement. In pertinent part, La.R.S. 9:335 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   A. (1) In a proceeding in which joint custody is decreed, the court shall render a joint custody implementation order except for good cause shown.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (2)(a) The implementation order shall allocate the time periods during which each parent shall have physical custody of the child so that the child is assured of frequent and continuing contact with both parents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (b) To the extent it is feasible and in the best interest of the child, physical\n   custody of the children should be shared equally.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (3) The implementation order shall allocate the legal authority and responsibility of the parents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   B.

All major decisions made by the domiciliary parent concerning the child shall be subject to review by the court upon motion of the other parent. It shall be presumed that all major decisions made by the domiciliary parent are in the best interest of the child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Interpreting La.R.S. 9:335, the supreme court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Read as a whole, therefore, we conclude the plain language of La. R.S. 9:335 manifests the legislature's clear intent to establish a custodial system in which a child has a domiciliary parent and no more than one such parent. The text is clear. Although each parent can share physical custody, the court can only designate a single domiciliary parent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Hodges\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6769128,6769210\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/181/700/\">\n    181 So.3d at 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In further explanation, the\n   <em>\n    Hodges\n   </em>\n   opinion also explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Although La.

In other words, while La. R.S. 9:335(B)(1) provides a preference for the designation of \"\n   <strong>\n    a\n   </strong>\n   domiciliary parent,\" a court could choose not to designate a domiciliary parent at all and, instead, to allocate authority by means of an\n   <strong>\n    implementation order\n   </strong>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    v.

They said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   It would appear that the legislature, in requiring an allocation of the legal authority and responsibility regarding minor children, intended to promote greater harmony between the parents by providing less opportunity for conflict.

And as reflected in the facts of the present case, such a statement does nothing to diffuse the opportunity for conflict. Accordingly, we find the trial court also failed to allocate legal authority and responsibility in its joint custody implementation order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    Disposition\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Having identified two errors of law, we must determine a procedure to best resolve this matter.

We find that the record is complete and de novo review is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   A.D. and J.P. lived together with their two daughters, B.P., their six-year old, and C.P., their three-year old, in A.D.'s home near Bayou Chicot. J.P. left the home at or near Christmas 2017. After J.P. left, he lived with his parents and, at the time of the custody hearing, he was in the process of purchasing a home of his own. At the time of the hearing, the two daughters were living at home with A.D. The domiciliary parent is the parent with whom the child primarily resides. La.R.S. 9:335(B)(2). Moreover, our review of the record shows A.D. provides the children with day-to-day stability and sees to the children's daily necessities of life. Accordingly, we designate A.D. as the domiciliary parent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As the domiciliary parent, A.D. shall have authority to make all major decisions\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   affecting B.P. and C.P. Moreover,\n   as provided in La.R.S. 9:335(B)(3), all major decisions made by A.D. concerning her children shall be subject to review by the court upon motion of J.P.

However, the record does contain detailed reasons for judgment which address custody and visitation with specificity.

Notwithstanding, see\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    our further discussion of La.R.S. 9:335(A)(3) and the trial court's ruling.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    We further note that although the trial court granted mutual and reciprocal restraining orders to both A.D. and J.P. in its interim judgment, the final judgment is silent in this regard.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    We pretermit discussion of A.D.'s second assignment of error.
