For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mr. Dorsey, who was found to have violated disciplinary rules regarding defiance and aggravated disobedience, was confined to isolated detention for ten days and lost phone privileges for four weeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Dorsey sought review of the disciplinary action under the Louisiana Corrections Administrative Remedy Procedure Act (CARP), LSA-R.S. 15:1171\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Dorsey was denied relief at both the first and second steps of the procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Thereafter, Mr. Dorsey filed a Petition for Judicial Review with the 19th Judicial District Court. In accordance with LSA-R.S. 15:1178, Mr. Dorsey's petition was screened by a commissioner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The commissioner\n   recommended that the district court dismiss Mr. Dorsey's petition because it failed to raise a \"substantial right\" violation. Subsequently, the district court, adopting the recommendation of the commissioner, dismissed Mr. Dorsey's petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mr. Dorsey has appealed and seeks review of the district court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Under CARP, an inmate aggrieved by a disciplinary decision by the DPSC may seek judicial review of that decision pursuant to LSA-R.S. 15:1177. According to Section 1177(A)(9), the court can reverse or modify the DPSC's decision only \"if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced.\"\n   <strong>\n    Plaisance v.
