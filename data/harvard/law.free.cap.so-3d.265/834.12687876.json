The issue on appeal is whether there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Ms. Lenox's spinal infection was causally related to her work accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Ms. Lenox went to work for Renegade Harley in Alexandria, Louisiana, in April 2014, as a store clerk/manager. On November 22, 2016, around lunchtime, Ms. Lenox went to the back to get a pair of boots for a customer. She located the boots about halfway down a shelf and bent over to get them. When she bent over, she experienced a weird sensation. She brought the boots to the customer and chatted with the customer for a while.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Ms. Lenox's husband came by the store to meet her for lunch. She told him that her back started \"killing\" her suddenly and pain was shooting down her right leg. She reported the incident to Gayle Stolzer, the human resources person at Renegade Harley. Ms. Stolzer told Ms. Lenox to go to Kisatchie Medical Center, a walk-in clinic, for treatment. A drug screen was performed, which was negative. She was diagnosed with lumbar strain and prescribed Ansaid and Flexeril. She then went home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The next day, Ms. Lenox woke up in excruciating pain and could not get out of bed. An ambulance was called, and Ms. Lenox was taken to St. Francis Cabrini Hospital. A lumbar CT scan revealed changes at L4-5 and L5-S1, with a possible pars defect at L5. Dr. Gregory Dowd, a neurosurgeon, consulted on Ms. Lenox's case. He explained that a pars defect is a defect in the bony bridge connecting the front and back portions of the vertebral body. Dr. Dowd opined that the back and leg pain was suggestive of radiculopathy caused by a compressed nerve. He ordered an MRI, which was performed on November 25, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The MRI indicated degenerative disc disease and a small focal disc protrusion at L5-S1. Dr. Dowd testified that the disc protrusion at L5-S1 caused significant impression on the nerve at that level and was likely responsible for the right-sided lumbar radiculopathy. Ms. Lenox received an epidural steroid injection on November 27, 2016. During her stay at St. Francis Cabrini Hospital, Ms. Lenox developed shoulder pain, so a medical neurologist consulted on her case. That doctor opined that Ms. Lenox needed a rheumatology evaluation. She was discharged from the hospital on December 1, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Continuing to suffer with pain, Ms. Lenox was taken by ambulance and admitted to Rapides Regional Medical Center on December 3, 2016. Dr. Dowd's associate, Dr. Michael Drerup, saw Ms. Lenox. Dr. Drerup noted his concern for sepsis. An MRI was performed that day with similar findings as the first MRI. Another MRI was performed on December 9, 2016. This time it was performed with and without contrast. The MRI indicated evidence of discitis, osteomyelitis, and possible epidural abscess.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Dr. Dowd testified that Ms. Lenox developed an infection of the lumbar spine. She also demonstrated weakness in the form of foot drop. He stated that the infection caused left-sided compression whereas the original herniated disc caused right-sided compression. All issues were at the same L5-S1 level. Dr. Dowd performed surgery on December 11, 2016. Dr. Dowd testified that the surgery was targeted primarily to drain the infection and to decompress the affected nerve.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Ms. Lenox was discharged from Rapides Regional Medical Center on December 20, 2016. She was admitted to Christus Dubuis of Alexandria for long-term care due to the infection. On February 4, 2017, Ms. Lenox was discharged to St. Francis Cabrini Hospital for rehabilitation for two weeks before she went home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On March 9, 2017, Ms. Lenox filed a disputed claim for compensation. She alleged that she did not receive wage benefits and medical treatment was not authorized. The Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. They contended that they accepted the accident as compensable but only paid for medical treatment up to the time Ms. Lenox developed the spinal infection. The Defendants dispute that the spinal infection was causally related to the original work accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A hearing on the motion for summary judgment was held on April 2, 2018. The workers' compensation judge (WCJ) held that the spinal infection was not causally related to the accident and granted the Defendants' motion for summary judgment, dismissing Ms. Lenox's claim with prejudice. Ms. Lenox then filed the present appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    SUMMARY JUDGMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ms. Lenox claims that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the Defendants. She argues that the law is so well-settled in this area and that she is entitled to recover from her employer even if her work-related injury was exacerbated by infection contracted during her treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Summary judgment procedure is favored and \"is designed to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action .... and shall be construed to accomplish these ends.\" La.Code Civ.P. art. 966(A)(2).

He must establish that the accident was work-related, that the accident caused the injury, and that the injury caused the disability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DeGruy v.

He may be aided in meeting the foregoing burden by a presumption of causation, if he can prove that before the accident he had not manifested disabling symptoms, that such symptoms commenced with the accident and manifested themselves thereafter, and that either medical or circumstantial evidence indicates a reasonable possibility of causal connection between the accident and onset of the disabling symptoms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Walton v.

Thus, the testimony as a whole must show that more probably than not an employment accident occurred and that it had a causal relation to the disability. If the testimony leaves the probabilities equally balanced, the plaintiff has failed to carry the burden of persuasion. Likewise, the plaintiff's case must fail if the evidence shows only a possibility of a causative accident or leaves it to speculation or conjecture.\n   <em>\n    Buxton v.

Dr. Dowd testified that the sepsis infection could be caused by a urinary tract infection or untreated pneumonia, both of which Ms. Lenox developed during treatment. However, he stated that an epidural steroid injection could also cause an infection and that patients sometimes develop infections when they receive injections for medical treatment. Dr. Dowd further stated that it is difficult to determine what caused the infection. He further stated that when Ms. Lenox was discharged from St. Francis Cabrini Hospital, which was four days after the injection, she had an elevated sedimentation rate and white blood cell count. This is an indication of an early brewing infection. Dr. Dowd opined that Ms. Lenox was demonstrating signs of infection at the time she was discharged from St. Francis Cabrini Hospital that were not present when she was admitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Dr. Dowd further testified that Ms. Lenox's earlier MRIs after the accident did not show evidence of an infection. The later MRIs, which were with and without contrast, reveal the infection. Dr. Dowd agreed that this change demonstrated a chronological development that the infection developed during the course of her treatment. He specifically stated that he was of the opinion that she \"developed new symptoms, signs and findings of infection during her treatment.\" He was also not aware of Ms. Lenox suffering with an infection before the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Defendants cite this court's case in\n   <em>\n    Sweat v.

When he went to the doctor, it was discovered he had an epidural abscess already present in his thoracic spine levels T3 to T7. The only evidence in the record was the testimony of Mr. Sweat's treating physician, Dr. Drerup. After reviewing the evidence, this court held that Dr. Drerup clearly stated, \"several times, in several ways, that the infection that caused Mr. Sweat's abscess was not caused by trauma, injury, or strain. The abscess was caused by bacterial infection alone.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6812012\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/188/482/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6812012\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/188/482/\">\n    at 483-84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Even if Ms. Lenox was predisposed to infection before the accident, the supreme court has stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   The fact that a condition is preexisting does not preclude recovery for the disabled employee; the employer takes the employee as he is, and the fact that the disease alone might have disabled the employee in its ordinary course of progress is not the inquiry.
