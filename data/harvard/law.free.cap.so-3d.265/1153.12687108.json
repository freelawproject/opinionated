Brown\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case involves a peremptory exception of prescription. Appellant, Faubourg Saint Charles, LLC (\"FSC\"), filed suit (the \"Petition\") against Appellee, Faubourg Saint Charles Homeowners Association, Inc. (\"HOA\"), alleging it was entitled to reimbursement for monies advanced to HOA for the years 2012 through 2016. The district court sustained HOA's peremptory exception of prescription finding that the sums advanced by FSC to HOA before February 27, 2015 were monies lent subject to a three-year prescriptive period. Additionally, the district court denied FSC's oral motion to amend the Petition. FSC appeals the district court's partial final judgment. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment sustaining the exception of prescription, reverse the judgment denying the amendment, and remand the matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY AND FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FSC was the developer of Faubourg Saint Charles Condominiums (the \"Condominiums\"). Construction began on the Condominiums in 2006. In October 2006, FSC executed and recorded the \"Act of Declaration Creating and Establishing the Condominium Regime Faubourg Saint Charles Condominium[s],\" and FSC incorporated the HOA in order to assume the operation and management of the Condominiums. The HOA did not become fully functional until the later part of 2016. Before\n   the HOA became functional, FSC operated and managed the Condominiums.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   FSC also owned a unit-unit 2-in the Condominiums. In December 2017, HOA successfully sued FSC in Orleans Parish First City Court to collect assessments that FSC owed as the owner of unit 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Shortly thereafter, on February 27, 2018, FSC filed the Petition alleging in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   6.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Between [HOA's] formation and late 2016, FSC through its owner, Roland von Kurnatowski advanced sums on behalf of [HOA] to maintain the [Condominiums].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   7.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   When [HOA] were [sic] finally able to take control of the development, FSC had incurred approximately $ 100,388.20\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   on behalf of [HOA] to maintain the [Condominiums]. Those expenses exceeded income, and included administrative expense, insurance, office supplies, shipping, telephones and communications, auto expense, utilities including electric, gas, sewer and water, maintenance including contract payroll, materials, equipment and pest control, and a suit against the Sewerage &amp; Water Board for overbilling of services. Those expenses incurred by FSC on behalf of plaintiff, by year, are summarized as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <pre id=\"p-18\">2012 $46,990.49 2013 $38,409.65 2014 $6,861.51 2015 $8,126.55 2016 (Jan. thru May) $9,300.76 __________ Total: $10[9],[6]88.20</pre>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   8.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [HOA] is obligated to FSC for the foregoing and any other sums advanced to operate and maintain [the Condominiums] for [HOA].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Attached to the Petition were FSC's profit and loss statements for the years 2012 through 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In response, HOA filed a peremptory exception of prescription (the \"Exception\"). HOA alleged FSC's claims for \"money lent\" to HOA before February 27, 2015 had prescribed pursuant to the three-year prescriptive period of La. C.C. art. 3494.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   FSC opposed the Exception, arguing that its suit was for an accounting of expenses advanced on behalf of the HOA and breach of contract subject to the ten-year prescriptive period of La. C.C. art. 3499.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   FSC, however, did not seek to supplement or amend its Petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A trial on the Exception was held on June 15, 2018. No evidence was introduced. The district court sustained the Exception, finding the cause of action asserted\n   by FSC against HOA was for money lent subject to a three-year prescriptive period, and the claims for money lent before February 27, 2015 had prescribed and were dismissed with prejudice. FSC then orally moved to amend the Petition to allege an oral contract between FSC and HOA, or other alternatives. The district court denied the request. A judgment was issued by the district court on June 19, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   FSC assigns two errors: the district court erred by granting the Exception; and the district court erred in refusing to allow FSC an opportunity to amend the Petition as required by La.

C.C. art. 3494 for an action on money lent; rather, the district court should have applied the ten-year prescription period for personal actions codified in La. C.C. art. 3499. FSC urges the Petition sets forth three possible personal actions: (1) a contract action; (2) an accounting action; and/or (3) an agent/principal relationship. Additionally, FSC argues the district court failed to construe the Petition in favor of maintaining FSC's action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Contract action\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   FSC argues the relationship between it and HOA was contractual. FSC asserts there was either an oral contract or a contractual relationship established through La. R.S. 9:1123.105. La. R.S. 9:1123.105 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   A contract for the maintenance, management, or operation of the condominium property or any lease of recreational or parking facilities entered into by the association while the association is controlled by the developer of the condominium shall be subject to cancellation by the association by vote of not less than a majority of the individual unit owners other than the declarant computed with reference to their respective percentage obligations for common expenses within a one year period immediately following the date on which individual unit owners other than the declarant assume or acquire control of the association.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In sustaining the Exception, the district court stated, \"I believe the [FSC] has not alleged the existence of an agreement between the parties requiring any repayment of the alleged advances, much less any agreement to a specific term or time period for repayment.\" We agree. Although FSC asserted HOA was obligated to FSC for reimbursement of monies advanced, FSC did not allege in the Petition there was an oral or written contract. Moreover, FSC failed to introduce any evidence at trial on the Exception to establish the existence of an agreement or a contract. Furthermore, neither La. R.S. 9:1123.105 nor any other statute set forth in the Louisiana Condominium Act triggers a statutory contractual relationship between the party or entity managing and maintaining a condominium property and a homeowners association.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   This claim lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    Accounting action\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   FSC asserts its action against HOA is one for an \"accounting under the terms of that contract.\" At the trial, the district court rejected this argument:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   In your petition you styled it as a request for reimbursement. So when I look at that, any monies paid, you are asking for it to be paid back, which signals to me it's a loan, not an accounting. So it's not just the scenario. I am looking at what was in the petition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We agree. FSC did not allege in the Petition or introduce evidence of a request for an accounting under the terms of a contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   This claim lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Agent/principal relationship\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   FSC contends that its relationship with HOA is one of agent and principal, citing\n   <em>\n    In re Succession of Moore\n   </em>\n   , 97-1668 (La.

In support, FSC cites La. C.C. P. art. 865 which provides that \"[e]very pleading shall be so construed as to do substantial justice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The district court was constrained by the character of the action pled and the lack of evidence presented. As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the Petition does not support FSC's assertion that it was pleading a personal action in contract, in an accounting, or an agent/principal relationship. Moreover, FSC presented no evidence at the trial on the Exception in support of these grounds. Thus, based upon the record, the district court did not err in construing the Petition as an action for money lent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   This claim lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Thus, after a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the record, we find the district court was legally correct in sustaining the Exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    Amendment of the Petition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In the alternative, FSC asserts the district court erred in failing to give it an opportunity to amend the Petition as required by La. C.C.P. art. 934.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In denying FSC's oral motion to amend the Petition, the district court stated that \"[b]ased upon what's already pled, based upon the review of it and what the petition sought, not just here, but in First City Court, I have no choice but to grant the prescription, and I am not going to allow you an opportunity to amend.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The decision to allow a plaintiff to amend a petition under La.
