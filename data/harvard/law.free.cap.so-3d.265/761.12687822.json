Defendant was found guilty of manslaughter in response to the charge of second degree murder, and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment at hard labor. The court of appeal affirmed.\n   <em>\n    State v. Eaglin\n   </em>\n   , 17-657 (La. App. 3 Cir. 3/28/18),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12663974\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/239/1001/\">\n    239 So.3d 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In affirming, a majority of the panel found the error in admitting a highly inflammatory photograph of defendant, which lacked any probative value, was harmless because the State introduced\n   <em>\n    sufficient evidence\n   </em>\n   to support the conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eaglin\n   </em>\n   , 17-657, p. 40,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12663974\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/239/1001/\">\n    239 So.3d at 1027\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"There was consistent testimony regarding the fight that preceded the shooting that was sufficient to convict the defendant of manslaughter. The trial court's error in admitting the prejudicial photograph, Exhibit S-2, is,\n   therefore harmless.\"). Judge Cooks, dissenting, noted that the majority applied the wrong standard in determining whether the error was harmless. The dissent is correct in that assessment. Under\n   <em>\n    Chapman v.

In applying the\n   <em>\n    Chapman\n   </em>\n   standard, \"[t]he question, however, is not whether the legally admitted evidence was sufficient ..., which we assume it was, but rather, whether the State has proved 'beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Satterwhite v.
