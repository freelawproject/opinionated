Darryl Metcalf was found guilty of two counts of sexual battery, attempted sexual battery, and fondling. The Coahoma County Circuit Court sentenced him to fifteen years for fondling and twenty years for each of the other convictions. Because all of the sentences were set to run concurrently, the circuit court effectively sentenced Metcalf to twenty years in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections. Metcalf appeals. His appointed counsel argues that the circuit court erred by (1) excluding one of Metcalf's witnesses and (2) giving jury instructions that constructively amended two counts in the indictment. Counsel also argues that Metcalf's trial counsel was ineffective. Metcalf has filed a supplemental pro se brief. After thorough review of the issues before us, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62. This case stems from Metcalf's contact with M.W., who was four years old during the events that led to Metcalf's conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   M.W. lived with his mother, Deborah, and two siblings. Metcalf was twenty-four, and his family called him \"Peanut.\" He lived with M.W.'s great-grandmother, Maggie, who cared for M.W. while his mother had to work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63. On May 15, 2008, Deborah was preparing to go celebrate M.W.'s birthday when someone called from Maggie's apartment and asked Deborah to stop and pick up M.W.'s gifts. When M.W. learned that they would be stopping by Maggie's apartment, M.W. shut himself in his bedroom. A short time later, Deborah found M.W. crying in the corner. M.W. then told Deborah that \"Peanut was messing\" with him. According to Deborah, M.W. then elaborated that Peanut \"sucked his penis, bit his penis, tried to put his penis in [M.W.'s] mouth ... and was messing with his butt.\" After relaying M.W.'s revelation to Maggie, Deborah went to the police department and filed a report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64. Authorities arranged Sarah Ward's forensic interview of M.W. Ward later reported that \"M.W. did not provide any information or statements to corroborate the suspicion that he may have been sexually abused.\" Through her report, Ward recommended that \"M.W. participate in psychotherapy for further assessment of possible sexual abuse.\" M.W. was referred to Shirley Long, a therapist at Region One Mental Health Center in Clarksdale, Mississippi. Long conducted twelve sessions with M.W. during the course of nearly a year. According to Long, M.W. told her that \"Peanut touched his ears, nose and mouth, and put [M.W.'s] 'ding-a-ling' in Peanut's mouth until it hurt,\" \"Peanut tried to make [M.W.] put Peanut's penis in his mouth, but [M.W.] wouldn't open his mouth,\" Metcalf inserted an object into\n   M.W.'s anus, and Peanut \"took a gun from under the TV and put it to his head and told him he would kill him if he told anybody what he had done to him.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65. Metcalf was indicted on December 7, 2009, and charged with two counts of sexual battery, one count of attempted sexual battery, and one count of fondling. The indictment originally alleged that the offenses occurred between January and March 2008. Metcalf's trial was delayed for a significant period after the defense successfully moved for a mental competency evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66. In November 2015, the prosecution moved to amend the indictment to allege that the offenses occurred between January 1, 2008, and May 15, 2008. As the prosecution noted, the \"date of disclosure was May 15, 2008 ... [, and] all discovery tendered to the defense contemplates this date as the day when M.W.'s mother first became aware of the sexual abuse allegedly committed by\" Metcalf. On January 14, 2016, the circuit court granted the prosecution's motion over the defense's objection. During the same hearing, the circuit court conducted a competency hearing. Based on testimony from Dr. Amanda Gugliano and Dr. Reb McMichael, the circuit court held that Metcalf was competent to stand trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67. Additionally, defense counsel noted that he was unable to find Ward, who no longer worked at the Family Crisis Center where she interviewed M.W. Defense counsel announced that he would try to introduce her report into evidence if he could not find Ward, and the prosecution noted the procedural difficulty involved with defense counsel's plan. The circuit court ultimately took the parties' positions under advisement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68. Five days later, the defense requested a continuance so that it could continue looking for Ward. The prosecution objected, noting the various delays already incurred, including the setback caused by Metcalf's competency hearing. The circuit court granted the continuance and appointed an investigator to help defense counsel find Ward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b69. On May 18, 2016, the parties finally convened for Metcalf's trial. Before the prosecution began its case-in-chief, the circuit court heard the prosecution's motion to introduce M.W.'s testimony through Deborah and Long. After hearing their proffered testimonies, the circuit court granted the prosecution's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b610. The prosecution first called Assistant Police Chief Robbie Linley, of the Clarksdale Police Department, who, in 2008, was a captain supervisor of the department's Investigative Services Division. Chief Linley testified that he took over the investigation of Metcalf's case from another investigator who resigned. He further testified that during the investigation, it was established that Metcalf went by the nickname \"Peanut,\" and that at the time of the crime, Metcalf was twenty-four years old. Chief Linley stated that in 2008, M.W. was four years old. Chief Linley also provided an in-court identification of Metcalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b611. Next, Investigator Myette Dawson testified that he had been employed with the Clarksdale Police Department in 2008 and was the original investigator of Metcalf's case. Investigator Dawson testified that he spoke with Deborah and made an initial report concerning the abuse allegations on May 16, 2008. He said that after speaking with Deborah, he referred M.W. for a forensic interview at the Family Crisis Center. Investigator Dawson confirmed M.W.'s and Metcalf's ages at the time of the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b612. The State next called Deborah to testify. She testified about M.W.'s disclosure of sexual abuse, including that M.W.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   told her that \"Peanut\" \"sucked his penis, bit his penis, tried to put his penis in [M.W.'s] mouth ... and was messing with his butt.\" Deborah also testified that M.W. had been negatively affected by the event, and often wet his bed and bit his arm. She identified Metcalf as the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b613. Long testified about her treatment of M.W. and the disclosures M.W. made during therapy sessions, including that \"Peanut\" touched M.W.'s ears, nose, and mouth; put M.W.'s penis in his mouth; inserted an object into M.W.'s anus; and held a gun to M.W.'s head and threatened to kill M.W. if he told anyone about these actions. Long further testified that M.W.'s version of events remained consistent over his twelve-session treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b614. M.W. was the last witness to testify for the State. He testified that he was twelve years old and was born in May 2004. M.W. identified Metcalf as the person who molested him and whom he knew as \"Peanut.\" M.W. testified that Metcalf molested him when he was four years old at his grandmother's house in Willow Park. According to M.W., he was exiting the restroom when Metcalf grabbed him and took him to a back room. Metcalf put his fingers to M.W.'s lips, and tried to make him suck his penis. M.W. said that when he refused, Metcalf pulled down his pants and bit his penis. M.W. also testified that Metcalf put a gun to his head and said that if he told anyone what had happened, Metcalf would shoot him. M.W. could not say exactly what Metcalf inserted into his anus because he was turned the other way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b615. Following M.W.'s testimony, the prosecution rested. Metcalf moved for a directed verdict, which the circuit court denied. Then, trial was adjourned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b616. On the second morning of trial, May 19, 2016, the parties met in chambers to discuss a matter brought by the defense. During the meeting in chambers, the defense informed the circuit court that Ward had contacted him on the previous evening and said she would be available to testify the next day, on May 20. Defense asked the circuit court to delay trial until then. After hearing arguments from both parties, the trial court ultimately excluded Ward from testifying because Ward was not properly subpoenaed and was therefore not subject to the circuit court's authority, and because Ward's name was neither included on the witness list nor disclosed during voir dire. Further, the circuit court noted that it had appointed the defense an investigator at the State's expense on January 27, 2017, to assist the defense's location of Ward, and that after hearing from the defense, the circuit court did not \"believe a diligent effort was made to locate Ms. Ward.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b617. Next, the defense moved to admit statements Deborah made to Long during M.W.'s initial intake; namely, that M.W. did not disclose sexual abuse during his forensic interview. After hearing arguments from counsel, the circuit court ruled that the statements could be admitted pursuant to Mississippi Rule of Evidence 803(4) as statements made for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b618. The defense then proceeded with its case-in-chief, recalling Long to testify. When asked what information she received from Deborah regarding M.W.'s forensic interview, Long testified that Deborah told her that M.W. did not disclose any abuse to Ward because Ward referred to Metcalf by his given name, rather than \"Peanut,\" the name M.W. knew him by.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b619. Metcalf testified in his own defense. Metcalf categorically denied committing the allegations of abuse against him. During cross-examination, he admitted that his family and M.W. referred to him as \"Peanut.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b620. After the defense rested, it renewed its motion for a directed verdict, which the circuit court denied. Outside the presence of the jury, the defense gave a proffer of Ward's forensic interview of M.W., which was marked as Exhibit 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b621. As previously mentioned, the jury found Metcalf guilty of both counts of sexual battery, attempted sexual battery, and fondling. The circuit court denied Metcalf's motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) or in the alternative, a motion for a new trial. Metcalf has timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Mississippi Code Annotated section 99-15-29 (Rev. 2015) governs whether counsel is entitled to a continuance due to an absent witness. Section 99-15-29 requires that counsel file an affidavit setting forth, among other things, that he has \"used due diligence to procure ... the presence of the absent witness ... stating in what such diligence consists, and that the continuance is not sought for delay only, but that justice may be done.\" \"Embraced therein is the requirement that counsel has made a timely effort to place the absent witness under a subpoena.\"\n   <em>\n    Triplett v.

The record reveals that the defense made an unsworn motion ore tenus to postpone trial until the next day. The circuit court declined to delay trial for several reasons: Ward was not properly\n   served with a subpoena; the defense was not diligent in its efforts to locate Ward; and Ward's name was stricken from the witness list. Under these facts, we cannot say the circuit court abused its discretion in denying the motion. Further, there is no indication that Metcalf suffered a manifest injustice resulting from the denial of a continuance because the substance of Ward's report-that M.W. did not report any instance of sexual abuse during his forensic intake interview-was covered in Long's testimony. This issue is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Variance Between Indictment and Jury Instruction 7\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b626. On appeal, Metcalf claims for the first time that the circuit court constructively amended Counts One and Four of the indictment against him when it gave Jury Instruction 7, an elements-instruction that addressed each count in the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Count One: Sexual Battery\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b627. Count One charged Metcalf with violating Mississippi Code Annotated section 97-3-95(1)(d) (Rev. 2014) by sexually penetrating M.W., who was under fourteen years old, by inserting his penis into M.W.'s anal opening. Jury Instruction 7 allowed the jury to convict Metcalf of sexual battery upon a finding that Metcalf inserted his \"penis and/or object\" into M.W.'s anal opening. According to Metcalf, the inclusion of the words \"and/or object\" broadened the grounds for conviction and lessened the prosecution's burden of proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b628. Metcalf did not object to Instruction 7 as constructively amending Count One; in result, he has waived this issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Faulkner v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7000360\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/109/142/#p146\">\n    109 So.3d 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 146 (\u00b6 12) (Miss. Ct. App. 2013) (explaining that failure to object to a variance between an indictment and a jury instruction renders the issue procedurally barred on appeal). Accordingly, we can review Metcalf's claim only for plain error.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Young v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794332\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/194/904/#p910\">\n    194 So.3d 904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 910 (\u00b6 20) (Miss. Ct. App. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b629. In this instance, the instruction was not erroneous, let alone plainly erroneous. As the State points out, this Court has held that \"the particular method of achieving sexual penetration is not an element of the offense of sexual battery.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794332\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/194/904/#p910\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (\u00b6 21) (internal quotation marks omitted). \" 'Sexual penetration' includes cunnilingus, fellatio, buggery or pederasty, any penetration of the genital or anal openings of another person's body by any part of a person's body, and insertion of any object into the genital or anal openings of another person's body.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2097-3-97\">\n    Miss. Code Ann. \u00a7 97-3-97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (Rev. 2014). The jury unanimously convicted Metcalf of sexually penetrating M.W., which is the essence of the offense of sexual battery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Young\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794332\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/194/904/#p910\">\n    194 So.3d at 910\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\u00b6 21). Accordingly, Metcalf's challenge to this portion of Jury Instruction 7 is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Count Four: Fondling\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b630. Count Four charged Metcalf with violating Mississippi Code Annotated section 97-5-23 (Rev. 2014) by touching or rubbing M.W.'s private parts with his hands for the purpose of gratifying his lust or indulging in his sexual desires. Jury Instruction 7 did not reference M.W.'s private parts; it allowed the jury to convict Metcalf of fondling if it found that Metcalf handled, touched, or rubbed M.W. with his hands, any part of his body, or with any object. Metcalf argues Jury Instruction 7 broadened the grounds for conviction by allowing the jury to convict Metcalf \"for touching [M.W.]'s ear or face with a hand.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b631. The record reveals that the language in Jury Instruction 7 pertaining to Count Four was revised at Metcalf's request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The relevant portion of the prosecution's proposed jury instruction allowed the jury to convict on Count Four if it found Metcalf \"handle[d], touch[ed] or rub[bed] with his hands the private parts of M.W. ...\" During the jury instruction conference, defense counsel objected to the Count Four in the instruction and recommended that it track the statute. The trial court acquiesced:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [DEFENSE] Yeah. We were objecting to S1-A, Count IV.

In this case, the record does not affirmatively show ineffectiveness of constitutional dimensions, and the State does not stipulate that the record is adequate to review this issue.

The State interprets Metcalf's brief as though he raised two new issues: (1) whether Metcalf's trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to object to the amendment of his indictment and (2) whether the trial court erred by failing to conduct a hearing pursuant to Rule 803(25).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In doing our best to understand Metcalf's meaning, we agree that his brief raised these issues. We further note that in his supplemental reply brief, Metcalf did not disagree with the State's framing of his issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Ineffective Assistance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b640. First, Metcalf seems to claim that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to object to the amendment of his indictment. Because a review of the record reveals that Metcalf's counsel\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   in fact object to the indictment's amendment, we find Metcalf's claim is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b641. On November 17, 2016, the State filed a motion to amend the indictment pursuant to Rule 7.09 of the Uniform Rules of Circuit and County Court Practice to correct the dates of the crime. As it originally stood, the indictment alleged that the crimes occurred on or between January 2008 and March 2008. The State moved to amend the indictment to allege that the crimes occurred on or between January 1, 2008 and May 15, 2008, as \"the date of disclosure was May 15, 2008 ... [, and] all discovery tendered to the defense contemplates this date as the day when M.W.'s mother first became aware of the\n   sexual abuse ....\" The circuit court heard arguments on the prosecution's motion on January 14, 2016. During the hearing, Metcalf's trial counsel objected to and argued against the State's motion to amend the indictment. The circuit court ultimately allowed the amendment, finding it was one of form rather than substance. In light of trial counsel's objection, Metcalf's claim fails under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. at 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    B. 803(25) Hearing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b642. Hearsay is inadmissible unless the law provides an exception. M.R.E. 802 ; see M.R.E. 803 (exceptions that apply regardless of whether the declarant is available to testify); M.R.E. 804 (exceptions that apply only when declarant is \"unavailable\" to testify). This issue concerns Rule 803(25)'s exception for \"statement(s) made by a child of tender years describing any act of sexual contact with or by another[.]\" M.R.E. 803(25). Under Rule 803(25), such statements are admissible if:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   (A) the court-after a hearing outside the jury's presence-determines that the statement's time, content, and circumstances provide substantial indicia of reliability; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   (B) the child either:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   (i) testifies; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   (ii) is unavailable as a witness, and other evidence corroborates the act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b643. Metcalf argues that \"the trial court erred in allowing [Long][,] a forensic psychologist[,] to testify ... as the trial court made no findings as to the reliability of the hearsay statement and did not conduct a hearing outside the presence of the jury as required by\" Rule 803(25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b644.

Ct. App. 2007). Contrary to Metcalf's assertion, the circuit court held a hearing outside the presence of the jury and made detailed on-the-record findings concerning M.W.'s statements to Long.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b645. On May 18, 2016, the circuit court conducted a hearing outside the presence of the jury concerning the State's \"Motion to Offer MRE 803(25) Evidence.\" During this time, the circuit court heard proffered testimony from Long, the therapist who began treating M.W. in July 2008, as well as M.W.'s mother, Deborah. After receiving the testimony and hearing argument from counsel, the circuit court found that M.W., who was four years old at the time he made statements to Long and Deborah concerning sexual abuse, was a child of tender years. In her on-the-record finding, the trial judge stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   Based on Ms. Long's educational and professional background, the court finds that she is a credible witness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   She testified that she first saw M.W. ... in July of 2008, for 11 sessions; and with the initial session that was for 12 sessions. The amended indictment alleges the dates of the sexual battery to have occurred between January 2008 to May 2008.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   And with M.W. first consulting with Ms. Long in July, the Court finds that his conversations with her were in close proximity to the alleged events.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   Ms. Long testified that throughout the 12 sessions with M.W. ... his testimony was consistent and did not change, and she believes M.W. ... was a credible witness. And as a trained professional, the Court finds that she can make that determination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   She also indicated that she did not know of any motive that the child would have had to be untruthful.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   When asked if M.W. ... was prompted ... to tell of the alleged sexual abuse,\n   [Long] simply stated that she said to the child, \"Tell me what happened,\" and the child commenced to tell what happened.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   Based on this testimony there is absolutely no suggestive technique used, whatsoever, to elicit the allegations from M.W. ... and, therefore, the Court finds that the events, as related to Ms. Long by M.W. ... are reliable, and she will be able to testify as to these events in court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   As to [Deborah], the Court finds that M.W.'s initial conversation with his mother regarding the alleged abuse was a spontaneous one. They were preparing for a birthday party, and when he learned that he had to return to the location of the alleged events, he started to exhibit strange behavior by locking himself into a room.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   It was not until the mother managed to kick the door in that the child revealed to her why he did not wish to go to the location.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   Based on the testimony and all of the events surrounding it as related through the testimony, these accounts ... [are] more probable to be true.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   At the time he made the statements, it was close to the alleged abuse[.] The amended indictment states the date of the abuse to be January 2008 until May of 2008, and it was ... [on] May 15th when M.W. ... first told these events to his mother. And, because of the close proximity in time, the Court finds that his recollection is probably accurate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   There is no motive as to why M.W. ... would lie about this occurrence. And the way in which M.W. ... revealed these episodes to his mother indicates that they are not concocted or fabricated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b646. As the trial judge conducted a hearing outside the jury's presence and made detailed findings on the record in accordance with Rule 803(25), we find this issue is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b647. The circuit court committed no reversible error in its rulings below. Therefore, we affirm Metcalf's convictions and sentences.
