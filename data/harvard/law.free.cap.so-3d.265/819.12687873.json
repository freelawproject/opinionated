He was adjudicated a third felony offender and sentenced to life imprisonment without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence. This court vacated his conviction due to insufficient evidence being presented at trial, which required the vacating of his habitual offender life sentence.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Defendant, charged with second degree kidnapping, was found guilty of simple kidnapping. This court determined in\n   <em>\n    State v.

In addition, the return of a nonresponsive verdict constitutes an error patent reviewable even in the absence of a defense objection. La.C.Cr.P. 920 ;\n   <em>\n    State v.
