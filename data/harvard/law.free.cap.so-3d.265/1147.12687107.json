He was evicted by a Warrant for Possession of Premises in favor of NOLA East, LLC, the landlord, on June 15, 2018. For the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand for a new trial at which Mr. Simms shall be entitled to offer his defense(s) and supporting evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff NOLA East, LLC, the landlord/property owner who is operating and doing business as Magnolia Gardens Apartments, filed a Rule for Possession of Premises on May 24, 2018, against Myron Simms due to his failure to pay rent for the month of May 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mr. Simms asserts on appeal that he did not pay his May rent because the landlord failed to make necessary repairs to his apartment. Mr. Simms states that he informed the landlord of the need for urgent repairs at the end of February 2018, and the landlord conducted an inspection on March 16, 2018, after which the landlord indicated that repairs would be made. Mr. Simms contends that the property manager drafted work-orders to request repairs three times, but the appropriate repairs were never made, and Mr. Simms was not able to live in the unit for approximately a month and a half. Mr. Simms told the property manager at the end of April that he could not live in the unit and he would not be able to continue paying rent if repairs were not made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Simms further claims that at the eviction hearing on June 4, 2018, he was not permitted to present any evidence or an affirmative defense regarding the conditions of the apartment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court evicted Mr. Simms from the premises through a Judgment of Possession in favor of NOLA East signed the same day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 7, 2018, Mr. Simms obtained legal aid counsel who drafted a motion for new trial, arguing that his rent should have abated due to the lack of habitability of his apartment pursuant to La. Civ. Code art. 2693.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Mr. Simms, the apartment had been uninhabitable since the end of February 2018 because \"raw sewage leaks from the ceiling\" of the bathroom when his upstairs or next-door neighbor flushed the toilet or took a shower; there was visible mold growing on the ceiling of the bathroom; there was a hole in the bathroom floor; and the unit had a rodent infestation. On June 12, 2018, a couple of days before the new-trial hearing, counsel for Mr. Simms withdrew from representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Appearing at the June 14 hearing\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Simms stated that he \"was not allowed to speak and defend [him]self\" at the June 4 eviction proceeding. He also stated that a number of other residents of Magnolia Gardens had requested a full investigation of the \"slum-lord\" property and had filed complaints with several governmental agencies and consumer-protection entities. The NOLA East representative stated at the June 14 hearing that she had tried to work out a deal with Mr. Simms' (former) counsel, such that he could pay half the rent at that time and pay the other half the following week, because Mr. Simms\n   historically had been good about paying his rent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The court denied the motion for new trial from the bench and determined that unsuitable living conditions did not excuse Mr. Simms from paying rent. The next day, June 15, 2018, the court entered a Warrant for Possession of Premises in favor of NOLA East, ordering the eviction of Mr. Simms. Mr. Simms filed a Motion for Appeal on June 15, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Pursuant to La. C.C.P. art. 4907 (B), Mr. Simms timely filed a motion for new trial from the June 4, 2018 judgment of possession and, when his request for a new trial was denied, timely moved for an appeal under La. C.C.P. art. 5002 (B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Simms, appearing\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , appeals the judgment \"granting rule for possession absolute as entered in the above case on the 4\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   day of June, 2018.\" In addressing Mr. Simms' appeal of the June 4, 2018 judgment, we also review the lower court's denial of his motion for new trial and the corresponding entry of a Warrant for Possession of Premises on June 15, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    New Orleans Fire Fighters Pension and Relief Fund v.

C.C.P. arts. 4701\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Under La. C.C.P. art. 4732, a \"court shall try the rule\n   <em>\n    and hear any defense which is made\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added). In addition, a new trial may be granted in any case if there are good grounds for doing so, and a new trial \"shall be granted when a party has discovered, since the trial, evidence important to the cause which he could not, with due diligence, have obtained before or during the trial.\" La. C.C.P. arts. 1971 - 1973.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mr. Simms argues on appeal, and argued at the new-trial hearing, that he did not get his day in court because he was not permitted to present his defenses-that he notified his landlord of the defective conditions several times; that his landlord never made the necessary repairs; and thus his rent should have abated under La. C.C. art. 2693 because the apartment he occupied was uninhabitable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Indeed, attached to the motion for new trial are photographs of what appear to be\n   moldy ceiling tiles and a hole in the floor in the bathroom, plus an inspection report prepared after the initial hearing on Mr. Simms' eviction on June 4. The inspection report suggests that Mr. Simms' apartment, # 13, had many irregularities, including faulty plumbing in the bathroom and decayed or defective interior surfaces. Although Mr. Simms complained of these conditions at the eviction hearing, there is no indication that he was given an opportunity to present this defense to non-payment of rent, as required by La. C.C.P. art. 4732.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The motion for new trial also reflects that Mr. Simms notified the landlord as early as February 2018 of the substandard conditions of the apartment, including problems in the bathroom related to raw sewerage leaking from the ceiling, mold, and rodents. The pertinent provision of the Lease between Magnolia Gardens and Mr. Simms provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    16. MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   C. Tenant agrees to promptly notify Landlord in the event of damage, defect or destruction of the Unit, or the failure of any of Landlord's appliances or mechanical systems, and except for repairs or replacements that are the obligation of Tenant pursuant to Subsection A above, Landlord shall use its best efforts to repair or replace such damaged or defective area, appliance or mechanical system.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Notwithstanding his complaints to the landlord in February, Mr. Simms asserted that he paid rent for the months of March and April 2018, but he vacated the apartment in May after receiving a notice of eviction. In early June, at the time of the City of New Orleans property inspection, the landlord still had not made the necessary repairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   While Mr. Simms adhered to his obligation to notify the landlord of the defects under the terms of the lease, he asserts that the landlord did not abide by its own obligations or \"use its best efforts to replace such damaged or defective area\" in accordance with the Lease provisions. La. C.C. art. 2682 describes a lessor's principal obligations as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   The lessor is bound:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (1) To deliver the thing to the lessee;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (2) To maintain the thing in a condition suitable for the purpose of which it is leased; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (3) To protect the lessee's peaceful possession for the duration of the lease.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The lessor has the obligation to maintain the leased premises in a condition fit for its intended use, and to make necessary repairs.

The report lists several violations\n   in Mr. Simms' apartment, such as deteriorated doors and inadequate locking; paint needed in the bathroom; leaking plumbing fixtures in the bathtub; holes at the bath fixtures; and deteriorated or loose plumbing fixtures. The inspection report notes defective conditions in neighboring apartments as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   La.

Given the circumstances of this case, we reverse the trial court's denial of Mr. Simms' motion for new trial, vacate the June 4, 2018 Rule for Possession and the June 15, 2018 Warrant for Possession of Premises, and remand the matter to First City Court for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED AND REMANDED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   LOBRANO, J., DISSENTS AND ASSIGNS REASONS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   LOBRANO, J., DISSENTS AND ASSIGNS REASONS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   I respectfully dissent. I would affirm the judgment of the lower court. I find that the lower court properly held the hearing on the eviction proceedings, and a new trial is not warranted. The lessee, Mr. Simms, failed to proffer the evidence he is now claiming he was not allowed to introduce. Regardless of whether Mr. Simms was allowed to address the habitability of the apartment, those defenses regarding habitability did not relieve him of his obligation to pay rent to the lessor, NOLA East.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \"In Louisiana, the lessor has the obligation to maintain the leased premises in a condition fit for its intended use, and to make necessary repairs.\"\n   <em>\n    KM, Inc. v.
