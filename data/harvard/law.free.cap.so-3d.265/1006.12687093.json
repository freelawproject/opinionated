For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 22, 2017, the Jefferson Parish District Attorney filed a bill of information charging defendant, Shawn R. Richardson, with possession of cocaine in violation of La. R.S. 40:967(C). Defendant was arraigned and pleaded not guilty. On January 29, 2018, the trial court held a hearing on defendant's motion to suppress evidence, and the motion was denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 13, 2018, the matter proceeded to trial, and a jury found defendant guilty of the responsive verdict of attempted possession of cocaine. On March 16, 2018, the trial court sentenced defendant to one year at hard labor, to run consecutively to any time defendant was presently serving. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On the night of August 7, 2017, Detective Nathaniel Obiol with the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office Narcotics Section observed a silver Chevy Malibu traveling on Veterans Boulevard near Lafreniere Park fail to signal as it changed lanes. At the time, Detective Obiol was alone in his unmarked unit but was working in tandem with four or five other narcotics officers, including his supervisor, Sergeant Joshua Collins. Officers conducted a traffic stop of the vehicle, and the driver pulled into a nearby parking lot in the 2600 block of Veterans Boulevard. Detective Obiol and several other unmarked police units equipped with police lights approached the vehicle when it pulled over.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Detective Obiol asked the driver, defendant, to step out. Detective Obiol immediately advised defendant of his\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   rights and the reason for the traffic stop, and defendant indicated that he understood his rights. During the traffic stop, Detective Obiol asked defendant if there was any contraband, such as narcotics or weapons, inside the vehicle or on his person. Detective Obiol testified that defendant was \"adamant\" there was nothing illegal in the vehicle or on his person, and defendant told the officers they could search him and his car. Sergeant Collins, who was present when defendant exited the vehicle, similarly recalled that defendant provided consent to search his person and vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In response to defendant's consent to search, Detective Obiol removed a stocking cap from defendant's head, and he and Sergeant Collins observed a plastic bag containing a rock of crack cocaine stuck to the side of defendant's head.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Detective\n   Obiol seized the item as evidence, and defendant was arrested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     LAW AND DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In his sole assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   He asserts that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated when officers conducted a search of his person and seized evidence following a traffic infraction. He argues that his detention was unlawful and the purpose of the stop was pretextual as it was based upon a tip from an unreliable and unverified confidential informant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The State responds that Detective Obiol was justified in stopping defendant after he observed the commission of a traffic infraction regardless of whether the stop was a pretext to investigate for narcotics. It argues that defendant voluntarily consented to a search of his person, and the seizure of the cocaine was legal under the consent exception to the warrant requirement. Thus, the State alleges that the trial court correctly denied the motion to suppress evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The State has the burden, in a hearing on a motion to suppress the evidence, of establishing the admissibility of evidence seized without a warrant. La. C.Cr.P. art. 703(D). The trial court's denial of a motion to suppress is afforded great weight and will not be set aside unless the preponderance of the evidence clearly favors suppression.\n   <em>\n    State v.

He stated that at approximately 9:50 p.m. on August 7, 2017, he received information from a confidential informant that a black male in a silver Chevy Malibu was selling crack cocaine in the area of Lafreniere Park. He testified that he and other members of his narcotics group established mobile surveillance of the area and observed a black male driving a silver Chevy Malibu on Veterans Boulevard in Metairie. Detective Obiol also testified, as he did at trial, that he observed a traffic violation when the vehicle failed to signal while changing lanes on Veterans Boulevard, so he conducted a traffic stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant asserts that he was unlawfully stopped based on a tip from an unreliable and unverified confidential informant. He also argues that the stop was a pretext to investigate and search for drugs. However, both at the suppression hearing and at trial, Detective Obiol testified that he stopped defendant for a traffic infraction after he observed defendant change lanes without signaling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. R.S. 32:104(D) (\"signals ... shall be used to indicate an intention to ... change lanes ...\").

Both at the suppression hearing and at trial, Detective Obiol maintained that defendant insisted he had no contraband or weapons on his person or his vehicle and gave the officers consent to search. When questioned by defense counsel as to why a waiver form was not executed for defendant's consent, Detective Obiol indicated that defendant was \"adamant that he didn't have anything on him,\" so he \"took his word\" and performed the search. At trial, Sergeant Collins corroborated Detective Obiol's testimony, stating that he was present when defendant was stopped and exited his vehicle, and that defendant provided consent to search his person and his vehicle. After defendant voluntarily consented to the search of his person, Detective Obiol removed the stocking cap on defendant's head, which resulted in the discovery of the cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The credibility of witnesses is best determined by the trial judge and is not to be disturbed on appeal unless the trial judge abuses his discretion.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The trial judge did not abuse his discretion in crediting the testimony of Detective Obiol, which was also supported by the testimony of Sergeant Collins, that defendant gave consent to search his person and his vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In conclusion, the stop of defendant pursuant to a traffic violation was lawful, and the record does not show that defendant was detained any longer than necessary. Defendant freely and voluntarily gave consent to search his person and vehicle, and the cocaine was lawfully seized from defendant's person. For these reasons, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ERRORS PATENT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The record was reviewed for errors patent, according to La.
