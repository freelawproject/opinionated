See General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-32. The petitioner committed the former crime after October 1, 1994. The conditions of probation that the petitioner was found to have violated, however, were established in connection with a sentence imposed for the petitioner\u2019s conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>of certain crimes committed before October 1, 1994.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The significance of October 1, 1994, is that a person who has committed a crime on or after that date and who is sentenced to a term of imprisonment in connection with a conviction of such a crime is not entitled to earn good time credit, which serves to accelerate the date of release from confinement. <em>Velez </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>250 Conn. 536, 552, 738 A.2d 604 (1999) (\u201cgood time statutes [are] inapplicable to persons sentenced to a term of imprisonment for crimes committed on or after October 1, 1994\u201d); see General Statutes \u00a7 18-100d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Persons sentenced for crimes committed before October 1,1994, however, remain entitled to such good time credit. See <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>254 Conn. 214, 217 n.2, 756 A.2d 1264 (2000) . The dispositive issue in the present case, therefore, is which of the petitioner\u2019s two concurrent sentences governs his release date: the pre-1994 sentence or the post-1994 sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">The respondent, the commissioner of correction (commissioner), claims that, because the petitioner had finished serving his pre-1994 sentence, which was reduced by statutory good time credit, as of February 15, 2001, the petitioner\u2019s post-1994 sentence, which would not have been completed until January 15, 2002, had \u201cthe longest term to rim . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-38 (b) (l)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (concurrent sentences \u201csatisfied by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>discharge of the term which has the longest term to run\u201d). We agree with the commissioner and, therefore, reverse in part the judgment of the habeas court and remand the matter with direction to render judgment denying count one of the petitioner\u2019s amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">The material facts are not in dispute. In 1991, the petitioner engaged in certain conduct that resulted in his conviction of assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (3) and assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (3). On June 18, 1993, the petitioner was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment, suspended after eight years, and three years probation, in connection with his conviction of assault in the first degree. The petitioner was sentenced to a concurrent term of five years imprisonment in connection with his conviction of assault in the second degree. After serving his terms of imprisonment,* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the petitioner was released and began serving his three year term of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">In March, 1998, while serving his term of probation, the petitioner was arrested and charged with, inter alia, carrying a pistol without a permit in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 29-35 (a). Thereafter, on April 23,1998, the petitioner was charged in a separate information with violating the conditions of his probation. See General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-32.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>On June 10,1998, the petitioner admitted to violating the conditions of his probation. Thereafter, on July 24, 1998, the petitioner pleaded guilty to the charge of carrying a pistol without a permit and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of three years and ten months in connection with that charge (post-1994 sentence). With respect to the charge of violating the conditions of probation, the petitioner\u2019s probation was revoked in accordance with \u00a7 53a-32 (b) (4), and a sentence of four years imprisonment was imposed (pre-1994 sentence).* ****<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> These sentences were to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Upon the petitioner\u2019s commitment to the custody of the commissioner, the commissioner calculated the petitioner\u2019s presentence confinement credit for both sentences and his presentence good time credit for the pre-1994 sentence. On the basis of the commissioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>initial calculations, the dates on which the petitioner could expect to be released from confinement with respect to the pre-1994 and post-1994 sentences were March 20, 2002, and January 15, 2002, respectively. Thus, upon the petitioner\u2019s commitment to the custody of the commissioner in 1998, the pre-1994 sentence had the longer term. As of February 1, 1999, however, the petitioner had earned additional good time credit in connection with his pre-1994 sentence, and, consequently, the release date for the pre-1994 sentence had changed from March 20, 2002, to January 7, 2002. The petitioner continued to earn good time credit and his pre-1994 sentence was completed on February 15,2001, at which point the post-1994 sentence still had 334 days remaining. Thus, at all times after February 1,1999, the post-1994 sentence had the longest term to run.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">In January, 1999, the petitioner filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus, claiming that the commissioner had calculated his estimated date of release from confinement improperly inasmuch as the petitioner was not being credited with \u201cgood time under old law.\u201d On June 7, 2000, following the appointment of counsel, the petitioner filed a two count amended habeas petition. In count one, the petitioner claimed that his pre-1994 sentence was \u201cthe controlling sentence for the purposes of calculating [his] statutory good time and release date because it [was] the longer of the two sentences [that he] was ordered to serve by the trial court on July 24, 1998.\u201d In support of his claim, the petitioner relied on General Statutes \u00a7 53a-38 (b) (1), which provides that, when two or more sentences are to run concurrently, \u201cthe terms merge in and are satisfied by discharge of the term which has the longest term to run . . . .\u201d The petitioner claimed that because the pre-1994 sentence had the longer term to run <em>on the date of sentencing, </em>it became the controlling sentence for the purpose of determining the petitioner\u2019s release date. The commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>sioner disagreed, contending that because the term of the petitioner\u2019s pre-1994 sentence was reduced as the petitioner earned good time credit in connection with that sentence, the post-1994 sentence had the longer term to run as of February 1, 1999, and, therefore, had become the controlling sentence for the purpose of calculating the petitioner\u2019s release date.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">In count two of his amended habeas petition, the petitioner alleged that he had been deprived of his state and federal due process rights as a result of the commissioner\u2019s failure to consider the pre-1994 sentence, under which the petitioner was entitled to accumulate good time credit, as the controlling sentence for the purpose of calculating the petitioner\u2019s release date. The petitioner framed his claim in count two in terms of a failure on the part of the state to honor the terms of the bargain to which the petitioner agreed when he pleaded guilty to carrying a pistol without a permit and admitted to violating the conditions of his probation in 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">The commissioner moved to dismiss both counts of the amended habeas petition. On July 13, 2000, the habeas court, <em>Devlin, J., </em>granted the commissioner\u2019s motion as to count one of the petition but denied the motion as to count two. In granting the commissioner\u2019s motion to dismiss count one, the habeas court relied on the Appellate Court\u2019s decision in <em>Valle </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>45 Conn. App. 566, 696 A.2d 1280 (1997), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 244 Conn. 634, 711 A.2d 722 (1998), in which the Appellate Court upheld a habeas court\u2019s determination that the commissioner should have considered the effect of presentence confinement credit on two separate, four year sentences in determining which one of the two sentences had the longest term to ran within the meaning of \u00a7 53a-38 (b) (1). See id., 570. Relying on <em>Valle, </em>the habeas court in the present case determined that \u201cthe commissioner . . . should apply \u00a7 53a-38 to concurrent sentences by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>separately calculating the release dates for each sentence and then selecting the latest date as the effective release date.\u201d Noting that the commissioner \u201cdid just that\u201d in the present case, the habeas court concluded that the petitioner could not prevail, as a matter of law, on his claim that his pre-1994 sentence was the controlling sentence for the puipose of determining his release date. The habeas court denied the commissioner\u2019s motion to dismiss count two of the amended habeas petition, however, owing to the existence of unresolved factual issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">On February 7, 2001, the petitioner filed a motion to reconsider the habeas court\u2019s dismissal of count one of the amended habeas petition on the basis of this court\u2019s August 15, 2000 decision in <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 214. The court, <em>Devlin, J., </em>granted the petitioner\u2019s motion on February 15, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">The habeas court then held an evidentiary hearing on February 23,2001. Mary Jane Steele, a records specialist employed by the department of correction, testified that the commissioner had estimated the petitioner\u2019s release date for his pre-1994 sentence immediately following his commitment to the custody of the commissioner in 1998. According to Steele, the petitioner\u2019s estimated release date for his pre-1994 sentence was calculated under the \u201cassumption\u201d that he would behave appropriately and earn all available good time credit during the duration of his sentence. Due to the inclusion of estimated statutory good time credit in the calculation of the petitioner\u2019s estimated release date for his pre1994 sentence, the estimated release date for that sentence was accelerated, thereby rendering the term under that sentence shorter than the term to run under the post-1994 sentence. According to Steele, this provided the basis for treating the petitioner\u2019s post-1994 sentence as the controlling sentence. Steele also testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>fied, however, that the pre-1994 sentence could have become the controlling sentence if the petitioner had failed to earn good time credit or had forfeited good time credit previously earned.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">The habeas court, relying primarily on our decision in <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 214, concluded that the commissioner \u201cincorrectly [had] calculated [the petitioner\u2019s] term of imprisonment,\u201d and, therefore, the petitioner was \u201centitled to have his sentence recalculated.\u201d As to count two of the amended habeas petition, however, the habeas court found in favor of the commissioner because \u201cthe petitioner ha[d] failed to prove that his plea bargain included an agreement that one of his two concurrent sentences [would] be controlling for purposes of calculating his release date.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">The habeas court determined that it is the function of the commissioner, \u201cin construing multiple terms of concurrent imprisonment as one continuous term . . . to merge the concurrent sentences and determine the prisoner\u2019s discharge by the term of the sentence [that] has the longest term to run.\u201d The habeas court recognized that this function was complicated in the present case by virtue of the fact that the petitioner\u2019s pre-1994 sentence was governed by General Statutes \u00a7 18-7a (c)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> whereas his post-1994 sentence was governed by \u00a7 18-100d.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number><footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The habeas court also noted that \u00a7 18-7a (c) eliminated the prior practice of \u201cposting,\u201d whereby department of correction personnel would estimate and credit statutory good time at the beginning of a prisoner\u2019s sentence on the basis of the term of imprisonment imposed by the sentencing court.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See generally <em>Seno </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>219 Conn. 269, 275-76, 593 A.2d 111 (1991). The habeas court concluded that the commissioner had, in effect, engaged in posting, a practice that had been abolished by the legislature in 1982 through the enactment of Public Acts 1982, No. 82-379, \u00a7 1, codified as amended at General Statutes \u00a7 18-7a. <em>Seno </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 280; see General Statutes \u00a7 18-7a (c); see also <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">The habeas court thus determined that the method that the commissioner used in calculating the petitioner\u2019s release date was flawed. Relying on our decision in <em>Rivera, </em>the habeas court proposed that the commissioner, instead, should have \u201cmerge[d] the [petitioner\u2019s] concurrent sentences without reference to estimated good time.\u201d Under this approach, the petitioner\u2019s pre1994 sentence, which had an estimated release date of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>March 20, 2002, before consideration of any statutory good time credit that could be earned while serving that sentence, would have been the controlling sentence when the petitioner was committed to the custody of the commissioner.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Consequently, the habeas court ordered the commissioner to recalculate the petitioner\u2019s release date using the petitioner\u2019s pre-1994 sentence as the controlling sentence and rendered judgment granting the petitioner\u2019s amended habeas petition as to count one and denying the petition as to count two.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">Upon the granting of certification, the commissioner appealed from the judgment of the habeas court to the Appellate Court. We thereafter transferred the appeal to this court pursuant General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">We begin our analysis with a discussion of the appropriate standard of review. Although a habeas court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under a clearly erroneous standard of review, questions of law are subject to plenary review. E.g., <em>Duperry </em>v. <em>Solnit, </em>261 Conn. 309, 318, 803 A.2d 287 (2002); <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>57 Conn. App. 145, 147, 747 A.2d 1058, cert. denied, 253 Conn. 920, 755 A.2d 215 (2000). Because the material facts are not in dispute and the issue before us presents a pure question of law, our review is plenary. See, e.g., <em>Cupe </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>68 Conn. App. 262, 267, 791 A.2d 614, cert. denied, 260 Conn. 908, 795 A.2d 544 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>Our resolution of this appeal requires us to harmonize the various statutes involved to produce a reasonable statutory scheme that carries out the apparent intent of the legislature. See, e.g., <em>Vernon Village, Inc. </em>v. <em>Carothers, </em>217 Conn. 130, 137, 585 A.2d 76 (1991); <em>In re Sheldon G., </em>216 Conn. 563, 578, 583 A.2d 112 (1990). We begin, therefore, by providing an overview of the relevant good time credit statutes and the development of the relevant case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">The legislature has changed the method by which good time credit is calculated on several occasions since 1976. General Statutes \u00a7 18-7<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> applies to all sentences imposed prior to October 1, 1976. General Statutes \u00a7 18-7a (a)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> applies to sentences imposed between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>October 1, 1976, and June 30, 1981. Subsection (b) of \u00a7 18-7a<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> applies to sentences imposed in connection with crimes committed between July 1, 1981, and June 30, 1983. The subsection of \u00a7 18-7a applicable to the petitioner\u2019s pre-1994 sentence, namely, subsection (c),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> applies to sentences imposed in connection with crimes committed between July 1, 1983, and September 30, 1994. General Statutes \u00a7 18-7a (c) provides in relevant part that \u201c[a]ny person sentenced to a term of imprisonment for an offense committed on or after July 1, 1983, may, while held in default of bond or while serving such sentence, by good conduct and obedience to the rules . . . earn a reduction of his sentence as such sentence is served in the amount of ten days for each month served ... up to five years, and twelve days for each month served . . . for the sixth and each subsequent year of a sentence which is more than five years. . . .\u201d Finally, \u00a7 18-100d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> eliminated good time credit for sentences imposed in connection with crimes committed on or after October 1, 1994; <em>Velez </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 552; and mandated that prisoners must serve their maximum term or terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">In <em>Velez </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 537-38, this court had the opportunity to address, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>for the first time, the relationship between General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 18-7, 18-7a (c), 18-98a, 18-98b and 18-98d (b), on the one hand, and \u00a7 18-100d, on the other. Sitting en banc, we unanimously held that \u00a7 18-100d renders the statutes affording presentence and statutory good time credit to prisoners, namely, \u00a7\u00a7 18-7, 18-7a (c), 18-98a, 18-98b and 18-98d (b), inapplicable to prisoners sentenced to a term of imprisonment for crimes committed on or after October 1, 1994. <em>Velez </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 552.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">In <em>Velez, </em>the petitioner, Jorge Velez, was convicted in connection with a robbery that occurred on November 30, 1994. Id., 538-39. In his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, Velez claimed that the good time credit statutes continued to apply to sentences imposed in connection with crimes committed on or after October 1,1994. See id., 539. The habeas court in <em>Velez </em>dismissed his petition, finding that statutes affording prisoners good time credit were not applicable to sentences for crimes committed on or after October 1, 1994. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">On appeal, we concluded that, \u201c[i]n enacting [Public Acts 1993, No. 93-219 (P.A. 93-219)], the legislature effected three relevant changes to the statutory scheme governing the release of prisoners. First, \u00a7 6 of P.A. 93-219 [which is now codified at General Statutes \u00a7 54-124c] transferred from the department [of correction (department)] to an independent board of parole [(board)] the supervision of all persons released from the custody of the department, other than those granted community placement pursuant to [General Statutes] \u00a7 18-100c. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">\u201cSecond, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of P.A. 93-219 amended [General Statutes] \u00a7\u00a7 18-lOOc and 54-125a, respectively, to increase, from one to two years, the sentence one could receive, and still be eligible for placement in a community correctional program. As amended, \u00a7 18-100c pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>vides for community placement of prisoners sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years or less, and \u00a7 54-125a provides for parole of prisoners sentenced to a term of imprisonment exceeding two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">\u201cThird, \u00a7 10 of P.A. 93-219 created a new statute codified [at General Statutes] \u00a7 18-100d [which] . . . provides: <em>1Notwithstanding any other provision of the general statutes, </em>any person convicted of a crime committed on or after October 1, 1994, shall be subject to supervision by personnel of the [department ... or the [b]oard . . . <em>until the expiration of the maximum term or terms for which he was sentenced.\u2019 </em>... By its terms, \u00a7 18-100d requires that a person convicted of a crime committed on or after October 1, 1994, remain under the authority of either the department or the board for the entire length of his or her court-imposed sentence. Thus, the language of \u00a7 18-100d manifests an intention that such persons be either incarcerated (i.e., under the authority of the department), placed in a community correctional program (i.e., under the authority of the department) or on parole (i.e., under the authority of the board) during the <em>entire term </em>of their court-imposed sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">\u201cMoreover, the phrase <em>\u2018[notwithstanding any other provision of the general statutes\u2019 </em>... in \u00a7 18-100d unequivocally indicates that the legislature intended that the statutory requirement that persons convicted of crimes committed on or after October 1,1994, remain under the authority of the department or the board for the entire length of the court-imposed sentences, would override any statutory provisions to the contrary. By its terms, therefore, \u00a7 18-100d indicates that the legislature intended that the good time statutes\u2014statutes that operate to release inmates and persons granted community placement from the authority of the department and to release parolees from the authority of the board after completion of only a portion of their court-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>imposed sentences\u2014no longer be applicable to persons convicted of crimes committed on or after October 1, 1994.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original.) <em>Velez </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 542-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">In <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 214, a decision relied on by both the petitioner and the habeas court, we determined that \u201ca prisoner who is serving multiple concurrent and consecutive sentences is entitled to have his total number of earned good time credits applied to reduce his total effective term of imprisonment.\u201d Id., 217. The petitioner, Carlos M. Rivera, was sentenced to three years imprisonment upon his conviction of a certain crime. Id., 218. While on supervised home release, Rivera was arrested on other charges. Id. As a result, Rivera\u2019s home release status was revoked and he continued to serve his three year sentence. Id. Soon thereafter, Rivera was convicted of the other charges and was sentenced to two eight year terms of imprisonment, which were to run concurrently with each other and with the original three year sentence, for a total effective sentence of eight years imprisonment. See id. Subsequently, Rivera received an additional sentence of one year imprisonment in connection with the commission of yet another crime. Id., 219. The court ordered Rivera\u2019s one year sentence to run consecutively to the existing effective sentence of eight years imprisonment, establishing a new total effective sentence of nine years imprisonment. See id. Rivera claimed, and we agreed, that certain good time credit that he had earned while serving his three year sentence should have been credited to his overall effective sentence of nine years. See id., 219-20, 255. We relied in part on that portion of \u00a7 18-7 that provides that \u201c[wjhen any prisoner is held under more than one conviction, the several terms of imprisonment imposed thereunder shall be construed as one continuous term for the purpose of estimating the amount of commuta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>tion which he may earn . . . General Statutes \u00a7 18-7; see <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 237-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">Against the foregoing statutory and common-law backdrop, we now review the commissioner\u2019s claims that the habeas court improperly concluded that the commissioner\u2019s calculation of the petitioner\u2019s release date was flawed and that any reliance by the habeas court on our decision in <em>Rivera </em>was misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">The habeas court determined that the commissioner\u2019s calculation of the petitioner\u2019s release date was flawed because the \u201cmore straightforward approach in the petitioner\u2019s situation [was] to merge the concurrent sentences without reference to estimated good time.\u201d The habeas court then concluded: \u201cThe result would be that the [petitioner\u2019s pre-1994] sentence is controlling because its release date of March 20, 2002, [occurs later] than the January 15, 2002 release date [of the petitioner\u2019s post-1994] sentence. If [the] petitioner is thereafter rewarded for good behavior by earning good time, then he is entitled to it. If such good time advances his release date to a point earlier than January 15, 2002, then such a result is the product of the concurrent sentencing approach that a trial court need not utilize. <em>See Rivera v. Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 249 (corut may easily avoid any untenable results by imposing consecutive terms of imprisonment rather than concurrent terms).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) We disagree with the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\"><em>Rivera </em>involved multiple sentences for crimes that all were committed prior to October 1, 1994. In fact, in a footnote appended to the first sentence of our opinion in <em>Rivera, </em>we expressly referenced our holding in <em>Velez </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 552, that \u00a7 18-100d eliminated good time credit for prisoners serving sentences for crimes committed on or after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>October 1,1994. <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 254 Conn. 217 n.2. We further distinguished <em>Rivera </em>from <em>Velez </em>by noting that our determination of the issues raised in <em>Rivera </em>\u201caffect[ed] numerous persons who . . . were sentenced for crimes committed before October 1, 1994.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">The habeas court did not adequately consider this court\u2019s decision in <em>Velez </em>and the plain language of \u00a7 18-lOOd when it concluded that the commissioner improperly calculated the petitioner\u2019s release date. In enacting \u00a7 18-100d, the legislature required that a person, such as the petitioner, who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment for a crime committed on or after October 1,1994, serve the entire length of his court imposed sentence. See General Statutes \u00a7 18-100d; <em>Velez </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 544-45. Under the habeas court\u2019s proposed method of calculating the petitioner\u2019s release date, however, the petitioner would not have had to serve the entire length of his post-1994 sentence, a result that the legislature sought to preclude when it enacted \u00a7 18-100d. We therefore disagree with the habeas court\u2019s application of <em>Rivera</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to the facts of this case. We further decline the petitioner\u2019s invitation to overrule <em>Velez.</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">The application of <em>Rivera </em>to the facts of this case would lead to untenable results. It is well settled that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>we will not interpret statutes to lead to bizarre results. E.g., <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities </em>v. <em>Sullivan Associates, </em>250 Conn. 763, 778, 739 A.2d 238 (1999). A corollary to the petitioner\u2019s suggested construction of the statutory scheme is that a person who is sentenced for a crime committed on or after October 1, 1994, may serve more time than a person who receives the same sentence for the same crime, but who also receives another, longer, concurrent sentence for a crime committed prior to October 1, 1994, the term of which is reduced by the application of good time credit. We do not believe that the legislature intended this result when it sought to ensure that prisoners sentenced for crimes committed on or after October 1, 1994, would serve their maximum term. See General Statutes \u00a7 18-100d; <em>Velez </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 250 Conn. 544-45. Accordingly, we conclude that the habeas court\u2019s proposed method of calculating the petitioner\u2019s release date is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">In addition to relying on <em>Rivera, </em>the habeas court concluded that the commissioner had engaged in posting, a practice that had been abolished by the legislature in 1982. <em>Seno </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 280; see General Statutes \u00a7 18-7a (c). As we stated previously in this opinion, posting is a practice whereby department of correction personnel estimate and credit statutory good time at the outset of a prisoner\u2019s sentence on the basis of the term imposed by the sentencing court as opposed to the term of imprisonment actually served. See footnote 10 of this opinion and accompanying text. See generally <em>Seno </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 275-76. Thus, for example, if a prisoner receives a three year sentence and is eligible to earn ten days of good time credit per month over the term of that sentence, he would be credited with 360 days of good time at the outset of his sentence. The legislature abolished this practice to serve the dual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>purposes of: (1) reinstating the concept of good time as a reward for good behavior; and (2) eliminating an illogical consequence of the posting system, namely, that a prisoner can receive good time credit for time never served. Id., 277-78.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">The commissioner did not engage in posting in the present case. At the hearing on the petitioner\u2019s amended habeas petition, Steele testified that the process of estimating a prisoner\u2019s release date is an ongoing task during the prisoner\u2019s term of incarceration because a prisoner can earn or lose good time credit as he serves his sentence. Steele also indicated that, when a prisoner is serving concurrent sentences, the status of a sentence as the controlling sentence, i.e., the sentence with the longest term to run, can change while the prisoner is serving the concurrent sentences. She pointed to the present case as an example.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">The process of estimating release dates at the outset in order to select a controlling sentence does not constitute posting, especially in light of the fact that the status of a sentence as a controlling sentence can change while the prisoner is serving his concurrent sentences. The petitioner\u2019s time sheets, which were received as exhibits at the petitioner\u2019s hearing, make clear that the petitioner was not credited with any unearned good time at the outset of his pre-1994 sentence but, rather, was earning twelve days of good time credit per month.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> After serving six months of his pre-1994 sentence, the petitioner had earned seventy-two days of good time credit in connection with that sentence. At that point, his post-1994 sentence became the sentence with the longer term to run and properly was deemed the controlling sentence for the purpose of determining the petitioner\u2019s release date. If the petitioner had for<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>feited his seventy-two days of good time credit and had earned no more good time credit in connection with his pre-1994 sentence, the pre-1994 sentence could have become the controlling sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Furthermore, the practice of estimating good time to determine which of two or more concurrent sentences is more likely to have the longer term to run neither compromises the concept of good time as a reward for good behavior nor allows a prisoner to receive good time credit for time that he never serves. See id., 277-78. Inasmuch as the practice of estimating good time for this purpose neither constitutes a form of posting nor implicates any of the concerns that led the legislature to eliminate posting in 1982; see Public Acts 1982, No. 82-379, \u00a7 1; we agree with the commissioner that the habeas court improperly concluded that the commissioner\u2019s calculation of the petitioner\u2019s release date resulted in posting in violation of \u00a7 18-7a (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">Having determined that <em>Rivera </em>is inapplicable to our analysis and that the commissioner did not engage in the practice of posting, we turn to the issue of how best to harmonize the mandates of \u00a7\u00a7 18-100d, 53a-38 (b) (1) and 18-7a (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">Section 18-100d requires that the petitioner serve his entire three year, ten month post-1994 sentence less any presentence confinement credit earned pursuant to \u00a7 18-98d (a). Pursuant to \u00a7 18-7a (c), the commissioner may apply good time credit against the petitioner\u2019s pre-1994 sentence on a monthly basis by virtue of the petitioner\u2019s good conduct and obedience of institutional rules.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Section 53a-38 (b) (1) requires the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>missioner to merge the terms of the petitioner\u2019s concurrent sentences and provides that the petitioner\u2019s sentences will be satisfied upon completion of the sentence with the longest term to run.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">We can harmonize the foregoing statutory provisions by recognizing that the status of a sentence as a controlling sentence can change while a prisoner is serving multiple, concurrent sentences where some but not all of those sentences are subject to reduction through the application of good time credit. Our construction of the statutory scheme is consistent with the requirement of \u00a7 18-7a (c) that good time be calculated on a monthly basis rather than at the beginning of a sentence. Our construction also is consistent with the provisions of \u00a7 18-100d, which require a prisoner to serve the full term of a sentence imposed in connection with a crime committed on or after October 1, 1994. Under our construction of the statutory scheme, the petitioner obtains the benefit of good time credit under \u00a7 18-7a (c) with respect to his pre-1994 sentence, as was the intent of the legislature for crimes committed before October 1, 1994, and the legislative mandate that the petitioner serve the full term of his post-1994 sentence is satisfied. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>We conclude, therefore, that the determination of which sentence is controlling is not a static concept.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Consequently, we disagree with the habeas court\u2019s conclusion that the commissioner<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> improperly calculated the petitioner\u2019s release date.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">The judgment is reversed in part and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment denying count one of the petitioner\u2019s amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus.

Thus, the sentence imposed for the petitioner\u2019s violation of the conditions of his probation is a pre-1994 sentence. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>207 Conn. 152, 178, 540 A.2d 679 (1988) (\u201cThe element of \u2018punishment\u2019 in probation revocation ... is attributable to the crime for which [the probationer] was originally convicted and sentenced.

See General Statutes \u00a7 18-7a (b). If that same person were required to earn good time credit as he serves his sentence, whereby statutory good time credit would be applied on a monthly basis, he would end up serving more time, approximately nine months under the foregoing hypothetical. By eliminating the practice of posting, the legislature sought to have the commissioner calculate statutory good time credit on the basis of time served as opposed to the length of the sentence imposed. <em>Seno </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>219 Conn. 269, 278-80, 593 A.2d 111 (1991).
