The plaintiff claims<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that the trial court improperly deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>mined that: (1) the department properly had exercised jurisdiction under state law, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 16-247b (a)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 16-247f (a),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and under federal law, pursuant to 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7251 (c) (3)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 252 (d) (1) (Sup. 1999),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> over the petition by competing carriers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>claiming that the plaintiff charged the carriers excessive and discriminatory rates for the enhanced services; and (2) the department had not set rates and, accordingly, had not exceeded its statutory authority by ordering the plaintiff to submit the tariff, despite the fact that the department had rejected the competing carriers\u2019 claim that the enhanced services were \u201cnecessary\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 16-247b (b).* *****<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">The record contains the following relevant facts and procedural history. The department is a state agency authorized pursuant to title 16 of the General Statutes and the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 (1996 federal act); 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq. (Sup. 1999); to regulate and supervise the operation of public service companies in Connecticut. The plaintiff is a public service company within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 16-1 (a) (4) and (23)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and an incumbent local exchange <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>carrier (incumbent carrier) in the state. State and federal law impose substantial obligations on the plaintiff as an incumbent carrier to share infrastructure facilities and wholesale services with competing carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">Prior to November, 1998, the plaintiff received requests from numerous competing carriers for certain service alternatives beyond those offered as part of the plaintiffs baseline ordering and provisioning processes. These services consisted of \u201cpre due date service confirmation,\u201d \u201cexpedite service,\u201d \u201ccoordinated cutover service,\u201d and \u201cout of hours service.\u201d* ****<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The plaintiff initially satisfied these requests on an ad hoc basis. In November, 1998, the plaintiff informed competing carriers that it was making the enhanced services generally available. Because the plaintiff considered these services enhancements to its baseline services, it determined that it could set the rates and conditions by which competing carriers could obtain these services, and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>accordingly, executed with competing carriers desiring the services a memorandum of understanding reflecting those terms. The plaintiff charged the competing carriers the following nonrecurring charges for the services: $489.53 for pre due date confirmation; $656.73 for expedite service; $378 for out of hours service; and $394.85 for coordinated cutoff service. The plaintiff offered these enhanced services to its own retail customers at either no cost or on a time and materials basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">MCI WorldCom, Inc. (MCI), a competing carrier, attempted unsuccessfully to negotiate, on behalf of its subsidiaries, alternative terms to those set forth in the plaintiffs memorandum of understanding for the enhanced services. As a result, in February, 1999, MCI filed a petition for a declaratory ruling with the department, requesting that the department assert jurisdiction over the nonrecurring charges assessed by the plaintiff for the enhanced services. Several other competing carriers filed petitions with the department in support of MCI\u2019s petition.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The competing carriers claimed that these services were necessary for the provision of telecommunications services and not mere enhancements to the plaintiffs baseline service, as the plaintiff had asserted. Accordingly, in the competing carriers\u2019 view, the rates for such services must be tariffed and approved by the department pursuant to its authority under \u00a7 16-247b (b), which authorizes the department to \u201cdetermine the rates\u201d for such \u201cnecessary\u201d services.*<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See footnote 3 of this opinion. The competing carriers further contended that the rates that the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>charged for the services were excessive and not cost-based. They claimed that the plaintiffs actions impaired their ability to compete because the plaintiff had discriminated against them by providing the same services to its own customers at little or no cost. The competing carriers pointed to recent amendments to \u00a7 16-247b (b), claiming that those changes require the plaintiff to provide nondiscriminatory pricing for unbundled<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> network elements<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> \u201cbased on their respective forward-looking long-run incremental costs, consistent with the provisions of 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 252 (d) [Sup. 1999].\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See Public Acts 1999, No. 99-222. To remedy these concerns, the competing carriers requested, inter alia, that the department require the plaintiff to submit a tariff of rates, subject to the department\u2019s approval, along with a cost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>study substantiating the rates that it charged for each enhanced service.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">In response to these claims, the plaintiff first contended that it had acted appropriately in all respects regarding its offering of the services pursuant to its memoranda of understanding and that its current rates were reasonable. Although the plaintiff conceded that it intended ultimately to file the executed agreements with the department, along with a cost study supporting its final rates, it contended that the department lacked jurisdiction over the enhanced services. Specifically, the plaintiff asserted that the only provisions under state and federal law that authorize the department to determine rates limit the exercise of that authority to claims implicating network elements or services that constitute necessary telecommunications services. Because, in the plaintiffs view, the enhanced services were neither necessary nor telecommunications services, the services fell beyond the department\u2019s purview. The plaintiff contended that, in the absence of such authority, it should be free to charge what the market for such services will bear. With respect to the claim of discriminatory treatment, the plaintiff asserted that its obligation not to discriminate meant only that it could not arbitrarily treat competing carriers differently, which it had not done.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>The department determined that the features and functions that constitute the enhanced services are not \u201cessential\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d services, but, rather, telecommunications services of apremiumnature. Nonetheless, it concluded that the enhanced services were subject to the department\u2019s jurisdiction. The department reasoned that as both a public service company and a telephone company; see footnote 8 of this opinion; the plaintiffs services fall within its jurisdiction. It also noted the department\u2019s broad grant of statutory authority pursuant to \u00a7 16-247\u00cd (a) to \u201cregulate the provision of telecommunications services in the state in a manner designed to foster competition and protect the public interest.\u201d The department further determined that \u00a7 16-247b (a); see footnote 3 of this opinion; both authorizes the department to determine which unbundled functions of a telecommunications company\u2019s network that are being used for telecommunications services are capable of being tariffed and bars the plaintiff from discriminating in providing those functions. Moreover, the department noted that it was vested with authority, pursuant to the 1996 federal act; 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 251, 252 (Sup. 1999); to ensure that all incumbent local exchange carrier interconnection and network element services are reasonable. Finally, the department noted that the plaintiff had proposed to file the executed agreements with the department, and that these arrangements were subject to the department\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">The department, therefore, addressed the merits of the competing carriers\u2019 claims. It agreed with the competing carriers that the plaintiffs rates were excessive. It noted that, in prior decisions, the department had determined that costs must be calculated based on a particular forward-looking methodology, total service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>long run incremental cost (long run cost).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It also had determined previously that this methodology failed to account for certain costs that the plaintiff was entitled to recover and, accordingly, the plaintiff had been permitted to set rates based on a 25 percent level of contribution<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> to recover those costs. In light of those prior decisions, the department concluded that the plaintiff must propose rates calculated pursuant to the long run cost methodology plus a reasonable markup, which, in light of the fact that the enhanced services were not essential, could not exceed 25 percent. The department therefore ordered the plaintiff to submit a tariff for approval that satisfied these, as well as other,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> conditions. The department further found that the plaintiff had discriminated by offering the enhanced services to its own retail customers at no cost or on a time and materials basis. It therefore ordered the plaintiff to impose the same charges contained in the tariff on its retail customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">The plaintiff thereafter submitted proposed tariffs to the department. It also filed an appeal from the depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>ment\u2019s decision to the Superior Court,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-183.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The plaintiff claimed that the department had exceeded its statutory authority pursuant to \u00a7 16-247b (b), which permits the department to determine rates for \u201ctelecommunications services . . . that are necessary for the provision of telecommunications,\u201d because the department had set rates for the enhanced services despite having concluded that those services were not necessary. The plaintiff further claimed that the department improperly had attempted to expand its authority by relying on other state and federal provisions that did not expressly authorize rate setting for services deemed to be not necessary. Moreover, the plaintiff claimed that the department could not exercise jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 16-247b (a) to prevent discriminatory conduct because the department had failed to satisfy a necessary predicate of that subsection by either not acting in the context of an unbundling proceeding or not making comparable findings to those made in an unbundling proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-4\">The trial court rejected the plaintiffs claims. The court first reasoned that the department had not exceeded its authority under \u00a7 16-247b (b) because it had not \u201cset the rates\u201d for the enhanced services. Instead, the trial court concluded, the department properly had exercised its authority pursuant to \u00a7 16-247b (a) to prohibit the plaintiff from discriminating in the rates it charged its own retail customers and the competing carriers. The trial court further reasoned that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>\u00a7 16-247b (a) does not require linguistically that services or functions be unbundled as a predicate to the department\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction to prevent discriminatory conduct and that, as a matter of common sense, an unbundling proceeding was not required when the plaintiff voluntarily had offered the services on an unbundled basis. Finally, the trial court noted the department\u2019s authority to prohibit discriminatory practices under \u00a7 16-247f (a) and 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 251 and 252 (Sup. 1999). See footnotes 5 and 6 of this opinion. Accordingly, the trial court dismissed the plaintiffs appeal. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">We first set forth the well established principles guiding our standard of review of the department\u2019s decision. \u201c[A]n agency\u2019s factual and discretionary determinations are to be accorded considerable weight by the courts. . . . Cases that present pure questions of law, however, invoke a broader standard of review than is ordinarily involved in deciding whether, in light of the evidence, the agency has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion. . . . We have determined, therefore, that the traditional deference accorded to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statutory term is unwarranted when the construction of a statute . . . has not previously been subjected to judicial scrutiny [or to] ... a governmental agency\u2019s time-tested interpretation . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Hartford Municipal Employees Assn., </em>259 Conn. 251, 261-62, 788 A.2d 60 (2002). The issues of whether the department properly had exercised jurisdiction over the competing carriers\u2019 claims that the plaintiff charged excessive and discriminatory rates and whether the department had exceeded its authority when it ordered the plaintiff to file a tariff that conformed with specific rate setting guidelines present questions of law. The department does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>claim that its interpretation of the statute is time-tested. Accordingly, we exercise plenary review over the plaintiffs claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">\u201cWe approach this question according to well established principles of statutory construction designed to further our fundamental objective of ascertaining and giving effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, [and] to the legislative policy it was designed to implement . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">Before addressing the merits of the plaintiffs claims, we note that this appeal requires us to navigate the murky waters of telecommunications regulatory reform, between the 1996 federal act, described as \u201cin many important respects a model of ambiguity or indeed even self-contradiction\u201d; <em>AT&amp;T Corp. </em>v. <em>Iowa Utilities Board, </em>525 U.S. 366, 397, 119 S. Ct. 721, 142 L. Ed. 2d 834 (1999); and the provisions enacted under Connecticut law prior to and in reaction to the 1996 federal act. We, therefore, preface our analysis with an overview of the development of telecommunications law relevant to the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">In 1993, the Connecticut legislature took the first steps to change an entrenched system in which a few telephone companies had state sanctioned monopolies over local exchange service; see General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 16-247b (a); by creating a task force to study ways to open the system to competition. See Public Acts 1993, No. 93-330, \u00a7 1. As an initial step toward the impending reforms, the legislature enacted a provision requiring the telephone companies to provide to its competitors \u201creasonable nondiscriminatory access to all equipment, facilities and services located within the state necessary to provide competitive or unregulated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>telecommunications services to customers\u201d and mandating that the department \u201cdetermine the rates\u201d for such necessary services. Public Act 93-330, \u00a7 2 (b). The following year, the legislature took the lead in the nation in local telephone service reform when it implemented the task force\u2019s recommendations. See Public Acts 1994, No. 94-83; see also 42 S. Proc., Pt. 7,1999 Sess., p. 2476, remarks of Senator John Fonfara (calling Public Act 94-83 \u201clandmark legislation\u201d; noting that Connecticut was first state in country to pass deregulation of telecommunications industry). The goals of Public Act 94-83, referred to as the 1994 Telecommunications Act (state act), included ensuring access to high quality, affordable service and promoting competition as a means of ensuring a wide choice of customer services. See General Statutes \u00a7 16-247a (a) (1) and (2).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In order to achieve these goals, the state act emphasized the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>need to regulate commensurate with the level of competition and to encourage the shared use of the existing facilities belonging to the incumbent carriers. See General Statutes \u00a7 16-247a (a) (3) and (5). The state act mandated that the department \u201cregulate the provision of telecommunications services in the state in a manner designed to foster competition and protect the public interest.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 16-247f (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">As part of its implementation of these goals, the state act included a provision giving the department the authority to initiate proceedings, either on petition or pursuant to its own motion, in which it could order the local telephone company to unbundle<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> certain functions of its network, if the department determined that the unbundled functions are \u201creasonably capable of being tariffed and offered as separate services. Such unbundled functions shall be offered under tariff at rates, terms, and conditions that do not unreasonably discriminate among . . . users and . . . providers of such local network services.\u201d Public Act 94-83, \u00a7 3 (a); see General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 16-247b (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Two years after Connecticut instituted local telephone reform, Congress enacted the 1996 federal act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>which amended the Communications Act of 1934 that previously had been codified at 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 et seq. and instituted a comprehensive scheme, the goals of which were to end state sanctioned telephone monopolies and to open up competition across the country. See Pub. L. No. 104-104, 110 Stat. 56, codified at 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7151 through 276 (Sup. 1999); see also H.R. Rep. No. 104-204, reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 10 (purpose of 1996 federal act is to \u201cpromot[e] competition and [reduce] regulation in order to secure lower prices and higher quality services for American telecommunications consumers and encourage the rapid development of new telecommunications technologies\u201d). The 1996 federal act prescribes a power sharing arrangement between the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the state commissioners. <em>MCI Worldcom Network Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Federal Communications Commission, </em>274 F.3d 542, 544 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (1996 federal act is \u201ca kind of \u2018intergovernmental partnership\u2019 with a division of responsibility between the FCC and the states\u201d); <em>Puerto Rico Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Telecommunications Regulatory Board of Puerto Rico, </em>189 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1999) (1996 federal act is \u201cexercise in . . . cooperative federalism\u201d); see also <em>MCI Telecommunications Corp. </em>v. <em>U.S. West Communications, </em>204 F.3d 1262, 1265 (9th Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1001, 121 S. Ct. 504, 148 L. Ed. 2d 473 (2001) (noting irony of \u201cstatute intended to promote competition [but that] creates two levels of regulatory control\u201d). \u201cThe [FCC] is charged with the responsibility of promulgating regulations necessary to implement the [1996 federal act], but the [federal] [a]ct reserves to states the ability to impose additional requirements so long as the requirements are consistent with the [federal act] and \u2018further competition.\u2019 \u201d <em>MCI Telecommunications Corp. </em>v. <em>U.S. West Communications, </em>supra, 1265; see 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 251 (d) (3) and 253; 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.317 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Like the Connecticut reform scheme, the 1996 federal act contains a provision to enable new market entrants to gain access to an incumbent carrier\u2019s facilities in order to offer competition in local telephone service. See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 251 (Sup. 1999); see also H.R. Rep. No. 104-204, p. 47, reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 10. Section 251 prescribes affirmative duties for incumbent carriers in order to ensure this access. Specifically, upon request by a competing carrier, an incumbent carrier is required to: sell local telephone services to competing carriers at wholesale rates for resale to end users (resale); interconnect the competing carriers\u2019 network with its own network (interconnection); and provide network elements to competing carriers on an unbundled basis (unbundled access). See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 251 (c) (2) through (4) (Sup. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">With respect to unbundled access, \u00a7 251 further prescribes that the incumbent carrier must provide such access to network elements \u201cat any technically feasible point on rates, terms, and conditions that are just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory . . . .\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 251 (c) (3) (Sup. 1999). The scope of this duty is limited by \u00a7 251 (d), however, which requires the commissioner of the FCC to establish regulations to determine what network elements should be made available based on whether: \u201c(A) access to such network elements as are proprietary in nature is necessary; and (B) the failure to provide access to such network elements would <em>impair </em>the ability of the telecommunications carrier seeking access to provide the services that it seeks to offer.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 251 (d) (2) (Sup. 1999); see also <em>AT&amp;T Corp. </em>v. <em>Iowa Utilities Board, </em>supra, 525 U.S. 388-90 (vacating original FCC regulation that did not consider adequately whether elements met \u201cnecessary and impair\u201d standard). Accordingly, the FCC has promulgated regulations elaborating on the meaning of the \u201cnecessary and impair\u201d standard and setting forth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>specific network elements that must be offered to competitors. 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 51.317, 51.319 (2001). The FCC regulations further provide that the state commissioners may require incumbent carriers, on a case-by-case basis, to provide unbundled access to additional network elements, so long as they adhere to the \u201cnecessary and impair\u201d standard. 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.317 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-4\">Section 252 of title 47 of the United States Code sets forth the procedures by which competing carriers may request and obtain unbundled access to network elements, as well as interconnection and services. <em>AT&amp;T Corp. </em>v. <em>Federal Communications Commission, </em>220 F.3d 607, 611 (D.C. Cir. 2000). Unlike the state act, which envisioned resolution of such issues through an unbundling proceeding conducted by the department, the federal scheme emphasizes private, voluntary negotiation between the parties. See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 252 (a) (Sup. 1999); see also L. Freedman &amp; R. Davis, Negotiating Competition, 52 Admin. L. Rev. 999, 1003-1004 (Summer 2000) (describing negotiation process). Should such negotiations fail, a party may obtain binding arbitration by the state commissioner, at which time the commissioner may, inter alia, determine the \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d and \u201cnondiscriminatory\u201d rates for the unbundled network element. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 252 (b), (c), (d) (1) (Sup. 1999); see footnote 6 of this opinion. Such rates must be cost-based<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and nondiscriminatory, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>\u201cmay include a reasonable profit.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 252 (d) (1) (B) (Sup. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">Three years after the passage of the 1996 federal act, the Connecticut legislature enacted further changes to the state telecommunications scheme. See Public Acts 1999, No. 99-222. The changes expressly reflect a goal, in part, of conforming portions of the state law to the 1996 federal act.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Specifically, subsections (a) and (b) of \u00a7 16-247b, the state counterpart to federal provisions 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 251 and 252, were amended to incorporate references to the federal provisions.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> See footnote 3 of this opinion. For the most part, however, the 1999 amendment did not result in creating a state scheme that precisely tracks the language of the federal provisions. Accordingly, we address the import of these changes and inconsistencies where relevant to our analysis of the issues before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">With the foregoing legal landscape in mind, we now address the plaintiffs claims. We begin with the plaintiffs challenges to the department\u2019s jurisdiction and authority under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">The plaintiff first claims that the trial court improperly determined that the department properly had exercised jurisdiction, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 16-247b (a) and 16-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>247f (a), over the rates the plaintiff charged for the enhanced services when adjudicating the competing carriers\u2019 claims that the plaintiff was charging them excessive and discriminatory rates for the services. At the heart of the plaintiffs claim is its contention that \u00a7 16-247b (b) is the only source of jurisdiction for rate setting and that this provision limits such authority to necessary telecommunications services. Because the department determined that the services are not essential\u2014a finding the trial court equated with not necessary\u2014the plaintiff claims that the department lacks jurisdiction under \u00a7 16-247b (b) and, accordingly, cannot assert jurisdiction pursuant to other statutes that do not expressly confer authority to set rates. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">The principles of subject matter juxisdiction are well established. \u201cJurisdiction of the subject-matter is the power [of the court] to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong. ... A court has subject matter jurisdiction if it has the authority to adjudicate a particular type of legal controversy. . . . It is a familiar principle that a court which exercises a limited and statutory jurisdiction is without jurisdiction to act unless it does so under the precise circumstances and in the manner particularly prescribed by the enabling legislation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Crystal, </em>251 Conn. 748, 763, 741 A.2d 956 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">\u201cThis concept, however, is not limited to courts. Administrative agencies [such as the department] are tribunals of limited jxirisdiction and their jurisdiction is dependent entirely upon the validity of the statutes vesting them with power and they cannot confer jurisdiction upon themselves. . . . We have recognized that [i]t is clear that an administrative body must act strictly within its statutory authority, within constitutional limitations and in a lawful manner. ... It cannot modify, abridge or othexwise change the statutory provisions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>under which it acquires authority unless the statutes expressly grant it that power.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Figueroa </em>v. <em>C &amp; S Ball Bearing, </em>237 Conn. 1, 4, 675 A.2d 845 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">As noted previously, when enacting the broad regulatory reforms over local telephone service in 1994, the Connecticut legislature set forth specific goals, among them to \u201censure . . . accessibility of high quality, affordable telecommunications services to all residents and businesses in the state\u201d and to \u201cpromote the development of effective competition . . . .\u201d Public Act 94-83, \u00a7 2 (a); see General Statutes \u00a7 16-247a (a) (1) and (2). The legislature then mandated that the department implement various provisions of the state act, including \u00a7\u00a7 16-247\u00cd and 16-247b, \u201cin accordance with these goals.\u201d Public Act 94-83, \u00a7 2 (a); General Statutes \u00a7 16-247a (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">The legislature conferred a broad grant of authority upon the department in \u00a7 16-247\u00cd (a), requiring it to \u201cregulate the provision of telecommunications services ... in a manner designed to foster competition and protect the public interest.\u201d The competing carriers had claimed that the plaintiff was charging excessive rates for the enhanced provisioning services and that the plaintiff had charged either a minimal fee or no fee to its own customers. The competing carriers further claimed that they would be unable to compete in giving customers desired services if they were forced to pay the inflated rates that the plaintiff sought to impose. It is evident, therefore, that that these claims fall within the department\u2019s purview of regulating to foster effective competition and to protect the public\u2019s interest in affordable telephone services.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">The plaintiff claims that the more specific grant of jurisdiction to the department to set rates for necessary services in \u00a7 16-247b (b) requires us to apply the maxim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>of statutory construction that \u201cspecific terms covering the given subject matter will prevail over general language of the same or another statute which might otherwise prove controlling.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Darlene C., </em>247 Conn. 1, 14, 717 A.2d 1242 (1998). We disagree with the plaintiffs premise that the legislature had evinced an intention by its express grant of authority under \u00a7 16-247b (b) to limit its otherwise broad grant of regulatory authority to the department under \u00a7\u00a7 16-247a and 16-247L</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">The United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>AT&amp;T Corp. </em>v. <em>Iowa, Utilities Board, </em>supra, 525 U.S. 366, informs our reasoning on this question. One of the issues before the court in that case was whether the commissioner of the FCC had jurisdiction pursuant to the 1996 federal act to promulgate regulations prescribing a cost methodology that was binding on the states when determining rates. Id., 374. The court determined that the FCC did have jurisdiction, relying on 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 201 (b), which provides in relevant part: \u201cThe [FCC] may prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary in the public interest to carry out the provisions of this chapter.\u201d The court reasoned that the broad grant of jurisdiction under \u00a7 201 <em>\u201cexplicitly </em>gives the FCC jurisdiction to make rules governing matters to which the [1996 federal act] applies.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>AT&amp;T Corp. </em>v. <em>Iowa Utilities Board, </em>supra, 380. The incumbent carriers challenging the regulations had contended that specific language in 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 252 (c) (Sup. 1999) authorizing the state commissioners to \u201cestablish any rates\u201d entrusted jurisdiction over establishing rates to those commissioners. <em>AT&amp;T Corp. </em>v. <em>Iowa Utilities Board, </em>supra, 383-84. The court rejected that contention, reasoning that the state commissioners\u2019 application of the prescribed cost methodology to determine a concrete result was sufficient to constitute establishing rates. Id., 384. More important for our pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>poses, the court also rejected the incumbent carriers\u2019 contention that, because the FCC was mandated to promulgate regulations in one provision of \u00a7 252 (c) that was unrelated to rates, it thereby was precluded from promulgating regulations pursuant to the subsection addressing rates, which contained no express grant of authority to the FCC. Id., 384-85. The incumbent carriers had contended that the absence of an express grant of jurisdiction evinced Congress\u2019 intention to limit the FCC\u2019s otherwise broad grant of authority to regulate under \u00a7 201 (b). Id., 384. The Supreme Court explained in rejecting that contention: \u201cIt seems to us not peculiar that the mandated regulations should be specifically referenced, whereas regulations permitted pursuant to the [FCC\u2019s] \u00a7 201 (b) authority are not. In any event, the mere lack of parallelism is surely not enough to displace that explicit authority.\u201d Id., 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Our state scheme contains a broad grant of authority to the department to protect the public interest similar to that afforded to the FCC under the 1996 federal act. See General Statutes \u00a7 16-247\u00cd (a); see also General Statutes \u00a7 16-247a. The plaintiff has provided no evidence that the legislature\u2019s specific mandate that the department <em>must </em>determine the rates for necessary telecommunications services displaces the department\u2019s jurisdiction with respect to services that are not necessary in the strict technical sense applied by the department under \u00a7 16-247b (b), but that are needed nonetheless in order to compete effectively. Indeed, we find neither limiting language in the statute nor any legislative history demonstrating such an intention. Cf. <em>Gifford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>227 Conn. 641, 658-61, 631 A.2d 252 (1993) (noting language in statute limiting broader term and legislative history that evinced intention to make such limitation). Accordingly, we conclude that the legislature\u2019s specific grant of jurisdiction to the department under \u00a7 16-247b (b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>does not limit or negate its broad jurisdictional grant to the department pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 16-247a and 16-247L</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">Furthermore, \u00a7 16-247b (a) <em>expressly </em>prohibits the discriminatory practice in which the plaintiff was alleged to have been engaged. That section provides in relevant part: \u201cAny telecommunications services, functions and unbundled network elements and any combination thereof <em>shall be offered, under tariff at rates, terms and conditions that do not unreasonably discriminate </em>among actual and potential users and actual and potential providers of such local network services. \u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 16-247b (a). We point out that this prohibition is in addition to a similar ban on discriminatory conduct contained in subsection (b) of \u00a7 16-247b. See footnote 3 of this opinion. This dual prohibition evinces legislative intent to prohibit discriminatory conduct both with respect to necessary services, pursuant to subsection (b), and with respect to services that are deemed not necessary, pursuant to subsection (a). To read the parallel provisions otherwise would render the prohibition in subsection (a) superfluous, and, accordingly, we reject such an interpretation. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gibbs, </em>254 Conn. 578, 602, 758 A.2d 327 (2000) (\u201cIt is a basic tenet of statutoiy construction that the legislature did not intend to enact meaningless provisions. . . . [Statutes must be construed, if possible, such that no clause, sentence or word shall be superfluous, void or insignificant . . . .\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]). The prohibition on discriminatory conduct in \u00a7 16-247b (a), therefore, provides the department with specific \u201cauthority to adjudicate [the] particular type of legal controversy\u201d raised by the competing carriers\u2019 petition. <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Crystal, </em>supra, 251 Conn. 763.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">We conclude that the competing carriers\u2019 claims raised issues of whether the plaintiffs conduct, with respect to its offering of the enhanced services, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>discriminatory and contrary to the goals of the state act of providing affordable telephone service, promoting competition and protecting the public interest. Accordingly, the trial court properly determined that the department had subject matter jurisdiction over the claims under state law. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 16-247a, 16-247b (a) and 16-247\u00cd (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The plaintiff next claims that the trial court improperly determined that the department had the authority, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 16-247b (a) and 16-247\u00cd (a), to order the plaintiff to submit a tariff, subject to the department\u2019s approval, that satisfied specific criteria. The plaintiff offers two arguments in support of this claim. First, the department failed to conduct an unbundling proceeding, which, in the plaintiffs view, is a necessary predicate to the department\u2019s exercise of authority under \u00a7 16-247b (a). Second, the plaintiff claims that, even if the department had jurisdiction over the competing carriers\u2019 claims pursuant to \u00a7 16-247b (a), the department\u2019s authority under that section is limited to preventing the discriminatory application of rates, and does not extend to setting rates. We reject both of these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">The plaintiff had raised, in its brief, the issue of whether an unbundling proceeding, as provided for in the first sentence in \u00a7 16-247b (a); see footnote 3 of this opinion; is a necessary predicate to the department\u2019s exercise of authority over discrimination claims under that section. At oral argument, however, the plaintiff agreed with the department\u2019s position that it voluntarily had offered the enhanced services on an unbundled basis. The plaintiff then conceded that, as a result, there was \u201cno need\u201d for an unbundling proceeding.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>ingly, in the plaintiffs view, because there had been no unbundling proceeding, a proceeding that it concedes was unnecessary, the department could not exercise its authority pursuant to the second sentence in \u00a7 16-247b (a) to prevent unreasonable discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">We reject this position, in part, because it \u201cwould require a circular course of reasoning in which we are unprepared to indulge.\u201d <em>In re Jonathan M., </em>255 Conn. 208, 223, 764 A.2d 739 (2001). In addition, if we were to accept the plaintiffs premise, an incumbent carrier could circumvent the department\u2019s authority under \u00a7 16-247b (a) to prevent unreasonable discrimination any time it chose to by voluntarily offering the services on an unbundled basis. Such an interpretation of the statute clearly runs counter to the legislature\u2019s intent and we, therefore, reject it. See <em>Southington </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em>254 Conn. 348, 358, 757 A.2d 549 (2000) (\u201cwe read each statute in a manner that will not thwart its intended purpose or lead to absurd results\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Finally, we interpret the plaintiffs position that there was no need for an unbundling proceeding as a waiver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>of a claim that it is entitled to such a proceeding. See <em>Habetz </em>v. <em>Condon, </em>224 Conn. 231, 233 n.3, 618 A.2d 501 (1992) (plaintiffs claim raised in brief but abandoned at oral argument considered waived); <em>Bowman </em>v. <em>1477 Central Avenue Apartments, Inc., </em>203 Conn. 246, 255 n.8, 524 A.2d 610 (1987) (same). This waiver eliminates, therefore, our need to determine whether the department is required under \u00a7 16-247b (a) to conduct an unbundling proceeding, making the requisite findings (i.e., that unbundling is in the public interest, consistent with federal law), in order to exercise its authority under the second sentence of that section to prevent unreasonable discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">The plaintiff next contends that, even if the department has the authority to prevent unreasonable discrimination under \u00a7 16-247b (a) in the absence of an unbundling proceeding, that authority is limited to ordering the plaintiff not to discriminate and does not extend to setting rates. The plaintiff contends that the department did in fact set rates in its decision by prescribing a specific cost methodology that it must utilize and by determining the maximum markup it may charge. Accordingly, in the plaintiffs view, the department exceeded its authority under \u00a7 16-247b (b), which authorizes the department to determine the rates only for necessary telecommunications services. Because we have determined in part IIA of this opinion that the specific grant of jurisdiction in \u00a7 16-247b (b) does not otherwise constrain the department\u2019s jurisdiction, however, the issue is not whether the department did or did not determine rates in its decision. The issue is whether the department\u2019s action was in excess of its statutory authority pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 16-247b (a), 16-247a and 16-247f (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">We begin with \u00a7 16-247b (a), which provides in relevant part: \u201cAny telecommunications services, functions and unbundled network elements and any combination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>thereof shall be offered under tariff at rates, terms and conditions that do not unreasonably discriminate among actual and potential users and actual and potential providers of such local network services.\u201d The requirement that telecommunications services be \u201coffered under tariff\u2019 logically leads to the conclusion that the department has the authority to order the plaintiff to file a tariff for the services in order to ensure that the plaintiff is not discriminating in its provision of the services. Cf. General Statutes \u00a7 16-247\u00cd (referring to tariff investigations by department and tariff filings); Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 16-1-59A (prescribing procedures for \u201ctariff filings by telephone companies [that] do not alter existing rates or charges\u201d). Moreover, this provision does not proscribe all discriminatory conduct but only <em>unreasonable </em>discrimination. Therefore, the department may do more than what the plaintiff suggested in oral argument before this court, which was simply to order the plaintiff not to discriminate. It is within the scope of the department\u2019s authority to prescribe a cost methodology from which it may determine, based upon neutral criteria, whether any variation in rates the plaintiff charges to various competing carriers and its customers is a reasonable, cost-based distinction or simply discrimination unconnected to any rationale. We conclude, however, that the scope of the department\u2019s authority under \u00a7 16-247b (a) to prevent unreasonable discrimination does not extend to prescribing the maximum markup an incumbent carrier may take on services. Accordingly, we now turn to \u00a7\u00a7 16-247a and 16-247\u00cd (a) to determine whether those provisions provide the department with such authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">Section 16-247\u00cd (a) requires the department to \u201cregulate the provision of telecommunications services in the state in a manner designed to foster competition and protect the public interest.\u201d One aspect of the public\u2019s interest, as set forth in \u00a7 16-247a, is in high quality, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>affordable telephone service. In light of the remedial purposes of the statute, we read this authority broadly so as to effectuate the legislature\u2019s intent. See <em>Ganim </em>v. <em>Smith &amp; Wesson Corp., </em>258 Conn. 313, 373, 780 A.2d 98 (2001) (Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act is \u201cremedial statute that must be accorded a liberal interpretation in favor of those whom the legislature intended to benefit\u201d); <em>BEC Corp. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Environmental Protection, </em>256 Conn. 602, 621-22, 775 A.2d 928 (2001) (\u201cconclusion that the individual plaintiffs personally are liable under [General Statutes] \u00a7 22a-432 is supported by the broad remedial purpose of the [Environmental Protection Act], which is to protect the waters of the state from pollution\u201d); <em>Hartford Electric Supply Co. </em>v. <em>Allen-Bradley Co., </em>250 Conn. 334, 345, 736 A.2d 824 (1999) (Connecticut \u201c[Franchise [A]ct\u2019s remedial purpose, to prevent a franchisor from unfairly exerting economic leverage over a franchisee, indicates that the statute should be read broadly in favor of the plaintiff\u2019). Moreover, \u201cthe legislature\u2019s broad grant of power may be interpreted to include the conferral of such lesser included powers as are necessary to fulfill a legislative mandate.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Nelseco Navigation Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Liquor Control, </em>226 Conn. 418, 424, 627 A.2d 939 (1993); see also <em>Greenwich </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>219 Conn. 121, 126, 592 A.2d 372 (1991) (department has authority to equalize rates, despite no express authority, in fight of \u201cremedial purpose\u201d of statute and \u201cevident legislative intent to rely on the [department\u2019s] expertise\u201d); <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Dept. of Public Utility Control, </em>219 Conn. 51, 64, 591 A.2d 1231 (1991) (General Statutes \u00a7 16-19e creates \u201cbroad grant of regulatory authority [to the department that] carries with it the necessarily equally broad discretion, to be exercised within legal limits\u201d). We conclude, therefore, that the department\u2019s authority, pursuant to \u00a7 16-247f (a) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>its concomitant authority pursuant to \u00a7 16-247a, encompasses the power to set limits on the maximum markup an incumbent carrier may charge for services when that carrier has charged excessive rates for services contrary to the public interest.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court properly determined that the department did not exceed its statutory authority by ordering the plaintiff to file a tariff subject to the department\u2019s approval that met specific criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">We note that, in the present case, the plaintiff has not claimed that the department\u2019s findings and conclusions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>pursuant to its authority to regulate to prevent unreasonable discrimination, foster competition and protect the public interest, were unsupported by substantial evidence or were an abuse of the department\u2019s discretion. We therefore do not address this issue. We feel compelled, however, after our review of the department\u2019s decision in this case and of prior decisions offered by the department in support of this appeal, to caution the department that, in our view, it has failed to apply the necessary precision in its decisions. For example, the department determined in the present case that the plaintiffs enhanced services are not \u201ccritical\u201d or \u201cessential\u201d services. The relevant determination, pursuant to \u00a7 16-247b (b), however, is whether the services are \u201cnecessary.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Moreover, the department\u2019s findings of fact did not include a finding that the plaintiff had, in fact, unreasonably discriminated or a finding that the public interest or competition had been impaired by the plaintiffs actions, thus warranting the department\u2019s intervention.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Accordingly, we caution the department that, in future proceedings, it should set forth expressly the statutory provision upon which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>it relies to exercise jurisdiction and that it should articulate specific findings of fact and conclusions of law consistent with the statutory requirements in support of its exercise of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Finally, we address the issue of whether the trial court properly concluded that the department had jurisdiction over the competing carriers\u2019 claims under federal law, pursuant to 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 251 (c) (3) and 252 (d), and, accordingly, did not exceed its authority when it ordered the plaintiff to file a tariff that satisfied specific rate setting criteria. The trial court had noted that \u00a7 251 (c) (3) requires incumbent carriers to provide \u201cnondiscriminatory access to network elements on an unbundled basis ... on rates, terms, and conditions that are just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory in accordance with the terms and conditions of the agreement and the requirements of this section and section 252 of this title.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 251 (c) (3) (Sup. 1999). The court further had noted that \u00a7 252 mandates that rate determinations by state commissioners for network elements for purposes of \u00a7 251 (c) (3) must be nondiscriminatory. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 252 (d) (1) (A) (ii) (Sup. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The plaintiff claims that the enhanced services are not subject to regulation under federal law because its obligations under \u00a7 251 (c) (3) are triggered only when the network elements to which unbundled access is sought satisfies the \u201cnecessary and impair\u201d standard under \u00a7 251 (d) (2). Because the department determined that the plaintiffs enhanced services were not necessary services,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> the plaintiff contends that \u00a7\u00a7 251 (c) (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>and 252 (d) (1) are inapplicable and, therefore, cannot provide a basis for the department\u2019s jurisdiction. The plaintiffs claim in this regard is similar to the one it proffered regarding state law\u2014that the department may-set rates only when necessary services are at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Conversely, the department claims that 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 251 (d) applies only insofar as to dictate the circumstances under which an incumbent carrier may be required to provide unbundled access to network elements. It does not limit the incumbent carrier\u2019s duty under \u00a7 251 (c) to provide reasonable and nondiscriminatory rates, in the department\u2019s view, when, as in the present case, the incumbent voluntarily has unbundled the network elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Both parties have articulated plausible inteipretations of \u00a7 251 (c) (3). <em>See AT&amp;T Corp. </em>v. <em>Iowa Utilities Board, </em>supra, 525 U.S. 397 (1996 federal act is \u201cin many important respects a model of ambiguity or indeed even self-contradiction\u201d). In light of our conclusion that the department properly exercised its jurisdiction and authority under state law, however, we need not resolve this question. <em>Roth </em>v. <em>Weston, </em>259 Conn. 202, 205 n.2, 789 A. 2d 431 (2002) (court does not decide issues unnecessary to resolution of case); <em>Bortner </em>v. <em>Woodbridge, </em>250 Conn. 241, 251 n.13, 736 A.2d 104 (1999) (same). We nevertheless consider whether the department\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction and authority pursuant to state law is consistent with the federal scheme. We address this issue because the state scheme expressly references the 1996 federal act; see footnotes 3 and 13 of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>opinion; thereby indicating the legislature\u2019s intention to reconcile the schemes. Moreover, this discussion provides further evidence in support of our analysis in part II of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">As we have noted previously, the 1996 federal act created a two tier scheme of regulation, with power shared between the FCC and the state commissioners. The 1996 federal act reflects a \u201cgeneral policy ... of recognizing state authority over certain aspects of local telecommunications\u2014in areas over which the states held virtually exclusive sway prior to the enactment of the [1996 federal act]\u2014while ensuring compliance with federal law. [It] exemplifies a cooperative federalism system, in which state commissions can exercise their expertise about the needs of the local market and local consumers, but are guided by the provisions of the [1996 federal act] and by the concomitant FCC regulations . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Puerto Rico Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Telecommunications Regulatory Board of Puerto Rico, </em>supra, 189 F.3d 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">\u201cCongress intended to divide responsibility, and unless it expressly provided for federal responsibility, it left pre-1996 [federal act] assignments of responsibility in place, such as by retaining [47 U.S.C.] \u00a7\u00a7 152 and 410. In [47 U.S.C.] \u00a7 601 (c) (1) of the 1996 [federal act], Congress makes this point explicit: \u2018This Act and the amendments made by [it] shall not be construed to modify, impair, or supersede Federal, State, or local law unless expressly so provided in such Act or amendments.\u2019 Pub.

No. 104-104, 110 Stat. 56, 143 (1996) (codified at 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 152 note) . . . .\u201d <em>Bell Atlantic Maryland, Inc. </em>v. <em>MCI Worldcom, Inc., </em>240 F.3d 279, 300-301 (4th Cir. 2001); see also 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 253 (b) (Sup. 1999) (\u201c[n]othing in this section shall affect the ability of a State to impose, on a competitively neutral basis and consistent with section 254 of this title, requirements necessary to . . . ensure the continued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>quality of telecommunications services, and safeguard the rights of consumers\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">The state commissioners\u2019 authority to order incumbent carriers to provide <em>access </em>to network elements on an unbundled basis under \u00a7 251 (c) (3) is expressly limited by \u00a7 251 (d) (3). They cannot order incumbents to provide unbundled access to unnecessary services; they only may order incumbent carriers to provide unbundled access if the competing carrier\u2019s request for access satisfies the necessary and impair standard. See also 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.317 (b) (4). There is no express limitation in \u00a7 251, however, on an incumbent carrier\u2019s duty to provide reasonable and nondiscriminatory rates. Even if we assume that \u00a7 251 cannot be construed to <em>authorize </em>the department to ensure reasonable and nondiscriminatory rates for network elements that are not necessary, there clearly is no language that expressly <em>prohibits </em>any action with respect to those elements. Indeed, under the plaintiffs view, \u00a7 251 (c) simply does not apply to services that are not necessary. Accordingly, we find nothing in the express language of the 1996 federal act that would preclude the department from regulating under state law in the present case to protect the public\u2019s interest in affordable, high quality telecommunications service.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Moreover, the department\u2019s exercise of its authority under state law is consistent with the goal of the 1996 federal act to promote competition. See H.R. Rep. No. 104-204, p. 47 (1995), reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 10, 11. Although we acknowledge that an additional goal of the 1996 federal act was to reduce regulation, we note that regulation, under that act, was associated with the protective measures taken by the states to perpetuate the incumbent carriers\u2019 monopoly over telephone service. See H.R. Rep. No. 104-204, p. 47 (1995), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. 10, 13.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that the department\u2019s jurisdiction over the plaintiffs enhanced services pursuant to state law and its concomitant exercise of authority was not inconsistent with federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b25-7\"> The plaintiff appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment to the Appellate Court. We then transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b25-8\"> We note that, although the plaintiff has framed the issues in its brief as jurisdictional, throughout its discussion of those issues it treats the claims as raising questions of authority, specifically, whether the department exceeded its statutory authority by setting rates. As we explained in <em>Amodio </em>v. <em>Amodio, </em>247 Conn. 724, 727-28, 724 A.2d 1084 (1999), the issue of subject matter jurisdiction is distinct from the authority to act under a particular statute. \u201cSubject matter jurisdiction involves the authority of a court to adjudicate the type of controversy presented by the action before it. . . . A court does not truly lack subject matter jurisdiction if it has competence to entertain the action before it. . . . Although related, the court\u2019s authority to act pursuant to a statute is different from its subject matter jurisdiction. The power of the court to hear and determine, which is implicit in jurisdiction, is not to be confused with the way in which that power must be exercised in order to comply with the terms of the statute.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. Therefore, in an effort to ensure that we have adjudicated adequately the plaintiffs claims, we have reframed the issues into distinct claims addressing the department\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the claims before it as well as its authority to act pursuant to the relevant statutes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b26-4\"> General Statutes \u00a7 16-247b provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) On petition or its own motion, the department shall initiate a proceeding to unbundle a telephone company\u2019s network, services and functions that are used to provide telecommunications services and which the department determines, after notice and hearing, are in the public interest, are consistent with federal law and are technically feasible of being tariffed and offered separately or in combinations.

So whether we unbundle them or not, affects only one thing\u2014it affects whether there was a need for an unbundling proceeding under the first sentence of \u00a7 16-2471) (a). Obviously, there was no need for such a proceeding; therefore, there was no such proceeding.

Indeed, we believe (hat result would have been likely in light of the fact that the plaintiff was ordered to charge its own retail customers the same rates it charged the competing carriers.

Although we address in part in of this opinion the issue of whether the department\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction and authority under state law is consistent with the federal scheme, we need not determine at this time whether the standards are indeed different because the department\u2019s jurisdiction was not premised on \u00a7 16-247b (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b59-12\"> The House Report provided: \u201cIn providing local phone service, telephone companies have historically been protected from competition by State and local government barriers to entry.
