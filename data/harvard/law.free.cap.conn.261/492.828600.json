McCahill, on bail pending his appeal from the trial court\u2019s judgment of conviction of burglary in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101 (a) (2),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (1).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>order of release on bail was based on its determination that P.A. 00-200, \u00a7 5, violated the separation of powers provision. We agree with the trial court. In addition, for the reasons that follow, we need not address the claim of the plaintiff in error, Jennifer F., the victim of the burglary and sexual assault, and the victim advocate, in the writ of error to this court, that she has standing as a victim to pursue an appellate remedy for a claimed violation of a right contained in article first, \u00a7 8 (b), of the Connecticut constitution, as amended by articles seventeen and twenty-nine of the amendments,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which is more commonly known as the victim\u2019s rights amendment, because we conclude that the writ of error is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the petition for review and writ of error. On May 23, 2001, the defendant was found guilty, following a jury trial, of burglary in the first degree and sexual assault in the first degree for an incident that had occurred in January, 1999. Following the trial court\u2019s acceptance of the jury verdict, the state requested that the defendant be held without bail pending sentencing, in accordance with P.A. 00-200, \u00a7 5. After hearing argument from the parties on this issue, the trial court, <em>Hon. Bernard D. Gaffney, </em>judge trial referee, declined to take the defendant into custody and, instead, set bond at $250,000. The defendant thereafter posted bond and was released.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">The trial court then referred the matter to the adult probation department for the preparation of a presentence investigation and report. On August 9, 2001, the trial court sentenced the defendant to twelve years imprisonment, execution suspended after six years, with six years special parole. After imposition of the sentence, the defendant requested that he be released on bail during the pendency of his appeal. The state objected on the ground that the defendant had been convicted of a crime involving the use of physical force against another person and, therefore, P.A. 00-200, \u00a7 5, prohibited the defendant\u2019s release on bail. After hearing argument from the parties and the state victim advocate<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> on this issue, the trial court released the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>on $250,000 bond, on the basis of its conclusion that P.A. 00-200, \u00a7 5, violated the separation of powers provision. The trial court also ordered the defendant to avoid any contact with the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The day after imposition of the defendant\u2019s sentence and his release on bond, the state, pursuant to \u00a7 54-63g, filed this petition for review in the Appellate Court challenging the trial court\u2019s order releasing the defendant on bail following the imposition of his sentence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On August 23, 2001, the victim filed a writ of error in this court. The victim advocate initially acted as counsel for the victim in prosecution of the writ.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In the writ, the victim also challenged the trial court\u2019s decision to release the defendant and asserted that her constitutional right under the victim\u2019s rights amendment to be \u201creasonably protected from the accused\u201d was violated by the defendant\u2019s release. We transferred the state\u2019s petition for bail review to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and Practice Book \u00a7 65-3,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and we ordered that it be consolidated with the writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">THE VICTIM\u2019S WRIT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">We first address the victim\u2019s writ of error to this court. For the reasons that follow, we dismiss the victim\u2019s writ of error as moot, and do not resolve whether the victim\u2019s rights amendment affords either the victim or the victim advocate the right to bring a writ of error for a purported violation of a right contained in the amendment. We conclude that, because of the procedural circumstances of these cases, a resolution of that question is not necessary to the ultimate issue addressed by all parties in both cases before this court, namely, whether P.A. 00-200, \u00a7 5, violates the separation of powers provision of our state constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">As previously noted, the two cases consolidated for argument before this court were the petition for review of the defendant\u2019s release on bail brought by the state and the writ of error brought by the victim. It is well established law that appellate rights are established by statute. \u201cThe right of appeal is purely statutory. It is accorded only if the conditions fixed by statute and the rules of court for taking and prosecuting the appeals are met. . . . <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>135 Conn. 262, 266, 63 A.2d 589, aff'd, 337 U.S. 901, 69 S. Ct. 1046, 93 L. Ed. 1715 (1948). . . . [0]ur jurisdiction over appeals, both criminal and civil, is prescribed by statute . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Curdo, </em>191 Conn. 27, 30, 463 A.2d 566 (1983). The ability to bring an appeal, in the civil or criminal context, depends upon the legislative authorization as contained in the General Statutes. The writ of error, however, is a concept \u201cdeeply rooted in our common law. <em>State </em>v. <em>Assuntino, </em>173 Conn. 104, 109-10, 376 A.2d 1091 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Caplan, </em>85 Conn. 618, 622, 84 A. 280 (1912) . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number><em>Banks </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>241 Conn. 569, 584, 698 A.2d 268 (1997). In other words, although the legislature has codified the right to bring a writ of error in General Statutes \u00a7 52-272,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> that right exists independent of its statutory authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The right to bring a petition for review of a bail decision, however, was created solely through the statutory enactment of \u00a7 54-63g. There is no independent, common-law basis for the petition. It is beyond cavil that, pursuant to \u00a7 54-63g, the victim is precluded from participating as a party in the state\u2019s petition for review. Section 54-63g makes review of a release order available to two parties: the state and the defendant. Although the victim has certain constitutional rights; see Conn. Const., amend. XXIX; which may have to be respected during the pendency of any appellate proceeding, the language of \u00a7 54-63g makes unequivocal the preclusion of a victim as a party in a petition for review. A victim seeking appellate vindication of these rights, therefore, must proceed, if at all, by writ of error, as the victim does here.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">In the writ of error, the victim claims that her constitutional right to reasonable protection from the accused was violated by the trial court\u2019s release of the defendant. A preliminary question to that substantive issue, however, is whether the victim may seek appellate relief for a claimed violation of a right contained in the victim\u2019s rights amendment. This is, in part, a question of whether the victim has standing to pursue this writ of error. Ultimately, however, she must argue, as she does, that the trial court improperly concluded that P.A. 00-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>200, \u00a7 5, was unconstitutional. This ultimate issue is the very same issue that is before this court in the petition for review brought by the state. In both the writ of error and in the petition for review, therefore, our ultimate determination is whether the trial court correctly concluded that P.A. 00-200, \u00a7 5, violated the separation of powers provision of the Connecticut constitution. Because both the writ of error and the petition for review raise the very same ultimate question, we conclude that the issue of standing under the writ of error is not necessary to our determination of the constitutionality of P.A. 00-200, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Put another way, the victim seeks by way of the writ of error, the ability to bring before this court the issue of whether the trial court\u2019s determination that P.A. 00-200, \u00a7 5, was unconstitutional\u2014and the consequent release of the defendant\u2014violated her constitutional right to be reasonably protected. The preliminary question, before we can reach the merits of her writ, is whether she has standing to bring the writ. That question\u2014the question of her standing\u2014is not one that we must answer because we resolve the issue of the constitutionality of P.A. 00-200, \u00a7 5, in the state\u2019s petition for review. The writ of error, therefore, is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">We do not take lightly our responsibility to act as the final arbiter in resolving issues relating to our constitution. See <em>Marbury </em>v. <em>Madison, </em>5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177, 2 L. Ed. 60 (1803); <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Allen, 13 </em>Conn. 119, 132 (1839). We also, however, do not engage in addressing constitutional questions unless their resolution is unavoidable. \u201cOrdinarily, [c]onstitutionai issues are not considered unless absolutely necessary to the decision of a case .... <em>State </em>v. <em>Cofield, </em>220 Conn. 38, 49-50, 595 A.2d 1349 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Onofrio, </em>179 Conn. 23, 37-38, 425 A.2d 560 (1979); <em>State </em>v. <em>DellaCamera, </em>166 Conn. 557, 560-61, 353 A.2d 750 (1974); <em>see Ashwander </em>v. <em>Tennessee Valley Authority, </em>297 U.S. 288, 346-47, 56 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>S. Ct. 466, 80 L. Ed. 688 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>230 Conn. 372, 382, 645 A.2d 529 (1994); <em>Moore </em>v. <em>McNamara, </em>201 Conn. 16, 20, 513 A.2d 660 (1986) (\u201c[t]his court has a basic judicial duty to avoid deciding a constitutional issue if a nonconstitutional ground exists that will dispose of the case\u201d); see also 16 Am. Jur. 2d, Constitutional Law \u00a7 117 (1998). Because we may resolve the issue of whether P.A. 00-200, \u00a7 5, violates the separation of powers provision without also addressing the constitutional question of whether the victim\u2019s rights amendment permits her appellate review, we leave the latter issue for another day and proceed with an examination of the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">THE STATE\u2019S PETITION FOR REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">We turn then, to the state\u2019s petition for review pursuant to \u00a7 54-63g, and an examination of the constitutionality of P.A. 00-200, \u00a7 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Before reaching the merits of this issue, we consider the defendant\u2019s preliminary argument that this court lacks jurisdiction over the state\u2019s petition for review because the defendant\u2019s substantive appeal from the judgment of his conviction is presently before the Appellate Court and not this court. We disagree with the defendant and conclude that our jurisdiction over the petition for review is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">As noted, \u00a7 54-63g authorizes a petition for review of a bail order decision to be filed in the Appellate Court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>We have jurisdiction over the state\u2019s petition for review because we have transferred it to this court pursuant to \u00a7 51-199 (c), which provides that the \u201cSupreme Court may transfer to itself a cause in the Appellate Court. ...\u201d The petition for review, authorized by \u00a7 54-63g, is not an appeal by which we appropriately could exercise jurisdiction via the certification authority conferred upon us by General Statutes \u00a7 51-197\u00cd.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ayala, </em>222 Conn. 331, 340-41, 610 A.2d 1162 (1992). Section 51-199 (c) provides, however, that we may transfer a \u201ccause\u201d in the Appellate Court. In other words, our transfer authority by way of \u00a7 51-199 (c) is not limited to a formal appeal, but encompasses causes. The petition for review, once filed in the Appellate Court, is a cause that we appropriately may transfer to this court. Our jurisdiction is proper and, therefore, we proceed with an examination of the merits of the state\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">As noted, the trial court released the defendant on a $250,000 bond for the period of time between its acceptance of the guilty verdict and imposition of sentence, and again permitted the defendant to be free on bond after sentencing and during the pendency of his appeal of the conviction. In its memorandum of articulation, the trial court indicated that it had declined to follow the mandate of P.A. 00-200, \u00a7 5, because it had concluded that the statute represented an \u201c[unconstitutional intrusion] upon the powers of the judicial magistr[ac]y.\u201d In other words, according to the trial court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>P.A. 00-200, \u00a7 5, violates the separation of powers mandate, as codified in article second of the state constitution, as amended by article eighteen of the amendments. We agree and hold that P.A. 00-200, \u00a7 5, represents an unconstitutional intrusion upon the judicial magistracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Our responsibility to measure the constitutional nature of laws duly enacted by our legislature is without question. In the federal context, the United States Supreme Court has stated: \u201cDeciding whether a matter has in any measure been committed by the Constitution to another branch of government, or whether the action of that branch exceeds whatever authority has been committed, is itself a delicate exercise in constitutional interpretation, and is a responsibility of this Court as ultimate interpreter of the Constitution.\u201d <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Carr, </em>369 U.S. 186, 211, 82 S. Ct. 691, 7 L. Ed. 2d 663 (1962). We also serve as the body through which our state laws will be measured against the Connecticut constitution. See <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>supra, 13 Conn. 132 (\u201c[i]f the legislature shall attempt to encroach upon constitutional restrictions, it will become the solemn duty of the court to declare such an attempt illegal and the act void\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">We begin with the well established proposition that \u201c[bjecause a validly enacted statute carries with it a strong presumption of constitutionality, those who challenge its constitutionality must sustain the heavy burden of proving its unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt. ... In construing a statute, moreover, we will search for an effective and constitutional construction that reasonably accords with the legislature\u2019s underlying intent.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Bartholomew </em>v. <em>Schweizer, </em>217 Conn. 671, 675-76, 587 A.2d 1014 (1991). We also note that, \u201c[w]hen a question of constitutionality is raised, courts must approach it with caution, examine it with care, and sustain the legislation unless its invalidity is clear.\u201d <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Newtown, </em>147 Conn. 374, 390, 161 A.2d 770 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>\u201c[T]he primary puipose of [the separation or powers] doctrine is to prevent commingling of different powers of government in the same hands. . . . The constitution achieves this purpose by prescribing limitations and duties for each branch that are essential to each branch\u2019s independence and performance of assigned powers. ... It is axiomatic that no branch of government organized under a constitution may exercise any power that is not explicitly bestowed by that constitution or that is not essential to the exercise thereof. . . . [Thus] [t]he separation of powers doctrine serves a dual function: it limits the exercise of power within each branch, yet ensures the independent exercise of that power.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Massameno </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>234 Conn. 539, 551-52, 663 A.2d 317 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">\u201cIn the context of challenges to statutes whose constitutional infirmity is claimed to flow from impermissible intrusion upon the judicial power, we have refused to find constitutional impropriety in a statute simply because it affects the judicial function .... A statute violates the constitutional mandate for a separate judicial magistracy only if it represents an effort by the legislature to exercise a power which lies exclusively under the control of the courts ... or if it establishes a significant interference with the orderly conduct of the Superior Court\u2019s judicial functions.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bartholomew </em>v. <em>Schweizer, </em>supra, 217 Conn. 676. \u201cIn accordance with these principles, a two part inquiry has emerged to evaluate the constitutionality of a statute that is alleged to violate separation of powers principles by impermissibly infringing on the judicial authority. ... A statute will be held unconstitutional on those grounds if: (1) it governs subject matter that not only falls within the judicial power, but also lies exclusively within judicial control; or (2) it significantly interferes with the orderly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>functioning of the Superior Court\u2019s judicial role.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Angel C., </em>245 Conn. 93, 131, 715 A.2d 652 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">As noted, P.A. 00-200, \u00a7 5, provides in relevant part: \u201cA person who has been convicted of any offense, except . . . [one] involving the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force against another person, and is either awaiting sentence or has given oral or written notice of such person\u2019s intention to appeal or file a petition for certification or a writ of certiorari may be released pending final disposition of the case . . . .\u201d The effect of the amendment is to restrict a trial court from releasing any individual who has been convicted of a crime involving physical force that is actual, attempted or threatened. The prohibition on release applies following conviction, and even those defendants who have not yet been sentenced are subject to the release restriction. Thus, the amendment serves to mandate immediate incarceration upon the rendition of a guilty verdict in a case in which the defendant has been charged with a crime involving physical force.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">We begin our examination of the constitutionality of P.A. 00-200, \u00a7 5, with a brief account of the transformation of the statutory language into its present form. \u201cIn order to put the defendant\u2019s constitutional claims into perspective, we must review the history of the state legislation [that is implicated by those claims].\u201d <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>222 Conn. 799, 806, 611 A.2d 400 (1992), overruled in part, <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>228 Conn. 630, 636 n.4, 637 A.2d 1111 (1994). In 1967, when \u00a7 54-63f was first enacted, the statute provided in relevant part: \u201cA person who has been convicted of <em>any offense </em>and is either awaiting sentence or has given oral or written notice of his intention to appeal or file a petition for certification or a writ of certiorari <em>may be released </em>pending final disposition of the case, unless the court finds custody to be necessary to provide reasonable assurance of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>appearance in court, upon the first of the following conditions of release found sufficient by the court to provide such assurance . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 1968) \u00a7 54-63f. In 1967, therefore, the statute expressly affirmed the trial court\u2019s discretion to grant postconviction bail to a defendant who had been convicted of any offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The public act that created \u00a7 54-63f is entitled, \u201cAn Act Concerning Bail Procedures for Arrested Persons.\u201d Public Acts 1967, No. 549, \u00a7 14. As a general matter, that act amounted to the legislature\u2019s attempt to develop new procedures for the provision of bail in Connecticut. The legislative history concerning Public Acts 1967, No. 549, \u00a7 14, reveals that the act was intended, generally, to <em>enhance </em>a defendant\u2019s right to bail. In speaking of that act, Representative John A. Carrozzella stated: \u201cThe purpose of the bill is to revise bail procedures to assure the prompt release of arrested persons pending their appearance in court.\u201d 12 H.R. Proc., Pt. 9, 1967 Sess., p. 3870. Representative Robert D. King stated: \u201cIt has been very difficult to assure any arrested person that he would be released on bail. ... I think [the bill] brings the bail provisions out of the dark ages into the [twentieth] century.\u201d Id., pp. 3872-73. On the basis of the legislative history of Public Acts 1967, No. 549, \u00a7 14, and the plain language of \u00a7 54-63f, we reasonably can conclude that, in 1967, the legislature intended \u00a7 54-63f to serve as a directive that: (1) a defendant who had been convicted of any offense would be eligible for postconviction bail; and (2) discretion rested with the trial court to make an appropriate determination as to when such bail should be granted. \u201c[The defendant] may be released . . . <em>unless the court </em>finds custody to be necessary to provide reasonable assurance of his appearance in court, upon the first of the following conditions of release found sufficient <em>by the court </em>to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>provide such assurance . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes (Rev. to 1968) \u00a7 54-63f.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">By the late 1990s, however, the legislature began to limit the provision of postconviction release.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In 1998, the legislature constricted the expansive group of all convicted criminals for whom release was available, to only those criminals who had not been convicted of murder, capital felony, felony murder or arson murder. See Public Acts 1998, No. 98-51 (P.A. 98-51). In other words, P.A. 98-51 served to limit the discretion of the trial court to release on bail a defendant who had been convicted of any of the aforementioned serious crimes. Finally, in 2000, the legislature acted to limit further the trial court\u2019s discretion when it prohibited the release of any person convicted of a crime involving the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force against another person. See P.A. 00-200, \u00a7 5. Although \u00a7 54-63f, as presently codified, contains the language placing discretion in the trial court regarding its determination as to whether to release a convicted defendant, the trial court\u2019s discretion, no doubt, has been curtailed, as the class of individuals over whom the trial court may exercise its discretion has been decreased from all defendants to only those defendants who have not been convicted of murder, capital felony, felony murder or arson murder, or crimes involving physical force against another person.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">In sum, by P.A. 98-51 and P.A. 00-200, \u00a7 5, the legislature has transformed the 1967 statute that was enacted to make postconviction bail available to <em>all </em>defendants, to a statute that eliminates the trial court\u2019s discretion to grant such bail to various classes of convicted offenders. Whether in passing P.A. 00-200, \u00a7 5, the legislature acted properly, that is, without violating the separation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>of powers provision, is the subject of this petition and, therefore, we turn to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">As noted, the test for determining whether a statute violates the separation of powers provision is expressed in the alternative. A legislative enactment violates the separation of powers provision if it <em>either </em>governs subject matter that falls within the exclusive control of the judiciary, <em>or </em>if the statute creates a significant interference with the orderly functioning of the Superior Court\u2019s judicial role. <em>State </em>v. <em>Angel C., </em>supra, 245 Conn. 131. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that P.A. 00-200, \u00a7 5, is unconstitutional because it presents a significant interference with the orderly functioning of the Superior Court\u2019s judicial role.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">An initial consideration is whether the constitutionality of P.A. 00-200, \u00a7 5, should be determined solely on the facts of this case, or by examining the statute in light of other cases that conceivably could fall within the grasp of the statute\u2019s reach. We conclude that the latter approach is most appropriate in this circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">As noted, it is our conclusion that P.A. 00-200, \u00a7 5, violates the separation of powers provision because it significantly interferes with the orderly functioning of the Superior Court\u2019s judicial role. The nature of this conclusion relies on the premise that P.A. 00-200, \u00a7 5, will create an interference with the trial court\u2019s disposition of cases <em>other than just this case. </em>In other words, it would be a remarkable conclusion to state that a statute creates a significant interference because, upon one set of facts, the orderly functioning of the trial court\u2019s judicial role has been upset. More correctly, we consider the separation of powers challenge to have merit because of the Superior Court\u2019s regular role in supervising the prosecution of individuals charged with crimes involving the use of physical force against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>another person. It is these many cases together, along with the elimination of the Superior Court\u2019s discretion to grant bail in appropriate circumstances in that large class of cases, that creates the significant interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">There can be no doubt that the sole control over the provision of postconviction bail rested, until 1967, with the Superior Court. The legislature\u2019s participation in this area began with the enactment of \u00a7 54-63f in 1967, as we have been unable to discover any earlier statutes addressing the provision of postconviction bail. As noted, the 1967 enactment respected the trial court\u2019s ability to make an appropriate determination as to whether postconviction bail should be granted. It is manifest, however, that the judicial branch has long had the power to submit a defendant to bail following conviction. This power has existed in the judicial branch since the earliest days of Connecticut\u2019s statehood and even before. In an early Superior Court case, the court stated: \u201cAfter verdict of the jury finding the prisoner guilty and before judgment rendered, [the attorney] moved that the prisoner might be admitted to bail to appear and abide the judgment of Court\u2014 which was admitted. . . . There had been some doubts with the Court formerly whether the Court had right to bail after conviction and before judgment\u2014but it was now settled\u2014and the Court admitted bail to be taken.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Beach, </em>2 Kirby (Conn. Sup.) 20, 21 (1786-87).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">As we previously have noted, one of the greatest achievements of the 1818 constitution was the separation of the powers of government into three departments. See Adams v. <em>Rubinow, </em>157 Conn. 150, 153, 251 A.2d 49 (1968). While the 1818 constitution for the first time provided for this separation of powers, it did not disturb the functions then in existence in the Superior Court. \u201cThe \u2018Superiour Court\u2019 had been established in May, 1711, as a trial court of general jurisdiction and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>was in existence when our constitution was adopted in 1818. [5 Col. Rec. 238 (1712); Statutes (1808 Rev.) p. 205]. There can be no doubt that it was the intent of the [1818] constitution that this court should continue, with the essential characteristics it had previously possessed. See [Statutes (1821 Rev.) p. 138].\u201d <em>Walkinshaw </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>130 Conn. 122, 127, 32 A.2d 547 (1943); see also <em>Carpenter </em>v. <em>Meachum, </em>229 Conn. 193, 197-98, 640 A.2d 591 (1994); <em>Szarwak </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>167 Conn. 10, 34, 355 A.2d 49 (1974). In other words, when the constitution was adopted in 1818, the Superior Court maintained the power to exercise its discretion to grant postconviction bail in appropriate circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">In 1899, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Vaughan, </em>71 Conn. 457, 42 A. 640 (1899), this court discussed in general the Superior Court\u2019s power to grant postconviction bail. \u201cThe power to admit to bail after conviction is not a statutory but a common-law power . . . bail is then a matter of <em>absolute discretion, </em>to be exercised by the court, however, with great caution, and rarely to be allowed when the crime is serious. But the <em>power </em>to admit to bail is inherent in the court so long as the prisoner is in its custody; that is, until he is taken in execution.\u201d (Emphasis altered.) Id., 460-61. With regards to the English Court, of which our Superior Court possessed the same common-law powers, this court stated: \u201cThe Court of King\u2019s Bench, by the plenitude of its power, may admit to bail in all cases on consideration of the nature and circumstances of the case. . . . <em>This power continues after conviction and after judgment, </em>so long as the prisoner is in the custody of the court, but in most cases ceases when he is taken in execution .... Such common-law powers of the Court of King\u2019s Bench belong to the Superior Court. In most of our States bail is largely controlled by statute. But when the courts exercise the common-law power, they may admit to bail, after conviction and after sentence, and until the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>accused is in execution.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis added.) Id., 461. We have never departed from the principles announced in <em>Vaughan. </em>That case, therefore, presents compelling evidence of the inherent, common-law powers possessed by the Superior Court to exercise its discretion to grant postconviction bail \u201cin all cases . . . .\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Although it is evident, therefore, that the judicial power in the area of postconviction bail is one anciently derived, and that the legislative influence is more recent, P.A. 00-200, \u00a7 5, will still pass constitutional muster if it does not create a significant interference with the orderly functioning of the Superior Court\u2019s judicial role. We conclude that the statute, in the variety of circumstances in which it must be applied, serves to create such an interference and is, therefore, unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The power to admit to bail exists not simply as an exercise of the judicial prerogative, but so that a defendant\u2019s right to bring an appeal will not result in a meaningless proceeding. \u201c[T]he <em>power </em>to admit to bail is inherent in the court so long as the prisoner is in its custody; that is, until he is taken in execution. . . . But it <em>necessarily follows </em>from the principle . . . that where, as in this State, a review of the judgment by a Court of Errors is a matter of right, there <em>must </em>be power in the courts to stay execution and, if the special circumstances of the case justify it, to admit to bail.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis altered; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Vaughan, </em>supra, 71 Conn. 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">In other words, as we previously have recognized, if the right to bail and stay of execution pending appeal did not exist, \u201cthe right of appeal would be destroyed or seriously hampered, [because] the period of the pendency and determination of the appeal by this court might be considerable . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>marks omitted.) <em>Carino </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>171 Conn. 366, 369, 370 A.2d 950 (1976); <em>Winnick </em>v. <em>Reilly, </em>100 Conn. 291, 298, 123 A. 440 (1924). The power to stay execution and admit to bail is necessary so that a defendant\u2019s right to review of the judgment will not become an exercise of form without substance. Because, under the statute, a convicted offender of a crime involving physical force must be incarcerated immediately, the likelihood exists that a defendant who has been convicted of a minor offense and who would be sentenced to a short term of imprisonment, would find his statutory right to appellate review of the judgment meaningless. If, by the time his appeal is adjudicated, he had completed his term of incarceration, then the practical effect of a successful appeal would be reduced to eliminating the collateral effects of the conviction, and the <em>direct </em>effect\u2014namely, the sentence of incarceration\u2014 would be irremediable. Put another way, the statute is offensive to the orderly functioning of the Superior Court because it destroys, in a potentially very broad class of cases, the trial court\u2019s discretion to grant bail, during the pendency of an appeal. In the absence of such a power, a defendant who has been convicted of a minor offense and who will receive only a short term of imprisonment, will likely serve most, and probably all, of his sentence <em>before </em>his appeal would be decided; and, if his appeal were to be successful, that success would, therefore, be empty.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">The legislative history of P.A. 00-200, \u00a7 5, reveals that at least one legislator accurately envisioned the dangers created by the statute. During debate on the bill, Representative Robert Fan- proposed an amendment that would have deleted the language referring to the prohibition on release for physical offenses. His proposed amendment failed. During the debate, however, Representative Fair stated: \u201cBut the problem with this [bill] is that it goes far, it goes much too far. People who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>commit violent crimes should be treated seriously but you have to understand that not everybody who commits a violent crime is automatically going to be sentenced to jail.\u201d 43 H.R. Proc., Pt. 13, 2000 Sess., pp. 4327-28. Later, Representative Farr stated: \u201cIf the sentence was a relatively short sentence, ten days, [thirty] days, [sixty] days, the individual decides to appeal that conviction, today as I understand it they post bond, they give a notice of appeal, they\u2019ve posted the bond. As I understand this language, they can\u2019t any longer post bail, they can\u2019t post bail. They\u2019re not entitled to bail. They will then go do their sixty days . . . while their appeal is pending. The court overturns the appeal, too bad. They\u2019ve done the sentence. And if the appeal takes two years to complete, anybody who gets sentenced up to two years, as I read this, does the sentence without regard to whether they\u2019ve appealed it or not. . . . [With ]this provision, we\u2019re essentially saying, you get convicted, you start doing your jail time so that you can appeal. But by the time you get your appellate [case], unless you have successfully completed your appeal, quicker than the term you\u2019ve been sentenced to, it\u2019s going to be moot. You\u2019re going to do the time anyway. That\u2019s a major change in the law. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an appropriate one . . . .\u201d Id., pp. 4347-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Public Act 00-200, \u00a7 5, further interferes with the Superior Court\u2019s control of the criminal proceeding during the interim period between rendering of the verdict and imposition of the sentence. In many cases, a trial court or jury will render a verdict against an accused, but the trial court will continue the case for sentencing on a later date.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Because the statute mandates incarceration upon conviction, for a person convicted of a crime involving physical force, a trial court will be forced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>to have a defendant taken into custody even in the circumstance when it is possible that the defendant will receive only a fine or a period of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">A review of our criminal statutes reveals numerous crimes that involve the use of force against another person, but which are labeled misdemeanors by our legislature.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> A misdemeanor is defined to be a crime for which the maximum term of imprisonment may be no more than one year. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-26 (a). Conviction for a misdemeanor may subject the defendant to a fine or a term of imprisonment, or a combination of both. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-28 (b);<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> see also General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-36, 53a-42.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Under the plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>language of P.A. 00-200, \u00a7 5, a defendant convicted of one of these crimes, who intends to appeal, may not be released on bail, even though the trial court may have yet to sentence the defendant to a term of imprisonment. In many cases, the trial court eventually could determine that the defendant should be subject to a fine or a period of probation, rather than a term of incarceration. Even so, during the interim period after conviction and before the imposition of the sentence, P.A. 00-200, \u00a7 5, requires that the defendant must be incarcerated. A more significant interference with the trial court\u2019s orderly functioning can hardly be imagined than to force it to subject a defendant to a period of incarceration when, later, it properly determines that the appropriate punishment under the circumstances is the imposition of a fine or probation.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Furthermore, \u201c[i]t is well established that under the common law a trial court has the discretionary power to modify or vacate a criminal judgment before the sentence has been executed. <em>State </em>v. <em>Walzer, </em>208 Conn. 420, 426-28, 545 A.2d 559 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>187 Conn. 109, 123, 445 A.2d 304 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pallotti, </em>119 Conn. 70, 74, 174 A. 74 (1934); <em>State </em>v. <em>Vaughan, </em>[supra, 71 Conn. 460-61].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Luzietti, </em>230 Conn. 427, 431-32, 646 A.2d 85 (1994). The Superior Court\u2019s power in this respect, as evidenced by Practice Book \u00a7 42-51 et seq., provides a defendant with the ability to request that the court render a judgment of acquittal despite a guilty verdict. The trial court, thus, may determine that the verdict is legally flawed, and either release the defendant or order a new trial. Under P.A. 00-200, \u00a7 5, however, the trial court has no discretion to permit the defendant to remain free on bond until it can consider those issues. The statute unduly interferes with the court\u2019s power to vacate a criminal conviction during the mterim period between return of the jury\u2019s verdict and sentencing, because it deprives the court of its power to prevent a defendant from being incarcerated while the court evaluates whether the conviction should in fact be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">By General Statutes \u00a7 53a-39a,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the legislature has provided that in some cases, the trial court may place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>a convicted defendant, who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment, into an alternate incarceration program in lieu of imprisonment, which may consist of placement in an intensive probation program, a community service program or a residential or nonresidential treatment program. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-39a (b). A trial court makes this discretionary determination after consulting a report prepared by the office of adult probation. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-39a (a). Again, P.A. 00-200, \u00a7 5, requires that an offender convicted of a crime involving physical force will be incarcerated while the office of adult probation prepares a report that might actually recommend that the defendant be enrolled in a community service program. A trial court must maintain the discretion to grant postconviction bail so that the criminal proceeding does not result in such irrational consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Menillo, </em>159 Conn. 264, 269, 268 A.2d 667 (1970), we stated in dicta: \u201c[Postconviction release] is not authorized by any constitutional requirement but only under \u00a7 54-63f of the General Statutes . . . and should be granted with great caution, as pointed out in cases such as <em>State </em>v. <em>Vaughan, </em>[supra, 71 Conn. 460].\u201d We do not read this language from <em>Menillo </em>to mean that <em>only </em>the legislature may act in the area of postcon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>viction release, for, as we already have noted, the power to act in this respect is a common-law power that has belonged to the Superior Court since our earliest days.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">In addition, we do not disagree with the assertion that the legislature may act in the area of postconviction release without violating the separation of powers provision. In fact, even though this petition does not present this question, we discern no interference with the Superior Court\u2019s role when the legislature enacted P.A. 98-51, to prevent release for those who have been convicted of some of the most serious crimes, because the term of incarceration normally levied for such crimes would likely exceed the period of time that it would take for resolution of the defendant\u2019s appeal. As such, there is no significant danger of a result in which a defendant would have served his entire term of incarceration only to later face an appellate proceeding that would be moot, but for its collateral consequences. See <em>Housing Authority v. Lamothe, </em>225 Conn. 757, 765, 627 A.2d 367 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>207 Conn. 152, 161, 540 A.2d 679 (1988). Additionally, a person convicted of one of these serious crimes would certainly be facing a term of incarceration, rather than merely a fine or probation. There is, therefore, no danger that such a defendant would be incarcerated between conviction and sentencing, only to learn, at sentencing, that the court had imposed only a fine or probation. Public Act 00-200, \u00a7 5, however, goes much farther than P.A. 98-51, and, in doing so, creates such a significant interference that it can only be construed to be unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">In <em>Bartholomew </em>v. <em>Schweizer, </em>supra, 217 Conn. 672, we concluded that General Statutes \u00a7 52-216b,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> \u201cwhich <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>permits closing argument to the trier of fact to include counsel\u2019s suggestion of an appropriate monetary recovery,\u201d did not violate the separation of powers provision. In analyzing whether the statute presented a significant interference with the trial court\u2019s responsibility to discipline and regulate the conduct of counsel, we relied on the fact that the statute did not interfere with the exercise of judicial discretion relating to control of attorney conduct during a trial. Id., 681. We concluded that \u201c[d]espite the enactment of \u00a7 52-216b, the trial court continues to have the power to monitor closing arguments in the service of justice.\u201d Id. We reasoned that \u201c[t]he statute does not purport to abrogate the power or the duty of the trial court to comment upon the propriety of counsel's argument ... to give curative instructions if necessary after the arguments of counsel to prevent prejudice ... or to declare a mistrial or to set aside a verdict if counsel\u2019s comments were so prejudicial that no curative instruction could preserve the parties\u2019 right to a fair trial.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Thus, whereas \u00a7 52-216b left intact a trial court\u2019s control of the proceedings, P.A. 00-200, \u00a7 5, instructs a trial court that, in a very wide class of cases, its discretion to grant postconviction bail has been eviscerated. Public Act 00-200, \u00a7 5, cannot survive, even under the reasoning employed in <em>Bartholomew, </em>as what is left of the trial court\u2019s discretion to grant postconviction bail is a mere remnant of the trial court\u2019s common-law power to grant such bail \u201cin all cases . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Vaughan, </em>supra, 71 Conn. 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The state and the amicus curiae attorney general contend that P.A. 00-200, \u00a7 5, does not interfere with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520A\">*520A</page-number>the orderly functioning of the Superior Court because courts maintain the ability to release on bail those individuals who have not been convicted of crimes involving physical force. This argument is suspect because it ignores the reality that, if we were to determine that P.A. 00-200, \u00a7 5, does not violate the separation of powers provision, then nothing in that doctrine would prevent the legislature from eliminating postconviction bail <em>in all cases.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The victim contends in her writ of error that P.A. 00-200, \u00a7 5, does not violate the separation of powers provision because it was enacted pursuant to an express constitutional grant of legislative authority under the victim\u2019s rights amendment. We note that the state did not make this argument in its brief and that we dismiss the victim\u2019s writ of error as moot. See part I of this opinion. Nevertheless, in order to further our \u201csearch for an effective and constitutional construction that reasonably accords with the legislature\u2019s underlying intent\u201d; <em>Bartholomew </em>v. <em>Schweizer, </em>supra, 217 Conn. 675-76; we address this contention.

In <em>Rollinson, </em>the defendant claimed that General Statutes \u00a7 54-46a,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> the statute pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520B\">*520B</page-number>viding for probable cause hearings pursuant to article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution, as amended by article seventeen of the amendments (probable cause hearing amendment),<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> violated the separation of powers provision. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rollinson, </em>supra, 650. The defendant based this claim on the fact that, at the time of his probable cause hearing, the rules of practice had not yet been amended to provide for rules governing such healings, although the statute set forth a detailed hearing procedure, creating an \u201cunconstitutional conflict\u201d between the statute and our rules of practice. Id. He had contended that this conflict violated the distinction between substance and procedure under the separation of powers doctrine, where, \u201c[a]s a general proposition, the General Assembly lacks the power to enact rules governing procedure, and the Superior Court lacks the power to promulgate rules governing substantive rights and remedies.\u201d Id., 650-51. We disagreed, and, following <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanabria, 192 </em>Conn. 671, 690, 474 A.2d 760 (1984), held: \u201c[T]he implementing procedures contained in \u00a7 54-46a were \u2018constituent parts\u2019 of the substantive rights created by amendment seventeen. <em>That constitutional amendment, by its own terms, conferred upon the legislature, and not upon the courts, the authority to fashion 'procedures prescribed by law\u2019 </em>for hearings to determine probable cause. In these circumstances, the validity of \u00a7 54-46a is not subject to constitutional attack as a violation of separation of powers.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rollinson, </em>supra, 651.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The present case differs from <em>Rollinson </em>because the nature and wording of the probable cause hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520C\">*520C</page-number>amendment at issue in that case is markedly different from that of the victim\u2019s rights amendment at issue in the present case.

Conn. Const., amend XVII. Thus, the probable cause hearing amendment in <em>Rollinson </em>could not stand independent of legislative enactments with any degree of efficacy. In discussing the probable cause hearing amendment in <em>Sanabria, </em>we noted that the \u201csubstantive right ... is intimately bound up with its procedural underpinnings\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanabria, </em>supra, 192 Conn. 690; and held that the amendment was not effective until the date the implementing legislation was enacted.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Id., 691. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Rollinson, </em>supra, 203 Conn. 651, we applied that analysis, concluding that the implementing procedural legislation was so inextricably intertwined with the amendment that it did not violate the separation of powers provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">By contrast, the legislative implementation of the substantive rights articulated in the victim\u2019s rights amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520D\">*520D</page-number>ment is not tied to any procedural requirements. The constitution sets forth the following substantive right at issue in the present case:<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, a victim . . . shall have the . . . right to be reasonably protected from the accused throughout the criminal justice process . . . .\u201d Conn. Const., amend. XXIX. The subsequent provision contained in that amendment conferring legislative implementation authority is set forth in general terms. It stands alone and provides: \u201cThe general assembly shall provide by law for the enforcement of this subsection. . . .\u201d Conn. Const., amend. XXIX.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">The constitutional authorization to the legislature under the victim\u2019s rights amendment lacks a specific connection to procedural implementation similar to that found in the probable cause hearing amendment. Such a generally phrased grant of authority to the legislature<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> cannot be interpreted as abrogating the overriding separation of powers doctrine. See <em>Massameno </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520E\">*520E</page-number><em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>supra, 234 Conn. 551-52 (\u201cWe previously have held that the primary purpose of this constitutional doctrine is to prevent commingling of different powers of government in the same hands. . . . The constitution achieves this purpose by prescribing limitations and duties for each branch that are essential to each branch\u2019s independence and performance of assigned powers. . . . This court has stated: \u2018It is axiomatic that no branch of government organized under a constitution may exercise any power that is not explicitly bestowed by that constitution or that is not essential to the exercise thereof.\u2019 \u201d [Citations omitted.]); <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Rubinow, </em>supra, 157 Conn. 154 (\u201cthe legislative powers granted the General Assembly are complete except as restricted by the state or federal constitution, just as the judicial powers granted the judicial department are complete except as restricted by the state or federal constitution\u201d); see also <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Cayetano, </em>528 U.S. 495, 522, 120 S. Ct. 1044, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1007 (2000) (holding that compliance with one-person, one-vote requirement under fourteenth amendment of federal constitution does not excuse compliance with fifteenth amendment of federal constitution); W. Horton, The Connecticut State Constitution: A Reference Guide (1993) p. 87 (\u201cthe legislature in Connecticut has the power to enact any legislation except as it is restricted by the federal Constitution or any provisions of the state Constitution\u201d); R.

The generality of the legislative authority provided for under the victim\u2019s rights amendment plainly distinguishes that provision\u2019s impact on the separation of powers clause from that of the probable cause hearing amendment. Accordingly, we reject the argument that P.A. 00-200, \u00a7 5, does not violate the separation of powers provision because its enactment was constitutionally authorized under the victim\u2019s rights amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">As Chief Justice Marshall observed long ago: \u201cThe powers of the legislature are defined, and limited; and that those limits may not be mistaken, or forgotten, the constitution is written.
