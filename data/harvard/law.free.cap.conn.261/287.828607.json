Cimochowski, was assistant superintendent for support programs/services in the Hartford public school system. On May 14, 1999, she was terminated from her position. After her termination, she filed a three count amended complaint in the District Court against the named defendant, the Hartford public schools; the city of Hartford; the state board of trustees for the Hartford public schools; the former interim superintendent of schools, Matthew Borrelli; and the current superintendent, Anthony Amato. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>complaint alleged, inter alia,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> *a violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (civil rights act), based on her claimed status as a teacher under the act. The plaintiff subsequently moved for partial summary judgment with respect to this claim, contending that, as a tenured teacher under the act, she had a property right in her employment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendants also filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming that the plaintiff was not a teacher under the act and that, therefore, the act does not afford the plaintiff a property right in her job. Accordingly, the defendants contend that her termination did not violate the civil rights act. The District Court certified to this court the stated question of law to this court, which this court accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">The District Court\u2019s certification order set forth the following relevant facts. \u201cThe plaintiff, Anna M. Cimochowski, Ph.D., went to work for the Hartford Public Schools in 1966.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> She was appointed Acting Assistant Superintendent for Support Programs/Services by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>State Board of Trustees for the Hartford Public Schools on October 14, 1997. On January 8, 1998, she was appointed Assistant Superintendent for Support Programs/Services by the State Board of Trustees<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> for the Hartford Public Schools.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">\u201cThe Hartford Superintendent of Schools is the chief executive officer of the Hartford Public Schools. The Assistant Superintendent is responsible for certain components of the system, and reports to the Superintendent of Schools. The Hartford Superintendent of Schools supervises the Assistant Superintendent. The posting for the position the plaintiff held stated that the occupant \u2018[ajssists the Superintendent in the exercise of line authority\u2019 and performs \u2018other duties and responsibilities as assigned by the Superintendent/Designee.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">\u201cThe contract in force between the plaintiff and the Hartford Public Schools required the plaintiff to \u2018perform duties as detailed in the job description under the direction of the Superintendent of Schools.\u2019<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">\u201cThe certification which the plaintiff held from the State Board of Education was the certification of \u2018Intermediate Administrator.\u2019 The certification which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>Hartford Superintendent of Schools holds is the certification of \u2018School Superintendent.\u2019<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">\u201cOn May 14, 1999, the plaintiff was terminated from her employment with the Hartford Public Schools without being afforded the procedures contained in the [act], [General Statutes \u00a7] 10-151. \u201c<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>The plaintiff claims that the position of assistant superintendent falls within the definition of teacher under the act because the definition of teacher includes administrative positions below the rank of superintendent. See footnote 2 of this opinion. The plaintiff further contends that the plain and unambiguous language of the act extends protection to assistant superintendents and that the statutory scheme requires that assistant superintendents be covered by the act. Conversely, the defendants claim that the plaintiff, as an assistant superintendent, does not qualify as a teacher under the act because the position of assistant superintendent is a high-level management position, <em>equal </em>to the heightened rank of superintendent. We find the plaintiffs argument persuasive and the defendants\u2019 argument unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Whether or not an assistant superintendent falls within the definition of teacher as defined by \u00a7 10-151 (a) (2) is a question of statutory construction over which our review is plenary. <em>State </em>v. Murray, 254 Conn. 472, 487, 757 A.2d 578 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">We begin our analysis with the language of the statute. Section 10-151 (a) (2) provides that \u201c[t]he term \u2018teacher\u2019 shall include each certified professional employee below the rank of superintendent employed by a board of education for at least ninety days in a position requiring a certificate issued by the State Board of Education . . . .\u201d Accordingly, an individual must satisfy three requirements to be considered a teacher under the act: (1) the employee must hold a position below the rank of superintendent; (2) the employee must be certified and employed by a board of education for at least ninety days; and (3) the employee must be employed in a position requiring a certificate issued by the state board of education. It is not disputed that the plaintiff has satisfied the second and third requirements. The sole issue that we must decide, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>is whether an assistant superintendent is \u201cbelow the rank of superintendent . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 10-151 (a) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">As a preliminary matter, we note that the plaintiff asserts, and the defendants do not dispute, that in general administrators are teachers for purposes of the act. The plaintiff points to <em>Delagorges </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>176 Conn. 630, 410 A.2d 461 (1979), as support for the statement in her brief that \u201c[s]chool administrators are covered by the . . . [a]ct, though they are administrators.\u201d See <em>Connecticut Education Assn. </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>5 Conn. App. 253, 270, 498 A.2d 102, cert. denied, 197 Conn. 814, 499 A.2d 804 (1985) (under <em>Delagorges, </em>administrators do not have tenure as administrators but <em>do </em>have tenure as teachers). Because we believe that the Appellate Court\u2019s interpretation of the act in <em>Connecticut Education Assn, </em>is an extension of this court\u2019s holding in <em>Delagorges, </em>and because the question of whether or not administrators are teachers for purposes of the act is central to the question of whether assistant superintendents are teachers, we begin with a preliminary examination of the holdings in <em>Delagorges </em>and <em>Connecticut Education Assn.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">In <em>Delagorges </em>we were asked to decide whether a principal and vice principal were \u201centitled to invoke \u00a7 10-151 (f) when they [were] terminated as administrators but retained as teachers.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Id., 634. We stated, alternatively, the question as, \u201chave the plaintiffs, by virtue of their certification as administrators and their many years of administrative service, acquired tenure as administrators?\u201d Id. We held that, when administrators are reassigned to classroom teaching positions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>rather than being fired outright, the act does not apply. Id., 634r-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">The facts of that case were as follows. Both plaintiffs, George Delagorges and George Richards, had been employed by the West Haven school system for over twenty years. Id., 632. Each became an administrator. Delagorges was an administrator for four years and an assistant principal for three years; Richards was an administrator for thirteen years and a principal for twelve years. Id. The defendant board of education undertook a study of the West Haven school system in which both plaintiffs had participated. As a result of the study, the positions of principal and vice principal were eliminated and several new administrative positions were substituted. Both plaintiffs applied for new positions under the reorganization, but neither was selected. They both subsequently were reassigned to teaching positions at a substantially reduced salary. Id. They protested the reassignment to the board of education and then sought judicial review. Id. The trial court concluded that it was without jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal under the act. Id., 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">On appeal to this court, the plaintiffs claimed that they had \u201ctenure as administrators because they were employed for more than three continuous years under individual administrative contracts.\u201d Id., 634. We stated that the language of the statute \u201cis sufficiently open-ended so that it might be read either to encompass or deny the plaintiffs\u2019 claim\u201d; id., 635; and questioned \u201cwhether we should take this opportunity, in the absence of explicit legislative direction, to construe the . . . [a]ct to provide tenure for administrators not as teachers but as administrators.\u201d Id., 636. We concluded that the relevant case law \u201cillustrate[d] the wisdom of restricting tenure to teachers until the legislature . . . instructs us to the contrary.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 637. We also concluded, however, that the plaintiffs had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>not been terminated for cause and, therefore, that the provisions of the act entitling terminated teachers to certain review procedures had not been triggered. Id., 637-38. Thus, it is unclear whether our holding in that case that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to hear the plaintiffs\u2019 appeals was based on our conclusion that administrators were not entitled to the statutory review procedures applicable to teachers or that those procedures simply had not been triggered.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">In <em>Connecticut Education Assn. </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>supra, 5 Conn. App. 269, the Appellate Court concurred with the conclusion of the state board of labor relations that \u201cadministrator unit members and teacher unit members are considered as one class of teachers for purposes of rights under the . . . act . . . .\u2019\u2019In that case, the trial court was asked to issue a declaratory judgment on the validity of the construction of the act by the state board of labor relations (labor board). Id., 255. The labor board had issued the ruling in response to a petition by the Connecticut state council of AFSA, AFL-CIO, for a declaratory ruling on the question of \u201c[w]hether under the [teacher negotiation act] and the . . . [a]ct, it is a mandatory subject of bargaining for the administrators\u2019 unit and/or the teachers\u2019 unit that members of an administrators\u2019 unit whose positions have been eliminated or whose positions have been lost to other administrators, may bump into or be assigned to a position in the teachers\u2019 unit, which position (i) is held by a Tenured teacher, (ii) is held by a non-Tenured teacher pursuant to [General Statutes \u00a7] 10-151 (b) or (iii) is unoccupied?\u201d Id., 256. The labor board examined both the teacher negotiation act; General Statutes \u00a7 10-153a et seq.; and the act; General Statutes \u00a7 10-151; and \u201crendered an exhaustive and scholarly decision and declaratory ruling\u201d; <em>Connecticut Education Assn. </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>supra, 260; answering the question in the affirmative. Id., 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The Appellate Court adopted \u201cin toto . . . the answers promulgated by the labor board . . . .\u201d Id., 276. The court began by noting the fact that \u201c[c]ourts should accord great deference to the construction given the statute by the agency charged with its enforcement.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 266, quoting <em>Connecticut State Board of Labor Relations </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>177 Conn. 68, 74, 411 A.2d 28 (1979). The court then set forth a thorough analysis of the labor board\u2019s ruling. <em>Connecticut Education Assn. </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>supra, 5 Conn. App. 267-76. The court, in adopting the labor board\u2019s determination, did so on the basis of \u201cthe labor board\u2019s thoughtful analysis of the questions involved in the light of the history and intent of the pertinent statutes and its administrative expertise in this highly technical area.\u201d Id., 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Significantly, in <em>Connecticut Education Assn., </em>the Appellate Court relied on a statutory provision not cited either by this court in <em>Delagorges </em>or by the labor board. It stated, \u201c[a]ny lingering doubt that may be raised concerning the court\u2019s conclusion is dispelled by examination of General Statutes \u00a7 10-145d, not cited by the labor board or any parties to this case. This section concerns, in pertinent part, the adoption of state board regulations for teacher certificates and the adoption of regulations for school business administrators. Subsection (d) provides: \u2018Any individual certified as a school business administrator pursuant to regulations adopted by the state board in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, shall not be deemed to be included in the definition of \u201cteacher\u201d in subdivision (2) of subsection (a) of section 10-151 solely by reason of such certification, provided any such individual who holds a regular teacher\u2019s certificate issued by the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>board of education and is employed as a teacher, principal, supervisor or school superintendent<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> shall not be excluded from such definition.\u2019 This definition, not otherwise related to the issues in this case, emphasizes strongly the all important concept in the . . . [a]ct that for its purposes a certified teacher remains a part of the teacher class regardless of what other administrative positions might be attained.\u201d Id., 270-71. The Appellate Court concluded, and we agree, that this related legislation evidences the legislature\u2019s intent to include administrators within the definition of teacher for purposes of the act. Id., 271. Accordingly, the court concurred in the labor board\u2019s conclusion that the legislature clearly intended that administrators have the same level of employment security as classroom teachers. Id., 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">The Appellate Court supported its determination by citing to <em>Delagorges, </em>stating that its decision was \u201cconsistent with <em>Delagorges </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>[supra, 176 Conn. 630]. In <em>Delagorges, </em>the court held that the transfer of two high school administrators to classroom positions was merely a reassignment which did not entitle the administrators to judicial review of the board of education\u2019s decision under the . . . [a]ct. The <em>Delagorges </em>case did not involve bumping rights. Nevertheless, the court\u2019s conclusion that administrators did not have tenure as administrators but only as teachers firmly buttresses the conclusion we have reached.\u201d <em>Connecticut Education Assn. </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>supra, 5 Conn. App. 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">As we have noted, however, in <em>Delagorges </em>we did not conclude that administrators have tenure as teachers; rather, we concluded that, because the two plaintiffs had not been terminated, the act did not apply. <em>Dela</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number><em>gorges </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 176 Conn. 637-38. In <em>Delagorges, </em>we simply did not reach the question of whether the termination of an administrator triggered the review provision of the act. Although the conclusion in <em>Connecticut Education Assn, </em>is an extension of the <em>Delagorges </em>holding, we conclude, nevertheless, that it is not inconsistent with <em>Delagorges </em>and that it is consistent with the legislative policy evidenced by \u00a7 10-145d.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">This conclusion is supported by an examination of the teacher evaluation act; General Statutes \u00a7 10-151c; which contains a definition of \u201cteacher\u201d substantially identical to that provided in the act. Section 10-151c provides in relevant part: \u201cAny records maintained or kept on file by any local or regional board of education which are records of teacher performance and evaluation shall not be deemed to be public records and shall not be subject to the provisions of section 1-210 . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Section 10-151c defines the term teacher as \u201ceach certified professional employee below the rank of superintendent employed by a board of education in a position requiring a certificate issued by the State Board of Education.\u201d This court has recognized that, for purposes of \u00a7 10-151c, the term teacher includes administrators. See <em>Mendillo </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>246 Conn. 456, 472-74, 717 A.2d 1177 (1998) (evaluation of principal could not be disseminated by superintendent without principal\u2019s consent pursuant to \u00a7 10-151c); <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>221 Conn. 217, 234, 602 A.2d 1019 (1992) (\u00a7 10-151c applies to principal and assistant principal but does not protect against \u201cthe public disclosure of the substance of votes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>of a public agency that happen to concern matters of personnel, teacher performance or evaluation\u201d); <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>210 Conn. 590, 595, 556 A.2d 592 (1989) (documents describing \u201cgoals and objectives\u201d of school administrators protected from disclosure by \u00a7 10-151c). We find it significant that this court has interpreted a substantially identical definition of the term teacher within the same statutory scheme as the act to include school administrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">In light of the labor board\u2019s construction of the act, the legislative intent to include administrators within the definition of teacher as set forth in \u00a7 10-145d, and this court\u2019s interpretation of the term teacher under \u00a7 10-151c, we conclude that the term teacher as defined by the act, includes administrators, and that terminated administrators are entitled to invoke the act\u2019s review procedures. Having established, as a preliminary matter, that administrators are teachers for purposes of the act, we now turn to the question of whether assistant superintendents are teachers under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">To answer this question, we apply the tools of statutory construction to the statutory scheme surrounding the act as it elucidates the legislative policy that the act was designed to implement. Section 10-151 is part of a larger statutory scheme of school laws, including the act, the teacher evaluation act; General Statutes \u00a7 10-151c; the teacher negotiation act; General Statutes \u00a7 10-153a et seq.; and statutes pertaining to the superintendents of schools. \u201cThe school laws enacted by the General Assembly demonstrate the adoption of a public policy to provide good public schools, staffed by qualified teachers; that these teachers, having proved their worth, shall be secure in their employment, save for circumstances affecting the quality of their work; and that, as an inducement to, and reward for, a long period of service, qualified teachers shall benefit from a com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>prehensive retirement system.\u201d <em>Herzig </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>152 Conn. 144, 151, 204 A.2d 827 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">A closer look at the legislative intent underlying the act reveals the legislative policy that the act was designed to implement, namely, protection of the employment security of employees of the educational system balanced with protection of the ability of boards of education to exercise discretion in implementing educational policy. \u201cWe are of course cognizant of the importance that has been attached by our legislature and by our cases to the protection of teachers in their professional role.\u201d <em>Delagorges </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 176 Conn. 636. This policy of protecting teachers is balanced, however, against the competing interest of boards of education in their ability to exercise \u201cadministrative discretion to determine and to implement educational policy. That discretion also has been recognized by our cases .... [J]udicial interposition into every reassignment of teaching or administrative personnel would carry substantial potential for administrative chaos.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">The purpose of the precursor to the act enacted in 1917; Public Acts 1917, c. 316; was to increase efficiency in the hiring process and to enable rural school boards to attract better teachers.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This focus on aiding local <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>boards of education shifted to a policy of protecting teachers with the enactment of certain amendments in 1941 .<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> \u201c4pe recorded legislative history suggests that the statute was primarily intended to provide judicial review for teachers dismissed for cause . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Delagorges </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 176 Conn. 635-36. \u201c[T]he clear legislative intent is that administration unit teachers are to have the same degree of employment security as teacher unit personnel including the right to bump in accordance with a layoff procedure; and . . . teachers, whether in the administrative unit or teacher unit, are to be treated equally as members of the same class . . . .\u201d <em>Connecticut Education Assn. </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>supra, 5 Conn. App. 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">An examination of the statutes pertaining to superintendents further evidences the legislature\u2019s balancing of interests between employment security for employees of the educational system and the need of school boards to exercise discretion in implementing educational policy. General Statutes \u00a7 10-157 (a)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>in relevant part that \u201c[u]pon election and notification of employment or reemployment, the superintendent may request and the board shall provide a written contract of employment which shall include, but not be limited to, the salary, employment benefits and term of office of such superintendent. ...\u201d The differing levels of protection provided to teachers and administrators under the act and to superintendents under \u00a7 10-157 evidences the legislature\u2019s intent to balance its desire to protect employment security for school employees with its desire to provide the administrative discretion that is necessary effectively to operate a school system. Teachers are provided with the most protection\u2014they have a property right in their teaching position. <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>181 Conn. 69, 72, 434 A.2d 333 (1980) (\u201c[a] teacher who is given by statute the right to continued employment except upon a showing of cause or the bona fide elimination of his position; see General Statutes \u00a7 10-151 [d]; acquires a property right that is entitled to protection under the due process clause\u201d), on appeal after remand sub nom. <em>Halpern </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>231 Conn. 308, 649 A.2d 534 (1994). Administrators below the rank of superintendent are given slightly less protection\u2014they have a property right in a teaching position, but they have no administrative tenure. See <em>Trotta </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>32 Conn. App. 395, 397-98, 628 A.2d 1343, cert. denied, 227 Conn. 922, 632 A.2d 700 (1993). Finally, superintendents have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>the least amount of explicit statutory protection, but they are still protected by their statutory right to an employment contract that sets out the terms of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">Our conclusion that assistant superintendents are below the rank of superintendent is, therefore, consistent with the policy underlying the school laws, namely, to provide all employees with some degree of employment security while, at the same time, providing room for the exercise of administrative discretion. Each certified employee of a board of education for more than ninety days holding a position that requires a certificate from the state board of education is protected from arbitrary discharge provided that he or she is below the rank of superintendent. That includes classroom teachers and administrators. Superintendents also are protected from arbitrary discharge through their statutory right to an employment contract. Were we to conclude that assistant superintendents are within the rank of superintendent, they would be wholly without protection from arbitrary discharge as they would be excluded from the protection afforded by the act and they also would not fall within the purview of \u00a7 10-157, which requires that boards of education enter into employment contracts with their superintendents.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> That conclusion would undermine the legislative policy underlying the school laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The defendants contend, however, that public policy dictates that public school districts have discretion in removing assistant superintendents. We agree. We conclude, however, that our determination that assistant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>superintendents are below the rank of superintendent and, thus, protected by the act will not unduly restrict the discretion of boards of education in removing assistant superintendents. This court previously has recognized that school administrators do not have administrative tenure. <em>Delagorges </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 176 Conn. 634-37. Rather, they have <em>teacher </em>tenure. <em>Trotta </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 32 Conn. App. 397-98. This affords assistant superintendents a level of protection commensurate with the amount of discretion needed by the boards of education. Indeed, the plaintiff in this case is not claiming that she had a right to the position of assistant superintendent; she merely claims the right to a job.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">Moreover, an examination of the teacher negotiation act; General Statutes \u00a7 10-153a et seq.; which appears in the same part of the General Statutes as the act, reveals that, when the legislature has desired to exclude assistant superintendents from the scope of the school laws, it has done so explicitly. For example, General Statutes \u00a7 10-153b (b) explicitly excludes from the teacher negotiation act \u201c[t]he superintendent of schools, <em>assistant superintendents, </em>certified professional employees who act for the board of education in negotiations with certified professional personnel or are directly responsible to the board of education for personnel relations or budget preparation, temporary substitutes and all noncertified employees of the board of education . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Prior to 1969, the teacher negotiation act used the same language as the act to define whom the statute covered, namely, all certificated employees employed by a board of education holding a position \u201cbelow the rank of superintendent . . . .\u201d General Statutes (Cum. Sup. 1967) \u00a7 10-153b (b).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>In 1969, the legislature reorganized the teacher negotiation act, setting up separate bargaining units for teachers and administrators. In so doing, the legislature changed the language from \u201cbelow the rank of superintendent\u201d to the enumerated list in \u00a7 10-153b (b). Public Acts 1969, No. 811, \u00a7 2. Four years later, in 1973, the legislature revised the definition of teacher in the act, changing the from \u201cbelow the rank of superintendent or supervising agent\u201d to \u201cbelow the rank of superintendent.\u201d Public Acts 1973, No. 73-456, \u00a7 1. Four years after removing assistant superintendents from the purview of the teacher negotiation act, the legislature amended the <em>same language </em>in the act but chose not explicitly to exclude assistant superintendents. This omission is persuasive evidence of the legislature\u2019s intent to include assistant superintendents within the purview of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">The defendants claim, however, that the exclusion of assistant superintendents from the teacher negotiation act evidences the legislature\u2019s intent that assistant superintendents fall within the rank of superintendents. We disagree. Were we to adopt the defendants\u2019 reasoning, we would have to conclude that all of the other positions listed in \u00a7 10-153b (b), namely, \u201ccertified professional employees who act for the board of education in negotiations with certified professional personnel or are directly responsible to the board of education for personnel relations or budget preparation, temporary substitutes and all noncertified employees of the board of education,\u201d would also join assistant superintendents and superintendents within the rank of superintendent. Such a result would be absurd.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Having examined the relationship between the act and related legislation, we next examine the relationship of the act to common-law principles governing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>wrongful discharge. This court recognized an action for wrongful discharge of an at-will employee in the seminal case of <em>Sheets </em>v. <em>Teddy\u2019s Frosted Foods, Inc., </em>179 Conn. 471, 476, 427 A.2d 385 (1980) (created public policy exception limiting discretion to terminate at-will employees). \u201cIn interpreting this exception, we note our adherence to the principle that the public policy exception to the general rule allowing unfettered termination of an at-will employment relationship is a narrow one . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Burnham </em>v. <em>Karl &amp; Gelb, P.C., </em>252 Conn. 153, 159, 745 A.2d 178 (2000). This narrow public policy exception allowing a common-law wrongful discharge action by an employee who can prove a demonstrably improper reason for dismissal is an attempt to \u201cbalance the competing interests of employer and employee.\u201d <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Hartford Courant Co., </em>200 Conn. 676, 679, 513 A.2d 66 (1986). \u201cThe employer is allowed, in ordinary circumstances, to make personnel decisions without fear of incurring civil liability. Employee job security, however, is protected against employer actions that contravene public policy.\u201d Id. Accordingly, the employee has the burden of proving a violation of <em>important </em>public policy. Id., 679 and n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">This is very limited protection in comparison to that afforded by the act. Teachers in Connecticut are <em>not </em>at-will employees because of an affirmative decision of the legislature. In enacting the act, the legislature evidenced an intent to protect classroom teachers and administrators below the rank of superintendent from the threat of arbitrary discharge. Such protection is not afforded to at-will employees who are only protected in situations where an important public policy has been violated. In addition, we note that superintendents are not at-will employees, but rather they have a statutory right to an employment contract. In affirmatively choosing to remove teachers, administrators and superinten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>dents from the realm of at-will employees, the legislature has made clear its intent that these people \u201cshall be secure in their employment, save for circumstances affecting the quality of their work . . . .\u201d <em>Herzig </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 152 Conn. 151. It would make little sense to read \u00a7 10-151 together with \u00a7 10-157 as protecting <em>everyone but </em>assistant superintendents, who would then be at-will employees subject to arbitrary discharge except in the narrowest of circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Finally, because both parties focused in their briefs and arguments on the plain meaning of the phrase \u201cbelow the rank of superintendent,\u201d we turn to the common understanding of the phrase and conclude that that understanding bolsters our conclusion that assistant superintendents are below the rank of superintendent. The meaning of the phrase \u201cbelow the rank of superintendent\u201d necessarily turns on the meaning of the term rank as used in the statute. Rank is not explicitly defined in the text of \u00a7 10-151. \u201cWhere a statute does not define a term it is appropriate to look to the common understanding expressed in the law and in dictionaries.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Vickers, </em>260 Conn. 219, 224, 796 A.2d 502 (2002). \u201cWords in a statute must be given their plain and ordinary meaning . . . unless the context indicates that a different meaning was intended.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gelinas </em>v. <em>West Hartford, </em>225 Conn. 575, 584, 626 A.2d 259 (1993); see also General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a) (\u201c[i]n the construction of the statutes, words and phrases shall be construed according to the commonly approved usage of the language\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">\u201cRank\u201d has been defined as \u201ca relative standing or position . . . .\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionaiy (10th Ed.). Relative standing or position requires the comparison of two positions in relation to one another\u2014assistant superintendent as compared to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>superintendent. It is uncontested that the superintendent is the chief executive officer of a school system. An assistant superintendent, however, is responsible for only certain components of the system. Additionally, the word \u201cassistant\u201d modifies superintendent. An assistant is \u201ca person who assists: HELPER . . . .\u201d Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed.). The assistant superintendent\u2019s job is to <em>help </em>the superintendent. She depends on the superintendent to assign her tasks and to direct her in her work. It would be odd, indeed, were we to find that the supervisor and the assistant shared the same rank. Comparing the two positions in relation to one another supports the conclusion that an assistant superintendent is below the rank of superintendent.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The defendants claim in their brief, however, that the term rank \u201cclearly conveys the concept of a category of more than one [person] or [thing]\u2014in the plural\u2014 sharing a status or standing in a hierarchy . . . .\u201d This, they contend, is consistent with the way \u201crank\u201d is used by the military wherein each rank includes individuals of common status.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The defendants\u2019 military argument is unpersuasive. First, there is nothing in the statute to suggest that it was intended to incorporate the military lexicon. Second, although in certain instances it might apply, as in the rank of general officer including the various degrees of general officer; see Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary (10th Ed.); in other instances it does not apply, as in lieutenant general is below the rank of general. Finally, and most important, attributing the meaning of \u201crank\u201d suggested by the defendants\u2019 military analogy would, as we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>explained, leave an assistant superintendent, in effect as the only at-will employee in the teaching and administrative categories. This is inconsistent with the purpose of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">For the stated reasons, we conclude that assistant superintendents are teachers as that term is defined in the act, \u00a7 10-151 (a) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The certified question is answered: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">No costs will be taxed in this court to any party.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b310-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 51-199b, the Uniform Certification of Questions of Law Act, provides in relevant part: \u201c(d) The Supreme Court may answer a question of law certified to it by a court of the United States ... if the answer may be determinative of an issue in pending litigation in the certifying court and if there is no controlling appellate decision, constitutional provision or statute of this state. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b310-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 10-151 is commonly known as the teacher tenure act. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Young, </em>44 Conn.
