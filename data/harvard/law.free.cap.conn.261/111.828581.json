J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ac\">The sole issue in this appeal is the proper construction of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (6),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which provides that one of the aggravating factors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>to be considered in determining whether a defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>convicted of a capital felony shall be sentenced to death is whether \u201cthe defendant committed the offense as consideration for the receipt, or in expectation of the receipt, of anything of pecuniary value . . . .\u201d The trial court concluded that the aggravating factor applies only to killings that are an essential prerequisite to obtaining something of pecuniary value and, therefore, does not apply to a capital offense committed during the course <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>of a robbery. The state claims on appeal that the statute applies to any capital felony committed with a profit motive, including those committed in the course of a robbery.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We conclude that the aggravating factor does not apply to capital felonies committed in the course of a robbery and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The parties stipulated that the following facts reasonably could be found by a trier of fact. At some point during the evening of January 23, 1999, the defendant, Alex Sostre, and three other individuals went to an apartment building located at 4543/2 Main Street in East Hartford with the intention of robbing Gregorio Velez, who lived in apartment no. 2. After they broke into Velez\u2019 apartment, the defendant and one of the other individuals became involved in a struggle with Velez, during which they assaulted him. The defendant took a handgun from Velez at that time. The defendant also took from Velez the keys to a safe located in the apartment, which the defendant believed contained more than $1000. As the defendant unsuccessfully attempted to open the safe, he heard the sound of a police radio. At that point, he left the apartment and entered the building\u2019s common hallway.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Meanwhile, at approximately 9:13 p.m., the East Hartford police department had received a telephone complaint of loud noise at 454V2 Main Street. Police officer Brian Aselton and two other police officers responded to the complaint. Upon arrival, the officers were unable to locate a disturbance. Aselton, who was dressed in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>police uniform that displayed police patches and a badge, entered the building alone to notify the complainant of the officers\u2019 findings and encountered the defendant in the hallway. The defendant shot Aselton in the head with the gun that he had taken from Velez. He then fled from the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">At approximately 9:22 p.m., the East Hartford police department received a 911 telephone call from Jose Mulero, who lived in apartment no. 8 at 454V2 Main Street. Mulero indicated that a police officer had been injured. Police officers responded to the call and found Aselton wounded and bleeding in the hallway of the apartment building near the door of apartment no. 2. Aselton was taken to Hartford Hospital, where he died as a result of the gunshot wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Before the robbery, on January 21, 1999, the defendant had told an acquaintance, Denise Morales, that he was going to commit a robbery and, if a police officer interrupted him, either he would shoot the police officer or the officer would have to shoot him. After the robbery, the defendant told another acquaintance that he had shot Aselton because he did not want to return to jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">On January 27, 1999, the defendant was arrested and charged with capital felony in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54b (l),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> murder in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> felony murder in violation of General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 53a-54c,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> kidnapping in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> burglary in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> conspiracy to commit bur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>glary in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and 53a-101, larceny in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-123 (a) (3),* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and attempted larceny in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and 53a-124.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">On July 12, 2000, the state gave notice to the defendant of its intention to seek the death penalty on the basis of the aggravating factors set forth in \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (1) and (6). The defendant subsequently filed a motion to dismiss the aggravating factors. In a thoughtful and comprehensive memorandum of decision, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>trial court, <em>Lavine, </em>denied the motion to dismiss as to \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (1), but granted the motion as to \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (6). Upon the granting of certification by the Chief Justice pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-265a,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the state appealed to this court from the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (6) aggravating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">On appeal, the state claims that the trial court improperly determined that \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (6) does not apply to a capital felony committed in the course of a robbery, but applies only to an offense involving a killing that is an essential prerequisite to the receipt of something of value, \u201cincluding \u2018murders for hire\u2019 or contract killings, killings to obtain insurance proceeds, murders for inheritance, or murders in certain business contexts (e.g., the murder of a partner) which will, due to the operation of law, create pecuniary gain for the perpetrator.\u201d The state argues that robbery is committed \u201cin expectation of the receipt\u201d of pecuniary gain and, therefore, is covered by the statute. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (6). We agree with the trial court that \u00a7 53a-46a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>(i) (6) does not apply to a capital felony committed during the course of a robbery.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The state\u2019s claim presents a question of statutory interpretation, over which our review is plenary. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>251 Conn. 285, 460, 743 A.2d 1 (1999), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 841, 121 S. Ct. 106, 148 L. Ed. 2d 64 (2000). \u201cA penal statute must be construed strictly against the state and liberally in favor of the accused.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>206 Conn. 346, 355, 538 A.2d 185 (1988). \u201cCriminal statutes are not to be read more broadly than their language plainly requires and ambiguities are ordinarily to be resolved in favor of the defendant. . . . These considerations are especially pertinent to a death penalty statute . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McGann, </em>199 Conn. 163, 177, 506 A.2d 109 (1986). \u201c[T]he touchstone of this rule of lenity is statutory ambiguity. . . . [W]e . . . [reserve] lenity for those situations in which a reasonable doubt persists about a statute\u2019s intended scope even after resort to the language and structure, legislative history, and motivating policies of the statute.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jason B., </em>248 Conn. 543, 555, 729 A.2d 760, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 967, 120 S. Ct. 406, 145 L. Ed. 2d 316 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">To provide context for our analysis of the state\u2019s claim, we briefly review the structure of our death penalty statutes as a whole. \u201cIn General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-46a through 53a-46c, the legislature has established a three-tiered pyramid, in which each tier narrows the class of defendants that may be found eligible for the death penalty. At the first tier above the base of the pyramid, our statute separates capital felony homicides from other homicides, and authorizes bifurcated death penalty hearings only for those who have been found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>guilty of or have pleaded guilty to a capital felony. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46a (b). At the second tier, the statute further limits the death penalty by requiring the sentencer to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, the existence of at least one statutorily delineated aggravating factor. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46a (b), (e), (f), and (g). ... At the third and final tier, our statute separates, from all cases in which a penalty of death may be imposed, those cases in which it shall be imposed ... by requiring a sentencer to find, by a preponderance of the evidence, whether a mitigating factor exists. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46a (e). In making this determination, the capital sentencer must consider the existence of each of the mitigating factors listed in the statute at \u00a7 53a-46a [h] and of any other mitigating factor concerning the defendant\u2019s character, background and history, or the nature and circumstances of the crime. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46a [d]. If the sentencer fails to find the existence of a mitigating factor, after having found the existence of an aggravating factor, the court must sentence the defendant to death. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46a (f).\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>230 Conn. 183, 236-38, 646 A.2d 1318 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1165, 115 S. Ct. 1133, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1095 (1995). In 1995, the legislature amended the death penalty statutes to provide that if the sentencer finds both a mitigating factor or factors and an aggravating factor or factors, the sentencer must determine whether \u201cany aggravating factor or factors outweigh any mitigating factor or factors . . . .\u201d Public Acts 1995, No. 95-19, \u00a7 1, codified in part as General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46a (e). If so, then \u201cthe court shall sentence the defendant to death.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46a (f). If not, then \u201cthe court shall impose a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of release.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46a (g).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">THE LANGUAGE</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">We now turn to the merits of the state\u2019s claim. \u201cAs with any issue of statutory interpretation, our initial guide is the language of the statute itself.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Ledbetter, </em>240 Conn. 317, 328, 692 A.2d 713 (1997). General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46a (i) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe aggravating factors to be considered shall be limited to the following ... (6) the defendant committed the offense as consideration for the receipt, or in expectation of the receipt, of anything of pecuniary value . . . .\u201d We do not conclude, as the state urges, that this language clearly and unambiguously applies to robbery.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The words \u201cconsideration,\u201d \u201creceipt\u201d and \u201cexpectation\u201d invoke transactional concepts central to contract murder and invite the question whether the statute was intended to target capital felonies involving the taking of property by force. See footnote 2 of this opinion. Accordingly, to determine the intent of the legislature, we must examine the structure of the statute and the context of the language at issue, its legislative history and the case law of our sister states construing similar statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">CONSTRUCTION WITH GENERAL STATUTES \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (5)</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">As noted by the trial court, \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (5) provides significant context for the interpretation of \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (6). The (i) (5) factor applies to a defendant who procures the commission of a capital felony \u201cby pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>ment, or promise of payment, of anything of pecuniary value,\u201d whereas the (i) (6) factor applies to a defendant who commits a capital felony \u201cas consideration for the receipt, or in expectation of the receipt, of anything of pecuniary value . . . .\u201d The proximity and parallel structure of these two factors suggest that they were intended to apply respectively to the two parties to a murder for hire, and that it is the procurer\u2019s promise of payment, referred to in (i) (5), that gives rise to the expectation of receipt, referred to in (i) (6). See <em>Soares </em>v. <em>Max Services, Inc., </em>42 Conn. App. 147, 159, 679 A.2d 37, cert. denied, 239 Conn. 915, 682 A.2d 1005 (1996) (proximity of statutory provisions may reveal legislative intent).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The state claims, however, that this interpretation would render the clause \u201cin expectation of the receipt\u201d mere surplusage. It argues that, because \u201c[a]n exchange of promises is sufficient consideration to support a contract\u201d; <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Locke Steel Chain Co., </em>153 Conn. 527, 531, 218 A.2d 526 (1966); a murder for hire is committed for \u201cconsideration\u201d whether payment is actually made or merely promised prior to the commission of the offense. See 1 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 77 (1) (1981) C\u2018[t]o constitute consideration, a <em>performance or a return promise </em>must be bargained for\u201d [emphasis added]). Therefore, the state contends, the phrase \u201cas consideration for the receipt\u201d encompasses both actual receipt and expected receipt. Accordingly, it argues, if \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (6) is construed to apply only to murders for hire, that construction would render superfluous the second clause dealing with murders committed \u201cin expectation of the receipt ... of anything of pecuniary value . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">We conclude that the state\u2019s interpretation rests on a faulty reading of the statute. As used in \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (6), the term \u201cconsideration\u201d does not refer to the benefit for which the capital offense was committed, but to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>the commission of the capital offense itself.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (6) (\u201cthe defendant committed the offense <em>as consideration for </em>the receipt\u201d [emphasis added]). In other words, it is the intentional murder that serves as the consideration for receipt of payment. Therefore, the fact that, under contract law, the term \u201cconsideration\u201d may mean either performance or the promise of performance is irrelevant to our construction of the statute. It does not follow from that legal principle that, for purposes of \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (6), the term \u201creceipt\u201d may mean either actual receipt or the expectation of receipt any more than it follows that, under \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (5), the term \u201cpayment\u201d may mean either actual payment or the promise of payment. Accordingly, if \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (6) were construed to apply only to murders for hire, the second prong would not be superfluous because, unlike the first prong, it covers the situation where the defendant either received the promised pecuniary value after the capital felony was committed or never actually received it.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">We emphasize that this statutory language was drafted with a view to prosecuting capital felonies, not to enforcing contracts. Accordingly, it is reasonable to infer that the legislature included the \u201cexpectation of the receipt\u201d language in \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (6) to clarify that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>it did not intend to require the state to prove actual receipt of a promised payment in order to establish the aggravating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">DEFINITIONS OF \u201cRECEIPT\u201d AND \u201cEXPECTATION\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The state also claims, however, that even if the second prong of \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (6), referring to the \u201cexpectation of the receipt,\u201d covers murders for hire that are not covered by the first prong, referring to \u201cconsideration for the receipt,\u201d the phrase \u201cin expectation of the receipt\u201d is not limited to cases in which the defendant has received a promise of payment, but includes any circumstance where the defendant expects to take possession of something of pecuniary value as a result of committing a capital offense. In support of its claim, the state relies primarily on the definition of the word \u201creceipt.\u201d It points out that the court in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>910 F. Sup. 837, 848 n.15 (N.D.N.Y. 1995),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> in interpreting an identical aggravating factor and rejecting the interpretation of the statutory language urged by the defendant in this case, concluded that the term \u201c \u2018receipt\u2019 \u201d did not \u201cserve to limit interpretation of the statute to pecuniary benefit which accrues to a defendant in a transactional sense . . . .\u201d Rather, the court noted, \u201c \u2018[r]eceipf in its plain and ordinary meaning is defined as \u2018la. An act of receiving something; b. The fact of being received.\u2019 Webster\u2019s II New Riverside Dictionary 981 (1994) \u2018Receive\u2019 is defined as \u20181. To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>acquire or <em>take </em>(something given, offered or transmitted): GET.\u2019 Id.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>United States </em>v. Walker, supra, 848 n.15; see also id., 848, citing Webster\u2019s II New Riverside Dictionary (1994)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> (concluding that \u201cnothing in the plain and ordinary meaning of \u2018expectation\u2019 serves to limit an understanding of Congress\u2019 use of the term to murders in expectation of the receipt of an inheritance\u201d). Accordingly, the court concluded that the statutory language was sufficiently broad to apply to robbery. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>supra, 848-49. The state in this case also cites Webster\u2019s New Universal Unabridged Dictionary (1996), which defines \u201cto receive\u201d as \u201cto take into one\u2019s possession (something offered or delivered),\u201d in support of its claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">We disagree with the <em>Walker </em>court\u2019s analysis. In our view, neither the definition cited by that court nor the definition cited by the state in this case supports that court\u2019s broad interpretation of the statutory language. Both definitions are accompanied by parenthetical qualifiers that clearly connote the passive stance of a person who \u201creceives.\u201d See Webster\u2019s II New Riverside Dictionary 981 (1994) (received item is \u201csomething given, offered or transmitted\u201d); Webster\u2019s New Universal Unabridged Dictionary (1996) (received item is \u201csomething offered or delivered\u201d). This connotation is at odds with the notion of robbery, which involves the use, or the threat of immediate use, of physical force upon a person to take property or to compel its delivery. See footnote 2 of this opinion. Similarly, the phrase \u201cin expectation of\u2019 does not carry with it the connotation of purposive activity that the phrases \u201cwith intent to\u201d or \u201cin an attempt to\u201d do, while it does connote both a sense of probability and of debt or obligation. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary (1991) (\u201cexpect\u201d means \u201c1 <em>archaic: </em>AWAIT 2: SUPPOSE, THINK 3: to anticipate or look forward to the coming or occurrence of &lt;we ~ them any minute now&gt; <em>&lt;~ed </em>a telephone call&gt; 4 a: to consider probable or certain &lt;~ to be forgiven&gt; &lt;~ that things will improve&gt; b: to consider reasonable, due, or necessary <em>&lt;~ed </em>respect from the students&gt; c: to consider bound in duty or obligated cthey ~ you to pay your dues&gt;\u201d). The phrase \u201cin expectation of the receipt,\u201d therefore, more accurately describes the mental state of a defendant who anticipates taking possession of something offered or to be delivered to him under a promise than that of a defendant who intends to take property from a person by force.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The state also claims that its interpretation is supported by General Statutes \u00a7 53a-118 (a) (6), which provides that, for purposes of part IX of chapter 952 of the Penal Code, relating to larceny, robbery and related offenses, \u201c[t]o \u2018receive\u2019 means to acquire possession, control or title, or to lend on the security of the property.\u201d Although this definition appears, at first blush, to be broader than the dictionary definitions cited by the state, the state has pointed to no penal statute pertaining to larceny or robbery where the term \u201cto receive\u201d is actually used in the sense of \u201cto rob.\u201d Rather, the statutes consistently distinguish those offenses in which the property is \u201creceived,\u201d i.e., is not taken by use of force directly from the person of the victim, from other theft offenses. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-119 (8) and (13);<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> see also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-128a (f),<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> 53a-128c,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and 53a-128g.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that the dictionary and statutory definitions of \u201cexpectation\u201d and \u201creceipt\u201d are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>consistent with the interpretation that the aggravating factor was not intended to apply to capital felonies committed in the course of a robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">CONSTRUCTION WITH GENERAL STATUTES \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (1) AND (2)</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">The interpretation that \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (6) applies only to murders for hire is also consistent with subdivisions (1) and (2) of \u00a7 53a-46a (i), which provide: \u201cThe aggravating factors to be considered shall be limited to the following: (1) The defendant committed the offense during the commission or attempted commission of, or during the immediate flight from the commission or attempted commission of, a felony and he had previously been convicted of the same felony; or (2) the defendant committed the offense after having been convicted of two or more state offenses or two or more federal offenses or of one or more state offenses and one or more federal offenses for each of which a penalty of more than one year imprisonment may be imposed, which offenses were committed on different occasions and which involved the infliction of serious bodily injury upon another person . . . .\u2019\u2019If we were to adopt the state\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (6), namely, that it applies to capital felonies committed with the expectation of pecuniary gain as the result of theft,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> we would have to conclude that the legislature intended that, under \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (1), a capital felony would be aggra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>vated only in cases in which there has been a prior conviction for the same felony or, under \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (2), in which there have been at least <em>two </em>previous convictions \u201cinvolv[ing] the infliction of serious bodily injury,\u201d but that, under \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (6), the legislature intended that a capital felony involving theft would be aggravated regardless of whether there was a prior felony conviction for theft. For example, under \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (1), a defendant who committed murder during the course of an offense involving kidnapping and sexual assault in the first degree would be eligible for the death penalty<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> only if he previously had committed the offense of kidnapping or sexual assault\u2014assuming that no other aggravating factors existed\u2014while, under \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (6), a defendant who committed murder in the course of a kidnapping and robbery could receive the death penalty even if he had no previous convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">This result, however, which implies that the legislature considered offenses involving theft to be inherently more dangerous and heinous than other felonies, is inconsistent with the statute as a whole. If the legislature had considered theft to be more dangerous or heinous than kidnapping or sexual assault for purposes of constituting an aggravating factor, then, logically, the legislature would have made murder during the course of an offense involving theft a capital felony. The legislative history of the death penalty statute, however, shows that the legislature expressly chose not to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>During debate on the legislation ultimately enacted as Public Acts 1973, No. 73-137, \u00a7 3, now codified as General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54b, Representative Joseph M. Pugliese introduced House Amendment A, which would have made a capital felony of \u201c \u2018murder committed by a person who was, at the time, committing robbery or burglary while armed.\u2019 \u201d 16 H.R. Proc., Pt. 6, 1973 Sess., p. 2927. In support of the amendment, Representative Pugliese stated, \u201cI offer this amendment as a deterrent hopefully that these people who do engage in these actions, although we perhaps cannot convince them not to rob, not to burglarize, that perhaps we cannot eonviee them that they should not carry a gun while doing these actions but perhaps if they know that they are going to get the death penalty for killing someone, we might just convince them that they ought to carry a gun that is not loaded.\u201d Id., p. 2928. Representative James F. Bingham opposed the amendment, however, stating that \u201c[t]his bill was drafted very carefully to comply with the death penalty decision and if you read the specific crimes enunciated in the death penalty or calling for the capital felony, they fall into a category which has been defined by <em>[Furman </em>v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238, 92 S. Ct. 2726, 33 L. Ed. 2d 346 (1972)] as especially heinous and cruel crimes. ... As to the far end of one scale we could say that the killing by a husband in a lover\u2019s quarrel would be probably the least heinous of crimes although many would say that is a heinous crime which should be paid for by the death penalty. On the other end of the scale, we have probably the most heinous crime known to man is the crime of the killing of a person for gain commonly known as the hit and if some person pays a thousand dollars to a hired killer, that, in my opinion, would be at the other end of the scale. . . . [I]t is my opinion and it is the opinion of the Attorney General\u2019s Office of the United States that the . . . inclusion of the crime enunciated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>by Rep. Pugliese would render this bill unconstitutional.\u201d 16 H.R. Proc., supra, pp. 2928-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Representative Samuel S. Freedman also opposed the amendment, stating that \u201c[f]irst <em>of </em>all, some <em>of </em>the language referring to at the time seems to me to be too vague to stand up in a criminal statute. Secondly, the singling out of one crime, such as this a crime of homicide and not including other crimes of homicide in similar situations, would lead us into equal protection problems under the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d Id., pp. 2929-30. He also pointed out that Justice Blackmun, in his dissenting opinion in the <em>Furman </em>case, \u201ccontinually refers to the most heinous crimes and I would give the House some examples of his language. He said in his dissent, if we were possessed of legislative power, I would restrict the use of capital punishment to a small category of the most heinous crimes. . . . [C]learly this bill is at present the most I believe we can expect to stand up constitutionally.\u201d Id., pp. 2930-31, remarks of Representative Freedman. In light of these objections, Representative Pugliese withdrew the proposed amendment. Id., p. 2932.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The legislature also had reservations about enacting a death penalty statute that would punish economic crimes and, therefore, have a disproportionate effect on the economically disadvantaged. Responding to such reservations, Senator George C. Guidera stated that \u201c[i]t has been said by many Senators, opponents to the measure, that the sentence should be imposed without reference to economic or racial status. You know, murders committed by economically poor and the racial minority groups generally fall into one single category and that is burglary and a death, a shooting, which occurs after the burglary or the [larceny]. . . . [T]he mitigating and aggravating circumstances which we set up in this Bill do not in any place discriminate on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>basis of economic condition or racial group.\u201d 16 S. Proc., Pt. 4, 1973 Sess., pp. 1936-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">This legislative history clearly indicates that the legislature did not consider robbery to be an especially heinous crime in the death penalty context, and that it concluded, for that reason, that the imposition of the death sentence for murders involving robbery would be of questionable fairness and constitutionality. With this background in mind, we have difficulty believing that the legislature contemplated that, on the one hand, a capital felony involving murder, kidnapping and rape, all of which, in and of themselves, the legislature considered to be particularly heinous and dangerous crimes, would not be sufficiently heinous to subject the defendant to the death penalty in the absence of an additional aggravating factor, but that, on the other hand, an offense involving murder, kidnapping and robbery would.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">This legislative history also makes clear that the legislature considered murder for hire to be the single most heinous capital offense. See also id., p. 1868, remarks of Senator Guidera (\u201c[t]he Bill also imposes the death penalty upon two classes of criminals who have no regard for human life and for whom personally I have no regard; [number] [o]ne: the hired assassin, the hired gunman, [number] [t]wo: the non-addict hard drug seller where the user of the drug dies as a result of its use\u201d). This is consistent with the legislature\u2019s decision to make murder for hire both a capital felony and an aggravating factor so that, in combination with any other capital felony or aggravating factor, commission of that offense would subject the defendant to the possibility of receiving the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Moreover, if the portion of the bill now codified as \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (6) was intended to cover offenses involving theft, it is difficult to understand why the opponents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>of Amendment A, among whom was Representative Bingham, the principal sponsor of the death penalty bill in the House of Representatives and cochairman of the judiciary committee, neglected to mention that fact during debate on the amendment. Rather, if that were the case, it would have been natural for him and the other opponents of the amendment to point out that, even though a murder committed during the course of an armed robbery was not classified as a capital felony, robbery would be an aggravating factor if a murder otherwise was classified as a capital offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Finally, we find unpersuasive the state\u2019s suggestion that the <em>absence </em>in Connecticut\u2019s death penalty scheme of a separate aggravating factor explicitly referring to robbery supports its interpretation of \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (6). The state points out that, because Connecticut has not explicitly included robbery in a separate aggravating factor, it would not be \u201c \u2018double counting\u2019 \u201d to apply \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (6) to a killing in the course of a robbery. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Chew, </em>150 N.J. 30, 56, 695 A.2d 1301 (1997) (because New Jersey statute provides for aggravating factor where \u201coffense was committed while the defendant was engaged in the commission of, or an attempt to commit, or flight after committing or attempting to commit . . . robbery\u201d; N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:11-3 c [4] [g] [West 1982]; court concluded that to apply aggravating factor identical to \u00a7 53a-46a [i] [6] to offense involving robbery would be \u2018\u2018double-counting\u201d); but see <em>State </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>661 S.W.2d 497, 505 (Mo. 1983), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1009, 105 S. Ct. 1875, 85 L. Ed. 2d 168 (1985) (\u201cthe application of the receiving money [aggravating factor] to murder in the course of robbery would not be duplicative of an existing aggravating circumstance and is thus even more reasonable\u201d).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We cannot con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>elude, however, that the legislature\u2019s choice not to classify robbery as an aggravating factor <em>explicitly, </em>as the Model Penal Code,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> as well as several states,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> have done, is affirmative evidence of its intent to do so <em>cryptically. </em>Rather, it is more logical to assume that the legislatures that have enacted aggravating factors both for offenses involving pecuniary gain and for those involving robbery have done so because they believed that the pecuniary gain factor did not apply to offenses committed in the course of a robbery. Accordingly, our legislature\u2019s choice is more logically interpreted as reflecting an intent to reject robbery as an aggravating factor than an intent to encompass it in \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (6). As stated by the trial court, \u201cif the legislature had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>wanted to turn killings accomplished during robberies, burglaries and larcenies into an [aggravating factor], it simply would have said so in a separate, unambiguous and straightforward [manner].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">ADDITIONAL LEGISLATIVE HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">We next address the state\u2019s claim that other statements by legislators during the debate on the death penalty bill make it \u201cunmistakably clear\u201d that the legislature intended for \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (6) to apply to robbery. The state relies primarily on statements by Representative Bingham explaining that the state could establish an aggravating factor by proving that \u201cthe defendant committed the offense for the receipt or expectation of receipt of anything of pecuniary] value\u201d; 16 H.R. Proc., supra, p. 2925; and that \u201cthe crime was committed after procurement by hire or committed for hire or for some pecuniary] value.\u201d Id., p. 2976. The state argues that this language does not expressly limit the aggravating factor to murders for hire. It further argues that, if Representative Bingham had understood the factor to be so limited, he would not have included the phrase \u201cor for some pecuniary value\u201d in his second remark.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">Contrary to the state\u2019s claim, however, the remarks do not clearly and unambiguously indicate a legislative intent for the statute to apply to theft. The first remark cited by the state is a mere paraphrase of the statute, and the second remark, in and of itself, could be read as <em>equating </em>murder committed for some pecuniary value with murder for hire just as easily as it could be read to <em>distinguish </em>the two offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">The state also points to Senator Guidera\u2019s remark that \u201c[t]he only crimes which have been designated as capital felonies are those in which there is a high degree of deterrence likely\u2014the lifer who attempts to escape <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>from prison, the roof top sniper who fires on firemen in the performance of their duties, the bank robber or the liquor store holdup man who kills a policeman who attempts to foil his plans . . . .\u201d 16 S. Proc., supra, p. 1868. The state argues that \u201cthe deterrent effect that Senator Guidera sought to achieve through the enactment of the bill would be realized only if the perpetrator of the crimes to be so deterred were eligible for the death penalty.\u201d We are not aware of, however, and the state has not pointed to, any theory under which the \u201clifer\u201d or the \u201croof top sniper\u201d referred to by Senator Guidera would be eligible for the death penalty in the absence of some additional aggravating factor. Id. Accordingly, we conclude that this remark was intended merely to explain the undisputed fact that all of the offenses referred to\u2014murder committed by one who was, at the time of commission of the murder, under sentence of life imprisonment; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54b (4); murder of a firefighter; General Statutes \u00a7 54a-54b (1); and murder of a police officer; General Statutes \u00a7 54a-54b (1)\u2014are capital felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">The state also cites legislative history pertaining to the general purposes of the death penalty statutes in support of its argument. Specifically, it points to Senator Guidera\u2019s remark that \u201cwe\u2019re trying to protect, in this Bill, those individuals who are out on the street day in and day out who are trying to protect our lives and property including the policemen, the deputy sheriffs, the constables, the local police, the state police and so forth and so on . . . .\u201d 16 S. Proc., supra, p. 1873. It also cites Senator John Zajac\u2019s remark that \u201cby failing to execute a criminal convicted\u2014a criminal convicted of these most awful offenses\u2014we are failing to add the deterrent that might spare the indefinite number of innocent, human lives from prospective murderers.\u201d Id., p. 1880. Finally, it cites Senator Dave Odegard\u2019s statement that \u201cgovernment is fundamentally estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>lished to protect the persons and property of its citizens. All of our human experience tells us that the certainty and severity of punishment is truly a deterrent to criminal acts.\u201d Id., p. 1927. The state argues that these remarks \u201cclearly indicate that death penalty supporters believed that execution of criminals who commit the most heinous offenses is necessary for the capital felony statute to be an effective deterrent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">We have no quarrel with the state\u2019s understanding of the general purposes of the death penalty statutes to deter heinous offenses and to protect police officers acting within the scope of their duties. Nothing in these general remarks, however, definitively indicates that the legislature intended to deter \u201cthe most heinous offenses\u201d and to protect police officers by making robbery an aggravating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">OTHER JURISDICTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">The state also urges this court to follow two jurisdictions with aggravating factors identical to \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (6) that have construed the factor to apply to capital felonies committed during the course of a robbery. See <em>United States </em>v. Walker, supra, 910 F. Sup. 837 (construing 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848 [n] [7]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>126 Ariz. 428, 436, 616 P.2d 888, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1067, 101 S. Ct. 796, 66 L. Ed. 2d 612 (1980) (construing Ariz. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 13-454 [E] [5] [1956]).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>in the foregoing analysis, however, we reject the conclusions of the court in <em>Walker </em>that (1) the defendant\u2019s interpretation of the factor would render the \u201c \u2018in expectation of the receipt\u2019 \u201d language superfluous; (2) the proximity and parallel structure of the aggravating factor for procurement of murder for hire was not significant; and (3) nothing else in the plain language or structure of the statute precluded the application of the statute to robbery. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>supra, 848-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">Nor are we persuaded by the Arizona court\u2019s conclusory statement that \u201c[t]he circumstances surrounding the total episode reflect that the expectation of financial gain [from a robbery] was a cause of the murders,\u201d and that the factor was, therefore, applicable to robbery. <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>supra, 126 Ariz. 436. Moreover, that court subsequently held that \u201cthe language in [Ariz. Rev. Stat.] \u00a7 13-703 (F) (5) [1978] makes clear . . . that this aggravating [circumstance] does not apply in every situation where an individual has been killed while at the same time the defendant has made a financial gain. It is limited to those situations where the defendant committed the offense <em>... in the expectation </em>of the receipt of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>anything of pecuniary value. ... In other words, the hope of pecuniary gain must provide the impetus for the murder. For example, if a beneficiary killed an insured in order to gain the proceeds of a life insurance policy this aggravating circumstance would be satisfied. On the other hand, an unexpected or accidental death that was not in furtherance of the defendant\u2019s goal of pecuniary gain, which occurs during the course of or flight from a robbery, does not in itself provide a sufficient basis for finding the same aggravating circumstance.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hensley, </em>142 Ariz. 598, 603-604, 691 P.2d 689 (1984). Accordingly, it is far from clear that Arizona courts would apply the aggravating factor under the circumstances of this case. See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chanthadara, </em>230 F.3d 1237, 1263-64 (10th Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 992, 122 S. Ct. 457, 151 L. Ed. 2d 376 (2001) (noting that person who kills in course of robbery does not necessarily do so for pecuniary reasons and holding that, under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3592 [c] [8],<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> capital felony itself, rather than robbery, must be committed in expectation of pecuniary gain). Moreover, to the extent that <em>Hensley </em>and <em>Chanthadara </em>could be read as suggesting that the aggravating factor is applicable to certain capital offenses committed during the course of a robbery, namely, those in which the sole motive for the killing was pecuniary gain, for the reasons set forth in parts II, III and IV of this opinion, we are not convinced that the Connecticut legislature had any such intent.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>The defendant also points out that the court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Chew, </em>supra, 150 N.J. 56, construing an aggravating factor identical to \u00a7 53a-46a (i) (6), concluded that, to satisfy the factor, \u201cit must be found that the killing is the essential prerequisite to the receipt of the gain, not just a killing that results in pecuniary gain.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> The issue in that case, however, was whether the factor applied to a murder committed in order to obtain insurance proceeds, not whether it applied to robbeiy. Id., 50. Although the court stated in dicta that \u201cour statute does not sustain the breadth of the factor adopted by the . . . court [in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>supra, 910 F. Sup. 837]\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Chew, </em>supra, 55; and \u201cthat it would be double-counting to apply the c (4) (d) factor to a killing in the course of a robbery;\u201d id., 56; we conclude that, because the analysis in <em>Chew </em>focused on whether murder to obtain insurance proceeds, rather than murder in the course of a robbery, is covered by the aggravating factor, it adds little to the foregoing discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>VII</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">RULE OF LENITY</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">We recognize that, in a very broad sense, a defendant who commits a capital felony during the course of a robbery could be said, under certain circumstances, to have done so \u201cin expectation of the receipt\u201d of something of pecuniary value.

As the trial court noted, however, \u201c[t]he issue . . . is not whether the language of the statute <em>could </em>be [so] construed . . . but whether the legislature intended that it <em>would.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.)

A killing committed during the course of a robbery frequently is committed in order to facilitate escape or to avoid subsequent prosecution. No such difficulty arises if the aggravating factor is limited to murder for hire.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b163-7\"> Courts in other jurisdictions have similarly limited their pecuniary gain aggravating factors.

Stat. \u00a7 29-2523 [1] [c] [1975], which provides lor aggravating factor when \u201c[t]he murder was committed for hire, or for pecuniary gain, or the defendant hired another to commit the murder for the defendant,\u201d to apply \u201c[1] to the hired gun, [2] to the hirers of the gun, and [3] to murder motivated primarily by a desire for pecuniary gain as in the case of a murder of an insured by the beneficiary of a life insurance policy for the purpose of obtaining the proceeds, or the murder of a testatory by a legatee or devisee to secure a legacy or a devise\u201d); <em>Boutwell </em>v. <em>State, </em>659 P.2d 322, 328 (Okla Crim. App. 1983) (construing Okla.

Because of textual and structural differences between those statutes and our own, however, those cases are of little guidance in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
