J.</author>\n<p id=\"AyN\">This case is before us on a writ of error brought by the named plaintiff in error, Allstate Insurance Company (plaintiff),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the insurer of the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>dant in the underlying action, seeking reversal of an order of the trial court, <em>Mottolese, J., </em>the defendant in error (trial court), imposing sanctions against the plaintiff pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 14-13. The dispositive issue in this case is whether a party\u2019s proper exercise of its right to a trial de novo in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 52-549z following a nonbinding arbitration proceeding may serve as the grounds for the imposition of sanctions under Practice Book \u00a7 14-13. We conclude that it may not, and that the trial court, therefore, improperly sanctioned the plaintiff.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse the order of sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The plaintiff claims that the trial court\u2019s order of sanctions against it is void because it is not a party to the underlying action and never consented to the court\u2019s personal jurisdiction over it. Further, the plaintiff contends that: (1) the trial court violated its due process rights by failing to give notice that that court would be considering whether to impose sanctions upon the plaintiff for its refusal to increase its settlement offer; and (2) the order of sanctions was an improper attempt by the trial court to coerce and intimidate the plaintiff to settle the underlying defendant\u2019s case and, as such, violated the underlying defendant\u2019s constitutional right of access to the courts. We agree that, under the circumstances of this case, the plaintiffs conduct, which was grounded in its insured\u2019s exercise of his right to a trial de novo, cannot serve as the basis for an order of sanctions, and we reverse the order sanctioning the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">The record discloses the following relevant facts and procedural history. In December, 1997, Robert Morgan filed the underlying action against David Distasio, the plaintiffs insured, to recover damages for injuries sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>tained in a December 5, 1995 automobile accident.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Distasio, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Fairfield, Docket No. CV 970347509. After a pretrial conference at which no settlement was reached, the trial court referred the case to nonbinding arbitration pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-549u,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the court annexed arbitration program. In December, 1999, the arbitrator issued a memorandum of decision in which he found, inter alia, that Distasio negligently had rear-ended Morgan\u2019s vehicle, that Morgan had sustained minor physical injuries and property damage, and that judgment should be rendered in favor of Morgan in the amount of $2450. Distasio thereafter timely filed a claim for a trial de novo pursuant to \u00a7 52-549z<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 6and Practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>Book \u00a7 23-66,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> requesting that the trial court vacate the arbitration award and restore the case to the jury trial list.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">On April 4,2001, a pretrial conference was held before the trial court, <em>Mottolese, J. </em>The trial court continued the conference to April 11, 2001, with the instruction that Distasio produce his insurance claims representative on that date. On April 11, 2001, Distasio, Morgan and their respective counsel, along with the claims representative for the plaintiff, Stephen Coppa, appeared before the court in accordance with a written notice of pretrial conference. Coppa acknowledged that the plaintiff had made its initial settlement offer of $2050 to Morgan after evaluating the case, and that, at the time the offer was made, he had told Morgan that the offer was final. After discussion, the trial court found that the plaintiffs refusal \u201cto pay anything more than $2050 ... is conduct which may fairly be characterized as unfair and in bad faith.\u201d The trial court further stated that \u201c[t]his court deems [the plaintiffs] refusal to participate in a resolution of this case in a reasonable manner as the functional equivalent of a failure to attend a pretrial,\u201d and that \u201c[i]f s unreasonable for any insurance carrier, any tortfeasor, to require judicial resources to be put in place and for thousands and thousands of taxpayers\u2019 money to be expended in order to save you, [the plaintiff], $400.00.\u201d The trial court held that the plaintiffs conduct was an \u201cunwarranted imposition upon scarce judicial resources ... a gross <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>abuse of the civil justice system; and [that it made] a mockery of Connecticut\u2019s court annexed arbitration program.\u201d Accordingly, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 14-13,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the trial court awarded Morgan attorney\u2019s fees of $250 for the April 4 pretrial conference and $250 for the April 11 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Distasio moved for articulation, requesting that the trial court clarify whether the ruling on attorney\u2019s fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>was directed at the plaintiff, Distasio or Distasio\u2019s counsel. In response, the trial court appointed H. James Pickerstein, an attorney, \u201cas a special master to conduct discovery on behalf of the court and to assist the court in preparing its articulation.\u201d The court ordered that the scope of discovery was to include, but not be limited to, the plaintiffs settlement policies and practices as they related to the underlying case, the extent to which Distasio\u2019s counsel had participated in the settlement process, and the policies and practices of the court annexed arbitration program and de novo trials.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Distasio moved for appellate review of the trial court\u2019s order, arguing that the order did not articulate or clarify the trial court\u2019s April 11 decision, as he had requested in the motion for articulation. Distasio further argued that the appointment of a special master to conduct discovery was an improper attempt by the trial court to substitute a new decision or to change the reasoning or basis of the court\u2019s April 11 decision.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thereafter, Distasio filed an appeal in the Appellate Court challenging the appointment of the special master.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">In the meantime, the plaintiff moved for permission to amend the writ to address the sanction order. The trial court objected to the motion for permission to amend. We granted the plaintiffs motion for permission to amend the writ of error and allowed the parties to file supplemental briefs. Thereafter, the plaintiff filed its amended writ of error, alleging the prior claims and further contending that the trial court improperly had appointed a special master and that the order of discovery was not an articulation but an attempt to find justification, through rectification of the record, of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>sanctions previously imposed. Thereafter, the trial court amended the order by articulating that the sanction of the attorney\u2019s fees was directed to the plaintiff, and it vacated the remainder of the order. In light of the amendment of the order, the additional issues raised in the amended writ of error are now moot. Only the order of sanctions remains in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The plaintiff claims that the order of sanctions was an improper attempt to coerce and intimidate it into settling the matter, thereby violating its constitutional right to a trial by jury. Specifically, the plaintiff argues that Distasio\u2019s assertion of his statutory right to a trial de novo following the court-ordered nonbinding arbitration proceeding preserved his right to a trial by jury guaranteed by the Connecticut constitution, and that a party\u2019s decision not to be bound by an arbitrator\u2019s decision regarding settlement cannot be the basis for the imposition of sanctions under Practice Book \u00a7 14-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Conversely, the trial court argues that, because the arbitrator\u2019s award of $2450 in damages was a mere $400 more than the plaintiff was originally willing to pay, the plaintiff took a defiant approach to the settlement process that was interpreted by the trial court as being disrespectful to it, harmful to the opposing party and implicitly contemptuous. The trial court further argues that it is within that court\u2019s inherent authority to sanction all who appear before it whose actions may be characterized as unfair and in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">We agree with the plaintiff and conclude that Distasio\u2019s exercise of his right to file for a trial de novo after the completion of arbitration proceedings cannot provide the basis for sanctions pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 14-13. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion when it sanctioned the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">First, we address the standard of review. The standard of review with regard to a court\u2019s decision to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>impose sanctions is an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Housing Authority, </em>63 Conn. App. 113, 117, 774 A.2d 1025 (2001). \u201cIn reviewing a claim that this discretion has been abused the unquestioned rule is that great weight is due to the action of the trial court and every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of its correctness. . . . [T]he ultimate issue is whether the court could reasonably conclude as it did.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Connecticut National Bank </em>v. <em>Investors Capital Corp., </em>29 Conn. App. 48, 54-55, 613 A.2d 1370, cert. denied, 224 Conn. 902, 615 A.2d 1044 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">We begin with a review of the nonbinding arbitration program. Section 52-549u permits the judges of the Superior Court to refer certain civil actions to an arbitrator for nonbinding arbitration. The arbitrator\u2019s decision, however, is not binding on the parties and does not limit either party\u2019s access to a trial. <em>Shelby Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bishop, Kirk &amp; Saunders, Inc., </em>13 Conn. App. 189, 193, 535 A.2d 387 (1988). Pursuant to \u00a7 52-549z (d) and Practice Book \u00a7 23-66 (c), a party that participated in nonbinding arbitration may appeal from the arbitrator\u2019s decision by requesting a trial de novo, in which case the arbitrator\u2019s decision becomes null and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">The statutory right to a trial de novo has its underpinnings in the Connecticut constitution. \u201cArticle IV of the amendments to the constitution of Connecticut provides, inter alia, that the right of trial by jury shall remain inviolate. It is clear that the right to a jury trial may not be abolished as to causes triable to the jury prior to the constitution of 1818, and extant at the time of its adoption. . . . Nevertheless, such a right may be subjected to reasonable conditions and regulations. . . . The provision by the legislature for an alternative means of dispute resolution through the use of arbitrators to hear cases claimed for jury trial was but part of an effort to alleviate court congestion. . . . The right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>to a trial by jury in these cases is preserved inviolate by General Statutes \u00a7 52-549z and Practice Book \u00a7 [23-66]. Each of these sections provides for a claim for a trial de novo within twenty days of the filing of the arbitrator\u2019s decision. Once a claim for trial de novo is filed in accordance with the rules, a decision of an arbitrator becomes null and void.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Shelby Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bishop, Kirk &amp; Saunders, Inc., </em>supra, 13 Conn. App. 192-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Although both parties to the arbitration have an inviolable right to a trial de novo, that right is subject to reasonable conditions and regulations. See id. Attendance at a pretrial hearing is one such condition. Thus, Practice Book \u00a7 14-13 provides in relevant part that \u201cwhen a party against whom a claim is made is insured, an insurance adjuster for such insurance company shall be available by telephone at the time of such pretrial session unless the judge ... in his or her discretion, requires the attendance of the adjuster at the pretrial. If any person fails to attend or to be available by telephone pursuant to this rule, the judicial authority may make such order as the ends of justice require, which may include the entry of a nonsuit or default against the party failing to comply and an award to the complying party of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">We further recognize, as the trial court claimed, that \u201c[o]ur courts have long been recognized to have an inherent power, independent of any statute, to hold a defendant in contempt of court. . . . The purpose of the contempt power is to enable a court to preserve its dignity and to protect its proceedings.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Garvin, </em>242 Conn. 296, 306, 699 A.2d 921 (1997). The sanction created by Practice Book \u00a7 14-13 and relied upon by the trial court in this case, however, was intended to serve a different function, namely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>to ensure the insurer\u2019s presence to assist in the settlement of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Public policy favors and encourages the voluntary settlement of civil suits. <em>Krattenstein </em>v. <em>G. Fox &amp; Co., </em>155 Conn. 609, 614, 236 A.2d 466 (1967) (\u201cIt is a proper exercise of the judicial office to suggest the expediency and practical value of adjusting differences and compromising and settling suits at law. The efficient administration of the courts is subserved by the ending of disputes without the delay and expense of a trial, and the philosophy or ideal of justice is served in the amicable solution of controversies. Our rules specifically provide for the procedure to be followed in pretrial sessions designed to encourage the settlement of cases.\u201d). We view with disfavor, however, all pressure tactics, whether employed directly or indirectly, to coerce settlement by litigants, their counsel and their insurers. The failure to concur with what a trial court may consider an appropriate settlement should not result in the imposition of any retributive sanctions upon a litigant, his or her counsel or his or her insurer. As our sister state, New York, has recognized, \u201c[t]he function of courts is to provide litigants with an opportunity to air their differences at an impartial trial according to law. . . . [The court should not be able] to exert undue pressure on litigants to oblige them to settle their controversies without their day in court.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Schunk </em>v. <em>Schunk, </em>84 App. Div. 2d 904, 905, 446 N.Y.S.2d 672 (1981); <em>Wolff </em>v. <em>Laverne, Inc., </em>17 App. Div. 2d 213, 214, 233 N.Y.S.2d 555 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">We recognize that Practice Book \u00a7 14-13 grants the trial court the authority to sanction an insurance company for its failure to attend or be available by telephone at a pretrial session. In this case, however, the plaintiff was not unavailable or otherwise absent from the proceedings. Moreover, its actual presence, through its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>agent, Coppa, cannot be transformed into the functional equivalent of an absence, as the trial court ruled,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> simply because the insurer decided not to abide by the arbitrator\u2019s assessment of damages and to insist, as its insured\u2019s agent, on the insured\u2019s right to a trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Although we sympathize with the trial court\u2019s concern that merely attending a pretrial conference while refusing, at the same time, to participate meaningfully in the negotiation or settlement process is not within the spirit of the settlement process, the plaintiffs refusal, on the basis of a validly exercised right to a trial de novo, to abide by the arbitrator\u2019s nonbinding decision that the plaintiff should pay $400 more than its original offer does not fall within the parameters of sanctionable behavior under \u00a7 14-13. To conclude otherwise would undermine the insured\u2019s constitutional right to a trial of the claims. Practice Book \u00a7 14-13 authorizes the court to use its discretion to require an insurer to be present or available because the insurer\u2019s presence might assist in the settlement of the case. Under these circumstances, however, the failure to negotiate is not equivalent to the failure to appear in court. Distasio indicated, by requesting a trial de novo, that he wanted his dispute to be resolved by trial. The plaintiffs rejection of the arbitration award evidences the same preference, in accordance with \u00a7 52-549z (d) and Practice Book \u00a7 23-66 (c). Accordingly, because Distasio properly exercised his statutory right to a trial de novo and the plaintiff properly complied with the trial court\u2019s request to be present at the pretrial hearing, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion when it imposed sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>The writ of error is granted and the matter is remanded with direction to vacate the order of sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b550-12\"> The plaintiff was not a party to the underlying case, <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Distasio, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Fairfield, Docket No. CV 970347509.
