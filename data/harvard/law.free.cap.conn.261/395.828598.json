The state claims that the Appellate Court improperly: (1) refused to incorporate the inquiry of <em>Lozada </em>v. <em>Deeds, </em>498 U.S. 430, 432, 111 S. Ct. 860, 112 L. Ed. 2d 956 (1991), into the abuse of discretion standard for review of denials of state requests for permission to appeal pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-96;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) dismissed the state\u2019s appeal. The state also requests that this court exercise its general supervisory power and review its claim that the trial court improperly concluded that the police lacked probable cause to arrest the defendant. We reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">The defendant, Joseph Alexander James, was charged with criminal attempt to possess four ounces or more of marijuana in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 2 la-279 (b),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> possession of four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>ounces or more of marijuana in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-279 (b), conspiracy to transport with intent to sell one kilogram or more of marijuana in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48 (a)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and 21a-278 (b),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> criminal attempt to possess with intent to sell one kilogram or more of marijuana in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49 (a) (2) and 21a-278 (b), and possession with intent to sell one kilogram or more of marijuana in violation of \u00a7 21a-278 (b). The trial court, <em>McMahon, J., </em>granted the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress his postarrest voluntary statement and evidence of a shipping receipt obtained in a search incident to his arrest on the grounds that the police lacked probable cause for the underlying arrest. This suppression led to a dismissal of the charges. Pursuant to \u00a7 54-96, the state requested permission to file an appeal. The trial court denied that motion. The state appealed to the Appellate Court from that denial, and sought to challenge on that appeal the granting of the motion to suppress. The Appellate Court upheld the trial court\u2019s denial of permission to appeal, and did not reach the substantive merits of the case because it had dismissed the state\u2019s appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>64 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>App. 495, 501, 779 A.2d 1288 (2001). This certified appeal followed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant for the resolution of the state\u2019s claims in this appeal. After a \u201ccontrolled delivery\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of a package containing marijuana by an undercover police detective to the defendant\u2019s workplace in West Hartford, the defendant was arrested for attempted possession of four ounces or more of marijuana, possession of four ounces or more of marijuana, conspiracy to transport with intent to sell one kilogram or more of marijuana, attempt to possess with intent to sell one kilogram or more of marijuana, and possession with intent to sell one kilogram or more of marijuana. Thereafter, the defendant moved to suppress, as involuntary, certain written statements that he had made.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The trial court denied that motion. The defendant then moved to dismiss the charges on the basis that the police lacked probable cause to arrest him. An evidentiary hearing was held on that motion, at which the defendant made an oral motion to suppress certain other evidence, consisting of his written confession and a Federal Express shipping receipt discovered on the defendant in a search incident to his arrest. The trial court granted that motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>to suppress, concluding that the police lacked probable cause to arrest the defendant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The state moved in the trial court for reconsideration of its suppression decision on the basis that the subsequently obtained evidence was sufficiently attenuated from the arrest to be admissible, even if the arrest was considered to have been illegal. The state also moved for written articulation of the trial court\u2019s decision on the motion to suppress. In addressing these motions, the trial court orally articulated its position with regard to probable cause and stated that the evidence seized was not sufficiently attenuated from the illegal arrest to be admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Subsequent to this articulation, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for dismissal of all charges. The trial court also stated that, with respect to the probable cause determination, \u201c[t]he sole issue\u201d that it had to decide was what had actually transpired during the course of the arrest. The court explained that, based upon its own knowledge and experience, probable cause did not exist on the facts of this case and that, therefore, the \u201cevidence seized and the statements made by the defendant [were] fruit of the poisonous tree and tainted by the illegal arrest.\u201d After the case was dismissed, the state immediately moved for permission to appeal pursuant to \u00a7 54-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">The trial court refused to grant the state permission to appeal, citing <em>State </em>v. <em>McMillan, </em>51 Conn. App. 676, 725 A.2d 342, cert. denied, 248 Conn. 911, 732 A.2d 179 (1999), for the applicable abuse of discretion standard of review under \u00a7 54-96. The trial court stated that, pursuant to <em>McMillan, </em>the only question it had to ask <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>itself in denying the state permission to appeal was, \u201cDid I abuse my discretion?\u201d The trial court answered: \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d and explained that an appeal was unnecessary because its probable cause determination was based on \u201ca full evidentiary hearing\u201d with witnesses, arguments, and motions for articulation and reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">The state appealed from the trial court\u2019s denial of permission to the Appellate Court. <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>supra, 64 Conn. App. 495. The state claimed that a trial court\u2019s denial of the state\u2019s request for permission to appeal is subject to the inquiry of <em>Lozada </em>v. <em>Deeds, </em>supra, 498 U.S. 432, as is the denial of certification of a petition to appeal from the denial of a petition for a new trial, <em>Seebeck </em>v. <em>State, </em>246 Conn. 514, 534, 717 A.2d 1161 (1998), and the denial of a petition for certification to appeal from the dismissal of a habeas corpus petition, <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>230 Conn. 608, 616, 646 A.2d 126 (1994). See <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>supra, 498-99. The state argued that denial of permission for its appeal \u201cconstitutes an abuse of discretion if the state demonstrates that another court could resolve the issue in a different manner.\u201d Id., 498. The Appellate Court rejected the state\u2019s claims and held that the trial court did not engage in \u201csuch clear, arbitrary and extreme abuse of discretion that we can conclude that an injustice appears to have been done.\u201d Id., 500. It then dismissed the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, noting that the trial court\u2019s grant of permission to appeal under \u00a7 54-96 is a jurisdictional prerequisite. Id., 501. This certified appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">We first consider whether the Appellate Court improperly refused to incorporate the three factor inquiry articulated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Lozada </em>v. <em>Deeds, </em>supra, 498 U.S. 432, into the abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>of discretion standard that governs our review of a trial court\u2019s decision to deny the state permission to appeal pursuant to \u00a7 54-96. The defendant argues that the <em>Lozada </em>inquiry is applicable only where a criminal defendant\u2019s federal right is at issue. The defendant also argues that application of the <em>Lozada </em>inquiry would \u201cdiminish to a virtual nullity\u201d the trial court\u2019s discretion in the \u00a7 54-96 context. We agree with the state and conclude that the Appellate Court improperly failed to adopt the three factor inquiry of <em>Lozada </em>v. <em>Deeds, </em>supra, 432. For the reasons discussed herein, we hold that a trial court has abused its discretion in denying permission to appeal under \u00a7 54-96 if the state demonstrates that: (1) \u201cthe issues are debatable among jurists of reason\u201d; (2) \u201ca court could resolve the issues [in a different manner]\u201d; or (3) the questions are \u201cadequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">It is well established that trial court denials of permission for state\u2019s appeals under \u00a7 54-96 are subject to review for \u201cclear and extreme\u201d abuse of discretion. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Bergin, </em>214 Conn. 657, 660-61, 574 A.2d 164 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>S &amp; R Sanitation Services, Inc., </em>202 Conn. 300, 308, 521 A.2d 1017 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>174 Conn. 100, 109-11, 384 A.2d 315 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous, </em>55 Conn. App. 250, 252-53, 739 A.2d 298 (1999). Although the abuse of discretion standard is highly deferential to the trial court, when denial of permission to appeal under \u00a7 54-96 presents a \u201cmanifest abuse . . . where injustice appears to have been done,\u201d the \u201cstatute\u2019s condition requiring the [trial] court\u2019s permission to appeal cannot serve to insulate a trial court from review by this court . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>supra, 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">A trial court\u2019s discretion under \u00a7 54-96 is certainly not unfettered. Even when a trial court\u2019s decision deny<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>ing the state permission to appeal questions of law under \u00a7 54-96 is based upon \u201cconsidered reasons,\u201d the deferential standard of review will not insulate the decision from appellate review if the decision is rooted in incorrect legal principles. For example, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Bergin, </em>supra, 214 Conn. 661, we held that, even where a trial court issued a four page memorandum of decision on issues briefed by the parties, it nonetheless had abused its discretion in denying the state permission to appeal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Bergin, </em>which is similar to the present case, also involved a probable cause determination by the trial court. Id., 661-62. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Bergin, </em>supra, 661, we referred to probable cause as an issue of law that we \u201c[often review],\u201d despite the trial court\u2019s mislabeling of what are, \u201cunder the governing precedents, appeal-able legal issues\u201d as \u201cfactual determinations . . . .\u201d Id., 662; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>255 Conn. 268, 279, 764 A.2d 1251 (2001). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Bergin, </em>supra, 662-63, we noted: \u201cConfidence in our judicial system would be severely eroded if the trial court had the authority to dismiss charges against this defendant before trial on an unsound premise, and could then insulate its decision from appellate review.\u201d* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Despite the otherwise deferential standard of review, where issues of law are involved, it is absolutely imperative that \u201cthe trial judge recognized his [or her] obligation \u2018to play fair with the system.\u2019\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>S &amp; R Sanitation Services, Inc., </em>supra, 202 Conn. 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The <em>Lozada </em>inquiry was established in order to determine whether a petitioner has made the requisite \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a federal right\u201d for the issuance of the required certificate of probable cause to appeal the denial of federal habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253, and <em>Barefoot </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em>463 U.S. 880, 893, 103 S. Ct. 3383, 77 L. Ed. 2d 1090 (1983). <em>Lozada </em>v. <em>Deeds, </em>supra, 498 U.S. 432. In <em>Lozada, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the required \u201csubstantial showing\u201d was made if the petitioner \u201cdemonstrate [s] that the issues are debatable among jurists of reason; that a court could resolve the issues [in a different manner]; or that the questions are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. In the federal courts, the probable cause certificate serves the same policy goal as the granting of permission or certification to appeal does in Connecticut, namely, to screen out frivolous appeals while still protecting the litigants\u2019 statutory right<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> to appellate review of adverse determinations. See, e.g., <em>Barefoot </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em>supra, 892-93; <em>Seebeck </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 246 Conn. 533; <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 616. The <em>Lozada </em>inquiry already provides us with well marked guideposts for the exercise of trial court discretion in two other areas of appeals requiring permission or certification to appeal. See, e.g., <em>Seebeck </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number><em>State, </em>supra, 534 (denial <em>of </em>permission to appeal denial of petition for new trial); <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 615-16 (denial of certification to appeal denial of writ of habeas corpus).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">In <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 615, we held that the abuse of discretion standard governing the review of denials of permission for state\u2019s appeals under \u00a7 54-96 was also applicable to denials of petitioners\u2019 timely requests for certification to appeal adverse habeas corpus determinations pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-470 (b).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We stated, however, that, in the habeas corpus context, the abuse of discretion standard required \u201camplification . . . .\u201d Id. Accordingly, we held in <em>Simms </em>that \u201cin an appeal under \u00a7 52-470 (b), a petitioner will establish a clear abuse of discretion in the denial of a timely request for certification to appeal if he can demonstrate the existence of one of the <em>Lozada </em>criteria . . . .\u201d Id., 616. Considering the legislature\u2019s intent to discourage frivolous appeals via the enactment of \u00a7 52-470, we concluded that \u201c[a] habeas appeal that satisfies one of the <em>Lozada </em>criteria is not frivolous.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">We further expanded the application of the <em>Lozada </em>inquiry to denials of petitions for certification to appeal the denial, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-95 (a),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> of a request for a new trial in <em>Seebeck </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 246 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>Conn. 533-34. In <em>Seebeck, </em>we first noted the \u201cvirtually identical\u201d statutory language and policy basis of discouraging frivolous appeals that underlie both \u00a7\u00a7 54-95 (a) and 52-470, the statute at issue in <em>Simms. </em>Id., 534. We then concluded that \u201ca petitioner can establish a clear abuse of discretion in a trial court\u2019s denial, pursuant to \u00a7 54-95 (a), of a timely request for certification to appeal a denial of a petition for a new trial by establishing one of the three <em>Lozada </em>criteria.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">The defendant argues that the Appellate Court properly concluded that the <em>Lozada </em>inquiry is inapplicable to denials of state requests for permission to appeal. First, the defendant claims that <em>Lozada </em>is applicable only to situations where a <em>criminal defendant </em>is asserting <em>&amp; federal right. </em>Alternatively, the defendant argues that incorporation of the <em>Lozada </em>inquiry into the abuse of discretion standard would eviscerate, by \u201cdiminish[ing] to a virtual nullity,\u201d the trial court\u2019s discretion in determining whether to grant the state permission to appeal. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">First, we have already effectively applied the <em>Lozada </em>inquiry in the habeas corpus context, where parties other than criminal defendants or habeas petitioners have petitioned for certification to appeal. Section 52-470 (b), the habeas corpus statute at issue in <em>Simms, </em>uses the neutral term \u201cappellant\u201d to designate the party who must seek court certification for an appeal. This is illustrated in <em>Rivera </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>254 Conn. 214, 217, 756 A.2d 1264 (2000), wherein the habeas petitioner brought a petition alleging that he improperly had been denied good time credit. The trial court agreed with the petitioner and awarded him good time credit. Id., 220. The trial court then denied the commissioner of correction\u2019s petition for certification to appeal pursuant to \u00a7 52-470 (b). Id. The commissioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>appealed from the denial to the Appellate Court, which dismissed the appeal, holding that none of the <em>Lozada </em>criteria had been met and that, therefore, \u201cthe [habeas] court did not abuse its discretion in denying the [commissioner\u2019s] certification to appeal.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 224. On appeal from that determination, we reversed the Appellate Court, holding that the habeas court did in fact abuse its discretion in denying permission to appeal because the commissioner had raised a \u201ccolorable claim\u201d sufficient to satisfy the <em>Lozada </em>inquiry.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Id., 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Similarly, in <em>Copas </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>234 Conn. 139, 149, 662 A.2d 718 (1995), the habeas court held that the petitioner had received ineffective assistance of counsel at the time of his guilty plea. The habeas court then denied the commissioner\u2019s petition for certification pursuant to \u00a7 52-470 (b) for an appeal to the Appellate Court. Id., 149-50. Reviewing the denial of certification, we held that the habeas court had abused its discretion in denying the petition for certification because it was unclear if the habeas court had applied the proper prejudice standard of <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Lock-hart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59, 106 S. Ct. 366, 88 L. Ed. 2d 203 (1985),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> to the habeas petitioner\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at the time of his guilty plea. <em>Copas </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 151. Our prior decisions in the habeas corpus context indicate that the <em>Lozada </em>criteria, as a screening procedure for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>determining whether an appeal is frivolous, apply equally, neutrally and effectively to <em>any </em>prospective appellant. Accordingly, we reject the defendant\u2019s argument that the <em>Lozada </em>inquiry is applicable only to review of situations where a criminal defendant is asserting a federal right.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The defendant also argues that application of the <em>Lozada </em>inquiry in the context of \u00a7 54-96 will \u201cdiminish to a virtual nullity\u201d the trial court\u2019s discretion in determining whether to grant the state permission to appeal.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We disagree. The <em>Lozada </em>inquiry provides the same clear and intelligible standards for trial courts exercising their gatekeeping discretion under \u00a7 54-96 as it does in the contexts of certifying appeals in habeas corpus and petitions for new trials. Without clearly defined criteria for determining whether a prospective appeal is frivolous, trial courts exercising \u00a7 54-96 discretion might consider themselves confined to the same circular and self-answering inquiry that the trial court undertook in this case.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Discretionary decision-making without the benefit of clearly defined guideposts, such as those set forth in <em>Lozada, </em>is predisposed to be arbitrary. See <em>State </em>v. <em>S &amp; R Sanitation Services, Inc., </em>supra, 202 Conn. 312, quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed. 1979) (\u201c \u2018[arbitrary\u2019 means \u2018[w]ithout adequate determining principle . . . not governed by any fixed rules or standard\u2019 \u201d). In a highly regarded and often <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>cited law review article criticizing the \u201cabracadabra\u201d inherent in the terms \u201c \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 \u201d or \u201c \u2018discretion,\u2019 \u201d the late scholar Maurice Rosenberg noted that \u201c[i]n the past [appellate court] opinions have fallen far short of satisfactorily defining or refining the concept of abuse of discretion. This need not be true if the appellate courts will bring themselves to appreciate the need for guidelines.\u201d M. Rosenberg, \u201cJudicial Discretion of the Trial Court, Viewed from Above,\u201d 22 Syracuse L. Rev. 635, 667 (1971).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Accordingly, we disagree with the defendant\u2019s arguments because the <em>Lozada </em>inquiry provides an appropriate analytic framework, consistent with the remainder of our permissive appeal jurisprudence, to guide the exercise of trial court discretion in cases involving \u00a7 54-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">In light of our conclusion that the <em>Lozada </em>inquiry does apply to a denial of a request for permission to appeal pursuant to \u00a7 54-96, we conclude that the Appellate Court improperly dismissed the state\u2019s appeal. Probable cause issues, like those presented in this case, are questions of law; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>257 Conn. 216, 223, 777 A.2d 182 (2001); that may satisfy either of the first two factors delineated in the <em>Lozada </em>inquiry we have adopted herein. We have noted: \u201cProbable cause is not readily, or even usefully, reduced to a neat set of legal rules. . . . Reasonable minds may disagree as to whether a particular [set of facts] establishes probable cause.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Eady, </em>249 Conn. 431, 440, 733 A.2d 112, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1030, 120 S. Ct. 551, 145 L. Ed. 2d 428 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>(1999). As the defendant conceded at oral argument before this court, the very nature of the probable cause issues presented in this case make them \u201cdebatable among jurists of reason\u201d or subject to resolution in a different manner. (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lozada </em>v. <em>Deeds, </em>supra, 498 U.S. 432. This is such a case. We conclude that, therefore, the Appellate Court improperly dismissed the appeal because, under the <em>Lozada </em>inquiry, the trial court abused its discretion in denying the state permission to appeal the adverse probable cause determination under \u00a7 54-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">The state also has requested that this court reach, \u201cin the interest of judicial economy,\u201d the substantive question of whether probable cause existed in the present case. In its dismissal of the state\u2019s appeal, the Appellate Court concluded that it did not have the subject matter jurisdiction to reach the merits of the underlying probable cause issue. <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>supra, 64 Conn. App. 500-501. We now grant the state\u2019s request and will invoke our supervisory powers, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 60-2,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> in order to reach the probable cause issue. For reasons discussed herein, we hold that the trial court improperly concluded that, as a matter of law, there was no probable cause to arrest the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">As a threshold matter, we must first determine whether the exercise of our supervisory powers pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>ant to Practice Book \u00a7 60-2 is appropriate in the present case. \u201cNormally, when we conclude that the Appellate Court has improperly failed to reach an issue concerning a decision by tibe trial court, we remand the case to that court for consideration of the merits of that issue. Under our supervisory powers over proceedings on appeal, however, this court also has the authority to address the subject of the trial court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Ahneman </em>v. <em>Ahneman, </em>243 Conn. 471, 481, 706 A.2d 960 (1998); see also <em>Matza </em>v. <em>Malza, </em>226 Conn. 166, 189, 627 A.2d 414 (1993) (invoking supervisory power where \u201cAppellate Court should have considered the claim\u201d). Furthermore, even if the actual subject of the trial court\u2019s decision is not an issue originally certified for appeal to this court, the exercise of our supervisory authority to address it is appropriate when the record is adequate to allow review of the merits and the parties have briefed the issues. <em>Ahneman </em>v. <em>Ahneman, </em>supra, 482; see also <em>West Hartford Interfaith Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Town Council, </em>228 Conn. 498, 507, 636 A.2d 1342 (1994) (reviewing unpreserved claim under general supervisory and control power \u201c[i]n view of the adequate record . . . and the significance of the issue to . . . the parties\u201d). Invocation of our supervisory powers where appropriate also carries the benefit of \u201cavoid[ing] the necessity of inordinate further delay . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ahneman </em>v. <em>Ahneman, </em>supra, 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">In the present case, the record is adequate for our review of the trial court\u2019s probable cause determination. The record includes more than 140 pages of transcripts of three witnesses\u2019 testimony and counsel\u2019s argument from the evidentiary hearings held on June 8,1999, and July 13 and 14,1999. The record also includes sufficient findings of fact by the trial court. Furthermore, both the state and the defendant have thoroughly briefed the probable cause issue for our consideration. We con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>elude, therefore, that the exercise of our supervisory power in the interest of judicial economy is appropriate in this case, and we now turn to the merits of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">The following additional facts are necessary for the resolution of this appeal. On June 5, 1997, Federal Express informed the West Hartford police that their drug-sniffing dogs had detected marijuana in two boxes addressed to the Har-Conn Chrome Company (HarConn) in West Hartford. With the Federal Express manager present, the West Hartford police officers unsealed the boxes at the Federal Express office in East Hartford and found a blue Igloo cooler in each box. The two large Igloo coolers contained approximately forty-eight pounds of marijuana between them.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The detectives removed much of the marijuana from one of the boxes and replaced it with sand and other weights before defivering the package to Har-Conn.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">On June 6, 1997, the West Hartford police delivered the box to Har-Conn, with Detective Paul Melanson acting in an undercover role as a Federal Express driver. The other police officers surrounded the perimeter of Har-Conn\u2019s premises and monitored Melanson\u2019s activities via a \u201cbody wire\u201d that he wore. The delivery did not take place during the usual morning delivery time for Federal Express packages. Upon his arrival at HarConn, Melanson delivered the package to John Chen, whom Melanson understood from a prior briefing with the actual Federal Express driver to be the person who normally received all Har-Conn packages. After Chen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>signed the Federal Express paperwork for the box, Melanson remained on the Har-Conn premises by asking to use the bathroom. He then saw Chen open the box, look inside, and remark to a coworker that this was \u201cJoe\u2019s package . . . .\u201d Chen then paged \u201cJoe\u201d via the building\u2019s public address system.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Melanson attempted to stay in the area and watch. In order to avoid suspicion, he walked out of the building and reentered the shipping area a short time later through another door. When he returned to the shipping area, the package was no longer there. In order to track the location of the package, Melanson told Chen that he had signed the form in the incorrect location and that Melanson needed the package back in order to correct the paperwork. At that point, the defendant entered the receiving area. Chen pointed to the defendant and told Melanson that the package belonged to the defendant. Chen then told the defendant to ask Melanson about the location of a second package. When the defendant asked Melanson about a second package, Melanson replied that there was only one package to deliver. The defendant then turned around, exited the building, and walked down the driveway. When the defendant left the Har-Conn building and walked down the driveway, he was carrying two lawnmower blades.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Melanson then used his body wire to contact Lieutenant Carl Rosensweig, the detective in charge of the investigation. In this communication, Melanson described the defendant in detail, informed Rosensweig that the defendant had received the package, and stated that the defendant was carrying a metal object. Rosensweig then observed the defendant walking quickly down Har-Conn\u2019s driveway toward his vehicle. Rosensweig and another detective then approached the defendant, ordered him to the ground at gunpoint, handcuffed him, and patted him down to check for weapons. This initial patdown yielded the lawnmower blade that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>defendant was carrying and a subsequent body search incident to the arrest yielded a Federal Express shipping receipt.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">After the police officers had arrested the defendant, Melanson returned to question Chen about the location of the box itself. Chen stated that \u201cJoe\u201d had taken the box around the comer inside the Har-Conn building. After Rosensweig obtained consent to search the building from William Livingston, Har-Conn\u2019s vice president, the police officers found the package in a room around the comer from the shipping area where it had been initially received.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">In the present case, the admissibility of the evidence at issue depends on whether the underlying warrantless felony arrest was sufficiently grounded in probable cause.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> \u201cAs a threshold matter, we set forth the appropriate standard pursuant to which we review a challenge to a trial court\u2019s granting of a suppression motion. This involves a two part function: where the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts set out in the memorandum of decision .... Where . . . the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>court has drawn conclusions of law, our review is plenary, and we must decide whether those conclusions are legally and logically correct in light of the findings of fact.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 222, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Velasco, </em>248 Conn. 183, 188-89, 728 A.2d 493 (1999). Accordingly, we will engage in plenary review of the trial court\u2019s legal conclusion that probable cause to arrest the defendant did not exist on the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>supra, 255 Conn. 291-93, we reviewed the well established legal principles governing probable cause in the context of warrantless felony arrests. \u201cIn order for a warrantless felony arrest to be valid, it must be supported by probable cause. . . . The determination of whether probable cause exists under the fourth amendment to the federal constitution, and under article first, \u00a7 7, of our state constitution, is made pursuant to a totality of circumstances test. . . . Probable cause exists when the facts and circumstances within the knowledge of the officer and of which he has reasonably trustworthy information are sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution to believe that a felony has been committed. . . . The probable cause test then is an objective one. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">\u201cWe consistently have held that [t]he quantum of evidence necessary to establish probable cause exceeds mere suspicion, but is substantially less than that required for conviction. . . . The existence of probable cause does not turn on whether the defendant could have been convicted on the same available evidence. . . . [P]roof of probable cause requires less than proof by a preponderance of the evidence. . . . Probable cause, broadly defined, comprises such facts as would reasonably persuade an impartial and reasonable mind not merely to suspect or conjecture, but to believe that criminal activity has occurred. . . . The probable cause determination is, simply, an analysis of probabili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>ties. . . . The determination is not a technical one, but is informed by the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent [persons], not legal technicians, act. . . . Probable cause is not readily, or even usefully, reduced to a neat set of legal rules. . . . Reasonable minds may disagree as to whether a particular [set of facts] establishes probable cause.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Under the totality of the circumstances in the present case, we conclude that probable cause for the defendant\u2019s arrest did exist. Given the facts at hand, a sufficient nexus clearly existed between the defendant and both of the marijuana packages at issue to establish probable cause to arrest. Moreover, in determining whether probable cause existed to arrest the defendant, the trial court incorrectly focused on the police officers\u2019 actions with respect to investigating Chen\u2019s role in any potential criminal activity. The trial court also improperly treated Chen\u2019s statements with respect to the defendant as having originated from an informant and being subject to the analysis of <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>219 Conn. 529, 544, 594 A.2d 917 (1991), and <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 230-31, 103 S. Ct. 2317, 76 L. Ed. 2d 527 (1983). We conclude that these largely irrelevant concerns about Chen inappropriately undermined the analysis of the probabilities that should have reasonably persuaded an impartial mind that sufficient probable cause existed to arrest the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Bearing in mind that our inquiry is limited to what the police knew <em>before </em>the arrest; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Trine, </em>236 Conn. 216, 236-37, 673 A.2d 1098 (1996); we conclude that a sufficient nexus existed between the defendant and the controlled packages at issue to establish probable cause for his arrest. First, Melanson observed Chen, the usual recipient of packages at HarConn, open the delivered package, look inside, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>remark to a coworker that this was \u201cJoe\u2019s package . . . .\u201d Chen then called for \u201cJoe\u201d over the building\u2019s public address system. After Melanson, who still appeared to be a Federal Express driver, stalled for time by pretending that the package needed to be signed for again, the defendant entered the shipping area. When Melanson asked about the package, Chen told him that the package belonged to the defendant. Albeit at Chen\u2019s suggestion, the defendant asked Melanson about the location of a <em>second </em>package\u2014a particularly probative question given that Federal Express had intercepted and turned over <em>two </em>packages to the police, while only <em>one </em>was delivered. The entire interaction between Chen, the defendant, and Melanson could persuade \u201can impartial and reasonable mind . . . that criminal activity ha[d] occurred.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>supra, 255 Conn. 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">The trial court also improperly focused on Chen\u2019s culpability and the need to eliminate him as a suspect before determining that sufficient probable cause existed to justify the defendant\u2019s arrest. The trial court referred to Chen\u2019s receiving responsibilities and stated: \u201cI think a reasonably prudent person would think that the number one suspect would be the person who ordinarily receives this package, unless other evidence is shown.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> It is unnecessary and improper for aprobable cause inquiry to focus on anyone besides the particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number><em>defendant </em>at issue in the case. It is well established that \u201c[p]robable cause to arrest exists if (1) there is probable cause to believe a crime has been committed; and (2) there is probable cause to believe <em>that the person to be arrested committed that crime.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. Trine, supra, 236 Conn. 236; see also, e.g., <em>Golino </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>950 F.2d 864, 870 (2d Cir. 1991). Although Chen\u2019s level of involvement with the package may be potentially relevant for the purposes of determining the defendant\u2019s guilt at <em>trial,</em><footnotemark><em>26</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it was immaterial for determining probable cause at the time of arrest; accordingly, further investigation was not required into Chen\u2019s role before arresting the defendant. Therefore, any intimation by the trial court that the police should have engaged in further investigation into Chen before arresting the defendant was legally incorrect. Even if Chen truly was the \u201cnumber one suspect,\u201d that did not negate the ample probable cause that existed to justify the defendant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">The trial court also improperly made reference to Chen as an informant. Specifically, the trial court stated: \u201cSo the two factors that the police have to base anything in reference to this defendant is Mr. Chen, who there\u2019s no indicia of reliability, who is even a suspect even after the arrest, by the police own admission, saying it\u2019s Joe\u2019s. The only admission on the part of the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>dant that I let in in the prior motion to suppress was, Where\u2019s the second package? Which is almost repeating verbatim what Mr. Chen says.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Chen\u2019s reliability was irrelevant to the probable cause determination in the present case because he was not acting as an informant when he spoke to Melanson, who was undercover as a Federal Express driver at the time of their interaction. Although reliability is a factor to be considered when determining whether an informant\u2019s statements give rise to probable cause; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>supra, 219 Conn. 544;<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> it was not at issue here. Chen was not acting as an informant giving information to the police; he was acting as a shipping and receiving clerk directing a Federal Express driver to the recipient of a delivered package. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mordowanec, </em>259 Conn. 94, 112, 788 A.2d 48, cert. denied, 536 U.S. 910, 122 S. Ct. 2369, 153 L. Ed. 2d 189 (2002), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>supra, 542 n.10 (describing and distinguishing informants from other sources of information for police); see also Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990) (defining \u201cinformer\u201d as \u201c[a]n undisclosed person who confidentially discloses material information of a law violation, thereby supplying a lead to officers for their investigation of a crime\u201d). Accordingly, because Chen was not acting as an informant providing a tip to a police officer, his reliability bore no relevance to the probable cause inquiry at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">On the quantum of the facts at hand, there were sufficient facts to persuade a reasonably prudent and impartial mind that the defendant was involved in the criminal activity that occurred. We conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>trial court improperly determined that the police lacked probable cause to arrest the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment of dismissal, and to remand the case to the trial court with direction to deny the motion to suppress and for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b419-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-96 provides: \u201cAppeals from the rulings and decisions of the Superior Court,, upon all questions of law arising on the trial of criminal cases, may be taken by the state, with the permission of the presiding judge, to the Supreme Court or to the Appellate Court, in the same manner and to the same effect as if made by the accused.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b419-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-49 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cA person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting with the kind of mental state required for commission of the crime, he . . .

They will then arrest the recipient, if the delivery circumstances so warrant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b436-8\"> It should be noted that the police officers never saw the defendant in possession of the box and lacked actual awareness of his proximity to the Federal Express package.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b436-9\"> At issue here is whether the Federal Express shipping receipt and the defendant\u2019s postarrest voluntary statement were lawfully obtained.

It, in fact, would be the receiving clerk that would initially exercise control and dominion over that package. . . . We get to that point. Then the officer overhears Mr. Chen, suspect number one, say this is Joe\u2019s package. He pages a Joe. Some time shortly thereafter, after the officer leaves and comes back, the defendant enters. ... I accept it as a fact for the purposes of my finding, Mr. Chen indicates it\u2019s Joe\u2019s package.
