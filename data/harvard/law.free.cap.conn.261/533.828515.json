The trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict, sentencing the petitioner to a total effective term of twenty years imprisonment. The petitioner appealed to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the judgment of conviction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>48 Conn. App. 19, 32, 708 A.2d 969, cert. denied, 245 Conn. 901, 719 A.2d 1164 (1998). Thereafter, the petitioner filed a petition for a new trial pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-270,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> alleging the existence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>newly discovered evidence of juror bias. After an evidentiary hearing, the trial court, on May 9, 2000, rendered judgment denying the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">On May 25, 2000, the petitioner appealed from the judgment denying the petition for a new trial to the Appellate Court without first seeking certification to appeal pursuant to \u00a7 54-95 (a).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On April 5, 2001, the state moved to dismiss the petitioner\u2019s appeal,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> claiming that the Appellate Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the petitioner had failed to seek certification to appeal in accordance with \u00a7 54-95 (a). The Appellate Court granted the state\u2019s motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We then granted the petitioner\u2019s petition for certification to appeal from the order of the Appellate Court dismissing the petitioner\u2019s appeal, limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly dismiss the [petitioner\u2019s] appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based on the [petitioner\u2019s] failure to seek certification to appeal pursuant to ... \u00a7 54-95 (a)?\u201d <em>Santiago </em>v. <em>State, </em>258 Conn. 906, 782 A.2d 139 (2001). Although we conclude that the petitioner\u2019s failure to seek certification to appeal pursuant to \u00a7 54-95 (a) does not constitute a jurisdictional bar to the petitioner\u2019s appeal from the judgment of the trial court denying his petition for a new trial, we nevertheless determine that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>he is not entitled to appellate review of the trial court\u2019s judgment until he has satisfied the certification requirement of \u00a7 54-95 (a). Accordingly, we affirm the order of the Appellate Court dismissing the petitioner\u2019s appeal, albeit on different grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The state and the petitioner assert diametrically opposed positions on the issue of whether compliance with the certification requirement of \u00a7 54-95 (a) constitutes a jurisdictional prerequisite to an appeal from the denial of a petition for a new trial. The state claims that compliance with the certification requirement of \u00a7 54-95 (a) is a jurisdictional prerequisite whereas the petitioner claims that it is not. We conclude that that issue\u2014and therefore the present case\u2014is controlled by our recent decision in <em>Seebeck </em>v. <em>State, </em>246 Conn. 514, 517, 533, 717 A.2d 1161 (1998), in which we held that a trial court\u2019s denial of a request, made pursuant to \u00a7 54-95 (a), for certification to appeal is not a jurisdictional bar to an appeal from the denial of a petition for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">In <em>Seebeck, </em>the petitioner, Erich Seebeck, had filed a petition for a new trial that was denied by the trial court. Id., 526. In accordance with \u00a7 54-95 (a), Seebeck sought permission from the trial court to appeal that court\u2019s denial of his petition for a new trial. Id. The trial court, however, denied Seebeck\u2019s request for certification to appeal. Id. Notwithstanding the trial court\u2019s denial of certification, Seebeck appealed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Id., 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">The state claimed that Seebeck\u2019s appeal should have been dismissed on the ground that the trial court\u2019s denial of certification deprived this court of subject matter jurisdiction over the appeal. See id., 527. In claiming that this court had subject matter jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>to entertain his appeal notwithstanding the trial court\u2019s denial of certification; id., 526-27; Seebeck cited our decision in <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>229 Conn. 178, 187-89, 640 A.2d 601 (1994) <em>(Simms I), </em>in which we examined General Statutes \u00a7 52-470 (b),<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> which governs appeals from the denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Section 52-470 (b), in language similar to that found in \u00a7 54-95 (a), requires a habeas petitioner to seek and obtain certification to appeal from an adverse judgment of the habeas court. In <em>Simms I, </em>we construed \u00a7 52-470 (b) to allow a habeas petitioner to obtain appellate review of the denial of a request for certification to appeal from the judgment of the habeas court denying the habeas petition. <em>Simms I, </em>supra, 189; see also <em>Simms </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>230 Conn. 608, 609, 646 A.2d 126 (1994) <em>(Simms II).</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Simms II, </em>we concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>\u201cthe legislature intended the certification requirement [of \u00a7 52-470 (b)[ ... to define the scope of our review and not to limit the jurisdiction of the appellate tribunal.\u201d <em>Simms II, </em>supra, 615. In light of the similarity of the language, purpose and history of \u00a7\u00a7 52-470 (b) and 54-95 (a), we concluded in <em>Seebeck </em>that \u00a7 54-95 (a), like \u00a7 52-470 (b), does not erect a jurisdictional barrier to an appeal but, rather, defines the scope of appellate review. <em>Seebeck </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 246 Conn. 530-33. We also concluded in <em>Seebeck </em>that the standard of appellate review under \u00a7 54-95 (a) is the same as the standard of appellate review under \u00a7 52-470 (b), namely, whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying the petitioner\u2019s request for certification to appeal.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Id., 533-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The state seeks to distinguish <em>Seebeck </em>from the present case on the ground that, in the former case, Seebeck sought certification to appeal, pursuant to \u00a7 54-95 (a), from the trial court\u2019s judgment denying his petition for a new trial; id., 516, 526; whereas in the present case, the petitioner did not seek certification to appeal pursuant to \u00a7 54-95 (a). Although we do not minimize the significance of the petitioner\u2019s procedural default, we nevertheless axe not persuaded that it constitutes a jurisdictional bar to appellate review of the trial court\u2019s denial of his petition for a new trial. A contrary conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>sion would be inconsistent with our reasoning and holding in <em>Seebeck </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 246 Conn. 533, that \u00a7 54-OS (a) was not intended to limit the jurisdiction of the appellate tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Our conclusion that we have jurisdiction to entertain the petitioner\u2019s appeal, however, does not end our inquiry. As this court previously has stated, statutorily imposed conditions to appellate review must be satisfied in the absence of good reason for excusal. Cf., e.g., <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>257 Conn. 258, 269-70, 777 A.2d 645 (2001); <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Hillcrest Associates, </em>233 Conn. 153, 173, 659 A.2d 138 (1995). Accordingly, apart from the jurisdictional issue, we must determine whether the certification requirement of \u00a7 54-95 (a) is mandatory or directory.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">\u201cThe test to be applied in determining whether a statute is mandatory or directory is whether the prescribed mode of action is the essence of the thing to be accomplished, or in other words, whether it relates to a matter of substance or a matter of convenience. ... If it is a matter of substance, the statutory provision is mandatory. If, however, the legislative provision is designed to secure order, system and dispatch in the proceedings, it is generally held to be directory, especially where the requirement is stated in affirmative terms unaccompanied by negative words.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Tunxis Service Center, </em>237 Conn. 71, 77, 676 A.2d 819 (1996); accord <em>Katz </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue Services, </em>234 Conn. 614, 617, 662 A.2d 762 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">We conclude that the certification requirement of \u00a7 54-95 (a) is mandatory. First, the statutory language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>is cast in negative terms. \u201cThe legislature, rather than phrasing the [certification requirement] in affirmative terms unaccompanied by negative words, as is often done with directory provisions; see, e.g., <em>Winslow </em>v. <em>Zoning Board, </em>143 Conn. 381, 387-88, 122 A.2d 789 (1956) (statutory provision that \u2018petition shall be scheduled for at least one public hearing to be held within sixty days\u2019 held directory because time limitation stated in affirmative terms); instead chose . . . negative phrasing . . . .\u201d <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Tunxis Service Center, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 78. Specifically, General Statutes \u00a7 54-95 (a) provides in relevant part that \u201c[w]o <em>appeal may be taken </em>from a judgment denying a petition for a new trial <em>unless . . </em>. the judge who heard the case or a judge of the Supreme Court or the Appellate Court . . . certifies that a question is involved in the decision which ought to be reviewed by the Supreme Court or the Appellate Court. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201cThe legislature\u2019s use of such negative terminology suggests that it intended [the certification requirement of \u00a7 54-95 (a)] to be mandatory.\u201d <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Tunxis Service Center, </em>supra, 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Second, as we explained in <em>Seebeck </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 246 Conn. 531, an important legislative policy objective of \u00a7 54-95 (a) is to discourage frivolous appeals.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The certification requirement of \u00a7 54-95 (a) is the means chosen by the legislature to accomplish that end. The fact that the certification requirement is integral to a fundamental purpose or objective of the statute strongly supports the conclusion that the certification requirement is mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Furthermore, a contrary conclusion would lead to an untenable result, namely, that a petitioner who ignores the certification requirement of \u00a7 54-95 (a) will be better off than a petitioner who complies with it. If a statutory provision is directory rather than mandatory, a party\u2019s noncompliance therewith will not invalidate any future proceedings contemplated by the statute unless the noncompliance has prejudiced the opposing party. See, e.g., <em>Metropolitan District Commission </em>v. <em>AFSCME, Council 4, Local 184, </em>237 Conn. 114, 122-23, 676 A.2d 825 (1996); <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Tunxis Service Center, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 77; <em>State </em>v. <em>Metz, </em>230 Conn. 400, 409, 645 A.2d 965 (1994). Consequently, if we were to conclude that the certification requirement of \u00a7 54-95 (a) is directory rather than mandatory, a petitioner whose petition for a new trial has been denied likely would be free to bypass the certification requirement of \u00a7 54-95 (a) with impunity because the state generally will be unable to show any prejudice arising from the petitioner\u2019s noncompliance. Such a result not only would thwart the purpose of \u00a7 54-95 (a), but also would encourage a petitioner to ignore the certification requirement to avoid the dual risk that certification will be denied and that the petitioner will be unable to demonstrate on appeal from denial of certification that the denial constituted an abuse of discretion. In other words, a petitioner who ignores the certification requirement nevertheless would be able to proceed directly to appellate review of the merits of the denial of his petition for a new trial, whereas the petitioner whose properly filed petition for certification is denied first must persuade the appellate tribunal, as a prerequisite to obtaining appellate review of the merits of his unsuccessful new trial petition, that the denial of his certification petition constituted an abuse of discretion. \u201cWe ordinarily read statutes with common sense and so as not to yield [such] bizarre results.\u201d <em>Southington </em>v. <em>Commercial Union Ins. Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>254 Conn. 348, 360, 757 A.2d 549 (2000). For these reasons, we conclude that the certification requirement of \u00a7 54-95 (a) is mandatory rather than directory.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The petitioner contends that the state has waived its right to seek dismissal of the petitioner\u2019s appeal because the state did not file its motion to dismiss until ten months and one week after the petitioner had filed his appeal. See Practice Book \u00a7 66-8.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We do not believe, however, that conventional notions of waiver and consent apply in circumstances in which, as in the present case, a petitioner has failed altogether to comply with the certification requirement of \u00a7 54-95 (a). Although we acknowledge that, typically, noncompliance with a mandatory statutory provision may be waived, either explicitly or implicitly, by the parties; e.g., <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Tunxis Service Center, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 80; <em>see Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Hillcrest Associates, </em>supra, 233 Conn. 173; those exceptions to the general rule requiring strict compliance with a mandatory statutory provision were created in recognition of the fact that a party may relinquish its right to demand strict adherence to a mandatory statutory provision by virtue of its own failure to enforce that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">As we previously have noted, however, the fundamental objective of the certification requirement of \u00a7 54-95 (a) is reducing frivolous appeals in criminal cases. See <em>Seebeck </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 246 Conn. 531 and n.10; see also footnote 15 of this opinion. This objective includes the goal of conserving judicial resources. In light of this statutory objective, it is apparent that the certification requirement of \u00a7 54-95 (a) serves important <em>public </em>and <em>institutional </em>policy objectives that are independent of, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>and perhaps even paramount to, the state\u2019s interest as a party to the litigation. Thus, the fact that the state allegedly had failed to file a timely motion to dismiss the petitioner\u2019s appeal is insufficient reason for this court to entertain that appeal when the petitioner has not sought certification to appeal. In other words, any purported waiver by the state of the certification requirement of \u00a7 54-95 (a) simply is not an adequate substitute for compliance with that requirement in light of the policy objectives of the statutory provision that embraces that requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">As we previously have acknowledged, \u201c[t]he opportunity for a new trial when new evidence comes to light provides a defendant [a] . . . critical procedural mechanism for remedying an injustice.\u201d <em>Seebeck </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 246 Conn. 531. We also have observed that the opportunity to appeal from the denial of a petition for a new trial has \u201crecognized value ... in remedying injustice . . . .\u201d Id., 533. On the basis of our conclusion in Seebeck; id.; and in the present case that the certification requirement of \u00a7 54-95 (a) is not subject matter jurisdictional, it necessarily follows that a petitioner who, like the petitioner in the present case, fails to comply with the ten day limitation period for seeking certification to appeal under \u00a7 54-95 (a) is not jurisdictionally barred from filing a request for certification to appeal after that ten day limitation period has run. Cf. <em>Iovieno </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>242 Conn. 689, 697, 699 A.2d 1003 (1997) (analogous ten day limitation period for seeking certification to appeal from denial of petition for writ of habeas corpus pursuant to \u00a7 52-470 [b] not subject matter jurisdictional). Nevertheless, we see no reason why an appellate tribunal should entertain an appeal from a denial of a petition for a new trial unless the petitioner first has sought certification to appeal pursuant to \u00a7 54-95 (a).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Accordingly, we will not entertain the petitioner\u2019s appeal on the merits of the trial court\u2019s denial of the petition for a new trial; the petitioner first must seek certification to appeal pursuant to \u00a7 54-95 (a). If his request for certification to appeal is denied, then he may seek appellate recourse in accordance with our holding in <em>Seebeck </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 246 Conn. 533.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">The order of the Appellate Court dismissing the petitioner\u2019s appeal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-95 (a) provides: \u201cAny defendant in a criminal prosecution, aggrieved by any decision of the Superior Court, upon the trial thereof, or by any error apparent upon the record of such prosecution, may be relieved by appeal, petition for a new trial or writ of error, in the same manner and with the same effect as in civil actions.

See id., 616.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b567-8\"> In <em>Seebeck, </em>we concluded, in accordance with the standards adopted by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Lozada </em>v. <em>Deeds, </em>498 U.S. 430, 431-32, 111 S. Ct. 860, 112 L. Ed. 2d 956 (1991), for the issuance of certificates of probable cause to appeal from a federal court\u2019s denial of habeas relief, that a petitioner satisfies his burden of establishing a court\u2019s abuse of discretion in denying a timely request under \u00a7 54-95 (a) for certification to appeal from the denial of a petition for a new trial, \u201cby demonstrating: [1] that the issues are debatable among jurists of reason; [2] that a court <em>could </em>resolve the issues [in a different manner]; or [3] that the questions are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Seebeck </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 246 Conn. 534, quoting <em>Simms II, </em>supra, 230 Conn. 616.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b568-9\"> We note that neither party addressed this issue but, rather, focused solely on whether, under the facts of the present case, compliance with \u00a7 54-95 (a) is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the petitioner\u2019s appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b569-7\"> We observed in <em>Seebeck </em>that Senator John H. Filer, one of the sponsors of the legislation that added the requirement of certification to \u00a7\u00a7 54-95 (a) and 52-470 (b), stated during the floor debate on the proposed legislation that the certification provisions were intended \u201cto reduce successive frivolous appeals in criminal cases [that] hasten ultimate justice.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Seebeck, </em>supra, 246 Conn. 531 n.10, quoting 7 S. Proc., Pt. 5, 1957 Sess., p. 2936.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b571-8\"> Practice Book \u00a7 66-8 provides in relevant part: \u201cAny claim that an appeal . . . should be dismissed . . . shall be made by a motion to dismiss the appeal .... Any such motion must be filed in accordance with Sections 66-2 and 66-3 within ten days after the filing of the appeal . . . provided that a motion based on lack of jurisdiction may be filed at any time. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b572-7\"> Of course, the decision of whether to entertain an untimely request for certification to appeal under \u00a7 54-95 (a) is within the sound discretion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>the court. See <em>Iovieno </em>v. <em>Commissioner of </em>Correction, supra, 242 Conn. 700 (decision of whether to entertain untimely petition, filed pursuant to \u00a7 52-470 [b], for certification to appeal from adverse judgment of habeas court \u201cleft to the sound discretion of the habeas court\u201d). In exercising that discretion, the court should consider the reasons for the delay. Id. On appeal, we employ an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of a petition for certification to appeal under \u00a7 54-95 (a) on grounds of untimeliness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b573-13\"> In the event that the petitioner does seek certification to appeal from the judgment of the trial court denying his petition for a new trial, that court will be required to decide whether to excuse the petitioner\u2019s delay in filing his petition for certification to appeal; see footnote 17 of this opinion; with due regard to the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, and any other relevant factors. In considering the length of the delay, the trial court should be mindful of the fact that most of that delay is attributable to the petitioner\u2019s efforts to seek direct appellate review from the judgment denying his petition for a new trial. Because the procedural avenue followed by the petitioner in the present case appears to have raised an issue of first impression in this state, we do not believe that the delay resulting from the appellate litigation of that issue should be weighed heavily, if at all, against the petitioner.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
