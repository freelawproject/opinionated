We conclude that the plaintiff was not so entitled and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">The plaintiff, the city of Torrington, appealed to the trial court from a decision by the named defendant, the zoning commission of the town of Harwinton (Harwinton commission), granting the application of the defendant Jerry Saglimbeni for a special permit and site plan approval for the construction of a residential community complex on property owned by the defendants Anthony D\u2019Andrea and Robert D\u2019Andrea (D\u2019Andreas). The trial court, <em>Wiese, J., </em>dismissed the plaintiffs appeal. Following a grant of certification to appeal by the Appellate Court, that court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. <em>Torrington </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>63 Conn. App. 776, 793, 778 A.2d 1027 (2001). Following our grant of certification to appeal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the plaintiff appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">The record establishes the following facts and procedural history. The property in question owned by the D\u2019Andreas consists of approximately 10.8 acres situated in the northwesterly comer of Harwinton, adjacent to that town\u2019s boundary with the plaintiff. The property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>has frontage on streets located in both municipalities, as well as public sewer service available from Harwinton and water service available from the plaintiff. In 1988, the D\u2019Andreas applied to the Harwinton commission to rezone the property from a town residential zone, which permitted single-family lots of no less than 65,000 square feet, to a planned multifamily zone, which permitted multifamily dwellings and condominiums, by special permit, on lots of five acres or more, and allowed for up to six dwellings per acre for lots served by public sewer and water, as was the D\u2019Andreas\u2019 property. Thus, under the planned multifamily zone, sixty units would be permissible on the property in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">On September 13, 1988, the Harwinton commission notified the Torrington planning and zoning commission (Torrington commission) of the proposed zone change, and the Torrington commission, on October 12, 1988, voted \u201cto notify the Town of Harwinton that [it] had no objection to the approval of this zone change by the Town of Harwinton.\u201d Subsequently, however, the D\u2019Andreas withdrew their Harwinton zone change application and applied, instead, to the Torrington commission for approval of a twenty-eight lot subdivision of their adjoining Torrington property.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">In August, 1989, the Torrington commission approved the D\u2019Andreas\u2019 subdivision application, known as Doolittle Heights Section III, including an extension of Torrington streets and public utilities to the Torrington-Harwinton town line and to the Harwinton property in question. As a condition of this approval, however, the D\u2019Andreas were required to record, and did record, a restrictive covenant on the property in question requiring the engineering department of Torrington to approve any public or private access from the Harwinton property in question to any Torrington public street.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">Shortly thereafter, on November 27, 1989, the D\u2019Andreas reapplied to the Harwinton commission to rezone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>the property in question from town residential to planned multifamily. The Harwinton commission denied that application, and the D\u2019Andreas appealed from that decision to the Superior Court. In the course of that appeal, the parties explored the possibility of a settlement. Because it was aware of the restrictive covenant, on September 11, 1990, the Harwinton commission inquired of the Torrington engineering department: \u201cTo help us in our deliberations, we would appreciate it if you could advise us as to the feasibility of gaining road access to the property from the Torrington side.\u201d The Torrington coloration counsel replied: \u201cAs an abutting property owner, the D\u2019Andreas have the right to access their Harwinton property on the existing Torrington road which abuts the property, i.e., Torcon Drive or any future road in the Doolittle Heights section which abuts their property. The only requirement would be that any access road, whether public or private, meet the City of Torrington Engineering Department specifications.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Meanwhile, the Harwinton commission had repealed the planned multifamily regulations, and had adopted more restrictive regulations, which are currently in effect, for a multifamily floating zone, known as the planned residential zone. That repeal and adoption obviously raised the stakes involved in the pending appeal: if the D\u2019Andreas were to prevail, arguably they would then be entitled to develop the property more intensively than the new regulations would permit; and if the Harwinton commission were to prevail, arguably the D\u2019Andreas would be more restricted in their development of the property than had been the case when they filed their application.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">The D\u2019Andreas and the Harwinton commission ultimately, in early 1991, proposed to settle the appeal by way of a stipulated judgment. This mutual decision was motivated by both parties\u2019 uncertainty as to the out<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>come of the appeal if left to resolution by the court. As part of the stipulated judgment, the D\u2019Andreas and the Harwinton commission agreed that.the D\u2019Andreas\u2019 application would be granted, subject to four conditions, each of which was preceded by the caveat, \u201c[notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary contained in the [zjoning [regulations . . . .\u201d Those four conditions were that: (1) the project would have a density of thirty-six units with two bedrooms each, limited to no more than four single-family units per structure; (2) the D\u2019Andreas would be permitted to file a single application for the entire thirty-six units, and the Harwinton commission \u201cagrees to permit the construction of 36 single family units\u201d on the property; (3) the Harwinton commission acknowledged that the property had adequate \u201cusable\u201d area, as that term was defined in \u00a7 4.7.4 (c) of the Harwinton zoning regulations, for thirty-six single-family units; and (4) the Harwinton commission acknowledged that the property had adequate road access through Torrington, Harwinton, or a combination of the two as determined by the Harwinton commission.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Thereafter, the court, <em>Susco, J., </em>held a hearing pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 (m)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and approved the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>stipulated judgment, including the four conditions previously described. Despite having had full notice of the D\u2019Andreas\u2019 Harwinton zone change application,* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> neither the plaintiff nor the Torrington commission sought either to intervene or to participate in the appeal or hearing approving the stipulated judgment. Indeed, thereafter, on September 23, 1991, the D\u2019Andreas secured approval from the Torrington engineering department for access to the Harwinton property from Torrington streets, as was required by the restrictive covenant that had been granted previously to the plaintiff in connection with the development of the D\u2019Andreas\u2019 Torrington property. This undisputed history brings us to the present proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">On April 27, 1998, more than seven years after the D\u2019Andreas and the Harwinton commission had entered into the stipulated judgment, the defendant Jerry Saglimbeni applied to the Harwinton commission for a special permit and site plan approval of a thirty-six unit residential condominium community on the property in question, submitting alternate site plans. One site plan showed unrestricted access from both Torrington and Harwinton, and another showed proposed gated access from Torrington and unrestricted access from Harwinton. Having received the required statutory notice of the application pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 8-3h,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Torrington commission notified the Harwin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>ton commission that it was now opposed to any access to the project from any Torrington street. After an extended hearing, at which the plaintiffs special counsel appeared on its behalf, the Harwinton commission approved the application, reasoning that: (1) \u201c[it] meets the regulations, as modified by the [stipulated] judgment\u201d; and (2) the proposed development would have no adverse effect on the \u201chealth, safety and welfare of the citizens of Harwinton.\u201d The Harwinton commission\u2019s approval, however, was subject to nineteen conditions, including that Saglimbeni secure final approval from both the Torrington engineering department and the Harwinton water pollution control authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">The plaintiff appealed from the decision of the Harwinton commission to the Superior Court, which dismissed the appeal, thereby affirming the Harwinton commission\u2019s approval of Saglimbeni\u2019s application. The plaintiff then appealed to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the judgment of the trial court, reasoning that the terms of the stipulated judgment were binding on the parties. <em>Torrington </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 63 Conn. App. 793. This certified appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">The plaintiff does not challenge the assertion that a planning and zoning commission may settle an appeal through a stipulated judgment. The plaintiff argues, however, that: (1) a special use permit, as is involved in the present case, must satisfy all of the local zoning regulations; (2) a zoning commission statutorily may not amend local zoning regulations of general applica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>bility without holding a public hearing thereon, and may not vary such regulations as to any particular parcel because that power is statutorily allocated to the zoning board of appeals;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and (3) therefore, the Harwinton commission had no authority to amend or vary Harwinton\u2019s special permit regulations by way of the stipulated judgment. Consequently, the plaintiff contends, it was not bound by the stip ulated judgment, and the Appellate Court improperly concluded to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">The defendants do not challenge the assertion that the effect of the stipulated judgment was to vary in some degree the zoning regulations applicable to the property. They claim, however, that: (1) the Appellate Court properly concluded that the stipulated judgment validly accomplished that end; and (2) as an alternate ground for affirmance of the Appellate Court\u2019s judgment, the plaintiff may not now collaterally attack the stipulated judgment. We agree with the defendants\u2019 alternate ground for affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">In <em>Upjohn Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>224 Conn. 96, 102, 616 A.2d 793 (1992), we reaffirmed and applied the general rule that one may not institute a collateral action challenging the decision of a zoning authority. We stated that the rule requiring interested parties to challenge zoning decisions in a timely manner \u201crest[s] in large part ... on the need for stability in land use planning and the need for justified reliance by all interested parties\u2014the interested property owner, any interested neighbors and the town\u2014on the decisions of the zoning authorities.\u201d Id., 102. We also noted, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>in dictum, that, to the extent that a party seeks to attack collaterally a previously unchallenged zoning decision on the basis of the zoning authority\u2019s lack of subject matter jurisdiction, \u201cthere may be exceptional cases in which a previously unchallenged condition was so far outside what could have been regarded as a valid exercise of zoning power that there could not have been any justified reliance on it, or in which the continued maintenance of a previously unchallenged condition would violate some strong public policy. It may be that in such a case a collateral attack on such a condition should be permitted.\u201d Id., 104-105.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">As our language in <em>Upjohn Co. </em>indicates, it must be an \u201cexceptional [case]\u201d that will justify disturbing the stability of unchallenged land use decisions. Id., 104. It is not enough that the conduct in question was in violation of the applicable zoning statutes or regulations. It must be shown that the conduct was so far outside what could have been regarded as a valid exercise of zoning power that there could not have been any justified reliance on it. Thus, a litigant who seeks to invoke this exception must meet a very high standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">In <em>Gangemi </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>255 Conn. 143, 150-51, 763 A.2d 1011 (2001), we converted this dictum into a holding, and concluded that the continued maintenance of the previously unchallenged condition at issue in that case violated the strong public policy against restraints on alienation. The present case presents our first occasion to apply the other exception to the general rule prohibiting collateral attacks on zoning decisions, namely, whether the Harwinton commission\u2019s exercise of the power to vary the special permit regulations was so far outside what could have been regarded as a valid exercise of zoning power that there could not have been any justified reliance on it. We conclude that the action of the Harwinton commission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>in entering into the stipulated judgment does not meet that very high standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">In <em>Upjohn Co., </em>we reasserted the need for stability in land use decisions even where the prior decision may have been extrajurisdictional. We stated: \u201c[Tjhere are limits to the notion that subject matter jurisdictional defects may be raised at any time. As we have only recently observed . . . [t]he modem law of civil procedure suggests that even litigation about subject matter jurisdiction should take into account the importance of the principle of the finality of judgments, particularly when the parties have had a full opportunity originally to contest the jurisdiction of the adjudicatory tribunal. . . . Under this rationale, at least where the lack of jurisdiction is not entirely obvious, the critical considerations are whether the complaining party had the opportunity to litigate the question of jurisdiction in the original action, and, if he did have such an opportunity, whether there are strong policy reasons for giving him a second opportunity to do so.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Upjohn Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 103-104.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">Applying these primary considerations to the facts of the present case, we conclude, first, that the lack of jurisdiction in the Harwinton commission was far from obvious. As a general matter, a zoning commission is empowered to determine whether: (1) the proposed use of the property is permitted under the zoning regulations; (2) the standards contained in the regulations are satisfied; and (3) conditions of approval or modifications to the proposal are necessary to protect public health, safety, convenience and property values, as provided for in General Statutes \u00a7 8-2. See <em>Housatonic Terminal Corp. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Board, </em>168 Conn. 304, 307, 362 A.2d 1375 (1975). Recent decisions of this court, however, have evidenced a trend toward investing zoning commissions with greater discretion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>determining \u201cwhether [a] proposal meets the standards contained in the regulations. The agency [may now] [decide] within prescribed limits whether a particular section of the zoning regulations applies to a given situation and the manner in which it applies.\u201d R. Fuller, 9A Connecticut Practice Series: Land Use Law and Practice (2d Ed. 1999) \u00a7 33.4, p. 160; see also <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>244 Conn. 619, 627-31, 711 A.2d 675 (1998). In making such determinations, moreover, a zoning commission may rely heavily \u201cupon general considerations such as public health, safety and welfare.\u201d R. Fuller, supra, p. 164; see also <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 627-31. Although these authorities do not stand for the proposition that a zoning commission ordinarily may vary zoning regulations for a particular parcel of property, they nonetheless suggest that it was not entirely obvious that the Harwinton commission\u2019s conduct in entering into the stipulated judgment in the present case was outside its purview. Furthermore, it is undisputed that the plaintiff, having had notice of the original zoning proceedings that led to the stipulated judgment, had the opportunity to litigate the question of the Harwinton commission\u2019s jurisdiction at that time. The question, therefore, is whether the Harwinton commission\u2019s conduct in entering into the stipulated judgment, which varied to some extent the zoning regulations applicable to the property in question, was so far outside what could have been regarded as a valid exercise of zoning power that there could not have been any justified reliance on it. Three considerations lead us to conclude that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">First, this was not simply a decision by the Harwinton commission to vary the regulations. Rather, the decision to enter into a stipulated judgment served to settle a vigorously contested appeal, with significant stakes for both the Harwinton commission and the property own<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>ers. Thus, the stipulated judgment invoked \u201cthe powerful interest in the promotion of settlement of litigation by agreement of the parties.\u201d <em>Sendak </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>7 Conn. App. 238, 242, 508 A.2d 781 (1986). Furthermore, it is undisputed that the court approved the stipulated judgment following the required public hearing, and the plaintiff does not contend that the judgment was the product of bad faith, collusion, or other improper conduct. This specific judicial endorsement indicated that the stipulated judgment protected the public interest, was fair, and was not the result of \u201csurreptitious dealing\u201d between the Harwinton commission and the D\u2019Andreas. <em>Willimantic Car Wash, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>247 Conn. 732, 742 n.16, 724 A.2d 1108 (1999) (court approval of settlements involving zoning matters promotes public interest by protecting against unfair or surreptitious dealing between applicants and zoning authorities). Thus, these considerations\u2014the powerful interest in the settlement of litigation, and specific judicial approval of the settlement pursuant to a required public hearing\u2014undermine the assertion that the judgment was so far outside what could be regarded as a valid exercise of zoning power that there could not have been any justified reliance on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Second, our examination of the record indicates that, for the most part, the extent to which the stipulated judgment in fact varied the zoning regulations was not so clearly outside the zoning power as to preclude any justified reliance, and that any significant variations were rendered moot by the specific conditions imposed by the Harwinton commission on the approval of Saglimbeni\u2019s application. In this connection, we note that the plaintiff does not, in its brief to this court, identify in any concrete way how the stipulated judgment vailed the zoning regulations, relying solely on a reference to a letter in the record from its attorney to the Harwinton <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>commission in opposition to Saglimbeni\u2019s application and to any reliance on the stipulated judgment. Nonetheless, we have reviewed that letter, and consider its contentions as those of the plaintiff on the question before us in this appeal. We glean from that letter three provisions of the regulations that the stipulated judgment varied.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">The first concerns the form of the application and the number of units permitted on the property. Section 4.7.3 of the Harwinton zoning regulations required that \u201can application for a Special Permit in a [planned residential] Zone shall consist of no more than 30 dwelling units.\u201d The stipulated judgment, however, provided that the defendants could \u201csubmit a single application for a Special Permit . . . and [the Harwinton commission] agrees to permit the construction of 36 single family units on the [parcel].\u201d Thus, this provision of the stipulated judgment permitted a single application to be filed,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> six more units than the planned residential regulations would have permitted; but it also must be borne in mind that it reduced from sixty units the number that would have been permitted had the stipulated judgment not been entered into, and had the original appeal been successful and the preexisting regulations applied to the parcel. Under these circumstances, we cannot regard the addition of six units as being so far outside the Harwinton commission\u2019s jurisdiction that there could not have been any justified reliance on the stipulated judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">The second provision concerned the amount of \u201cusable\u201d area for the thirty-six units. Section 4.7.4 (c) of the Harwinton zoning regulations required a survey, a site plan map and certifications from a licensed profes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>sional engineer and licensed land surveyor in order to determine whether land is \u201cusable,\u201d in terms of inland wetlands, flood hazard areas and excessive slopes. Under this regulation, if the property were served by approved public water and sewer systems, the maximum number of units would be 3.5 per acre, which would equal the thirty-six permitted units. The stipulated judgment acknowledged that the property had adequate \u201cusable\u201d area for thirty-six units. Despite the assertions in the attorney\u2019s letter to the contrary, there is nothing in this record to indicate that, when the Harwinton commission acknowledged that the property contained adequate \u201cusable\u201d area, it did not do so on the basis of appropriate maps and surveys. Indeed, it was already familiar with the property from the original zoning proceeding before it. Presumably, that proceeding was based on appropriate maps and surveys. In any event, as the party seeking to invoke the exception to the general rule barring collateral attack on a previously unchallenged land use decision, the plaintiff had the burden to establish that the Harwinton commission made such an acknowledgment without an adequate basis on which to do so. It has not met that burden. We have no reason to presume that the Harwinton commission acknowledged the existence of usable area without an appropriate inquiry based on appropriate documentation. Furthermore, the record indicates that, despite the assertion in the letter to the contrary, the property is served by both public water and sewer service.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">The third provision concerned access to the property. Section 4.7.4 (d) (1) of the Harwinton zoning regulations provided that the development have primary access \u201cdirectly onto a State Highway and . . . more than one point of vehicular access to a State Highway or to Town road, or . . . directly onto a Town road leading to a State Highway where the Town road has a minimum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>paved surface width of 22 feet and no grade in excess of 12 [percent] and . . . more than one point of vehicular access to the Town road.\u201d The plaintiff claims in the letter that the property \u201cdoes not access a Town road leading to a state highway and it does not have more than one point of vehicular access to a Town road.\u201d The stipulated judgment acknowledged that the property had adequate road access through Torrington, Harwinton, or a combination of the two. To the extent, however, that this provision of the stipulated judgment may have varied the zoning regulation in question, that circumstance was rendered moot by two conditions imposed by the Harwinton commission on Saglimbeni\u2019s application approval, which the Harwinton commission noted were being imposed in connection with that provision of the judgment, and pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 4.7.4 (d) and 8.1.1 (b) of the Harwinton zoning regulations, which enumerates standards relating to vehicular access. The first condition was that a certain recommendation of the Harwinton town engineer regarding road alignment for access and safety be incorporated into the plans for the development and be subject to review of the engineer before anyroad construction. The other condition required Saglimbeni to obtain approval from the plaintiff for access to the property from its streets. Thus, Saglimbeni\u2019s required compliance with these two conditions effectively ensures that access to the property will substantially conform to \u00a7 4.7.4 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">Third, both before, during and after the D\u2019Andreas\u2019 1988-90 proceedings before the Harwinton commission and the Superior Court, the plaintiff specifically approved of the proposed zone change for the Harwinton property in question, and, effectively, granted access to the property from its streets. In September, 1988, the Torrington commission notified the Harwinton commission that it \u201chad no objection to the [zone change] approval\u201d then being sought by the D\u2019Andreas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>from the Harwinton commission. Then, in September, 1990, responding to a specific request to the Torrington engineering department by the Harwinton commission for its position regarding access to the Harwinton parcel, the Torrington corporation counsel replied that: \u201cAs an abutting property owner, the D\u2019Andreas have the right to access their Harwinton property on the existing Torrington road which abuts the property, i.e., Torcon Drive or any future road in the Doolittle Heights section which abuts their property. The only requirement would be that any access road, whether public or private, meet the City of Torrington Engineering Department specifications.\u201d Finally, in September, 1991, months after the stipulated judgment, the Torrington engineering department specifically approved access from Torrington streets to the property in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">In addition, the origin of the restrictive covenant on the Harwinton property in question is significant. In 1989, the plaintiff, as a condition of its approval of the D\u2019Andreas\u2019 Doolittle Heights subdivision, required them to restrict by deed their <em>Harwinton </em>property so as to require the approval of the Torrington engineering department for road access from any Torrington street.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, the plaintiff secured a valuable property interest from the D\u2019Andreas at that time in connection with the proposed and anticipated development of their properties on both sides of the Harwinton-Torrington town line, which further enabled the plaintiff to be involved directly in the approval of any plan regarding the Harwinton parcel presently at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">The question of whether an extrajudicial act of a zoning authority is so far outside the valid exercise of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>zoning power that there could not have been any justified reliance on it, necessarily permits, in an appropriate case, some inquiry into the reasons for that reliance. Those reasons demonstrate a reasonable basis for the defendants\u2019 reliance on the stipulated judgment in question. It was reasonable for the defendants to presume that the plaintiff would not subsequently break faith with its own previous representations and positions regarding access to the property. It was also reasonable for the defendants to presume that the plaintiff would not seek to retain its own gain from the development process of the adjoining property on its side of the town line, while denying a subsequent, similar development on the Harwinton side that had been specifically burdened at the plaintiffs request in connection with the Torrington development.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">In this opinion NORCOTT and KATZ, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b789-8\"> We granted the plaintiffs petition for certification to appeal, limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude that a stipulated judgment in a zone change appeal modified the regulations applicable to a subsequent special use and site plan application?\u201d <em>Torrington </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>258 Conn. 907, 782 A.2d 1242 (2001). Despite the formulation of this question, we have determined, as we explain in the text of this opinion, that the appeal is more appropriately analyzed under the rubric of the defendants\u2019 alternate ground for affirmance, namely, whether, on the record demonstrated by the present case, the plaintiff was entitled to mount a collateral attack on the stipulated judgment in question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b792-6\"> In addition, the stipulated judgment contained nine other conditions addressing such subjects as the private nature of the roads within the project, storm water drainage, open spaces, and proposed changes to public roads within the project.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b792-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 (m), which deals generally with appeals from the decisions of zoning commissions, planning commissions, or a combination of the two, provides: \u201cNo appeal taken under subsection (b) of this section shall be withdrawn and no settlement between the parties to any such appeal shall be effective unless and until a hearing has been held before the Superior Court and such court has approved such proposed withdrawal or settlement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 8-8 (b) provides: \u201cExcept as provided in subsections (c), (d) and (q) of this section and sections 7-147 and 7-147\u00cd, any person aggrieved by any decision of a board may take an appeal to the superior court for the judicial district in which the municipality is located.

I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff, the city of Torrington, may not maintain the present action collaterally challenging the 1991 stipulated judgment because the contested provisions of the judgment were not so far outside the valid authority of the named defendant, the zoning commission of the town of Harwinton (commission), as to make reliance on that judgment unjustified. I conclude that there was an obvious lack of jurisdiction when the commission waived the requirements of its own regulations in clear violation of state law, and, therefore, the plaintiffs collateral attack on the stipulated judgment is proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">Notwithstanding the general rule prohibiting collateral attacks on the decisions of zoning authorities, this court in <em>Upjohn Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>224 Conn. 96, 104-105, 616 A.2d 793 (1992), recognized \u201cthat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>there may be exceptional cases in which a previously unchallenged condition was so far outside what could have been regarded as a valid exercise of zoning power that there could not have been any justified reliance on it . . . .\u201d The issue in the present case is whether the commission\u2019s lack of jurisdiction to agree to certain provisions of the stipulated judgment was sufficiently egregious such that reliance on that judgment was unwarranted. Analysis of the applicable regulations and statutes clearly reveals that, in entering into the stipulated judgment, the commission lacked the authority to excuse noncompliance with the requirements of the Harwinton zoning regulations, and, moreover, that in doing so, it acted in blatant disregard of statutory requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">It is axiomatic that a special permit application and site plan must conform to the standards set out in the regulations; <em>Barberino Realty &amp; Development Corp. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>222 Conn. 607, 614-1b, 610 A.2d 1205 (1992); and if a special permit does not comply with the applicable regulations, the commission cannot approve it. <em>Weigel </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>160 Conn. 239, 246-47, 278 A.2d 766 (1971); R. Fuller, 9A Connecticut Practice Series: Land Use Law and Practice (2d Ed. 1999) \u00a7 33.4, p. 162. In the present case, the individual defendants, Jerry Saglimbeni, Anthony D\u2019Andrea and Robert D\u2019Andrea (defendants), have conceded that the special permit application and site plan approved by the commission did not meet the requirements of Harwinton\u2019s special permit and zoning regulations (regulations). The commission admitted in its brief filed with the trial court that \u201cif the [stipulated] judgment did not modify the zoning regulations as to access, density, usable area, drainage, sewers and open space, then the commission\u2019s decision cannot be upheld under the requirements of the zoning regulations alone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>The issue before us, then, is the commission\u2019s authority to \u201cmodify\u201d or waive the requirements of the regulations. The commission effectively waived three provisions of the regulations in the stipulated judgment. First, the commission agreed that the defendants could \u201csubmit a single application for a special permit . . . and [the commission] agrees to permit the construction of [thirty-six] single family units on the [parcel].\u201d This stipulation contravened \u00a7 4.7 of the Harwinton zoning regulations, which requires that \u201can application for a Special Permit in a [planned residential] zone shall consist of no more than [thirty] dwelling units.\u201d Second, the commission acknowledged that the parcel had adequate \u201cusable\u201d area to permit construction of thirty-six living units.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Usable area is defined by \u00a7 4.7.4 (c) of the Harwinton zoning regulations as \u201cland other than . . . regulated inland wetlands and watercourses . . . [and] 50% of all land with a slope in excess of 25% . . . .\u201d Despite the presence of inland wetlands and steep grades on the site, the commission conceded that the site contained sufficient usable land to accommodate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>thirty-six living units. Furthermore, there is no evidence in the record that the commission received the required survey, site plan map and certifications from a licensed professional engineer and a licensed land surveyor before determining that there was sufficient \u201cusable\u201d land on the site. Third, the commission provided an acknowledgment that the parcel had \u201cadequate road access . . . either through Torrington, Harwinton or a combination of the two . . . .\u201d This stipulation was in clear breach of \u00a7 4.7.4 (d) (1) of the Harwinton zoning regulations, which requires that a development with thirty or more dwellings have access \u201ceither . . . directly onto a State Highway and shall have more than one point of vehicular access to a State Highway or Town road, or . . . directly onto a Town road leading to a State Highway . . . and shall have more than one point of vehicular access to the Town road.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">These waivers were critical components of the stipulated judgment negotiated between the commission and the other defendants, yet there can be no serious doubt that the commission lacked the authority to grant such waivers. Pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 8-6,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the power to vary the application of zoning regu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>lations falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the zoning board of appeals. <em>Langer </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>163 Conn. 453, 457, 313 A.2d 44 (1972) (\u201cthe power to vary [zoning regulations] to accommodate practical difficulties and do substantial justice lies exclusively in a [zoning] board of appeals\u201d); R. Fuller, 9 Connecticut Practice Series: Land Use Law and Practice (2d Ed. 1999) \u00a7 22.16, p. 505 (\u201cthe exclusive authority to vary the zoning regulations is vested in the zoning board of appeals\u201d). \u201cThe zoning commission itself cannot vary the requirements of the special permit or site plan provisions of the zoning regulations.\u201d R. Fuller, 9 Connecticut Practice Series: Land Use Law and Practice (2d Ed. 1999) \u00a7 15.15, pp. 363-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">What makes the commission\u2019s action in granting these waivers especially egregious is its wholesale disregard of its statutory obligations when it considered the special permit application for the site in question. General Statutes \u00a7 8-3c (b)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> requires that the commission hold a public hearing on an application for a special permit after giving notice to the public of the time and place of the public hearing. In the present case, the commission waived certain requirements of its regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>tions applicable to a special permit <em>for </em>the site without providing the opportunity for the public, including the plaintiff, an abutting property owner, to be heard on the application. Previously, we have emphasized the importance of public hearings, particularly in zoning cases. <em>Willimantic Car Wash, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>247 Conn. 732, 739, 724 A.2d 1108 (1999); <em>Couch </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>141 Conn. 349, 357, 106 A.2d 173 (1954). \u201cBecause of the public impact of land use decisions, Connecticut\u2019s governing statutoiy scheme promotes public participation in such decision making, and particularly provides for public hearings with substantial procedural safeguards. . . . [H]earings play an essential role in the scheme of zoning and in its development. . . . They furnish a method of showing to the commission the real effect of the proposed change upon the social and economic life of the community. . . . Hearings likewise provide the necessary forum for those whose properties will be affected by a change to register their approval or disapproval and to state the reasons therefor.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Willimantic Car Wash, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 739; <em>Couch </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>supra, 357. The commission\u2019s waiver of several requirements of its regulations without first holding a public hearing was a clear violation of \u00a7 8-3c (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Section 8-3c (b)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> further requires that the commission receive a report from the local inland wetlands agency with regard to any special permit application and that the commission give \u201cdue consideration\u201d to that report. The site of the proposed development in the present case clearly contained inland wetlands. Yet the commission stipulated that there was sufficient \u201cusable\u201d area, defined as land <em>exclusive </em>of wetlands, without obtaining and considering the statutorily required report from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>local inland wetlands agency. Our legislature clearly has established a strong public policy favoring protection of the inland wetlands of this state. <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>183 Conn. 532, 542, 441 A.2d 30 (1981). General Statutes \u00a7 22a-36 details the legislature\u2019s clear concern for the protection of inland wetlands in this state, providing in relevant part: \u201cThe inland wetlands and watercourses of the state of Connecticut are an indispensable and irreplaceable but fragile natural resource with which the citizens of the state have been endowed. . . . The preservation and protection of the wetlands and watercourses from random, unnecessary, undesirable and unregulated uses, disturbance or destruction is in the public interest and is essential to the health, welfare and safety of the citizens of the state. . . .\u201d To effectuate this intent, the legislature has required each municipality to establish an agency to regulate activities affecting wetlands and watercourses within that municipality. See General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42. The commission in the present case, however, stipulated that the site contained sufficient \u201cusable\u201d area (exclusive of wetlands) for thirty-six living units without obtaining and considering the statutorily required report of the Harwinton inland wetlands commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">When the commission entered into the stipulated judgment, it acted in utter disregard of at least two important statutory obligations, one requiring a public hearing to obtain public input on issues raised in the special permit application, and the second requiring consideration of a report from the local inland wetlands agency. General Statutes \u00a7 8-3c (b). I conclude that the commission\u2019s abdication of its statutory role brings this case within the exception recognized in <em>Upjohn Co. </em>for actions so far outside the authority of a zoning commission that those actions could not reasonably have been relied upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>The majority asserts that the commission\u2019s lack of jurisdiction was not obvious because: (1) the waivers were given in the interest of settling litigation; (2) the variations of the regulations were rendered moot by conditions later imposed by the commission when it approved Saglimbeni\u2019s application; and (3) the plaintiff gave its approval to the zone change during the application process. These considerations, however, are tangential to the issue before us, namely, whether, by agreeing to waive certain requirements of the zoning regulations and doing so in violation of the procedures mandated in \u00a7 8-3c (b), the commission exceeded its authority in such an obvious way that its actions reasonably could not have been relied upon. That question should be resolved by an objective analysis of the commission\u2019s legal authority under applicable statutes and regulations at the time it took the action in question. It should not be resolved by considering whether the plaintiff in this zoning appeal approved of the zone change at some earlier stage in the process or whether, years after the action at issue, the commission took other actions that made moot its earlier illegal action that resolved a pending lawsuit. Whether the commission acted egregiously in excess of its authority is a question of law to be resolved by application of an objective standard, e.g., whether an individual possessing reasonable knowledge of zoning law would conclude that the action of the zoning authority was so far in excess of its valid powers that there could not have been any justified reliance on that action. Application of that objective standard in the present case reveals that the commission\u2019s lack of jurisdiction was obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b806-5\"> Section 4.7.4 (c) of the Harwinton zoning regulations, which defines the term \u201cusable,\u201d provides in relevant part: \u201cFor the purpose of this section \u2018usable\u2019 area shall be defined as land other than the following areas which shall be shown on a site plan map:</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\"><em>\u201c\u2014regulated inland wetlands and watercourses </em>as defined in the Harwinton Inland Wetlands Regulations and shown on the Harwinton Inland Wetlands Map, the boundaries of which shall be located in the field by a certified soil scientist and mapped by a Connecticut licensed surveyor,</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\"><em>\u201c\u2014100 year flood hazard areas </em>as defined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (see Flood Hazard Areas Map on file in the office of the Planning and Zoning Commission), the boundaries of which shall be certified by a Connecticut licensed professional engineer,</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\"><em>\u201c\u2014land subject to existing easements which prohibit building development, </em>the boundaries of which shall be certified by a Connecticut licensed professional engineer,</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\"><em>\u201c\u201450% of all land with a slope in excess of 25% </em>as delineated on the site plan map showing topographic contours based upon a field or aerial survey and certified by a Connecticut licensed land surveyor.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-10\">\u201cBased upon the above required information the applicant\u2019s engineer shall certify the total \u2018usable\u2019 area of land on the site.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b807-6\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 8-6 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe zoning board of appeals shall have the following powers and duties . . .
