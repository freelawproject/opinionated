(academy), for several alleged breaches of her fiduciary duties to the academy. The attorney general filed a three count complaint against the defendant in which he alleged, inter alia, that the defendant had enriched herself at the expense of the academy, an educational, not-for-profit organization, by entering into one lease and two employment agreements with the academy. The defendant moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the attorney general lacked authority to maintain the \u201caction in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>own name.\u201d The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion, concluding that the attorney general had standing under General Statutes \u00a7 3-125<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to pursue an action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>against the defendant insofar as he sought to remedy the misappropriation of charitable contributions made to the academy. The trial court further concluded, however, that the attorney general had no authority, statutory or otherwise, to pursue an action against the defendant to remedy the misappropriation of noncharitable academy receipts. In light of the nominal amount involved, the attorney general thereafter abandoned his claim with respect to the recovery of charitable contributions, which, according to the trial court, was authorized under \u00a7 3-125. Upon motion of the attorney general, the trial court rendered judgment in favor of the defendant, from which the attorney general appealed to the Appellate Court. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 65-2, we granted the attorney general\u2019s motion to transfer the appeal to this court. We now affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. The academy was a Connecticut nonstock corporation with federal tax exempt status under \u00a7 501 (c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501 (c) (3) (1994). In 1997, the state department of education (department) granted the academy a charter to operate a state charter school,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>academy operated at 95 Fitch Street in New Haven. The academy opened its doors at that location in August, 1997, and remained there until the department revoked its charter in September, 1999. Although the academy received a small amount of charitable contributions,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it derived most of its operating revenue in the form of state funded tuition payments pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 10-66ee, as amended by Public Acts 1997, No. 97-290, \u00a7 9, and Public Acts 1998, No. 98-168, \u00a7 24.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, for the 1997-98 academic year, the academy received approximately $490,000 in tuition payments from the state on behalf of students enrolled in the academy. It received a similar amount in tuition payments during the 1998-99 academic year. In 1997, the academy also obtained a loan from the Connecticut health and educational facilities authority in the amount of $140,000. All of these funds, regardless of their source, were intended to enable the academy to carry out its educational objectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">The defendant was the president and treasurer of the academy. She also served as a member of the academy\u2019s board of directors. In May, 1997, the defendant purchased property located at 95 Fitch Street in New Haven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>and an adjacent parcel of land for $110,000.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thereafter, the defendant entered into a renewable five year lease agreement with the academy under which the academy agreed to lease the premises at 95 Fitch Street and the adjacent parcel (leased premises) at an annual base rent of $54,999.96.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant also entered into two separate employment agreements with the academy in August, 1998. Pursuant to the terms of the first agreement, the defendant agreed to devote an average of forty hours per month as the academy\u2019s administrative director from September, 1998, to May, 1999, in exchange for a salary of $38,000. The agreement further provided that the defendant would be paid a salary of $39,900 for the same services to be rendered between September, 1999, and May, 2000, and a salary of $41,895 for services to be rendered between September, 2000, and May, 2001. Under the second employment agreement, the defendant was hired as a consultant to act as a school superintendent from August 1 through August 31, 1998, at a salary of $30,000, from June 1, 1999, through August 31, 1999, at a salary of $33,000, and from June 1, 2000, through August 31, 2000, at a salary of $36,300. Additionally, the defendant had been paid $55,666 for services rendered to the academy between May, 1997, and May, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The attorney general alleged in his complaint that the defendant had breached her fiduciary duties to the academy by entering into the foregoing lease and employment agreements, which he further claimed were self-enriching and unfair to the academy. He also alleged that the defendant had breached her fiduciary duties to the academy when she had failed to meet the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>payment schedule on the promissory note that was secured by a mortgage on the leased premises and when she had failed to prevent the mortgagees from instituting foreclosure proceedings. See footnote 5 of this opinion. The attorney general cited \u00a7 3-125 and the common law as authority for maintaining an action against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">In a memorandum of decision on the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, the trial court concluded that the attorney general did not have standing under common law to pursue his claims against the defendant and that his statutory authority to maintain an action against the defendant was limited, pursuant to \u00a7 3-125, to the protection of gifts intended for public or charitable purposes. Thereafter, the trial court denied the attorney general\u2019s motion to reargue the motion to dismiss and, upon motion of the attorney general,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> rendered judgment in favor of the defendant. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">The attorney general claims that the trial court improperly concluded that he does not possess common-law authority to maintain an action against the defendant. He asserts that the trial court\u2019s conclusion renders the state without an effective remedy for addressing the defendant\u2019s self-dealing of academy assets. He further maintains that he has common-law authority to bring an action seeking to remedy breaches of fiduciary duties by those individuals entrusted with charitable funds, and that, pursuant to such authority, he may reach all of the misappropriated assets of the not-for-profit organization regardless of their source. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>The attorney general identifies the former common-law authority of the state\u2019s attorneys to protect the integrity of charitable gifts as the source of his common-law authority. Specifically, the attorney general claims that the common-law authority over civil matters, including those matters involving the protection of public and charitable gifts, which formerly was vested in the state\u2019s attorneys, devolved to the office of the attorney general upon its establishment in 1897. He further contends that this court and the legislature have recognized and affirmed his common-law authority through decisional law and statutory enactments. We address the attorney general\u2019s arguments seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Before turning to the merits of the attorney general\u2019s arguments, we are compelled to underscore what is at issue in this appeal. This appeal does not address whether the attorney general has statutory authority to protect the integrity of charitable gifts or whether he has statutory authority to bring an action against a fiduciary of a not-for-profit organization to recover misappropriated charitable funds. Indeed, after the trial court concluded that the attorney general did have such authority, the attorney general abandoned his claim insofar as it was based on his statutory authority. See footnote 7 of this opinion. Rather, the issue before us is whether the attorney general has standing under common law to bring an action for breach of fiduciary duties by officers of a not-for-profit organization in order to remedy the misappropriation of the organization\u2019s non-charitable receipts.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">\u201cStanding is the legal right to set judicial machinery in motion. One cannot rightfully invoke the jurisdiction of the court unless [one] has, in an individual or representative capacity, some real interest in the cause of action .... Standing is established by showing that the party claiming it is authorized by statute to bring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>suit or is classically aggrieved.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> . . . The fundamental test for determining [classical] aggrievement encompasses a well-settled twofold determination: first, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully demonstrate a specific personal and legal interest in the subject matter of the decision, as distinguished from a general interest, such as is the concern of all the members of the community as a whole. Second, the party claiming aggrievement must successfully establish that the specific personal and legal interest has been specially and injuriously affected by the decision.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>McWeeny, </em>260 Conn. 296, 308-309, 796 A.2d 516 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">As a preliminary matter, we set forth the standard under which we review the trial court\u2019s granting of a motion to dismiss for lack of standing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cA motion to dismiss . . . properly attacks the jurisdiction of the court, essentially asserting that the plaintiff cannot as a matter of law and fact state a cause of action that should be heard by the court. ... A motion to dismiss tests, inter alia, whether, on the face of the record, the court is without jurisdiction. . . . [0]ur review of the trial court\u2019s ultimate legal conclusion and resulting grant of the motion to dismiss [is] de novo.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Welwood, </em>258 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>425, 433, 780 A.2d 924 (2001). We now turn to the attorney general\u2019s arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">The attorney general initially argues that the common-law authority of the state\u2019s attorneys over civil matters devolved to the office of the attorney general upon its establishment in 1897, and, therefore, that \u201c[t]he [a]ttomey [g]eneral is simply a new branch on the tree rooted in the common law.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">In 1897, the office of the attorney general was established pursuant to Public Acts 1897, c. 191, \u00a7 1 (P.A. 191),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which is now codified as amended at General Statutes \u00a7 3-124.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Public Act 191, \u00a7 1, provides in relevant part: \u201cThere shall be an attorney-general chosen by ballot in the same manner as other state officers . . . .\u201d Section 2 of P.A. 191,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> which is now codified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>as amended at \u00a7 3-125, details the various duties and powers of the then newly established office of the attorney general, including the attorney general\u2019s authority to \u201crepresent the public interest in the protection of any gifts, legacies, or devises, intended for public or charitable purposes.\u201d Prior to the establishment of the office of the attorney general, however, the state\u2019s attorneys for the various counties had common-law authority to enforce charitable trusts, gifts and devises. See, e.g., <em>Dailey </em>v. <em>New </em>Haven, 60 Conn. 314, 325, 22 A. 945 (1891). This common-law authority encompassed other civil matters as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Keena, </em>64 Conn. 212, 29 A. 470 (1894), this court discussed the powers of the state\u2019s attorneys as they existed at the end of the nineteenth century. \u201cThe powers and duties of a State\u2019s Attorney have never been defined by statute law; they are (except in certain particulars specifically enumerated in the statutes) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>necessary incidents of the office, by force of the common law of this State. The language used in relation to the office has not materially changed since it was first formally established. In 1704 the \u2018Attumey for the Queen,\u2019 [was] required to \u2018prosecute and implead in the lawe all criminall offenders, and to doe all things necessary or convenient as an atturney to suppress vice and imorallitie.\u2019 4 Colonial Records, 468. In 1730 this Act was passed: \u2018In each county there shall be one King\u2019s Attoumey, who shall plead and manage, in the county where such attoumey is appointed, in all matters proper, in behalf of our sovereign lord the King.\u2019 7 Colonial Records, 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">\u201cIn 1764, apparently to remove any doubt that the representative of the crown also represented the sovereignty of the Colony, the King\u2019s attorneys in the several counties were empowered \u2018to appear in behalf of the Governor and Company of this Colony in all cases concerning them or brought for or against them in any of the said counties.\u2019 12 Colonial Records, 258. In 1784 it was enacted that ... \u2018In each county in this State, there shall be one State Attorney, who shall prosecute, manage and plead in the County where such Attorney is appointed, in all Matters proper for, and in behalf of the State.\u2019 Statutes 1786, p. 11. In the Revision of 1821 and of 1838 the same language was used. In 1849 the language was condensed as follows . . . \u2018The County Court, in each county, shall appoint one attorney for the State, who shall act as attorney in behalf of the State in the county where appointed.\u2019 Revision 1849, p. 208. In 1888 the statute reads thus ... \u2018A State\u2019s Attorney in each county, who shall act therein as attorney in behalf of the State.\u2019 General Statutes, \u00a7 763.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">\u201cIt has been uniformly held since 1730 that the office then established carried with it the duty to conduct all criminal prosecutions in the Superior Courts, and the power to institute and carry on in every court having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>criminal jurisdiction (unless restrained by some statute) any criminal prosecution within the jurisdiction of the court, and also the power and duty to exercise the common law powers appertaining to the office of the Attorney General,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> so far as applicable to our system of jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">\u201cThe power of the State\u2019s Attorney to file in the Superior Courts an original information exists by reason of his being invested with common law power of Attorney General, which in this State is greatly enlarged, because we early adopted the policy of filing an information in cases of felonies as well as misdemeanors; and, since the adoption of our Constitution, an information may be filed for every crime not punishable by death or imprisonment for life. It is then the common law of this State that authorizes the State\u2019s Attorney to file informations in the Superior Court, both in ordinary criminal prosecutions and in those prerogative writs where he represents as Attorney General the sovereignty of the State. Mandamus and quo warranto were authorized and regulated entirely by the common law until 1821, and to this day it is the common law that authorizes the State\u2019s Attorney to represent the sovereignty of the State when those writs are issued on application of the State alone.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Keena, </em>supra, 64 Conn. 214-15; accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Nardini, </em>187 Conn. 109, 113-15, 445 A.2d 304 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">The attorney general essentially argues that, in 1899, with the election of the first attorney general, all civil authority to act devolved from the state\u2019s attorneys to the office of the attorney general. He offers little support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>for this claim, however.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Even if we assume, as the attorney general argues, that the case law reveals that the common-law authority of the state\u2019s attorneys over charitable and public gifts devolved to the office of the attorney general, there is no indication that any other common-law powers of the state\u2019s attorneys concerning civil matters devolved to the office of the attorney general.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Our case law reveals that the state\u2019s attorneys continued to possess and act upon their common-law authority over civil matters following the establishment of the office of the attorney general. For example, the state\u2019s attorneys continued to bring mandamus and quo warranto actions after 1897. See, e.g., <em>Gormley </em>v. <em>Panuzio, </em>166 Conn. 1, 2, 347 A.2d 78 (1974) (writ of mandamus to compel mayor and assessor of city of Bridgeport to implement property revaluations); <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Risley, </em>151 Conn. 372, 373-74, 198 A.2d 55 (1964) (writ of mandamus to compel selectmen of town of Vernon to call special town meeting); <em>Blodgett ex rel. Bazil </em>v. <em>Boardman, </em>127 Conn. 475, 477, 18 A.2d 370 (1941) (writ of mandamus to compel secretary of state bar examining committee to issue certificate allowing out-of-state attorney to be admitted to Connecticut bar without examination); <em>Alcorn ex rel. Hoerle </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>127 Conn. 426, 427-28, 17 A.2d 514 (1941) (quo warranto information to determine whether defendant had right to continue acting as school superintendent after expiration of employment contract); <em>Ullman ex rel. Eramo </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>127 Conn. 239, 239-40, 16 A.2d 286 (1940) (writ of mandamus to compel enforcement of zoning regulations against nonconforming liquor store); <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number><em>ley ex rel.

Graye v. Quintilian, </em>121 Conn. 300, 302, 184 A. 382 (1936) (quo warranto information to determine title to office of city health official); <em>Comley ex rel. Donovan </em>v. <em>Lawlor, </em>120 Conn. 610, 611, 182 A. 218 (1935) (writs of mandamus to enforce rights to receive pension benefits); <em>Alcorn ex rel. Hendrick </em>v. <em>Keating, </em>120 Conn. 427, 430, 181 A. 340 (1935) (quo warranto information to determine whether respondent was legal member of state board of finance and control); <em>Spencer ex rel. Deuse </em>v. <em>Fargo, </em>114 Conn. 527, 528, 159 A. 349 (1932) (quo warranto information to determine whether respondent\u2019s status as nonelector rendered her election to town school committee invalid); <em>Cummings ex rel. Eliott </em>v. <em>Lake Torpedo Boat Co., </em>90 Conn. 638, 640, 98 A. 580 (1916) (writ of mandamus to compel foreign corporation to allow inspection of its records); <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Looney, </em>89 Conn. 557, 560, 95 A. 19 (1915) (writ of mandamus to compel selectmen of town of Stamford to call special town meeting for purpose of electing individual to fill unexpired term of office of town clerk); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Cleaveland, </em>76 Conn. 426, 428-29, 56 A. 850 (1904) (writ of mandamus to compel probate judge to permit appeal from certain orders). Although Public Acts 1976, No. 76-100, \u00a7 3, which is codified as amended at General Statutes \u00a7 52-485, abolished \u201c[a]ny common law requirement that the state\u2019s attorney participate in any way in an action for mandamus,\u201d there is no indication that this common-law authority was transferred to the office of the attorney general.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>Additionally, the office of the state\u2019s attorney continues to represent the commissioner of correction in habeas corpus proceedings, which are civil proceedings<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> through which habeas petitioners challenge the legality of their sentences.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Connelly </em>v. <em>Commissioner of </em>Correction, 258 Conn. 374, 375-76, 780 A.2d 890 (2001) (opposing challenge to imposition of prison sentence on ground that it was product of judicial vindictiveness); <em>Cobham </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>258 Conn. 30, 37, 779 A.2d 80 (2001) (opposing challenge to legality of prison sentence); see also <em>Consiglio </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>153 Conn. 673, 674, 220 A.2d 269 (1966) (opposing challenge to increase in original sentence by sentence review division of Superior Court on ground that state failed to provide petitioner with counsel at sentence review hearing); <em>Perell </em>v. <em>Warden of State Prison, </em>113 Conn. 339, 340, 155 A. 221 (1931) (opposing habeas petition alleging unlawful confinement on ground of insufficiency of evidence); <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Crofutt, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>84 Conn. 370, 374, 80 A. 90 (1911) (opposing challenge to legality of petitioner\u2019s detention pending extradition to New York).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">We also are mindful of the numerous statutes, some of which predate the establishment of the office of the attorney general, that authorize state\u2019s attorneys or the office of the state\u2019s attorney to act upon particular civil matters. For example, General Statutes (1902 Rev.) \u00a7 3461<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> authorized state\u2019s attorneys to obtain injunctions against troubled financial institutions within their respective counties.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 7-22<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and 7-81,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> state\u2019s attorneys possess the authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>to file an action in the Superior Court seeking the removal of town clerks and town treasurers, respectively, in circumstances of misconduct, neglect of duty or incompetence. General Statutes \u00a7 16-280\u00cd<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> authorizes state\u2019s attorneys, on behalf of the department of public utility control, to seek a restraining order or an injunction against any person who violates federal and state safety standards with respect to the storage and transportation of certain gases. Furthermore, General Statutes \u00a7 19a-346<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> authorizes state\u2019s attorneys to institute an action to enjoin a public nuisance, and General Statutes \u00a7 21a-259<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> vests state\u2019s attorneys with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>authority to institute an action for the appointment of a receiver of rents against the owner of rental property \u201cdeemed a common nuisance.\u201d Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 13b-305,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> a state\u2019s attorney may bring an action against a railroad company in order to remedy the railroad company\u2019s failure to carry out its contractual duties to construct, maintain or repair a highway or bridge.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> In light of the foregoing statutes and case law, which make clear that state\u2019s attorneys continue to possess and have acted upon their statutory and common-law authority over civil matters long after passage of P.A. 191 in 1897, we reject the attorney general\u2019s claim that the common-law authority of state\u2019s attorneys over civil matters devolved to the office of the attorney general.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The attorney general next argues that this court repeatedly has recognized his common-law authority with respect to the protection of charitable and public gifts, and that this recognition is an indication of his broader common-law authority to bring an action against the defendant under the circumstances of this case. In support of his argument, he cites to several decisions of this court, which, as our ensuing analysis indicates, are inapposite.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">In <em>Healy </em>v. <em>Loomis Institute, </em>102 Conn. 410, 419, 128 A. 774 (1925), we considered whether the Superior Court had authority, pursuant to its equitable powers, to prevent the trustees of a private school from discontinuing its educational programs for female students. The school was endowed and incorporated by five siblings, all of whom agreed to bequeath their respective estates for the purpose of establishing the school. Id., 415. The attorney general brought an action to enforce the terms of the charter<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> that the siblings had obtained to carry out their compact and pursuant to which the trustees were required to furnish an education to qualifying students between the ages of twelve and twenty-one regardless of sex. Id. On appeal, the attorney general challenged the trial court\u2019s finding that the charter did not require the school to continue coeducational instruction and its ensuing conclusion that it should not interfere with the decision of the school\u2019s trustees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>to discontinue instruction to female students. See id., 416, 419. Conversely, the trustees of the school argued that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to restrain and direct them with respect to the management and control of the internal affairs of the school, including their decision to discontinue coeducational instruction. Id., 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">We rejected the trustees\u2019 argument and concluded that, \u201cif the trustees do not pursue the objects of the charity, or abuse the charity by violating its franchises, its charter or Act of incorporation, or the conditions attached to it, or by the perversion of its funds, the court of chancery will intervene and compel the trustees to establish or execute the trust in accordance with their power under the charter or Act of incorporation and in accordance with the law of the land. The Attorney-General is the proper person to have brought this action, and the bill in equity a proper remedy.\u201d Id., 422-23. We did not determine, as the attorney general suggests, that the attorney general\u2019s standing to pursue the action rested on any common-law authority inherent in his office. We merely concluded that the Superior Court had jurisdiction to determine the matter and that the attorney general was the appropriate party to bring an action seeking to enforce the proper use of the charitable bequests as reflected in the wills and the charter. See id. Because of the procedural posture of the appeal, we did not address whether the attorney general derived his authority from statutory law or common law.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">In <em>Averill v. Lewis, </em>106 Conn. 582, 138 A. 815 (1927), a case decided two years after our decision in <em>Healy, </em>we concluded that \u201cthe beneficiary class [of a public charity] should be represented and their interests protected by the trustees, or, upon their failure to act, then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>by the public attorney\u2014formerly the State\u2019s Attorney and now the Attorney General.\u201d Id., 591. In so concluding, we specifically cited General Statutes (1918 Rev.) \u00a7 170, now codified as amended at \u00a7 3-125, as the source of the attorney general\u2019s authority to represent the interests of the beneficiary class. <em>Averill </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>supra, 592 (\u201cthe Attorney General . . . shall represent the public interest in the protection of any gifts, legacies or devises intended for public or charitable purposes\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]), quoting General Statutes (1918 Rev.) \u00a7 170. We specifically noted that the attorney general\u2019s duty to represent the public interest in protecting gifts, legacies or devises intended for charitable purposes \u201cdevolve[d] upon [him] by statute\u201d; <em>Averill </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>supra, 593; and that such a duty was \u201cmandatory and specific\u201d under the statute. Id., 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Approximately five years ago, in <em>Carl J. Herzog Foundation, Inc. </em>v. <em>University of Bridgeport, </em>243 Conn. 1, 16, 699 A.2d 995 (1997), we determined that a donor does not have standing under the Connecticut Uniform Management of Institutional Funds Act, General Statutes \u00a7 45a-526 et seq., to bring an action to enforce the terms of a completed charitable gift. Notwithstanding our reference to the case law of other states in discussing the general common-law rule that attorneys general have authority to enforce the terms of a charitable gift; <em>Carl J. Herzog Foundation, Inc. </em>v. <em>University of Bridgeport, </em>supra, 6-7; we reiterated that \u201cConnecticut is among the majority of jurisdictions that have codified this common-law rule and has entrusted the attorney general with the responsibility and duty to represent the public interest in the protection of any gifts, legacies or devises intended for public or charitable purposes. . . . General Statutes \u00a7 3-125.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Carl J. Herzog Foundation, Inc. </em>v. <em>University of Bridgeport, </em>supra, 7 n.3. Thus, rather than recognize any common-law authority of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>attorney general to protect charitable gifts, we consistently have recognized\u2014albeit at times sub silentio\u2014 that the common-law authority heretofore vested in the state\u2019s attorneys; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Keena, </em>supra, 64 Conn. 215 (state\u2019s attorneys possess \u201ccommon law powers appertaining to the office of Attorney General, so far as applicable to our system of jurisprudence\u201d); was codified and transferred to the office of the attorney general upon establishment of that office in 1897. See, e.g., <em>Averill </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>supra, 106 Conn. 591-92 (former duty of state\u2019s attorney to act on behalf of beneficiaries of public charity now statutory duty of attorney general). We, therefore, reject the attorney general\u2019s contention that we previously have recognized common-law authority in his office.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">We need not tarry on the attorney general\u2019s remaining two arguments, namely, that the legislature repeatedly has recognized and affirmed through legislative enactments that he possesses common-law authority over civil matters and that there will be no effective remedy for addressing the defendant\u2019s self-dealing if the attorney general can only proceed pursuant to his authority under \u00a7 3-125. The attorney general\u2019s first argument rests wholly on several saving clauses found in various statutes. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 19a-486h, 21a-225, 36a-647, 42-110m, 42-150, 47-112 and 47a-21. None of these statutes confers upon the attorney general any common-law authority. Cf. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Ganim, </em>233 Conn. 557, 670, 660 A.2d 742 (1995) <em>(Berdon, J., </em>dissenting) (common law of Connecticut includes, inter alia, adjudication of courts of justice, rules of practice and universally accepted usages and customs). Rather, each statute provides that the provisions of the chapter of which the statute is apart \u201cshall [not] be construed as a limitation upon the power or authority of the state . . . [or] the Attorney General ... to seek administrative, legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>or equitable relief as provided by other statutes or at common law.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 21a-225; accord General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 36a-647 (d), 42-110m (b), 42-150, 47-112 and 47a-21 (Z).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> We, therefore, find this argument to be without merit.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Notwithstanding the attorney general\u2019s argument that the defendant\u2019s alleged self-dealing will go unremedied unless we recognize his common-law authority to bring an action against the defendant, we identify several avenues for addressing the defendant\u2019s alleged breach of her fiduciary duties. First and foremost, the attorney general may bring an action pursuant to \u00a7 3-125<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 10-66ee (g),<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> on behalf of the commissioner of education, to compel the repayment of state funds that the academy used in a manner inconsistent with the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 10-66aa et seq. and to enforce the covenants in the grant documents. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 33-1038 (b) (3),<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> the attorney general may also institute an action to dissolve the academy, a nonstock corporation, or to enjoin it from engaging in ultra vires acts. Additionally, the academy itself or its directors may bring an action against the defendant pursuant to \u00a7 33-1038 (b).<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The academy may also seek a court order to remove the defendant as an officer of the nonstock corporation pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 33-1090,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> or it may institute a private action against the defendant for her alleged wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Our analysis of the attorney general\u2019s claim does not end there, however. We still must examine P.A. 191, which established the office of the attorney general and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>defined its duties, in order to determine whether the legislature intended to transfer the common-law authority of the state\u2019s attorneys over civil matters to the office of the attorney general. We initially examine the landscape upon which the act was passed, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The office of the attorney general principally was established in response to the spiraling legal costs incurred by the various state departments. See Hartford Daily Courant, May 15,1897, p. 12. Prior to the establishment of the office of the attorney general, each state agency and department had retained its own legal counsel to represent it, and thus the state, in legal matters pertaining to the respective agency or department. See id. According to the sponsor of the legislation establishing the office of the attorney general, the comptroller and nine state departments, boards and commissions collectively incurred at least $15,000 in legal expenses in 1896. Id. Representative Hariy E. Back estimated that the legal expenses of all of the state departments amounted to $25,000 annually. Id. Representative Samuel Frisbie best summarized the purpose behind the proposed legislation when he stated: \u201cI know of no single better way for saving money than the creating of this office.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.; see also Hartford Daily Times, May 21,1897, p. 3 (claiming that creation of office of attorney general would result in decrease in legal expenses of state departments).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Additionally, the legislature was concerned that the state was losing money because it did not have an attorney who could represent its financial interests before the legislature and Probate Court. See Hartford Daily Courant, May 15,1897, p. 12 (discussing proposed legislation concerning East Hartford bridge pursuant to which state would incur $500,000 in expenses and that only attorney appearing in opposition was hired by and acting on behalf of Litchfield county); see also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Hartford Daily Courant, May 21, 1897, p. 6 (discussing lack of representation in connection with state\u2019s loss of charitable bequest of $75,000 under will of Philip Marett); cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>69 Conn. 64, 74, 36 A. 1019 (1897) (only legislature was authorized to accept bequest of Philip Marett on behalf of state). In effect, although the state\u2019s attorneys were obligated to represent the state\u2019s interests in their respective counties; see General Statutes (1887 Rev.) \u00a7 763; no one state\u2019s attorney was responsible for appearing on behalf of the governor or other state officers, departments, boards or commissions, in various matters of significance to the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">Mindful of the principal purpose behind the establishment of the office of the attorney general, we now turn to the language of P.A. 191, \u00a7 2, to determine whether the legislature intended to transfer the common-law authority of the state\u2019s attorneys over civil matters to the office of the attorney general.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Public Act 191, \u00a7 2, provides in relevant part: \u201cThe attorney-general shall have general supervision over all legal matters in which the state is an interested party, <em>except those legal matters over which the state\u2019s attorneys have direction. </em>He shall advise and assist the state\u2019s attorneys if they so request. He shall appear for the state, the governor, the lieutenant-governor, the secretary, the treasurer, and the comptroller, and for all heads of departments and state boards, commissioners, agents, inspectors, librarian, committees, auditors, chemists, directors, harbor masters, and institutions, in all suits and other civil proceedings, excepting upon criminal recognizances and bail bonds, in which the state is a party or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>is interested, or in which the official acts and doings of said officers are called in question in any court or other tribunal, as the duties of his office shall require; and all such suits shall be conducted by him or under his direction. When any measure affecting the state treasury shall be pending before any committee of the general assembly ... he shall appear and take such action as he may deem to be for the best interests of the state, and <em>he shall represent the public interest in the protection of any gifts, legacies, or devises, intended for public or charitable purposes. </em>... He shall, when required by either branch of the general assembly, give his opinion upon questions of law submitted to him by either of said branches.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Pursuant to the clear and unambiguous language of the act, the attorney general\u2019s authority specifically excludes <em>\u201cthose legal matters over which the state\u2019s attorneys have direction.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) Id.; cf. General Statutes \u00a7 3-125 (\u201c[t]he Attorney General shall have general supervision over all legal matters in which the state is an interested party, except those legal matters over which the prosecuting officers have direction\u201d). If the attorney general\u2019s authority excludes all matters over which the state\u2019s attorneys had authority in 1897 and the state\u2019s attorneys had various common-law (and statutory) authority with respect to all criminal as well as certain civil matters at that time; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Keena, </em>supra, 64 Conn. 214-15; it necessarily follows that the state\u2019s attorneys were not divested of their common-law authority over civil matt\u00e9rs by virtue of the establishment of the office of the attorney general. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that the state\u2019s attorneys continued to represent the state in civil matters after 1897; see part IA of this opinion; and the fact that the legislature did not materially alter the statute governing the general duties of the state\u2019s attorneys after it created the office of the attorney general. Compare General Statutes (1887 Rev.) \u00a7 763 (\u201c[s]aid judges . . . shall also appoint a State\u2019s Attorney in each county, who shall act therein as attorney in behalf of the State\u201d) with General Statutes (1902 Rev.) \u00a7 471 (\u201c[t]he judges of the superior court shall appoint a state\u2019s attorney for each county, who shall act therein as attorney in behalf of the state\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">Notwithstanding the absence of any indication in the language of P.A. 191, \u00a7 2, that the common-law authority of the state\u2019s attorneys devolved to the office of the attorney general, that act did transfer to the office of the attorney general the common-law authority of the state\u2019s attorneys to represent the public interest in the protection of public and charitable gifts, legacies and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>devises. In light of the exclusionary language of the act, and in reliance on the principle of inclusio unius est exclusio alterius, we conclude that the office of the attorney general possesses only that common-law authority previously held by the state\u2019s attorneys that the legislature has transferred to that office by way of legislation.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>204 Conn. 410, 424, 528 A.2d 811 (1987) (\u201c[a]n enumeration of powers in a statute is uniformly held to forbid things not enumerated\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">We, therefore, agree with the trial court that the office of the attorney general is \u201ca creature of statute\u201d that is governed by statute and, thus, has no common-law authority.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly determined that the attorney general is without standing to pursue an action against the defendant to the extent that the attorney general seeks to remedy the defendant\u2019s alleged misappropriation of noncharitable receipts of the academy.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b458-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 3-125 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe Attorney General shall have general supervision over all legal matters in which the state is an interested party, except those legal matters over which prosecuting officers have direction. He shall appear for the state, the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, the Secretary, the Treasurer and the Comptroller, and for all heads of departments and state boards, commissioners, agents, inspectors, committees, auditors, chemists, directors, harbor masters, and institutions and for the State Librarian in all suits and other civil proceedings, except upon criminal recognizances and bail bonds, in which the state is a party or is interested, or in which the official acts and doings of said officers are called in question, and for all members of the state House of Representatives and the state Senate in all suits and other civil proceedings brought against them involving their official acts and doings in the discharge of their duties as legislators, in any court or other tribunal, as the duties of his office require; and all such suits shall be conducted by him or under his direction. When any measure affecting the State Treasury is pending before any committee of the General Assembly, such committee shall give him reasonable notice of the pendency of such measure, and he shall appear and take such action as he deems to be for the best interests of the state, and he shall represent the public interest in the protection of any gifts, legacies or devises intended for public or charitable purposes. All legal services required by such officers and boards in matters relating to their official duties shall be performed by the Attorney General or under his direction. All writs, summonses or other processes served upon such officers and legislators shall, forthwith, be transmitted by them to the Attorney General. All suits or other proceedings by such officers shall be brought by the Attorney General or under his direction. He shall, when required by either house of the General Assembly or when requested by the president pro tempore of the Senate, the speaker of the House of Representatives, or the majority leader or the minority leader of the Senate or House of Representatives, give his opinion upon questions of law submitted to him by either of said houses or any of said leaders. He shall advise or give his opinion to the head of any executive department or any state board or commission upon any question of law submitted to him. He may procure such assistance as he may require. Whenever a trustee, under the provisions of any charitable trust described in section 45a-514, is required by statute to give a bond for the performance of his duties as trustee, the Attorney General may cause a petition to be lodged with the probate court of the district in which such trust property is situated, or where any of the trustees reside, for the fixing, accepting and approving of a bond to the state, conditioned for the proper discharge of the duties of such trust, which bond shall be filed in the office of such probate court. The Attorney General shall prepare a topical and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>chronological cross-index of all legal opinions issued by the office of the Attorney General and shall, from time to time, update the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">Public Acts 2000, No. 00-99, \u00a7 19, made technical changes to \u00a7 3-125 that are not relevant to the merits of this appeal.
