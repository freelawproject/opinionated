The central issue is whether the period of time that the driver and passenger were detained while the officer retrieved the information improperly extended the traffic stop beyond what is considered reasonable under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution or Article 26 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Petitioner, Orlando Byndloss, was charged in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County with importation of 28 or more grams of cocaine (count one),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> possession of 448 or more grams of cocaine with intent to distribute (count two),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> possession of cocaine with intent to distribute (count three),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> conspiracy to distribute cocaine (count four), and possession of cocaine (count five).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On March 19, 2004, a pretrial hearing was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>held before the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County-concerning petitioner\u2019s motion to suppress the drug evidence. The motion was denied. On March 24, 2004, petitioner was subsequently tried and convicted on all counts, except conspiracy to distribute cocaine (count four), at a bench trial before the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. On May 7, 2004, the Circuit Court imposed a sentence of 15 years for importation of cocaine (count one) and a concurrent 15 years, the first five without the possibility of parole, for possession of 448 grams or more of cocaine with intent to distribute (count two). Counts three and five were merged with count two for sentencing purposes. Petitioner appealed to the Court of Special Appeals and that court affirmed the conviction. <em>Byndloss v. State, </em>162 Md.App. 286, 873 A.2d 1233 (2005). On June 21, 2005, petitioner filed a petition for writ of certiorari. On August 10, 2005, we granted certiorari. <em>Byndloss v. State, </em>388 Md. 404, 879 A.2d 1086 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Petitioner presented only one question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">\u201cDuring a routine traffic stop, may a State trooper withhold the issuance of a written warning and continue to detain the occupants of a vehicle after the driver and passenger have both provided driver\u2019s licenses and registration for the vehicle and the trooper has written a warning for the traffic infraction, but he has not issued it to the driver because the computer system, through which record[s] are checked, is inoperable, preventing the trooper from confirming the validity of the licenses and registration and checking for outstanding warrants?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">We hold that, under the particular factual circumstances of the case at bar, the police did not improperly detain petitioner. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">On November 19, 2003, Sergeant Clifford Hughes<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the Maryland State Police was on duty in the area of 1-95 and I-495 in Prince George\u2019s County. At approximately 10:58 a.m. Sergeant Hughes observed a 1997 green Chevrolet Malibu with Florida registration plates driving north on 1-95. The vehicle had a plastic license plate cover over its registration plate. The license plate of the vehicle was not clearly visible due to the plastic cover, in fact, \u201cthe vehicle registration tags and month were not visible at all.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As a result of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>violation of \u00a7 13-411 of the Transportation Article, Sergeant Hughes activated his emergency equipment and pulled the vehicle over.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Petitioner was a passenger in this vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Sergeant Hughes called in the stop to the College Park barrack and was advised that the computer systems through which licenses, vehicle registrations, and outstanding warrants are checked were down. The two systems are known as (1) Maryland Interagency Law Enforcement System (MILES) and (2) National Crime Information Center (NCIC). During the call Sergeant Hughes was not given any indication of when the systems would be up and operating again.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">At 10:59 a.m. Sergeant Hughes walked up to the vehicle on the passenger side.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> He knocked on the window of the front seat passenger. Petitioner, sitting in the front passenger seat, put the window down. Sergeant Hughes identified himself as a Maryland State Trooper and advised the driver, Joan Henry Malone, and passenger, petitioner, that they were being audibly and visually recorded.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Sergeant Hughes then asked Ms. Malone for her driver\u2019s license and registration. He explained that the reason for the stop was the plastic cover on the vehicle license plate. Ms. Malone stated that she didn\u2019t know that it was illegal and volunteered to remove it from the vehicle. Sergeant Hughes explained to her that it was too dangerous to do that due to the traffic on 1-95. Throughout <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>this conversation Ms. Malone was still looking for her driver\u2019s license and registration card.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">When Ms. Malone handed over her driver\u2019s license and registration card Sergeant Hughes noticed that her hands were shaking and that she seemed \u201cnervous\u201d and \u201crestless.\u201d Sergeant Hughes asked Ms. Malone where she was going and she told him that she was on her way from Florida to New York. At this time petitioner also gave Sergeant Hughes his driver\u2019s license.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> At 11:02 a.m. the conversation ended and Sergeant Hughes went back to his vehicle with the driver\u2019s licenses and registration card.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Sergeant Hughes sat in his vehicle, called for a K-9 unit, and then proceeded to write a warning for the license plate cover. He did not immediately call his dispatcher and ask them to run Ms. Malone\u2019s and petitioner\u2019s information through MILES and NCIC because he had been informed that the systems were down. Sergeant Hughes testified that he told the other officer on the scene \u201cI\u2019m going to talk to them a little more, she is real nervous.\u201d At 11:08 a.m., when he was finished writing the warning, Sergeant Hughes called back the College Park barrack and asked whether the systems were still down. The dispatcher advised him that the systems were still down, but that the problem only affected the College Park barrack. The dispatcher then advised him to contact either the Rockville or Forestville barrack because their systems were up and functioning. Sergeant Hughes then decided to hold off on giving Ms. Malone the written warning because he had not yet been able to run the licenses and registration through MILES and NCIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">At 11:09 a.m. Sergeant Hughes switched over to another channel and called the Waterloo barrack, which was the closest barrack, approximately three miles north of the stop. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Upon receiving the call, the dispatcher at the Waterloo barrack advised Sergeant Hughes that he could not hear him due to background noise or interference. At 11:10 a.m. Sergeant Hughes called the Waterloo dispatcher back using his cell phone. Sergeant Hughes requested license and outstanding warrant checks for Ms. Malone and petitioner and provided the dispatcher with the information from their driver\u2019s licenses and Ms. Malone\u2019s registration card. The Waterloo dispatcher said that he would call him back with the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">While waiting to hear back from the Waterloo dispatcher, Sergeant Hughes got out of his vehicle and approached Ms. Malone\u2019s car. He explained to her that he was waiting for a license and warrant check to come back, and as soon as that came back, they would be free to go. He then asked Ms. Malone to step out of the car and come to the rear of the vehicle. Sergeant Hughes testified that he again explained to her that \u201capparently the system was being slow today and as soon as the information came back, she would be free to go, and explained to her because of liability purposes, [he] couldn\u2019t allow her to drive away without knowing if her license was suspended or anything.\u201d Sergeant Hughes then asked Ms. Malone again about her trip and where she was going:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">\u201cShe told me she was going to New Jersey, and she had previously told me she was going to New York. I asked her did she have a lot of luggage in the vehicle and she said no. She had previously told me she was going to stay a week, and I asked her how she was going to stay a week without a lot of luggage, and she stated that she wasn\u2019t going to stay a week because she had to go back to work. Her stories were inconsistent with what she had previously stated to me. And at that time I also noticed that her eyes were watering and she appeared to be crying. She was jumpy. She couldn\u2019t keep still and she was holding herself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">On the video of the stop it is evident that it had become windy as Sergeant Hughes and Ms. Malone were standing outside and Ms. Malone stated that she was cold. After finishing their conversation, Sergeant Hughes returned to his police car and Ms. Malone remained standing outside.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>At 11:19 a.m. Sergeant Hughes received a call from the College Park dispatcher informing him that Trooper First Class (TFC) Butler, the certified K-9 handler, could not locate Sergeant Hughes. After this call Sergeant Hughes called back the Waterloo barrack to see if they had received the information from MILES and NCIC. The Waterloo police communications officer told him to \u201cstand by,\u201d which, according to the officer\u2019s testimony, means to wait and not transmit. At this point, Sergeant Hughes asked Ms. Malone, who was still outside on the side of the road, if she wanted to have a seat in his car and she agreed. Sergeant Hughes again explained to her that he was still waiting on the checks. After she further initiated conversation, he asked her whether \u201cthere were any weapons, narcotics, untaxed cigarettes, contraband, currency, et cetera, in the vehicle, and she said no.\u201d At 11:23 a.m. Sergeant Hughes called back the Waterloo barrack using his cell phone and spoke to the duty officer. He advised the duty officer that the police communications officer was taking a long time and was informed that they were very busy and would get back to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">At 11:26 a.m. TFC Butler, the K-9 handler, arrived. Sergeant Hughes spoke with TFC Butler and asked him to conduct a scan of Ms. Malone\u2019s vehicle, which TFC Butler then began to do. At 11:27 a.m. the Waterloo barrack communications operator called Sergeant Hughes back and said that petitioner had an extensive criminal background in New York and Florida, but did not provide any information at this time on Ms. Malone. Soon thereafter, at approximately 11:30 a.m., Sergeant Hughes testified that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-6\">\u201cAt the same time TFC Butler is running the dog around the vehicle, I observed the dog sit to the right-rear side of the vehicle, which I knew as a positive sit alert for the presence of narcotics....I then explained to [Ms. Malone] that based on the positive sit alert of the K-9, that I was going to conduct a probable cause search of her vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Azp\">Petitioner was asked to get out of Ms. Malone\u2019s vehicle and Sergeant Hughes and TFC Butler then conducted a thorough search of that car from 11:30 a.m. to 11:40 a.m. A search of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>large suitcase found in the trunk revealed male clothes packed tightly together and in the center of the suitcase, in a white plastic bag, two plastic vest-like panels taped with yellow masking tape. These packages contained approximately two kilograms of cocaine.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Sergeant Hughes then arrested Ms. Malone and petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">The Waterloo barrack\u2019s dispatcher never called back with further information concerning Ms. Malone or petitioner. After the arrests, Sergeant Hughes returned to the College Park barrack and had the police communications officer run Ms. Malone\u2019s information through MILES and NCIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">After the preceding testimony, the Circuit Court at the \u201cMotion to Suppress\u201d hearing issued its ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-7\">\u201cIn this instance, we have a confluence of misfortune on behalf of the defendants and poor timing on the part of the [Sjtate in which the Trooper, through absolutely no fault of his own, was stuck with a K-9 officer that he called for at 11:02, who apparently got lost, and said he couldn\u2019t find the Trooper, who was clearly visible on the side of the road, but apparently on the opposite side of the six\u2014or eight\u2014lane highway from where the K-9 officer was looking for him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">\u201cAnd you had that, plus the fact that his home barracks in College Park had its computer down. And clearly until the second call that the Trooper made, he could not be certain whether it was the entire NCIC [or] MILES system and its connection to the state police or whether it was only the local computers at College Park, which it turned out to be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-9\">\u201cHe was directed at College Park to call either Frederick or Rockville\u2014Forestville or Rockville, which might have made sense if you\u2019re sitting in College Park and you know <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>that College Park is halfway between those two locations, but, in fact, the Trooper was on 1-95 in the northbound lanes at or near the intersection with the Route 198 cut\u2014 off, and he knew that from the 198 exit, the Waterloo barracks is only a couple of miles down the road, whereas Rockville was 20 miles away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-5\">\u201cLearn your geography and you\u2019ll know the answer to that. I happen to know that, having driven it many times. And I think there is an old case from Judge Chasanow that says Pm allowed to take judicial notice of local geography. Because apparently you all don\u2019t know how to figure those things out. But anyway, that\u2019s the reality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">\u201cForestville was probably much farther than Rockville. Rockville was certainly much farther than Waterloo, which was the next barracks closer to College Park. What the Trooper didn\u2019t anticipate was that making that call for the records check was going to hit at the same time that apparently the Waterloo barracks was inundated either with an inefficient dispatcher or somebody who was inundated with a lot of calls coming in at just that particular time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-7\">\u201cSo he was waiting in good faith for the records check to come back. I believe that I was wrong, and while I could appreciate your not wanting to correct me, but I frankly didn\u2019t remember what the finding was in <em>[Wilkes],[</em><footnotemark>13</footnotemark>] and the <em>[Wilkes] </em>case clearly says that a K-9 sniffing on the exterior of a vehicle or even a suitcase does not create any Fourth Amendment issue whatsoever because the K-9 does not intrude into anything, and we saw that plainly on the video.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-8\">\u201cSo the length of time that it happened to take for both the K-9 and the records check were almost exactly and precisely concurrent. The records check, I believe, call came back while the dog was wandering around the vehicle, if I recall. If not, it was within a minute or so of the dog arriving and going around the vehicle. I observed the dog. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>I saw him stop twice, sniffing where it appeared to me that the defendant was seated on the passenger side of the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-5\">\u201cAgain, as I said earlier, you can\u2019t tell on a two\u2014 dimensional video what the distance is from the rear of the vehicle to the passenger door, but that was the area in which I saw him kind of sniff a little bit and then get pulled away by the handler to move on and go around the vehicle again. But he did that on each of the first two circuits and it was only on the third circuit that he came around and actually sat. But he was sitting on the same side of the vehicle that he had sniffed before. So I couldn\u2019t tell whether he was sniffing at the front passenger door or right behind that or closer to the rear of the vehicle on the side of the trunk by the rear door.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-6\">\u201cClearly, the officers who reported believed that the dog was indicating at the rear of the passenger compartment. They checked there to no avail. I watched the video and you could see the Trooper actually reach deep into the trunk to pull some piece of luggage, or whatever it was, to the front of the trunk in order to then search it. So whether it was in that area just above the wheel well, which would have been approximately where the dog was indicating, is really something for conjecture because I don\u2019t think that video is going to get any clearer no matter how many times you watch it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-7\">\u201cSo you\u2019re going to have to wait for that, for the testimony of the handler as to where he was indicating. But I\u2019m satisfied that there was enough at that indication to become then probable cause for a full search of the vehicle, passenger compartment and trunk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-8\">\u201cNow, as to the delay, I find no impermissible delay because it was absolutely not a pretext for the officer to be waiting for a call back to confirm whether or not there were outstanding warrants or any illegality in the licensing of the driver. While it appears at first blush that because he was able to very quickly clear up any confusion by the registration plate obscuring date\u2014or month and year, he cleared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>that up, apparently, very quickly with the driver\u2019s license and registration card, but at the time that he was able to look at that, he was also calling in the information for outstanding warrant and criminal record check, which is routine procedure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">\u201cThe delay was caused through no fault of the officer. It was not a pretext. Granted he did try and do some more investigative work while talking pre\u2014arrest with the defendant Malone, but all that established was some inconsistencies in what she had told him that raised his suspicions. In fact, he had already requested K-9 assistance. So those reasonable suspicions certainly didn\u2019t go to his effort to get a K-9 officer out there because he had already made that decision. So I find those to be irrelevant to this finding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">\u201cBut I don\u2019t see anything other than due diligence in the officer\u2019s part in making the stop.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The hearings judge declined to suppress .the evidence of the cocaine as a violation of petitioner\u2019s Fourth Amendment or Article 26 protections against illegal search and seizure. At trial, the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County convicted petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">On appeal, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the motions judge and the Circuit Court\u2019s decision, finding that \u201cthe purpose for the stop had not been accomplished before the K-9 Unit arrived\u201d and that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-9\">\u201cThe initial stop was not concluded and, therefore, no additional reasonable suspicion was needed to support continued detention of the vehicle, beyond that which supported the initial stop for violation of the traffic laws. By the time the record check information was finally relayed to the officer, revealing that [petitioner] had an extensive criminal background, the K-9 dog had already signaled that there were drugs in the vehicle, and the officers then validly searched it. <em>See, e.g., Wallace v. State, </em>142 Md.App. 673, 686, 791 A.2d 968 (2002) (probable- cause exists to search a vehicle once a drug dog alerts the officers to the potential presence of drugs in it). The detention lasted only long enough to complete procedures incident to the traffic stop.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number><em>Byndloss v. State, </em>162 Md.App. 286, 314-15, 873 A.2d 1233, 1250-51 (2005). We agree with this holding\u2014that under the factual circumstances present in this particular case, the initial stop was not concluded and the \u201cdetention lasted only long enough to complete procedures incident to the traffic stop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Our review of the Circuit Court\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s motion to suppress is ordinarily limited to the record of the suppression hearing, and not the record of the trial. <em>Whiting v. State, </em>389 Md. 334, 345, 885 A.2d 785, 791 (2005); <em>State v. Nieves, </em>383 Md. 573, 581, 861 A.2d 62, 67 (2004); <em>Laney v.

We review the facts and evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party on the motion, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the State. <em>Whiting, </em>389 Md. at 345, 885 A.2d at 791; <em>Nieves, </em>383 Md. at 581, 861 A.2d at 67; <em>Laney, </em>379 Md. at 533, 842 A.2d at 779; <em>Dashiell, </em>374 Md. at 93, 821 A.2d at 376-77 (quoting <em>Collins, </em>367 Md. at 707, 790 A.2d at 664) (citing <em>Riddick v. State, </em>319 Md. 180, 183, 571 A.2d 1239, 1240 (1990)). We extend great deference to the hearing judge\u2019s fact finding and will not disturb the findings unless clearly erroneous, however, we review independently the application of the law to those facts to determine if the evidence at issue was obtained in violation of the law and, accordingly, should be suppressed. <em>Whiting, </em>389 Md. at 345, 885 A.2d at 791; <em>Nieves, </em>383 Md. at 581-82, 861 A.2d at 67; <em>Laney, </em>379 Md. at 533-34, 842 A.2d at 779-80; <em>Dashiell, </em>374 Md. at 93-94, 821 A.2d at 377 (citing <em>Lancaster v.

Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Petitioner contends that the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that the motions court properly denied his motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>to suppress the evidence of the cocaine recovered from Ms. Malone\u2019s vehicle. Specifically, he argues that his detention by Sergeant Hughes while the trooper was waiting for information from MILES and NCIC amounted to an improper extended amount of time of detention in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. Petitioner posits that the traffic stop was longer than necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop, i.e., the warning for the plastic license plate cover.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The State argues that Sergeant Hughes reasonably detained petitioner while awaiting the results of a routine license and warrant check on Ms. Malone.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Extended Length of the Traffic Stop</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">The case <em>sub judice </em>tests what is a reasonable extension of the length of a traffic stop in order for police to receive radio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>verification of the validity of an individual\u2019s driver\u2019s license, vehicle registration, and warrants check. It is petitioner\u2019s contention that the length of the detention of the driver, and thus himself, in the case at bar was unreasonable and therefore the K-9 search was a violation of his constitutional rights. We find that under the particular facts and circumstances of this case, the initial traffic stop was still ongoing at the time of the K-9 scan and resultant alert. The facts indicate that Sergeant Hughes exercised reasonable diligence under the circumstances, in obtaining the license, registration, and warrant information from MILES and NCIC and there was no evidence extant that the stop was extended beyond the time necessary to reasonably complete all of the actions associated with resolving the initial purpose of the stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-5\">\u201cThe light of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">The Fourth Amendment protects against <em>unreasonable </em>searches and seizures. <em>See Whren v.

Pursuant to \u00a7 13-411 of the Transportation Article, Sergeant Hughes conducted a lawful stop of Ms. Malone\u2019s green Chevrolet Malibu, in which petitioner was the front seat passenger, after observing that the car\u2019s license plate was obscured by a plastic license plate cover. Petitioner does not challenge the stop itself<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> or even the <em>Carroll</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark><em> </em>search of the vehicle made after the K-9 alerted to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>presence of narcotics.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Petitioner argues that \u201cthe constitutional violation was the unreasonably prolonged detention or seizure of [petitioner], a passenger in a ear that was stopped because a registration plate cover was displayed on the vehicle\u2019s rear tag.\u201d Petitioner contends that the cocaine recovered from the vehicle was \u201cthe fruit[ ] of the unlawful detention\u201d and therefore must be suppressed. <em>See Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 488, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963). Petitioner\u2019s argument boils down to two points: (1) Ms. Malone and petitioner were detained longer than necessary for the issuance of a warning or citation for having the plastic license plate cover and (2) the continued detention was not justified by the circumstances that took place over the \u201cbrief period of time that it <em>should have taken </em>to determine the status of the driver, passenger and vehicle.\u201d We find that Ms. Malone and petitioner were not detained longer than necessary under the circumstances present in the case <em>sub judice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Because petitioner does not dispute the legitimacy of the stop, we find that the initial seizure was justified and turn to address whether the traffic stop was \u201clonger than is necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop.\u201d <em>See Royer, </em>460 U.S. at 500, 103 S.Ct. at 1325, 75 L.Ed.2d 229. In our determination of whether petitioner\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights have been violated, we must first establish when the initial legitimate stop ends. As we discussed in <em>State v. Green, </em>375 Md. 595, 826 A.2d 486 (2003):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-5\">\u201cJudge Raker, speaking for this Court, has drawn a bright line, demarcating the point at which an ordinary traffic stop ends:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-6\">In sum, the officer\u2019s purpose in an ordinary traffic stop is to enforce the laws of the roadway, and ordinarily to investigate the manner of driving with the intent to issue a citation or warning. Once the purpose of that stop has been fulfilled, the continued detention of the car and the occupants amounts to a second detention. <em>See Royer, </em>460 U.S. at 500, 103 S.Ct. at 1325-26. Thus, once the underlying basis for the initial traffic stop has concluded, a police-driver encounter which implicates the Fourth Amendment is constitutionally permissible only if either (1) the driver consents to the continuing intrusion or (2) the officer has, at a minimum, a reasonable, articulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot. <em>United States v. Sandoval, </em>29 F.3d 537, 540 (10th Cir.1994).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">355 Md. at 372, 735 A.2d at 499. This language clarifies that, after a traffic citation or warning has been issued, the Fourth Amendment allows only (1) consensual encounters between the police officer and driver, and (2) detentions supported by, at least, reasonable articulable suspicion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQE\"><em>Green, </em>375 Md. at 610, 826 A.2d at 495. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the initial justified detention was not concluded at the time the K-9 dog alerted to the presence of narcotics in the car. Due to the systems being down at the College Park barrack and then the delayed response of the Waterloo barrack, Sergeant Hughes had not been able to obtain information to verify the validity of the licenses, Ms. Malone\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>registration, or conduct a warrant check on Ms. Malone or petitioner. The initial purpose of the stop had not been fulfilled. Therefore, petitioner\u2019s only available argument is that the length of the detention was not reasonable, and that the resulting search of the vehicle should be found to be a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Petitioner \u201cacknowledges that the length of a traffic stop, per se, is not dispositive of whether the traffic stop was unreasonable, but it is a factor to consider with all of the other circumstances.\u201d As we have discussed previously in <em>Wilkes:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9O\">\u201cThe Supreme Court has expressly rejected imposing rigid time limitations on traffic stops. <em>See [United States </em>v.] <em>Sharpe, </em>470 U.S. [675,] 685, 105 S.Ct. [1568,] 1575, 84 L.Ed.2d 605 [(1985)]. In that case, the Supreme Court noted that as \u2018[m]uch as a \u201cbright-line\u201d rule would be desirable, in evaluating whether an investigative detention is unreasonable, common sense and ordinary human experience must govern over rigid criteria.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court continued:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-6\">In assessing whether a detention is too long in duration to be justified as an investigative stop, we consider it appropriate to examine whether the police diligently pursued a means of investigation that was likely to confirm or dispel their suspicions quickly, during which time it was necessary to detain the defendant. A court making this assessment should take care to consider whether the police are acting in a swiftly developing situation, and in such cases the court should not indulge in unrealistic second-guessing. A creative judge engaged in <em>post hoc </em>evaluation of police conduct can almost always imagine some alternative means by which the objectives of the police might have been accomplished. But \u2018[t]he fact that the protection of the public might, in the abstract, have been accomplished by \u201cless intrusive\u201d means does not, itself, render the search unreasonable.\u2019 The question is not simply whether some other alternative was available, but whether the police acted unreasonably in failing to recognize or to pursue it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 686-87, 105 S.Ct. at 1575-76, 84 L.Ed.2d 605 (citations omitted).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-6\"><em>Wilkes, </em>364 Md. at 576-77, 774 A.2d at 433. We will not simply determine that a stop was unreasonable due to the length of time over which it occurred. Based on <em>Sharpe, </em>it is necessary to revisit the facts, as expounded upon <em>supra, </em>in order to determine whether Sergeant Hughes \u201cdiligently pursued\u201d the retrieval of the license, registration, and warrant information from MILES and NCIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">On November 19, 2003, at 10:58 a.m. Sergeant Hughes pulled the vehicle over. At this time Sergeant Hughes called in the stop to the College Park barrack and was notified that the MILES and NCIC information systems were down but was not given an indication of when they would be back up. At 10:59 a.m. he approached the vehicle, notified the driver, Ms. Malone, of the infraction, spoke with her for a few minutes and obtained her driver\u2019s license and registration for the vehicle as well as the passenger\u2019s (petitioner) driver\u2019s license. At 11:02 a.m. Sergeant Hughes returned to his patrol vehicle, called for a K-9 handler, examined the documents and wrote out a warning for the plastic license plate cover. When he was finished, at 11:08 a.m., he called back the College Park barrack to see if the system was back up. He was informed that it was still down, but that he should contact another barrack because the system failure was limited to College Park. Sergeant Hughes then called the Waterloo barrack, located approximately three miles north of the location of the stop. It was 11:09 a.m. and there was apparently too much background noise or interference for the dispatcher to hear. Sergeant Hughes then, immediately, at 11:10 a.m. used his cell phone to call back the dispatcher. He provided the dispatcher with all of the necessary information to run the check and the dispatcher told him that he would call him back over the air once he received the information. Sergeant Hughes then got out of his vehicle, walked up to Ms. Malone\u2019s car and informed her that he was waiting on the results of a license and warrant check.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>It is at this point in the stop that petitioner argues that the length of the detention has become unreasonable. Petitioner acknowledges that \u201cpolice may conduct checks of driver\u2019s licenses, vehicle registrations and warrant statuses during a traffic stop....\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> However, petitioner contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>\u201csuch authority is premised on the fact that this information can be accessed quickly.\u201d As the Court in <em>Wilkes </em>discussed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AW9\">\u201cSuch holdings make sense as modern technology has availed police officers with the ability to quickly access relevant information without unnecessarily prolonging the duration of the stop or unreasonably increasing the level of intrusion. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>763 F.2d 1127, 1130 (10th Cir.1985) (\u2018The police officer had a car radio and contact thereby with dispatchers who had instant access to the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) computer records that could quickly resolve, with reasonable certainty, whether there were warrants outstanding against the driver and whether the car had been reported stolen.\u2019).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArO\"><em>Wilkes, </em>364 Md. at 579, 774 A.2d at 435. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>petitioner argues that the detention continued beyond a period during which the police would \u201cnormally\u201d have received information concerning the driver\u2019s licenses, registration, and warrant check.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Sergeant Hughes didn\u2019t hear back from either dispatcher until 11:19 a.m. At that time the College Park dispatcher called to inform him that the K-9 handler was lost and could not find the stop location. Sergeant Hughes then called the Waterloo barrack again to see if the license check and warrant information had come back, and was told to \u201cstand by.\u201d At 11:23 a.m., tired of waiting for a response, Sergeant Hughes called back the Waterloo barrack using his cell phone and spoke to the duty officer, who told him that they were very busy. At 11:26 a.m. the K-9 handler arrived and proceeded to conduct a scan on Ms. Malone\u2019s vehicle. At 11:27 a.m. the Waterloo barrack called Sergeant Hughes back and said that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>petitioner had an extensive criminal background,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> however, the dispatcher did not provide any outstanding warrant information nor did he provide any information on the driver, Ms. Malone. At 11:30 a.m. the K-9 dog alerted to the presence of narcotics in Ms. Malone\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">We addressed similar factual circumstances in <em>Wilkes. </em>In <em>Wilkes, </em>a vehicle was stopped for exceeding the speed limit. While the police were awaiting the results of a records check, a K-9 dog arrived, scanned the vehicle and alerted to the presence of narcotics. We upheld the search. In that case, however, there was no argument that the retrieval of the records check took an unreasonable amount of time. The K-9 unit had arrived within five minutes of the stop. Petitioner draws our attention to a footnote in <em>Wilkes, </em>in which we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">\u201cUnder the facts of the instant case, the K-9 scan, at the least, occurred while the troopers were waiting for conclusive warrant information, and that period of time, itself, was not unreasonably long. An overly long period of waiting for warrant information may well create problems relating to Fourth Amendment compliance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">364 Md. at 583-84 n. 22, 774 A.2d at 438 n. 22. While it is true that an overly long detention while waiting for warrant information may create Fourth Amendment problems, we do not find the period of detention in the case <em>sub judice, </em>based upon the particular facts and circumstances, to be such an occasion. As the Court in <em>Wilkes </em>also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">\u201cIf the K-9 scan was conducted prior to [the Trooper] receiving any information from the [barrack] concerning the computer check, then, as we have indicated ... the initial purpose for the traffic stop was not yet fulfilled and the K-9 scan was justified without additional independent reasonable articulable suspicion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>364 Md. at 583, 774 A.2d at 437. It is evident in the case at bar that the K-9 scan was being conducted prior to Sergeant Hughes receiving any information concerning the records check and thus, the initial purpose for the stop was not yet fulfilled.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">In <em>Wilkes, </em>we discussed <em>Pryor v. State, </em>122 Md.App. 671, 716 A.2d 338, <em>cert. denied, </em>352 Md. 312, 721 A.2d 990 (1998), a case in which a driver was stopped for exceeding the speed limit. The driver was then detained and made to wait for a K-9 unit to arrive. Under the circumstances presented in <em>Pryor, </em>the Court of Special Appeals suppressed the evidence obtained from the search, finding that a person stopped for a minor traffic violation \u201ccannot be detained at the scene of the stop longer than it takes\u2014or reasonably should take\u2014to issue a citation for the traffic violation that the motorist committed.\u201d 122 Md.App. at 674-75, 716 A.2d at 340. However, as we pointed out in <em>Wilkes:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-6\">\u201cthat court also recognized that there may be reasons that justify the extension of a traffic stop: \u2018[tjhis is not a case in which an extended detention of the motorist could be justified by the need to administer a \u201cfield sobriety\u201d test or <em>by technical difficulties in determining the status of the motorist\u2019s license or the ownership of the vehicle that has been stopped.\u2019 \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">364 Md. at 575 n. 16, 774 A.2d at 433 n. 16 (citing <em>Pryor, </em>122 Md.App. at 681-82 n. 7, 716 A.2d at 343 n. 7). The extended period of detention in the case <em>sub judice </em>was caused by technical difficulties in determining the status of Ms. Malone\u2019s and petitioner\u2019s driver\u2019s licenses, the registration of the vehicle, and warrant checks. There is no evidence that Sergeant Hughes was anything but diligent in his attempts at obtaining that information.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">It is established that a records check of a driver\u2019s license, registration, and outstanding warrants is an integral part of any traffic stop. <em>See Prouse, </em>440 U.S. at 663, 99 S.Ct. at 1401, 59 L.Ed.2d 660; <em>Wilkes, </em>364 Md. at 578, 774 A.2d at 434.

State], </em>370 Md. [648,] 661-62, 805 A.2d 1086, [1094 (2002)]. We have similarly opined that a single detention takes place and a K-9 scan for drugs is constitutionally permissible in situations where the scan is \u2018at a point in time when the trooper \u201cwas still awaiting the results of the license and registration check [and] the scan did not prolong the detention.\u2019 \u201d <em>Graham v.

Before the check was completed, the canine quickly scanned the vehicle and indicated the presence of drugs. We held that \u2018only one detention occurred,\u2019 as the \u2018trained dog arrived on the scene while [the police officer] was still running a check on [the defendant\u2019s] license and registration, and the scan took place as the deputy completed the check.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 437, 589 A.2d [at 1327], <em>See Graham, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>119 Md.App. at 458, 705 A.2d 82 (citing <em>Montrail </em>with approval for an example of what constitutes a single detention).

He knew that the College Park barrack\u2019s system was down when he first made the stop, but not how long it would be dowm or whether the problem was systemic, affecting the other barracks. He made his second call to College Park within a reasonable time period to see if the system was back up. At that point he was informed that he should call another barrack, which he immediately did. The Waterloo barrack informed him that they would call him with the information. When they didn\u2019t get back to him quickly, he called them back on two different occasions.

Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">We find that, under the particular facts and circumstances present in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the initial stop by Sergeant Hughes was not concluded at the time the K-9 dog alerted to the presence of narcotics. Sergeant Hughes with sufficient diligence pursued the acquisition of the records check involving the validity of Ms. Malone\u2019s driver\u2019s license and registration, petitioner\u2019s driver\u2019s license, as well as warrant checks on both individuals. We find that the seizure or detention was reasonable under the circumstances. Therefore, there was no violation of petitioner\u2019s Fourth Amendment or Article 26 rights.

While under the circumstances, i.e., on a trip from Florida to New York, sitting in a vehicle alongside a major interstate highway with the officer in possession of his license, it was extremely unlikely that any such passenger would attempt to leave the scene; nonetheless, the record does not indicate that the officer had ordered the petitioner not to leave. His \"detention\u201d (if that is what it was) was incidental to the driver\u2019s detention. We are holding that the extent of the detention was not violative of petitioner\u2019s rights. No issue is raised as to the standing of the passenger to object to the driver\u2019s detention at a traffic stop. Therefore, it is not necessary to resolve the question of whether a passenger has a right to object to the length of the detention of a driver which is based on the driver\u2019s traffic violation, as it is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">In the case <em>sub judice </em>there is no evidence in the record that petitioner attempted to resist the \"detention,\u201d as there was in <em>Dennis v.

The questioning that took place occurred while the officers were waiting for the results of the computer check.

The majority characterizes the central issue in the case as \u201cwhether the extended length of time that the driver and passenger were detained while the officer retrieved the information improperly extended the traffic stop beyond what is considered reasonable under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution or Article 26 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.\u201d 391 Md. 462, 465, 893 A.2d 1119, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>1123 (2006) (footnote omitted). After analyzing the nature of the stop, however, and the officer\u2019s diligence, as the majority does, we are led to a contrary conclusion; namely, that the lack of reasonable suspicion and the officer\u2019s lack of diligence resulted in an unreasonable detainment of the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">A law enforcement officer\u2019s objective in a routine traffic stop is to enforce the laws of the roadway and, ordinarily, to investigate the manner of driving with the intent to issue a citation or warning. Our Court\u2019s view is crystallized in <em>Ferris v. State, </em>355 Md. 356, 369, 735 A.2d 491, 497-98 (1999), in which Judge Raker summarized several Supreme Court holdings concerning the Fourth Amendment as it relates to traffic stops:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-6\">\u201c[A] traffic stop involving a motorist is a detention which implicates the Fourth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Sharpe, </em>470 U.S. 675, 682, 105 S.Ct. 1568, 1573, 84 L.Ed.2d 605 (1985); <em>Berkemer v.

[Ojrdinarily such a stop does not initially violate the federal Constitution if the police have probable cause to believe that the driver has committed a traffic violation. <em>Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 810, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 1772, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996). Nonetheless, ... it [is] clear that the detention of a person \u2018must be temporary and last no longer than is necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop.\u2019 <em>Florida v. Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 500, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 1325, 75 L.Ed.2d 229 (1983) (plurality opinion).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Once the purpose of that stop has been fulfilled, the continued detention of the car and the occupants amounts to a second detention. <em>See Royer, </em>460 U.S. at 500, 103 S.Ct. at 1325-26, 75 L.Ed.2d at 238. Thus, once the underlying basis for the initial traffic stop has concluded, a police-driver encounter which implicates the Fourth Amendment is constitutionally permissible only if either (1) the driver consents to the continuing intrusion or (2) the officer has, at a minimum, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>reasonable, articulable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot. <em>See United States v. Sandoval 29 </em>F.3d 537, 540 (10th Cir.1994). Many other courts around the country, in addressing traffic stops under similar circumstances, have held that a continued detention, absent independent justification, constitutes an illegal seizure under the Fourth Amendment. In <em>Ferns, </em>for example, we acknowledged the observations of the Supreme Court of Colorado:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-5\">\u201cWhen, as here, the purpose for which the investigatory stop was instituted has been accomplished and no other reasonable suspicion exists to support further investigation, there is no justification for continued detention and interrogation of citizens. <em>People v.

Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968) and its progeny that a <em>Terry </em>stop must not only be justified at its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>inception, but its scope throughout must be reasonably related to the circumstances which justify the intrusion. <em>United States v. Babwah, </em>972 F.2d 30, 33 (2nd Cir.1992).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2M\"><em>Id. </em>at 373, 735 A.2d at 500.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">We glean from the case law that a detention or seizure becomes unreasonable if an individual is detained longer than it should reasonably take to check on a driver\u2019s license, registration, or other investigative information. Further, it is important to note, as the Court of Special Appeals illustrated in <em>Carter v. State, </em>143 Md.App. 670, 692-93, 795 A.2d 790, 803 (2002), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-6\">\u201c[o]nce a reasonable time for the processing of a traffic charge has expired, even a minimal further delay to accommodate the arrival of a drug-sniffing canine is not permitted. <em>Graham v. State, </em>119 Md.App. 444, 469, 705 A.2d 82 (1998). That foreclosure is for the obvious reason that the dog sniff, however valuable it might be for other investigative purposes, does not in any way serve the purpose of ... justifying [the initial] traffic stop. Once the purpose of the traffic stop has been fully and reasonably served, no further detention is permitted\u2014unless, in the course of the traffic stop, some independent articulable or reasonable suspicion has arisen to create some new and self-sufficient investigative purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">In this context, it is, thus, imperative to keep in focus the sequence of events that transpired in the case <em>sub judice </em>after Sergeant Hughes stopped the vehicle operated by Ms. Malone:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Amr\">10:59 a.m. Sergeant Hughes approaches the vehicle after the stop. The reason for the stop was that a plastic cover over the license plate obscured the tag. The driver, Ms. Malone, according to the officer, seemed nervous and restless. Ms. Malone volunteered to remove the plastic cover, however, the Sergeant told her that removing the cover on Interstate 95 would be too dangerous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-8\">11:02 After retrieving both Ms. Malone\u2019s driver\u2019s license and registration; and the petitioner\u2019s driver\u2019s license, Sergeant Hughes went back to his vehicle. He told the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>other officer on the scene, \u201cI\u2019m going to talk to them a little more, she is real nervous.\u201d He called and requested a K-9 unit after the initial contact with Ms. Malone and Mr. Byndloss, when he knew the College Park Barracks (\u201cCPB\u201d) computer system was down. More importantly, Sergeant Hughes wrote a warning for the tag violation but did not give it to Ms. Malone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-5\">11:08 Sergeant Hughes then called the CPB. The CPB told him that the system was down and advised him that the Rockville or Forestville Barrack\u2019s systems were up and running.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-6\">11:09 Sergeant Hughes called the Waterloo Barracks<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because it was geographically closer to the traffic stop than both the Rockville or Forestville Barracks, but the Waterloo dispatcher could not hear him due to background noise and interference during the transmission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-7\">11:10 Sergeant Hughes called the Waterloo Barracks from his cell phone, and provided Ms. Malone\u2019s and Mr. Byndloss\u2019s information and asked for license and outstanding warrant checks on both individuals. As he waited for a reply from the Waterloo Barracks, he exited his vehicle, approached Ms. Malone\u2019s vehicle and told her to get out of the car and come to the rear of the vehicle. He told her that the system was slow and asked her questions about where she was traveling, how long she was staying at her destination and about her luggage. He noticed that she had been crying, was jumpy and her stories were inconsistent. Because the weather was windy and cold, Ms. Malone told the officer that she was cold. The Sergeant returned to his patrol car, leaving Ms. Malone standing alongside Interstate 95.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-8\">11:19-11:20 The CPB called and told the officer that the K-9 unit could not find the location of the traffic stop. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Again Sergeant Hughes called the Waterloo Barracks and was told to \u201cstand by.\u201d Sergeant Hughes noticed that Ms. Malone was still outside and asked her if she would like to sit in his vehicle.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He asked her if there was any contraband in her vehicle. She said no, she did not think there was contraband in the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-5\">11:23 Sergeant Hughes, using his cell phone, called the Waterloo Barracks again and was informed that they were busy and would get back to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">11:26 The K-9 unit arrived.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-7\">11:27 The Waterloo Barracks called and informed the Sergeant that the Mr. Byndloss had an extensive criminal record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-8\">11:30-11:40 The K-9 made a hit on the vehicle for drugs. A search was conducted, in which drugs were found in the trunk, in a suitcase containing men\u2019s clothing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">Having made a valid traffic stop based on the tag violation, the Sergeant, within ten minutes had conducted the necessary investigation, obtained the requisite information, addressed the matter with the driver, and made the determination that a warning ticket should be issued. Sergeant Hughes could not complete a license and registration check because the computers at his barracks were down. It is worth noting that there is no requirement that a trooper must complete a record check when the computer is down. At this point, absent some reasonable articulable suspicion, the stop should have ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">According to Sergeant Hughes, however, his observation that Ms. Malone appeared \u201cnervous\u201d and \u201crestless\u201d made him \u201csuspicious.\u201d Although he requested and obtained both Ms. Malone\u2019s and Mr. Byndloss\u2019s identification,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Ms. Malone\u2019s de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>meanor apparently made such an impact on the Sergeant that he not only told the accompanying officer that he was \u201cgoing to talk to them a little more, she is real nervous,\u201d but his \u201csuspicion\u201d also led him to call the K-9 unit first, before running a check on the driver\u2019s and passenger\u2019s identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Previously, we have held that if a person is nervous when pulled over by a police officer, that behavior does not rise to the level of reasonable suspicion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-6\">\u201c[NJervousness ... of the driver pulled over by a Maryland State trooper is not sufficient to form the basis of police suspicion.... There is no earthly way that a police officer can distinguish the nervousness of an ordinary citizen under such circumstances from the nervousness of a criminal who traffics in narcotics. An individual\u2019s physiological reaction to a proposed intrusion into his or her privacy cannot establish probable cause or even grounds to suspect. Permitting citizen\u2019s nervousness to be the basis for a finding of probable cause would confer upon the police a degree of discretion not grounded in police expertise, and, moreover, would be totally insusceptible to judicial review.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-7\"><em>Ferris, </em>355 Md. at 388, 735 A.2d at 508 (quoting <em>Whitehead v. State, </em>116 Md.App. 497, 505, 698 A.2d 1115, 1119 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Moreover, in <em>Ferris, </em>this Court cautioned against \u201cplacing too much reliance upon a suspect\u2019s nervousness when analyzing a determination of reasonable suspicion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 389, 735 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>A.2d at 509 (citations omitted). Noting that characterizing an individual as nervous, even unusually so, \u201cis an extremely subjective evaluation,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 389, 735 A.2d at 508 (citing <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>18 F.3d 874, 879 (10th Cir.1994)), in which an officer who has had no prior interaction with the person whose behavior is being characterized, \u201ccould not reasonably gauge [the person\u2019s] behavior during the traffic stop with his usual demeanor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>United States v. Beck, </em>140 F.3d 1129, 1139 (8th Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">In evaluating the scope of this traffic stop, we are mindful that a police officer\u2019s actions during a traffic stop must be reasonably related to the purpose of the stop. An officer must have reasonable suspicion to temporarily detain a driver, and the nervousness of the driver, under Fourth Amendment analysis, does not constitute reasonable suspicion. Furthermore, absent valid consent, a reasonable suspicion of other unlawful activity, or a reasonable suspicion that a detainee is armed and dangerous, an officer may not expand an investigative detention beyond the scope of the stop or embark on a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d in hope that something will turn up. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the officer not only lacked suspicion, but his actions unreasonably expanded the scope of the stop in time and manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">In <em>Wilkes </em>we referred to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sharpe </em>which stated that the length of time upon which a traffic stop is measured is not a rigid one. <em>See Wilkes v. State, </em>364 Md. 554, 576-77, 774 A.2d 420, 433 (2001) (citing <em>Sharpe, </em>470 U.S. at 685, 105 S.Ct. at 1575, 84 L.Ed.2d at 615). Furthermore, there is no bright line test for reasonableness with respect to detentions following a traffic stop. <em>Sharpe, </em>470 U.S. at 685, 105 S.Ct. at 1575, 84 L.Ed.2d at 615. Nonetheless, in <em>Sharpe, </em>the standard was that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ack\">\u201c[a] court making this assessment should take care to consider whether the police are acting in a swiftly developing situation and in such cases the court should not indulge in unrealistic second-guessing. The question is not simply whether some other alternative was available, but whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>the police acted unreasonably in failing to recognize or to pursue it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-5\"><em>Sharpe, </em>470 U.S. at 686-87, 105 S.Ct. at 1575-76, 84 L.Ed.2d at 616 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">This Court pointed out that modern technology allows for quick access to information without unnecessarily prolonging the duration of the stop, to cut down on the level of intrusion. <em>Wilkes, </em>364 Md. at 579, 774 A.2d at 435 (citing <em>U.S. v. Gonzalez, </em>763 F.2d 1127, 1130 (10th Cir.1985)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">Further,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-8\">\u201c[i]n assessing whether a detention is too long in duration to be justified as an investigative stop, we consider it appropriate to examine whether the police diligently pursued a means of investigation that was likely to confirm or dispel their suspicions quickly, during which time it was necessary to detain the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-9\"><em>Sharpe, </em>470 U.S. at 686, 105 S.Ct. at 1575, 84 L.Ed.2d at 615.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">What was not discussed in <em>Wilkes </em>was the police officer\u2019s reasonable use of modern technology in such a manner so as to avoid prolonged roadside detentions. The majority, however, relies primarily upon <em>Wilkes </em>in resolving this case. The facts in <em>Wilkes </em>are inapposite. The K-9 unit in <em>Wilkes </em>arrived on the scene within five minutes after the stop. Here, the K-9 unit arrived approximately thirty minutes after the stop, while it took thirty minutes to verify information concerning the driver\u2019s license, registration, and warrant information. Thirty minutes is too long to verify information using computer technology, especially considering that other reasonable alternatives were available. Sergeant Hughes could have contacted either the Rockville or Forestville Barracks or, in the alternative, issued the warning he had written earlier and allowed the driver and the passenger to leave the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">When Sergeant Hughes failed to proceed diligently under the circumstances, the prolonged detention became unreasonable. <em>See Lee v. Cline, </em>149 Md.App. 38, 56, 814 A.2d 86, 96-97 (2002), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>384 Md. 245, 863 A.2d 297 (2004); <em>Pryor v. State, </em>122 Md.App. 671, 674-75, 716 A.2d 338, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>340 (1998) (holding \u201cthat, unless continued detention can be justified by what occurs during the brief period of time ... [a] motorist who is subjected to a <em>\u2018Whren </em>stop\u2019 for a minor traffic violation cannot be detained at the scene of the stop longer than it takes\u2014or <em>reasonably should </em>take\u2014to issue a citation ....\u201d) (second emphasis added) (footnote omitted). <em>See also, Charity v. State, </em>132 Md.App. 598, 615, 614, 753 A.2d 556, 565; cert. <em>denied, </em>360 Md. 487, 759 A.2d 231 (2000) (a \u201clegitimate ... traffic stop to justify a coincidental investigation has a finite \u2018shelf life,\u2019 even when the traffic stop ... is not formally terminated\u201d and \u201cthe legitimating <em>raison d\u2019etre </em>[may] evaporate if its pursuit is unreasonably attenuated or allowed to lapse into a state of suspended animation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Moreover, in the present case, the State has failed to satisfy its burden of proving that the scope of the stop and detention was reasonable given the length of the detention. The stop extended beyond the time reasonably necessary for Sergeant Hughes to investigate a traffic offense. The articulated reason for the traffic stop was because of the tag violation. Although the driver offered to remove the cover immediately and apparently could have, the officer refused to permit the removal because, in the Sergeant\u2019s opinion, it was too dangerous a maneuver alongside Interstate 95. Yet, approximately ten minutes later, from 11:10 a.m.-11:20 a.m., Sergeant Hughes directed Ms. Malone to stand outside her car, which was stopped adjacent to Interstate 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">In addition, Sergeant Hughes never explained why he did not promptly call either Rockville or Forestville Barracks from his cell phone when the College Park Barracks dispatcher informed him that those computer systems were up and running.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The suppression hearing judge stated that Ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>geant Hughes did not call the Rockville or Forestville Barracks because of the distance between where the stop occurred and the location of those two barracks. That assertion is not persuasive after one considers that the matter of checking for information contained in a computer has no correlation to the proximity of the officer to a barrack.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The evidence reasonably supports the conclusion that the delay in obtaining confirmation with regard to the driver\u2019s license, registration, and warrant information was a direct result of Sergeant Hughes\u2019s lack of due diligence. Clearly, delaying the time it took to obtain the license, registration, and warrant information, permitted the arrival and subsequent scan of the vehicle by the K-9 unit, constituting a second stop, unrelated to the tag violation. When Sergeant Hughes became aware that he could not proceed diligently, he should have given Ms. Malone the warning he had written earlier and allowed her to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Unfortunately, in justifying the State\u2019s actions, the majority today expands our holding in <em>Ferris. </em>In doing so, it overlooks the overarching policy explicated in <em>Royer </em>of balancing the individual\u2019s right to privacy and the State\u2019s legitimate interests. Commentators have acknowledged, in some jurisdictions that, <em>\u201cTerry </em>has been whittled away to the point that ... \u2018routine\u2019 traffic stops are commonly turned into drug investi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>gations through a variety of techniques, including \u2018questioning about drugs, grilling about the minute details of travel plans, seeking consent for a full roadside exploration of the motorist\u2019s car, or parading a drag dog around the vehicle.\u2019 \u201d <em>O\u2019Boyle v. Wyoming, </em>117 P.3d 401, 415 (Wyo.2005) (quoting Wayne R. LaFave, 4 Search and Seizure \u00a7 9.3(d), 370, (4th ed. 2004) (other citations omitted)). By virtue of the majority\u2019s opinion, this Court further whittles away at <em>Terry </em>and validates stalling as another technique to turn routine traffic stops into drug investigations, notwithstanding the absence of reasonable suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The majority maintains that the purpose of the stop had not yet been completed, after all, the Trooper had not been able, by no fault of his own, to complete the license and registration checks. That cannot be the test. The convenience of Maryland\u2019s citizens should be taken into account. Under the majority\u2019s rationale, a stop for a traffic infraction no more serious than this one, so long as the computer system remains inaccessible, can be extended, to the affected citizen\u2019s utter and severe inconvenience, for an unlimited period, as long as it is necessary to check that citizen\u2019s license and registration, and the citizen subjected to it would have absolutely no recourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">It warrants reminding that it is within this Court\u2019s province, and indeed, it is this Court\u2019s obligation, to make an independent, reflective constitutional judgment of the trial court\u2019s factual findings whenever claim of a constitutionally-protected right is involved. Although this Court gives great weight to the findings of the trial judge as to specific, first-level facts (such as the time interrogation began), this Court must make its own independent judgment as to what to make of such facts and must, in making such independent judgment, resolve for itself the ultimate, second-level fact of whether a constitutional violation occurred. <em>See Ferris, </em>355 Md. at 368, 735 A.2d at 497; <em>see also Walker v. State, </em>12 Md.App. 684, 695, 280 A.2d 260 (1971), <em>Perkins v. State, </em>83 Md.App. 341, 346, 574 A.2d 356 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>We do not disagree with the majority as to any of the facts on the record. Our conclusions as to what the trooper could have, and indeed, should have, done are entirely based on the lapses of time established and our belief that the lack of certain facts support an opposite conclusion. Accordingly, based upon our independent evaluation of the evidence to support the extended detention, we are satisfied that evidence seized as a result of the unconstitutional detention should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Judge GREENE joins in this dissenting opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b534-9\">. Maryland State Police Waterloo Barracks is located on Route 1 (Washington Blvd.), in Jessup, Howard County, Maryland.

Curiously, from approximately 11:10 a.m.-11:20 a.m., Sergeant Hughes apparently left Ms. Malone standing outside on the shoulder of Interstate 95. He had told her minutes earlier that he did not think it was a good idea for her to remove the plastic cover from her license plate, because it was too dangerous on Interstate 95 due to traffic.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b535-12\">. It is unclear why the petitioner's license was being checked and, unfortunately, the record provided no clarity on the subject, and the issue was not raised by the petitioner.

In light of that testimony, a matter of concern for us, was that the first information provided to the Sergeant, in response to the record check, involved the passenger, Mr. Byndloss's extensive criminal history instead of either his or Ms. Malone's driving history.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b539-7\">.
