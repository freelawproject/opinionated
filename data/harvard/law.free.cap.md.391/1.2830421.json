Specifically, Petitioner, Tomran Inc. (\u201cTomran\u201d), has requested that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>Court review the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 affirmance of the Circuit Court\u2019s dismissal of the first amended complaint, including its findings that the choice of law clause in the Deposit Agreement did not govern the institution of shareholder derivative suits, that Irish law would not recognize Tomran\u2019s cause of action, and that the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Tomran\u2019s post-judgment motion to further amend the complaint. We shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Allied Irish Bank (\u201cAIB\u201d) is a company incorporated under the laws of Ireland that is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange. AIB wholly owned Allfirst Financial, a Delaware corporation with its headquarters in Baltimore, which in turn was the sole owner of several subsidiaries, including Allfirst Bank, a financial institution with its principal place of business in Baltimore.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">On February 6, 2002, Allfirst Bank revealed that it had discovered that a foreign currency trader in its employ, John Rusnak, had systematically falsified bank records and other documents accruing losses from non-existent option contracts and recording illusory premiums from them as profits. This caused Allfirst Bank to revise its earnings downward by nearly $700 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">Tomran, Inc., a Maryland corporation based in Jarrettsville, is a depositor in Allfirst Bank and holder of American Depositary Receipts (\u201cADRs\u201d) of stock in AIB worth over $100,000. ADRs have been succinctly defined by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in <em>Pinker v. Roche Holdings Ltd., </em>292 F.3d 361 (3d Cir.2002):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-9\">An ADR is a receipt that is issued by a depositary bank that represents a specified amount of a foreign security that has been deposited with a foreign branch or agent of the depositary, known as the custodian. The holder of an ADR is not the title owner of the underlying shares; the title owner of the underlying shares is either the depositary, the custodian, or their agent. ADRs are tradeable in the same manner as any other registered American security, may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>listed on any of the major exchanges in the United States or traded over the counter, and are subject to the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. This makes trading an ADR simpler and more secure for American investors than trading in the underlying security in the foreign market.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-5\">ADRs may be either sponsored or unsponsored. An unsponsored ADR is established with little or no involvement of the issuer of the underlying security. A sponsored ADR, in contrast, is established with the active participation of the issuer of the underlying security. An issuer who sponsors an ADR enters into an agreement with the depositary bank and the ADR owners. The agreement establishes the rights and obligations of the parties, such as ADR holders\u2019 voting rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b43-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 367 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">After Allfirst Bank announced its earnings restatement resulting from the Rusnak fraud, Tomran made a demand on the boards of directors of AIB and Allfirst Bank that they take action to recoup the losses. The boards denied Tomran\u2019s demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">On May 13, 2002, Tomran filed a derivative suit for money damages and declaratory and injunctive relief against the directors and senior officers of Allfirst Bank and nominal defendants, AIB, Allfirst Bank, and Allfirst Financial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On August 14, 2002, Tomran amended its complaint to state the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>action as a \u201ctriple derivative\u201d suit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The amended complaint alleged that Respondents were negligent and grossly negligent in their oversight of Rusnak\u2019s foreign currency dealings, which directly caused the loss to Allfirst Bank.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In its amended complaint, Tomran argued that, as a result of the change in the charter, the officers and directors of Allfirst Bank were no longer \u201cpersonally liable to the Bank or its shareholders for money damages.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, Tomran sought a declaratory judgment \u201cconfirming that the change in the Bank\u2019s articles was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>not retroactive and did not cover the $40 million in losses already in place as of December 1998.\u201d It also sought to enjoin Respondents \u201cfrom asserting that their liability to the Bank [was] limited in any fashion by the December 1998 transaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">All of the officers and directors filed motions to dismiss on the following grounds: that Tomran had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted; that Maryland courts did not have jurisdiction over the case; that Tomran had no derivative cause of action; and that Allfirst Bank\u2019s charter barred Tomran\u2019s claims. At the hearing on the motions to dismiss, both parties presented affidavits and deposition testimony from their respective experts on Irish law, Michael Ashe, for the Respondents, and Eoin McCullough, for the Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">In his December 30, 2002 opinion, Judge Albert J. Matricciani, sitting in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, determined that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Moreover, Judge Matricciani determined that Irish law should apply \u201cin determining the sustainability of [Tomran\u2019s] claims in this case.\u201d He stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">where the Court has held that the internal affairs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>doctrine[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] does not pose a complete bar to its exercise of jurisdiction over the internal affairs of a foreign corporation, it is unwilling to go farther and ignore the well settled principles that underlie that doctrine and require that the law of the place of incorporation govern the rights and responsibilities of the parties with respect to its internal operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">The court found that Tomran, to maintain the action, was required to establish: (1) that it is entitled, \u201cas a beneficial owner of AIB shares rather than a registered shareholder,\u201d to bring a derivative suit against AIB; (2) that the amended complaint \u201cset forth allegations sufficient to constitute a \u2018fraud on the minority\u2019 exception to the rule in the case of <em>Foss v. Harbottle, </em>[1843] 2 Hare 461, which stands for the general proposition under Irish law that even registered shareholders may not maintain an action on behalf of the company\u201d; and (3) that \u201cIrish law would permit a triple derivative action.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AIo\">With respect to the first requirement, the court found that Tomran could not proceed because no Irish case has permitted a beneficial owner of shares to maintain a derivative suit. As to the second prerequisite, the court determined that \u201cit was unlikely that the bald allegations contained in ... the first amended complaint would satisfy an Irish court that the \u2018fraud on the minority\u2019 exception ... has been pled adequately.\u201d The Circuit Court found with respect to the third requirement that there was no authority to suggest that \u201cIreland is about to permit double or triple derivative actions by even regis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>tered shareholders.\u201d Thus, the Circuit Court concluded that Tomran\u2019s request for a declaratory judgment and injunction was \u201crendered moot by the [cjourt\u2019s determination that [Tom-ran cannot] bring this action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Tomran filed a motion to amend the complaint and two motions requesting that Judge Matricciani alter or amend his judgment. Subsequent to Judge Matricciani\u2019s denial of all of the post-hearing motions, Tomran noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">The Court of Special Appeals held that the choice of law provision in the Deposit Agreement<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> could not be read so broadly as to encompass the right to maintain a derivative suit, and therefore, under the internal affairs doctrine, Irish law applied because AIB was incorporated in Ireland. Moreover, the intermediate appellate court determined that under Irish law an ADR holder lacked the right to bring a derivative suit, and even if it did have such a right, the allegations of negligence in the complaint were insufficient under Irish law to maintain a derivative suit based on the \u201cfraud on the minority\u201d exception in <em>Foss v. Harbottle, </em>[1843] 2 Hare 461. On January 18, 2005, Tomran filed a petition for writ of certiorari with this Court and presented the following issues for our consideration, which we have rephrased and renumbered for clarification purposes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-7\">1. Whether the Court of Special Appeals erred in determining that the choice of law clause in the Deposit Agreement did not govern the determination of whether Tomran had the right to sue derivatively;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-8\">2. Whether the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that Tomran would not have a cause of action under Irish law, thereby affirming the Circuit Court\u2019s dismissal; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>3. Whether the Court of Special Appeals erred in upholding the Circuit Court\u2019s denial of Tomran\u2019s post-judgment motion to amend the first amended complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">On April 7, 2005, we granted the petition and issued the writ. <em>Tomran v. Passano, </em>386 Md. 180, 872 A.2d 46 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Based upon our analysis of the choice of law clause in the Deposit Agreement, we determine that the phrase \u201chereunder and thereunder\u201d limits the scope of the choice of law provision to the rights enumerated explicitly in the Deposit Agreement and ADR Receipts and matters of contract enforceability. The issue of whether Tomran has a cause of action to sue derivatively on behalf of AIB is not governed by the Deposit Agreement or the ADR Receipts and thus, the choice of law clause does not apply. As such, under the internal affairs doctrine, an analysis of Irish law determines whether Tomran possesses a right to bring a derivative suit on behalf of AIB. We find that under the current state of Irish law Tomran would not be entitled to pursue this derivative action as a beneficial shareholder, and we hold that the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in denying the proffered post-judgment amendment to the first amended complaint. Therefore, we shall affirm.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Tomran presents three arguments for this Court\u2019s consideration. First, Tomran argues that the choice of law provision of the Deposit Agreement mandates the application of New York law to the determination of whether Tomran can pursue a derivative action on behalf of AIB. To this end, Tomran asserts that the language \u201chereunder and thereunder\u201d in the clause, which more fully states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-6\">Section <em>7.6\u2014Governing Law. </em>This Deposit Agreement and the Receipts shall be interpreted and all rights hereunder and thereunder and provisions hereof and thereof shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aj\">does not limit the scope of the choice of law clause to those rights enumerated in the Deposit Agreement and Receipts. Alternatively, Tomran contends that the choice of law clause is ambiguous and as such, under Maryland law, it must be construed in its favor and against the Respondents who, according to Tomran, drafted it.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">Tomran also argues that the lower courts erred in their determination that Irish law would not recognize the right of a beneficial owner of shares to bring a derivative suit. Accordingly, Tomran states that the Court of Special Appeals applied an erroneous standard because it required a preexisting case or statute recognizing such a right for that court to do so as well. Tomran contends that because the Irish courts, and their English predecessors, recognized and protected other rights of beneficial owners, the Court of Special Appeals should have concluded that the Irish courts would also extend derivative rights to those owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">Furthermore, Tomran asserts that it adequately pled the requirements of the \u201cfraud on the minority\u201d exception. It argues that because AIB\u2019s Board of Directors is vested with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>complete control over the company\u2019s affairs under the articles of incorporation, the Board may properly be considered a majority in control of the company. Moreover, Tomran contends that the Board\u2019s refusal to initiate a lawsuit constituted a \u201cfraud\u201d on the minority. Tomran alleges that AIB\u2019s Board was as culpable for the $700 million loss as the Board of Allfirst Bank and that the language of AIB\u2019s insurance policy contained an exclusion which prevented recovery if a direct suit, as opposed to a derivative action, was pursued.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Finally, Tomran argues that it should have been permitted to amend its complaint post-judgment to add the Bank of New York, the title holder to AIB\u2019s shares, as an additional party and make additional allegations regarding the \u201cfraud on the minority\u201d issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">Conversely, Respondents argue that the choice of law clause in the Deposit Agreement limits the application of New York law to those rights explicitly stated in the Deposit Agreement or the Receipts themselves, and neither the Deposit Agreement nor the Receipts grants ADR holders the right to sue derivatively. Moreover, even if this Court were to determine that the clause is ambiguous, Respondents assert, there is no allegation that Respondents drafted the Deposit Agreement, thereby causing the ambiguity to be construed against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">Respondents contend that the internal affairs doctrine, the principle stating that disputes concerning the relationships among corporation, its directors, officers, and shareholders must be governed by the law of the jurisdiction of incorporation, requires that Irish law govern the right to sue derivatively. Moreover, they argue that the Court of Special Appeals did not create a standard that was discriminatory against parties seeking to rely on foreign law, as Tomran asserted, but rather, that the intermediate appellate court considered the evidence and arguments presented by the parties and reached a carefully reasoned conclusion. Respondents also note that there is nothing in the applicable cases or treatises indicating that Irish courts would grant Tomran the right to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Respondents also argue that even if Tomran were entitled to sue, its claim would fail to satisfy the \u201cfraud on the minority\u201d rule. Respondents assert that \u201cfraud on the minority\u201d only applies when a shareholder can show that the alleged wrongdoers themselves control a majority of the vote, or that a voting majority improperly blocked the proposed action, and that Tomran did not plead apposite facts. They also contend that the charges made against AIB\u2019s Board of Directors do not constitute an affirmative abuse of fiduciary powers that harms the company and benefits the directors and officers personally as required under the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">The Meaning of \u201chereunder and thereunder\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Tomran argues that the choice of law provision in the Deposit Agreement mandates the application of New York law to determine whether it may proceed in a derivative suit on behalf of AIB because under its terms the choice of law provision encompasses \u201call rights.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\"> Section 7.6 of the Deposit Agreement provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag\"><em>Governing Law. </em>This Deposit Agreement and the Receipts shall be interpreted and all rights hereunder and thereunder and provisions hereof and thereof shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">Maryland follows the objective law of contract interpretation and construction. <em>Owens-Illinois, Inc. v. Cook, </em>386 Md. 468, 496, 872 A.2d 969, 985 (2005); <em>Taylor v. NationsBank, N.A., </em>365 Md. 166, 178-79, 776 A.2d 645, 653 (2001); <em>Wells v. Chevy Chase Bank, F.S.B., </em>363 Md. 232, 251, 768 A.2d 620, 630 (2001). We have explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-8\">A court construing an agreement under this test must first determine from the language of the agreement itself what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have meant at the time it was effectuated. In addition, when the language of the contract is plain and unambiguous there is no room for construction, and a court must presume that the parties meant what they expressed. In these circumstances, the true test of what is meant is not what the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>parties to the contract intended it to mean, but what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have thought it meant. Consequently, the clear and unambiguous language of an agreement will not give [way] to what the parties thought that the agreement meant or intended it to mean.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-5\"><em>General Motors Acceptance Corp. v. Daniels, </em>303 Md. 254, 261, 492 A.2d 1306, 1310 (1985) (citations omitted). The cardinal rule of contract interpretation is to give effect to the parties\u2019 intentions. <em>Owens-Illinois, </em>386 Md. at 497, 872 A.2d at 985. Moreover, this Court has adhered to the principle that we will not unnecessarily read contractual provisions as meaningless:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">A recognized rule of construction in ascertaining the true meaning of a contract is that the contract must be construed in its entirety and, if reasonably possible, effect must be given to each clause so that a court will not find an interpretation which casts out or disregards a meaningful part of the language of the writing unless no other course can be sensibly and reasonably followed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-7\"><em>National Union v. David A Bramble, Inc., </em>388 Md. 195, 209, 879 A.2d 101, 109 (2005), quoting <em>DIRECTV, Inc. v. Mattingly, </em>376 Md. 302, 320, 829 A.2d 626, 637 (2003), quoting in turn <em>Sagner v. Glenangus Farms, Inc., </em>234 Md. 156, 167, 198 A.2d 277, 283 (1964). <em>See also Bausch &amp; Lomb, Inc. v. Utica Mut. Ins. Co., </em>330 Md. 758, 782, 625 A.2d 1021, 1033 (1993); <em>Dahl v. Brunswick Corp., </em>277 Md. 471, 478-79, 356 A.2d 221, 226 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">Imbued with its ordinary, plain meaning and read in the context of the choice of law provision, \u201chereunder and thereunder\u201d must be viewed as referring to the rights set forth in the Deposit Agreement and Receipts. Based upon the grammatical and syntactical structure of the clause, \u201chereunder\u201d must concern the rights and obligations contained within the Deposit Agreement, which is the document where the choice of law clause appears. Similarly, \u201cthereunder\u201d must reference the terms embodied in the Receipts, which are the only other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>documents listed and which appear after the Deposit Agreement in the clause. Therefore, we conclude that the only-reasonable interpretation of \u201chereunder and thereunder\u201d is one wherein the phrase limits the scope of the choice of law provision to those rights enumerated in the Deposit Agreement and Receipts.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in <em>Batchelder v. Kawamoto, </em>147 F.3d 915 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>525 U.S. 982, 119 S.Ct. 446, 142 L.Ed.2d 400 (1998), reached the same conclusion when presented with a choice of law clause that was substantively identical to the clause at issue in the case <em>sub judice. </em>In <em>Batchelder, </em>the choice of law clause provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">This Deposit Agreement and the Receipts and all rights hereunder and thereunder and provisions hereof and thereof shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, United States of America. It is understood that notwithstanding any present or future provision of the laws of the State of New York, the rights of holders of Stock and other Deposited Securities, and the duties and obligations of the Company in respect to such holders, as such, shall be governed by the laws of Japan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">The Ninth Circuit stated that \u201c[t]he first sentence of \u00a7 7.07 provides that contract rights contained in the Deposit Agreement itself or in the ADR certificates as well as the construction of the Deposit Agreement, are to be governed by the laws of New York.\u201d <em>Id,, </em>at 918. The Ninth Circuit did not make its interpretation of the scope of the first sentence contingent upon the existence of the second sentence as Tomran asserts.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">The court continued to explain its reasoning by stating that Batchelder, in attempting to assert a right that is not \u201cexpressly granted\u201d to him by the Deposit Agreement, the second sentence \u201cdirects this court to apply Japanese law to determine the existence and scope of Batchelder\u2019s right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although the second sentence is dispositive in <em>Batchelder, </em>the Ninth Circuit noted that even if the second sentence was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>included in the clause, it would be bound to apply Japanese law under the \u201cinternal affairs\u201d doctrine, which provides that the law of the jurisdiction of incorporation governs the rights and responsibilities of the corporation and its shareholders. <em>Id. </em>at 920. Thus, according the Ninth Circuit, Japanese law would have applied in <em>Batchelder </em>regardless of the second sentence in the choice of law provision. Therefore, our analysis is consistent with the opinion in <em>Batchelder.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Our determination also is consistent with those jurisdictions that have considered the meaning of \u201chereunder and thereunder\u201d in the choice of law context, in arbitration clauses, and in forum selection clauses. <em>See, e.g., Rochdale Village, Inc. v. Public Service Employees Union, </em>605 F.2d 1290, 1296 (2d Cir.1979) (holding that \u201c[t]he insertion of the word \u2018hereunder\u2019 after the otherwise all-inclusive phrase \u2018any and all disputes\u2019 has the effect of limiting, albeit slightly, the parties\u2019 duty to arbitrate. All disputes arising \u2018under\u2019 the agreement are to be arbitrated; those that are collateral to the agreement are not.\u201d); <em>Desktop Images, Inc. v. Ames, </em>929 F.Supp. 1339, 1345 (D.Colo.1996) (stating that use of \u201cthereunder\u201d in the arbitration clause limits its application to those claims based upon the terms of the contract); <em>Hoffman v. Minuteman Press Int\u2019l Inc., </em>747 F.Supp. 552, 559 (W.D.Mo.1990) (\u201cThe \u2018hereunder\u2019 language in these franchise agreements limits application of the forum selection clause to suits arising under the agreement and seeking enforcement of the agreement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Had the parties intended the choice of law clause to govern \u201call rights,\u201d as Tomran urges, there would be no need to include the phrases \u201chereunder and thereunder\u201d in the clause. Thus, were we to conclude that the clause applied to \u201call rights,\u201d regardless of their inclusion in the Deposit Agreement or Receipts, we would be rendering the phrase \u201chereunder and thereunder\u201d nugatory. Moreover, Tomran\u2019s interpretation of the choice of law clause would result in the creation of two classes of derivative plaintiffs: beneficial shareholders, whose rights are governed by New York law, which presumably is more favorable to those plaintiffs and would permit Tomran to proceed, and AIB\u2019s normal shareholders, whose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>actions would be governed by the more stringent Irish law. We will not adopt such a position. Therefore, we find that \u201chereunder and thereunder\u201d limits the scope of the choice of law clause to those rights specifically stated in the Deposit Agreement and the Receipts. Because neither the Deposit Agreement nor the Receipts by their terms provide Tomran with the right to sue derivatively, we determine that the choice of law provision does not apply to the issue of whether Tomran has the light to sue derivatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The Internal Affairs Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\"> Because the choice of law clause does not apply, we must determine which jurisdiction\u2019s law should govern Tom-ran\u2019s right to proceed. For guidance we turn to the internal affairs doctrine. The internal affairs doctrine provides that the law of the jurisdiction of incorporation governs the rights and responsibilities of the parties involved. <em>See Gilman v. Wheat, First Securities Inc., </em>345 Md. 361, 370-71, 692 A.2d 454, 459 (1997); <em>N.A.A.C.P. v. Golding, </em>342 Md. 663, 674, 679 A.2d 554, 559 (1996); <em>Stockley v. Thomas, </em>89 Md. 663, 43 A. 766 (1899).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">Courts first developed the internal affairs doctrine in the 1860s. Frederick Tung, <em>Lost In Translation: From U.S. Corporate Charter Competition to Issuer Choice in International Securities Regulation, </em>39 Ga. L. rev. 525, 543 (2005). In its earliest explication, the doctrine embodied the recognition that \u201ca corporation\u2019s internal disputes implicated the territorial sovereignty of the incorporating state,\u201d which \u201creflected the historically intimate legal, economic, and geographical ties between the corporation and its incorporating state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Each corporation was a creature of statute and was treated as existing only within the boundaries of the state of incorporation. <em>Id. </em>at 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">As transportation and communication were facilitated in the middle of the nineteenth century, interstate corporations arose and the Commerce Clause was construed as preventing states from enacting protectivist legislation. <em>Id. </em>It was at this time that courts first delineated the internal affairs doctrine, \u201cde<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>ferring to the territorial sovereignty of the incorporating state regarding the internal matters of its corporations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The internal affairs doctrine remains in force today. As described by this Court in <em>N.A.A.C.P. v. Golding, </em>342 Md. 663, 674, 679 A.2d 554, 559 (1996), quoting <em>Edgar v. MITE Corp., </em>457 U.S. 624, 102 S.Ct. 2629, 73 L.Ed.2d 269 (1982):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-5\">[t]he internal affairs doctrine is a conflict of laws principle which recognizes that only one State should have the authority to regulate a corporation\u2019s internal affairs\u2014matters peculiar to the relationships among or between the corporation and its current officers, directors, and shareholders\u2014 because otherwise a corporation could be faced with conflicting demands.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-6\"><em>See also Gilman v. Wheat, First Securities Inc., </em>345 Md. 361, 370-71, 692 A.2d 454, 459 (1997). Therefore, because, as the parties agree, AIB is an Irish corporation, Irish law governs whether Tomran may maintain a derivative suit on AIB\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Irish Company<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Law</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">Tomran asserts that when the Court of Special Appeals and the Circuit Court determined that Irish law applied, they were obligated to determine the way that foreign jurisdiction would rule under Maryland Code (1973, 2002 Repl. Vol.), Section 10-501 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. That provision states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-9\">Every court of this State shall take judicial notice of the common law and statutes of every state, territory, and other jurisdiction of the United States, and of every other jurisdiction having a system of law based on the common law of England.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">Specifically, Tomran contends that both the Circuit Court and the Court of Special Appeals created a rule that discriminates against parties who wish to have foreign law applied and that is impermissibly rigid in that it requires clear legal authority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>to provide the basis of any conclusion about the foreign jurisdiction\u2019s law. Conversely, Respondents argue that the lower courts carefully considered the legal analysis and factual allegations before it and that there is nothing in the relevant cases, statutes, or commentary to suggest that Ireland would recognize Tomran\u2019s ability to pursue a derivative action. We again disagree with Tomran\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The Honorable Mr. Justice Ronan Keane, Chief Justice of Ireland, in his treatise on company law, provides a thorough explanation of the history of Irish company law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-6\">The general structure of Irish company law is closely modeled on that of England. The reason is obvious: the two countries had a common legal tradition and, after the Act of Union in 1800 and until 1921, all statute law affecting Ireland was enacted at Westminster. While there have been substantial changes in Irish company law since 1921, it was thought better to preserve the general structure inherited from the English, and such changes as have been made since 1921 have in many instances been based on changes in the neighbouring jurisdiction. Since the accession of Ireland to the European Economic Community in 1973, however, many changes have resulted from compliance with directives of the community, now the European Union, requiring the harmonisation of company law in the member states.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Both parties agree that there is a lack of applicable statutory and case law in Ireland on the shareholders\u2019 right to maintain a derivative suit and recognize that the decisions of the English courts prior to Irish independence in 1921, although not precedential authority, are persuasive. To that end, Tomran relies upon three English cases from the nineteenth century as supporting its assertion that Irish courts would permit it to proceed: <em>Bagshaw v. Eastern Union Ry. Co., </em>[1849] 7 Hare 114 (addressing issue of whether the directors\u2019 appropriation of monies to a project separate from that for which they were raised was proper, and limiting <em>Foss v. Harbottle, </em>[1843] 2 Hare 461, to the proposition that if the offending act by the directors is an act that the shareholders <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>could ratify, an action to impeach the board\u2019s action cannot be maintained); <em>Great Western Ry. v. Rushout, </em>[1852] 5 DeG. <em>&amp; </em>Sm. 290, 309 (finding that beneficiaries of a trust of stock could seek an injunction to interfere with the internal management of the railway company when an unlawful application of funds is involved); and <em>Binney v. Ince Hall Coal &amp; Channel Co., </em>[1866] 35 L.J. Ch. 363 (determining that the equitable mortgagee of shares has the authority to sue the company to protect the value of the shares). In response, Respondents note that none of the cases cited by Tomran addresses the issue of beneficial owners\u2019 ability to sue derivatively, but rather, the cases address other rights distinct from derivative rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">A close reading of the cases cited by the parties reveals that none of the cases cited provides any basis for the assertion that Irish courts would recognize a beneficial owner\u2019s right to maintain a derivative suit: <em>Bagshaw </em>and <em>Great Western </em>involved individuals seeking injunctions to redress alleged illegal acts by the boards, and <em>Binney </em>concerned an equitable mortgagee who sought an injunction to prevent the board from liquidating the share capital of its members.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">The issue before us is not what we believe the Irish court <em>should </em>hold when faced with this issue as Tomran urges, but rather what it <em>would </em>hold based on applicable laws and precedent. As the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit noted, \u201cThis Court must look to [foreign law] as it is and not as one might believe it ought to be.\u201d <em>Carson v. National Bank of Commerce Trust and Savings, </em>501 F.2d 1082, 1085 (8th Cir.1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">We cannot conclude that Irish courts would grant beneficial owners the right to sue derivatively on behalf of corporations where there is no indication, even in <em>dicta, </em>that they have considered the issue. Our determination is consistent with the conclusion of Irish legal treatises that have considered the issue. <em>See </em>The Honorable Mr. Justice Ronan Keane, Chief Justice of Ireland, Company Law (Butterworths 3d ed.2000); Robert R. Pennington, Company Law, ch. 17 (Butterworths <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>7th ed.1995); Patrick Ussher, Company Law in Ireland, ch. 8 (London: Sweet and Maxwell 1986). Only Mr. Pennington states that Irish courts would permit a beneficial owner to proceed in a derivative suit, but he did not cite to any authority supporting his assertion. Therefore, in light of the dearth of any statutory or common law authority indicating that Irish courts are disposed to recognize the right of beneficial owners to sue derivatively, we are not persuaded that an Irish court at this time would hold that Tomran can sue derivatively under Irish law.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Tomran\u2019s Motion to Amend</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Tomran also contends that the Circuit Court abused its discretion in denying Tomran\u2019s motion to amend the first amended complaint to add the Bank of New York as an additional plaintiff and make further allegations regarding \u201cfraud on the minority\u201d after the Circuit Court entered its judgment. We have previously stated that an abuse of discretion will be found \u201c \u2018where no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the [trial] court[ ]\u2019 ... or when the court acts \u2018without reference to any guiding principles,\u2019 and the ruling under consideration is \u2018clearly against the logic and effect of facts and inferences before the court[ ]\u2019 ... or when the ruling is \u2018violative of fact and logic.\u2019 \u201d <em>Beyond Systems, </em>388 Md. at 29, 878 A.2d at 583-84, quoting <em>Wilson v. John Crane, Inc., </em>385 Md. 185, 198, 867 A.2d 1077, 1084 (2005), quoting in turn <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 3598, </em>347 Md. 295, 312-13, 701 A.2d 110, 118-19 (1997) (citations omitted). We do not find that the trial court\u2019s decision in the present case is beyond the determination that a reasonable person would make in light of the fact that additional facts concerning \u201cfraud on the minority\u201d would not cure Tomran\u2019s inability to maintain a derivative action. Therefore, we conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Tomran\u2019s motion to amend the first amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Because \u201chereunder and thereunder\u201d limits the scope of the choice of law provision in the Deposit Agreement to those rights specifically set forth in the terms of the Deposit Agreement and the Receipts, we determine that Irish law governs whether Tomran has the right to pursue a derivative suit on behalf of AIB. Based on our examination of Irish law and applicable English cases, we find that Irish law would not recognize a beneficial owner\u2019s ability to sue derivatively. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

To the precise contrary, it expressly provides for the assignment of Allfirst Financial\u2019s and Allfirst Bank's Rusnak-related claims against the individual defendants to AIB.... Accordingly, if the merger is approved, and if this action still exists, the action\u2019s multiple derivative nature will be obviated.\u201d On April 1, 2003, AIB announced that it sold all of its interest in Allfirst Financial to M &amp; T Bank Corporation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b44-8\">.

As such, the consideration of the affidavits did not convert the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment because the application of foreign law in this particular case is a legal issue for the court to decide pursuant to Maryland Code (1973, 2002 Repl.Vol.), Section 10-503 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, which is determinative of whether Tomran has stated a legally sufficient claim. <em>See Porterfield v.

An ADR is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-10\">\u201c... a receipt that is issued by a depositary bank that represents a specified amount of a foreign security that has been deposited with a foreign branch or agent of the depositary, known as the custodian. The holder of an ADR is not the title owner of the underlying shares; the title owner of the underlying shares is either the depositary, the custodian, or their agent. ADRs are tradeable in the same manner as any other registered American security, may be listed on any of the major exchanges in the United States or traded over the counter, and are subject to the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. This makes trading an ADR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>simpler and more secure for American investors than trading in the underlying security in the foreign market.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-5\">\u201cADRs may be either sponsored or unsponsored. An unsponsored ADR is established with little or no involvement of the issuer of the underlying security. A sponsored ADR, in contrast, is established with the active participation of the issuer of the underlying security.

The agreement establishes the terms of the ADRs and the rights and obligations of the parties, such as ADR holders\u2019 voting rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-6\"><em>Pinker v. Roche Holdings Ltd., </em>292 F.3d 361, 367 (3rd Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">The ADR program was a \u201csponsored\u201d one, developed with the active participation of AIB, the issuer of the underlying shares. Indeed, the Deposit Agreement was between AIB, the Bank of New York and \u201call Owners and holders from time to time of American Depositary Receipts issues hereunder.\u201d As indicated, the petitioner contracted with AIB and, pursuant to that agreement, deposited its ADR\u2019s. The deposit was with The Bank of New York, in which the legal title to the petitioner\u2019s ADR\u2019s was placed, as trustee, and the Bank of New York held them in that capacity. Those ADR\u2019s, along with those of other holders of ADR\u2019s, beneficial owners of AIB stock, similarly titled, the petitioner alleged, were offered through the Bank of New York \u201cto obtain a listing on the New York Stock Exchange and to facilitate broad ownership of its shares by U.S. citizens such as Tomran.\u201d The Deposit Agreement contained the parties\u2019 understanding of their rights and obligations under it, as well as the terms of the ADR\u2019s. One of the provisions reflects the parties\u2019 agreement as to the law that applies in the interpretation of the agreement and the ADR\u2019s and, as well, that governs their rights under the ADR\u2019s and the agreement. That provision, \u00a7 7.6, a choice-of-law provision, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-9\"><em>\u201cGoverning Law. </em>This Deposit Agreement and the Receipts shall be interpreted and all rights hereunder and thereun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>der and provisions hereof and thereof shall be governed by the laws of the state of New York.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The majority concludes that \u201c[t]he issue of whether Tomran has a cause of action to sue derivatively on behalf of AIB is not governed by the Deposit Agreement or the ADR Receipts and thus, the choice of law clause does not apply.\u201d 391 Md. 1, 10, 891 A.2d 336, 342. This is, in its view, \u201c[bjecause neither the Deposit Agreement nor the Receipts by their terms provide Tomran with the right to sue derivatively.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17, 891 A.2d at 346. The premise for this conclusion is the majority\u2019s perception that the petitioner\u2019s argument is that the choice of law provision applied to \u201call rights,\u201d without regard to the Deposit Agreement and ADR\u2019s. <em>Id. </em>at 15, 891 A.2d at 345. Thus, focusing its interpretive efforts on \u201chereunder and thereunder,\u201d it determines that the phrase \u201climits the scope of the choice of law provision to the rights enumerated explicitly in the Deposit Agreement and ADR Receipts and matters of contract enforceability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10, 891 A.2d at 341-42.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">There are two aspects of the Deposit Agreement and the ADR\u2019s that \u00a7 7.6 addresses and governs: their interpretation and the rights, \u201call rights,\u201d of the parties under those documents. The majority correctly holds that the rights to which the choice of laws provision refers and relates are those of the parties, under the Deposit Agreement and the ADR\u2019s. The petitioner does not, as I read its brief, argue otherwise. Indeed, it argued specifically: \u201c[ujnder that contract (the \u2018Deposit Agreement\u2019), the parties agreed to a choice-of-law provision selecting New York law to govern all possible disputes regarding Tomran\u2019s rights <em>both </em>as an ADR holder <em>and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>under the agreement! ]\u201d and, stated differently, \u201cNew York law applies <em>not only </em>to interpretation of the Receipts and the Deposit Agreement, but also defines <em>all rights </em>that exist under and by virtue of ownership of the ADRs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">I do not agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion, arrived at with no apparent analysis, with respect to the scope of the rights of the parties\u2019 addressed in the Deposit Agreement or that exist pursuant to the ADR\u2019s. Section 7.6 is explicit, it governs \u201call rights\u201d of an ADR holder or arising under the Deposit Agreement, not just some of those rights, <em>i.e. </em>those specifically enumerated or that relate to contract enforceability. \u201cAll rights\u201d certainly does include such rights as are enumerated specifically and have to do with contract enforceability, but they also would include, and necessarily so, those rights that are implied or may be inferred. Because the parties agreed clearly and specifically that the interpretation of the ADR\u2019s and the Deposit Agreement, and \u201call rights\u201d under them, are to be governed by New York law, and there is no agreement, express or otherwise, alleged that varies that contract, I agree with the petitioner that disputes regarding the meaning of the ADR\u2019s, the Deposit Agreement and the rights they accord are to be resolved by reference to, and consistent with, New York law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>Although the majority goes to great pains to explain why the phrase, \u201chereunder and thereunder,\u201d limits the scope of the rights to those under the agreement and the ADR\u2019s, no such great pains are taken to explain, indeed, we are not advised as to, why the rights affected are only those \u201cenumerated explicitly in the Deposit Agreement and ADR Receipts and [that are] matters of contract enforceability.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To be sure,' the respondents argued that \u201cthe Deposit Agreement, including its choice-of-law provision, [is] inapplicable to issues concerning AIB\u2019s internal affairs, ... contending] that the Deposit Agreement only governs the mechanics of the ADR program, including, for example, the form and transferability of receipts, cancellation and destruction of surrendered receipts, and execution and delivery of receipts.\u201d <em>Tomran v. Passano, </em>159 Md.App. 706, 720-21, 862 A.2d 453, 461 (2004). That is not a sufficient basis and no other basis appears of record. This is especially telling in light of the majority\u2019s recognition, as it must, of our adherence to the objective law of contract interpretation and construction. As it explained, under that approach:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-5\">\u201c \u2018A court construing an agreement ... must first determine from the language of the agreement itself what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have meant at the time it was effectuated. In addition, when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>language of the contract is plain and unambiguous there is no room for construction, and a court must presume that the parties meant what they expressed. In these circumstances, the true test of what is meant is not what the parties to the contract intended it to mean, but what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have thought it meant. Consequently, the clear and unambiguous language of an agreement will not give [way] to what the parties thought that the agreement meant or intended it to mean.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">391 Md. at 13-14, 891 A.2d at 344, quoting <em>General Motors Acceptance Corp. v. Daniels, </em>303 Md. 254, 261, 492 A.2d 1306, 1310 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">It is likely that the interpretation that the majority put on \u00a7 7.6 is the interpretation that the respondents intended, that they intended that meaning. It is not, however, the meaning that the petitioner attributed to it; it believed that its impact and effect were much broader. Thus, the petitioner submitted, citing \u00a7\u00a7 4.1,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>4.7<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 4.9,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that the Deposit Agreement gave it \u201cequal rights to dividends, proxy information and shareholder notices, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>where they may cause their shares to be voted as they direct\u201d and alleged that, pursuant to the Deposit Agreement and ADR\u2019s, it \u201cin every relevant respect enjoy[s] the same rights and privileges of holders of AIB\u2019s ordinary shares.\u201d Consequently, the interpretation by the majority does not even capture what the parties intended, at best, deferring to the intention of only one side.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">More important, an objective person in the position of the parties, who used the broadest possible language to describe the rights he or she intended to be subject to New York law, would not likely have intended that language to be restrictive, to limit the scope of the disputes that otherwise would be subject to resolution by New York law. To an objective observer, \u201call\u201d means, <em>every one </em>of the rights under the Deposit Agreement and the ADR\u2019s, not just the ones that the respondents intended or the ones to which a more prudent negotiator might have restricted the agreement or even to the ones that objectively make sense. Our task is not to structure the deal for the parties in the way that is most beneficial to them. \u201cPeople are permitted to enter into contracts to their disadvantage.\u201d <em>Shallow Run Ltd. Partnership v. State Highway Admin., </em>113 Md.App. 156, 171-72, 686 A.2d 1113, 1121 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>The more expansive meaning of \u201call rights,\u201d in addition to being supported by common sense, finds support in <em>Batchelder v. Kawamoto, </em>147 F.3d 915 (9th Cir.1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>525 U.S. 982, 119 S.Ct. 446, 142 L.Ed.2d 400 (1998). In that case, American Honda and the holder of ADR\u2019s entered into a Deposit Agreement, which, like the Deposit Agreement in this case, contained a choice-of-law provision, \u00a7 7.07. That provision provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-5\">\u201cThis Deposit Agreement and the [American Depository] Receipts and all rights hereunder and thereunder and provisions hereof and thereof shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, United States of America. It is understood that notwithstanding any present or future provision of the laws of the State of New York, the rights of holders of Stock and other Deposited Securities, and the duties and obligations of the Company in respect of such holders, as such, shall be governed by the laws of Japan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The plaintiffs derivative action, brought pursuant to the Deposit Agreement, was dismissed, the court holding that \u201cthe .Deposit Agreement ... expressly provides that the law of Japan governs shareholder rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 917. It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AF\">\u201cThe first sentence of \u00a7 7.07 provides that contract rights contained in the Deposit Agreement itself or in the ADR certificates, as well as the construction of the Deposit Agreement, are to be governed by the laws of New York. The second sentence of \u00a7 7.07, however, explicitly provides that Japanese law governs shareholder rights and the rights of holders of other Deposited Securities, including ADRs. Thus, if an ADR holder seeks to assert a right belonging to shareholders or a right not specifically granted to ADR holders in the Deposit Agreement, the laws of Japan apply. Section 7.07 is simply a choice-of-law clause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 917-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">Like the plaintiff in <em>Batchelder, </em>the petitioner does not contend that the Deposit Agreement, in terms, grants it, as an ADR holder, the right to bring shareholder derivative claims; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>rather, it maintains its entitlement to bring a derivative action based on its status as an AIB ADR holder and, therefore, AIB shareholder. Unlike in <em>Batchelder, </em>however, there is no second sentence, the plain language of which directs the court to apply Irish law to determine the existence and scope of the petitioner\u2019s rights. In the absence of that second sentence, effect must be given to the only provision there is. And that provision admits of no exceptions or restrictions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b62-8\">. It so concluding, the majority characterized the phrase as clear and unambiguous. Be that as it may, to me, the critical phrase, \u201call rights\u201d is clear and unambiguous, viewed in context and given its plain meaning. It is, for the majority, at best, ambiguous. There simply is no evidence in this record that has been presented that would permit the interpretation, as meaning less than all of the rights under the agreement and the ADR's, that the majority gives it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b63-6\">. In this State, we favor the enforcement of choice of law provisions in contracts. <em>Kronovet v. Lipchin, </em>288 Md. 30, 43, 415 A.2d 1096, 1104 (1980) (it is \u201cgenerally accepted that the parties to a contract may agree as to the law which will govern their transaction, even as to issues going to the validity of the contract.\u201d). <em>See. Nat\u2019l Glass, Inc. v. J.C. Penney Props., Inc., </em>336 Md. 606, 610, 650 A.2d 246, 248 (1994).
