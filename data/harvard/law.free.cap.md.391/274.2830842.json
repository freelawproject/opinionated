Secure Financial Service, Inc. appeals the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>of the Circuit Court for Frederick County, raising three questions for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-4\">\u201c1. Whether the trial court erred in enforcing an indefinite venue provision?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-5\">2. Whether the trial court erred in enforcing a choice of law provision that would result in a due process violation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-6\">3. Whether the trial court erred in granting the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">We shall answer the third question first and hold that in this declaratory judgment action, the trial court erred in dismissing the Complaint and failing to declare the rights and obligations of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">Appellant Secure Financial Service, Inc., a Maryland corporation with its principal place of business in Maryland, entered into a contract with Norvergence Communications, Inc., a New Jersey corporation, on July 11, 2003. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Norvergence was to provide various telecommunications services and equipment to appellant over a five-year period at a total cost of $13,500, payable at $225 per month. Five days after the contract was formed, Norvergence assigned the contract to appellee Popular Leasing USA, Inc. on July 16, 2003, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Missouri. The Equipment Rental Agreement between Norvergence and Secure Financial permitted this assignment, providing as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-10\">\u201cWe may sell, assign or transfer all or any part of this Rental and/or the Equipment without notifying you. The new owner will have the same rights that we have, but not our obligations. You agree you will not assert against the new owner any claims, defenses or set-offs that you may have against us.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">Appellant was instructed by Norvergence to send all future payments due under the agreement to Popular Leasing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-12\">\u201cAll terms and conditions remain unchanged except you are to make all Equipment Rental payments to Popular Leasing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>U.S.A., Inc. starting with your first invoice, which will be sent to you within 60 days:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-4\">Popular Leasing USA Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\">P.O. Box 4240</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">Carol Steam, IL 60197-4240.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">Norvergence entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy on June 30, 2004, and that proceeding was converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation on July 14, 2004. Appellant did not make the monthly payment under the agreement due on August 20, 2004. By letter, Popular Leasing informed Secure Financial that the latter was in default of the contract, and that the balance due upon the contract, $10,319.18, had been accelerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">Prior to receiving Popular Leasing\u2019s letter, Secure Financial filed a declaratory judgment action pursuant to Md.Code (1973, Repl.Vol.2002, 2005 Cum.Supp.), \u00a7 3-403 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article in the Circuit Court for Frederick County.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Count I of the Complaint sought a declaration that the forum-selection clause and the choice-of-law provision were unenforceable. Count II sought a declaration that the Equipment Rental Agreement was unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">The applicable law provision of the lease states in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-10\">\u201cThis agreement shall be governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State in which Renter\u2019s principal offices are located or, if this Lease is assigned by Renter, the State in which assignee\u2019s principal offices are located, without regard to such State\u2019s choice of law considerations and all legal actions relating to this Lease shall be venued exclusively in a state or federal court located within that State, such court to be chosen at Renter or Renter\u2019s assignee\u2019s sole option. You hereby waive right to a trial by jury in any lawsuit in any way relating to this rental.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Popular Leasing filed a Motion to Dismiss, arguing that the forum-selection provision was enforceable as a matter of law, and that Secure Financial did not allege any set of facts upon which a court could find the contract unconscionable. Secure Financial responded, arguing that it could not have reasonably anticipated being haled into court in Missouri when it signed a contract in Maryland for services to be delivered in Maryland. Because the proper venue could be changed by the unilateral action of the lessor or its assignee\u2014Popular Leasing in the instant case\u2014simply by assigning the contract to another party or moving its principal place of business, Secure Financial contended, the applicable law provision is vague, and not enforceable. The Circuit Court for Frederick County agreed with Popular Leasing, and ruled that the provisions were enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">Secure Financial noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. We granted certiorari on our own initiative to consider the issues presented in this appeal. 388 Md. 97, 879 A.2d 42 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Before the Circuit Court, at a hearing on its Motion to Dismiss the Complaint for Declaratory Judgment, Popular Leasing maintained that the Complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and presented three arguments: (1) that the contract cannot be unconscionable on the face of the pleadings because there is no allegation that there was an unconscionable contract at the time the parties entered into the contract; (2) that the forum-selection clause is not unreasonable; and (3) that the declaratory judgment action is not ripe for decision because there does not exist a judicial issue or controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Secure Financial advised the trial court that Popular Leasing had in fact filed suit against it in Missouri, a representation uncontroverted by Popular Leasing. Secure Financial opposed the Motion to Dismiss the declaratory judgment action, arguing that the Circuit Court had to decide the issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>presented and that the Court should take evidence at a trial on the matter. Secure Financial represented to the court that Norvergence\u2019s special system, the \u201cMatrix 2001\u201d was a hoax\u2014that this \u201cmagic box\u201d is worth $250.00, maybe $500.00, and under the lease it is required to pay more than $12,000.00 for it, and that those facts can be determined by the Court to be unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">Unfortunately, the Court dismissed the Complaint for declaratory relief, ruling as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\">\u201cWe are here on the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the complaint for declaratory relief. There are several grounds upon which the defendant is asking this Court to dismiss. The complaint principally [sic], in proper venue, as well as failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. I am not going to reach failure to state a claim. The Court grants the motion to dismiss for the venue. I have reviewed this carefully. I have reviewed the contract. It\u2019s very clear to me when I reviewed this contract that these parties knew, one thing, they wouldn\u2019t be litigating in Maryland. They knew from that contract that, and it\u2019s clear to me from this express language of the contract, that the parties knew that they weren\u2019t going to litigate in Maryland. The contract says it will be where the lessor or its assignee, so, therefore, it\u2019s clear to me from reviewing the contract the parties knew that this could perhaps be assigned. And, yes, the original contract, the original lessor was in New Jersey, but that original lessor through this bankruptcy proceeding has assigned it to a lessor in Missouri, and I also reviewed the cases here, and it\u2019s clear to me that Maryland courts typically uphold venue provisions in contracts. They enforce the choice of venue clauses. I also reviewed ... the restatement that counsel for the plaintiff has asked me to look at. The law of the state chosen by the parties to govern their contractual rights and duties will be applied if the particular issue is one which the parties could have resolved by an explicit provision in their agreement directed to that issue. Two, the law of the state chosen by the parties to govern their contractual rights and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>duties will be applied, even if the particular issue is one which the parties could not have [sic] resolve by an explicit provision in their agreement directed to that issue, unless the chosen state has no substantial relationship to the parties or the transaction. But, here, I find there is because Missouri\u2019s aware the assignee conducts business, and the language of the contract makes it clear that the parties knew that there was a possibility of the assignment. So I do grant the motion to dismiss.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">The trial court erred in dismissing the Complaint and in failing to enter a declaratory judgment defining the rights and obligations of the parties under the agreement in a separate document. <em>See Converge v. Curran, </em>383 Md. 462, 477, 860 A.2d 871, 880 (2004); <em>Salamon v. Progressive, </em>379 Md. 301, 307-08 n. 7, 841 A.2d 858, 862-63 n. 7 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The Declaratory Judgment Act states that it is a remedial statute; its purpose is to \u201csettle and afford relief from uncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights, status, and other legal relations.\u201d \u00a7 3-402.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It should be \u201cliberally construed and administered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Act grants courts the power to grant declaratory relief to \u201c[a]ny person interested under a deed, will, trust, land patent, written contract, or other writing constituting a contract, or whose rights, status, or other legal relations are affected by a statute, municipal ordinance, administrative rule or regulation, contract, or franchise ....\u201d\u00a7 3-406. Thus, the circuit court has jurisdiction to construe a written contract and declare the rights of the parties under it. <em>See Northern Assurance Co. v. EDP Floors, </em>311 Md. 217, 223, 533 A.2d 682, 685 (1987). Notwithstanding the purpose of the statute as remedial and the plain language that it should be liberally construed and administered, a justiciable controversy is a prerequisite to the maintenance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>a declaratory judgment action. <em>See Converge, </em>383 Md. at 478, 860 A.2d at 880 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">In addition, \u201c[wjhen entering a declaratory judgment, the court must, in a separate document, state in writing its declaration of rights of the parties, along with any other order that is intended to be part of the judgment.\u201d <em>Allstate v. State Farm, </em>363 Md. 106, 117 n. 1, 767 A.2d 831, 837 n. 1 (2001). <em>See also </em>Md. Rule 2-601(a) (stating, in pertinent part, that \u201c[ejach judgment shall be set forth on a separate document\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Over and over again this Court has admonished trial courts that when a declaratory judgment is brought, and the controversy is appropriate for resolution by declaratory judgment, the court must enter a declaratory judgment. <em>See, e.g., Converge, </em>383 Md. at 477, 860 A.2d at 880; <em>Salamon, </em>379 Md. at 307-08 n. 7, 841 A.2d at 862-63 n. 7; <em>Jackson v. Millstone, </em>369 Md. 575, 593-94, 801 A.2d 1034, 1045 (2002); <em>Allstate, </em>363 Md. at 117 n. 1, 767 A.2d at 837 n. 1; <em>Christ v. DNR, </em>335 Md. 427, 435-36, 644 A.2d 34, 38 (1994). Recently, in <em>Allstate v. State Farm, </em>363 Md. 106, 117 n. 1, 767 A.2d 831, 837 n. 1 (2001), Judge Wilner, writing for the Court, stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-6\">\u201cOnce again, we are presented with a declaratory judgment action in which there is no written declaratory judgment. We have admonished trial courts that, when a declaratory judgment action is brought and the controversy is appropriate for resolution by declaratory judgment, the court must enter a declaratory judgment and that judgment, defining the rights and obligations of the parties or the status of the thing in controversy, must be in writing. It is not permissible for the court to issue an oral declaration. The text of the judgment must be in writing. <em>See Harford Mutual Ins. Co. v. Woodfin, </em>344 Md. 399, 414-15, 687 A.2d 652, 659 (1997); <em>Ashton v. Brown, </em>339 Md. 70, 87, 660 A.2d 447, 455 (1995); <em>Christ v. Department of Natural Resources, </em>335 Md. 427, 435, 644 A.2d 34, 38 (1994). Nor, since the 1997 amendment to Maryland Rule 2-601(a), is it permissible for the declaratory judgment to be part of a memorandum. That rule requires that \u2018each judgment shall be set forth on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>a separate document.\u2019 When entering a declaratory judgment, the court must, in a separate document, state in writing its declaration of the rights of the parties, along with any other order that is intended to be part of the judgment. Although the judgment may recite that it is based on the reasons set forth in an accompanying memorandum, the terms of the declaratory judgment itself must be set forth separately. Incorporating by reference an earlier oral ruling is not sufficient, as no one would be able to discern the actual declaration of rights from the document posing as the judgment. This is not just a matter of complying with a hyper-technical rule. The requirement that the court enter its declaration in writing is for the purpose of giving the parties and the public fair notice of what the court has determined.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">We are required in the instant case to reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court because the controversy was justiciable and that in dismissing the Complaint, the trial court did not enter a declaration in writing, declaring the rights and obligations of the parties. The trial court dismissed the Complaint erroneously and precluded appellant from presenting evidence, as it was entitled to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The primary issue raised by appellant is whether the forum-selection clause, contained within the contract between Secure Financial and Norvergence, and assigned to Popular Leasing, is enforceable. Appellant maintains that the clause is unreasonable and unjust making it unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">The prevailing view in this country is that forum-selection clauses are presumptively enforceable. <em>See, e.g., Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. v. Shute, </em>499 U.S. 585, 594-95, 111 S.Ct. 1522, 1527-28, 113 L.Ed.2d 622 (1991); <em>M/S Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., </em>407 U.S. 1, 15, 92 S.Ct. 1907, 1916, 32 L.Ed.2d 513 (1972); <em>Allen v. Lloyd\u2019s of London, </em>94 F.3d 923, 928 (4th Cir.1996); <em>Kevlin Servs., Inc. v. Lexington State Bank, </em>46 F.3d 13, 15 (5th Cir.1995); <em>Effron v.

Mousseux, </em>123 Ariz. 59, 597 P.2d 541, 542-43 (1979); <em>Preferred Cap. Inc. v. Power Engineering Group, Inc., </em>163 Ohio App.3d 522, 839 N.E.2d 416, 421 (2005). <em>See also Manrique v. Fabbri, </em>493 So.2d 437, 439-40 (Fla.1986); <em>Hauenstein &amp; Bermeister, Inc. v. Met-Fab Indus., Inc., </em>320 N.W.2d 886, 889-90 (Minn.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">In <em>Gilman v. Wheat, First Securities, </em>345 Md. 361, 692 A.2d 454 (1997), we endorsed the view of the United States Supreme Court in determining the enforceability of forum-selection clauses, setting forth the following framework:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-5\">\u201cWe distill from <em>[M/S Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., </em>407 U.S. 1, 92 S.Ct. 1907, 32 L.Ed.2d 513 (1972) and <em>Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. v. Shute, </em>499 U.S. 585, 111 S.Ct. 1522, 113 L.Ed.2d 622 (1991)], as have most courts, especially since 1992, that: (1) a forum-selection clause is presumptively valid and enforceable and the party resisting it has the burden of demonstrating that it is unreasonable; (2) a court may deny enforcement of such a clause upon a clear showing that, in the particular circumstance, enforcement would be unreasonable, and (3) the clause may be found to be unreasonable if (i) it was induced by fraud or overreaching, (ii) the contractually selected forum is so unfair and inconvenient as, for all practical purposes to deprive the plaintiff of a remedy or its day in court, or (iii) enforcement would contravene a strong public policy of the State where the action is filed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 378, 692 A.2d 454, 462-63 (1997); <em>see Stockley v. Thomas, </em>89 Md. 663, 668-69, 43 A. 766, 768 (1899) (concluding that, where plaintiffs \u201chave voluntarily abandoned the [c]ourts of this State\u201d through a contract, there is \u201cno good reason\u201d why their complaint should be adjudicated by a Maryland court). <em>See also Koch v. America Online, Inc., </em>139 F.Supp.2d 690, 693 (D.Md.2000) (interpreting <em>Gilman </em>as wholly consistent with \u201cthe federal standard for evaluation of forum-selection clauses\u201d adopted in <em>The </em>Bremen).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>In <em>Gilman, </em>we adopted the view of forum-selection clauses set out in the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 80 (1971) (amended 1988). <em>See Gilman, </em>345 Md. at 382-83, 692 A.2d at 465. That section sets out the modern view that \u201c[t]he parties\u2019 agreement as to the place of the action will be given effect unless it is unfair or unreasonable.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 80 (1971) (amended 1988). Under this section, a plaintiff who brings an action in violation of a choice-of-forum provision bears the burden of proving that enforcing the clause is unfair or unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 80 cmt. c. A plaintiff might establish also that (1) the choice-of-forum provision was \u201cobtained by fraud, duress, the abuse of economic power, or other unconscionable means\u201d or (2) the courts of the chosen state \u201cwould be closed to the suit or would not handle it effectively or fairly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 80 cmt. c.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">As we have indicated <em>supra, </em>in addition to the due process arguments, Secure Financial argues, in essence, that the underlying contract was fraudulent and that enforcing the choice-of-forum provision is unfair and unreasonable. Appellee asserts that Secure Financial has not met its burden of showing that the shifting forum-selection clause is unreasonable under the circumstances because Secure Financial cannot show that the forum-selection clause was induced by fraud or overreaching or that the contractually selected forum is unfair and inconvenient, or that enforcement would contravene a strong public policy of the State where the action was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Secure Financial never had the opportunity to present evidence that the forum-selection provision was induced by fraud or overreaching, or that as a matter of fact, it would be unfair or unreasonable to enforce the clause.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>We point out that the enforceability of this same forum-selection clause involving Norvergence has been the subject of much litigation around the country. Some courts have enforced the same floating forum-selection clause in cases where a party contracting with Norvergence for equipment rental has been sued by Norvergence\u2019s assignee. <em>See, e.g., IFC Credit Corp. v. Aliano Bros. Gen.
