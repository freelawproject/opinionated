National Hockey League, </em>893 F.2d 459, 462 (1st Cir.1990). The numerous interconnected business entities involved in the present case further complicate this already challenging area of the law. We consider here whether a Maryland state court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a foreign limited partnership whose only connection to Maryland consists of its corporate managing general partner\u2019s re-incorporation in Maryland. We consider also whether that general partner itself may be held liable for the actions of the foreign limited partnership entity, occurring outside of Maryland, in a contractual dispute among the partners of a second, distinct foreign limited partnership of which the first foreign limited partnership is the general partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">The premise of the cause of action underlying this case is about its only relatively straight-forward aspect.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hellyer Avenue Limited Partnership (\u201cHALP\u201d) was established in the summer of 2000, pursuant to the California Uniform Limited Partnership Act, for the purpose of developing, constructing, and managing a headquarters building in California for a communications company. The principal office and place of business of HALP also is in California. HALP consists of: Mission West Properties, L.P. (\u201cMWLP\u201d), the managing general partner and registered agent of HALP; Republic Properties Corporation (\u201cRepublic\u201d), also a general partner of HALP; and Steven Grigg (\u201cGrigg\u201d), David Peter (\u201cPeter\u201d), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>and Mentmore Partners LLC (\u201cMentmore\u201d), the three limited partners of HALP. The present action was brought by Republic, Grigg, Peter, and Mentmore (collectively the \u201cSuing HALP Partners\u201d) against MWLP, the managing general partner of HALP, and Mission West Properties, Inc. (\u201cMWINC\u201d), the general partner of MWLP.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">MWLP was formed as a limited partnership under Delaware law, but maintains its principal place of business in California. MWINC, the general partner of MWLP, was incorporated initially under the laws of California as a real estate investment trust, but later was re-incorporated in 1999 under the laws of Maryland. As required under Maryland law, MWINC named a registered agent in Maryland as part of its re-incorporation under Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">The Suing HALP Partners filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City alleging that MWLP, acting through its general partner MWINC, breached the HALP partnership agreement by improperly diluting the interests of the Suing HALP Partners in HALP and failing to make owed distributions. The complaint named as defendants MWLP and MWINC. The Circuit Court denied MWLP\u2019s and MWINC\u2019s motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. After a week-long bench trial, the trial judge concluded that, under California law, MWLP and MWINC breached the partnership agreement. Accordingly, judgments for damages were entered in favor of the Suing HALP Partners against both defendants jointly and severally.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">The Court of Special Appeals, in a reported opinion, <em>Mission West Properties, L.P. v. Republic Properties Corporation, </em>162 Md.App. 17, 873 A.2d 372 (2005), vacated the judgments against MWLP and MWINC. The intermediate appellate court determined that the Circuit Court lacked personal jurisdiction over MWLP. <em>Mission West, </em>162 Md. App. at 38, 873 A.2d at 384. Because MWLP was not domiciled in Maryland, and although \u201cMWLP was properly served with process in Maryland,\u201d it \u201cnever conducted <em>any </em>activity of any kind in Maryland.\u201d <em>Mission West, </em>162 Md. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>App. at 30, 37, 873 A.2d at 380, 384 (Emphasis in original). Derivative of its conclusion regarding MWLP, the Court of Special Appeals vacated the judgment against MWINC as \u201cMWINC face[d] liability only by virtue of its status as corporate general partner of MWLP.\u201d <em>Mission West, </em>162 Md.App. at 38, 873 A.2d at 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">We granted the Suing HALP Partners\u2019 Petition for Writ of Certiorari to consider whether: (1) the Court of Special Appeals erred in concluding that the Circuit Court lacked personal jurisdiction over MWLP where the foreign limited partnership was served with process upon the Maryland resident agent of its general partner, MWINC,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a corporation that re-incorporated in Maryland, and (2) the Court of Special Appeals erred in vacating the judgment of the Circuit Court against MWINC \u201cbecause MWINC face[d] liability only by virtue of its status as corporate general partner of MWLP.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Republic v.

(Stellex Microwave) was a high-tech communications company with its principal place of business in Palo Alto, California. The company\u2019s management wanted to relocate its headquarters to the Silicon Valley region of California, but the company could not afford to build such a facility and could not obtain suitable financing. Stellex Microwave was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Stellex Industries, Inc. (\u201cStellex Industries\u201d), also known as Stellex Technologies, Inc. Stellex Industries was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mentmore Holdings Corporation, which, in turn, was owned by two trusts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-7\">Stellex Microwave\u2019s management tried to negotiate a deal with Carl Berg, a prominent Silicon Valley real estate developer. He \u201ccontrols\u201d a California construction company called Berg &amp; Berg Enterprises (B &amp; B).n Berg is also president and CEO of MWINC, a real estate investment trust incorporated under the laws of California and reincorporated under the laws of Maryland, with its principal place of business in California. MWINC is the corporate general partner of MWLP, which itself is a Delaware limited partnership with its principal place of business in California. Nothing in the record shows that either MWINC or MWLP ever transacted any business in Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>Stellex Microwave\u2019s negotiations with Berg were unsuccessful. As a fallback measure, Stellex Microwave contracted with Republic, a corporation organized under the laws of the District of Columbia, with its principal place of business there. Under their agreement, Republic was to provide a headquarters to Stellex Microwave.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-4\">Steven Grigg and David Peter, both officers of Republic, restarted negotiations with Berg on behalf of Stellex Microwave. Through negotiations, Grigg, Peter, and Berg agreed that all the parties would form a joint-venture limited partnership to construct a headquarters for Stellex Microwave. The partnership would then lease the facility to that company, with the partnership itself being the landlord. B &amp; B owned a suitable lot on Hellyer Avenue in San Jose, California, so they named their partnership the Hellyer Avenue Limited Partnership (HALP).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-5\">The constituents of HALP were MWLP, as managing general partner, Republic, as general partner, Grigg and Peter individually, as limited partners, and Mentmore Partners LLC, a Delaware company with its principal place of business in New York. Mentmore Partners was established by Richard Kramer and William Remley for the sole purpose of holding an interest in HALP/] MWLP held a 50% interest in the partnership, and the interests of all the other partners (all of whom were affiliated with Kramer and Remley) held the other 50%.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-6\">The HALP limited partnership agreement essentially conditioned the membership of all partners except MWLP on Stellex Microwave\u2019s payment of all its obligations under the lease. MWLP contends that one of those obligations was paying B <em>&amp; </em>B for certain work Stellex Microwave hired B &amp; B to do on the facility; appellees dispute that that payment was an obligation <em>under the lease. </em>MWLP asserts that payment was not timely made to B &amp; B, that Stellex Microwave defaulted and the default was never cured, and accordingly, MWLP purported to expel all the other partners and stopped paying them their distributions from HALP\u2019s income/]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>Appellees, therefore, brought suit against MWLP for the distributions they contend were owed. The circuit court denied appellants\u2019 motions to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction:[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-5\">I have thought again about the integration and the operation of the partnership statutes, the California Revised Partnership Act and, as it is characterized in the California Revised Limited Partnership Act, and the arguments presented and I\u2019m now satisfied that my ruling earlier was incorrect. I don\u2019t believe that HELLYER is a necessary partyr 1....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-6\">The real effect and import of the integration of those California Statutes and the principles of partnership law satisfy me that, because a general partner can be sued for obligations of the partnership and jointly and severally liable, and because we have here, at least in part, one general partner from HELLYER suing another general partner and another entity, that the interests of HELLYER are necessarily effectively represented and protected by Mission West. Without getting into the identities of what Mr. Berg\u2019s connections are to all of this, because of the principles under the sections 15643 of the California statute and 16405, I am satisfied that [counsel for the Suing HALP Partners] arguments are correct and that I was incorrect earlier. I don\u2019t need to worry or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>agonize any further over the issues that, in effect, I raised and I believe unnecessarily may have complicated this morning, so for that I apologize.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-4\">* * * <em>* *</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-5\">So, that being said, for the clerk\u2019s benefit, and to note for her purposes, the motion of defendant Mission West Properties, L.P. and Mission West Properties Incorporated to dismiss or in the alternative to stay, is heard and denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-6\">Moving on from there, what I would like to do, then\u2014 and I would, for whatever it\u2019s worth, the got you (sic) provision of Maryland law, I think, is probably, as [counsel for the Suing HALP Partners] pointed <em>out,\u2014I did some further research, even though the cases that were noted don\u2019t really address the issues\u2014provides a, basis for sewice of process in Maryland, but that is an academic discussion at this point.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-7\">After a bench trial, the trial judge concluded that MWLP wrongfully stopped payment of distributions to the other partners. The court denied the relief requested by appellants under their counterclaim.

In our analysis, we shall focus exclusively on C <em>&amp; </em>JP \u00a7 6-102(a),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which provides that \u201c[a] court may exercise personal jurisdiction as to any cause of action over a person domiciled in, served with process in, organized under the laws of, or who maintains his principal place of business in the State.\u201d The Suing HALP Partners assert two theories, under C <em>&amp; </em>JP \u00a7 6-102(a), by which a Maryland court could acquire and exercise personal jurisdiction over MWLP. We shall address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Petitioners argue that the Circuit Court possessed jurisdiction over MWLP because the general partner of MWLP was re-incorporated in Maryland, thus causing MWLP to be domiciled in the State as well. As the Suing HALP Partners stated in their brief, \u201cexcept for tax and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>liabilities and rights created specifically by statute, a partnership has no juridical existence except through its partners.\u201d In <em>McLane v. State Tax Commission, </em>156 Md. 133, 145-46, 143 A. 656, 661 (1928), this Court, as Petitioners correctly noted, recognized that a partnership may be treated as a distinct legal entity for the purpose of taxation. We now also recognize that a limited partnership may be considered a distinct legal entity from its constituent partners for purposes of determining personal jurisdiction questions in our courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">A partnership is defined in the Maryland Revised Uniform Partnership Act (\u201cRUPA\u201d) of the Corporations and Associations (\u201cC &amp; A\u201d) Article of the Maryland Code (1975, 1999 Repl.Vol.) as \u201can association of two or more persons to carry on as co-owners a business for profit....\u201d C &amp; A \u00a7 9A-101(i). A limited partnership is defined under the Maryland Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (\u201cRULPA\u201d), Md. Code (1975, 1999 Repl.Vol.), as \u201ca partnership formed by two or more persons under the laws of the State and having one or more general partners and one or more limited partners.\u201d C &amp; A \u00a7 10-101(i). An important similarity in the statutory treatment of the two business entities in Maryland is the application of an \u201centity\u201d theory with regard to both. Under RUPA, which took effect in 1982, \u201c[a] partnership is an entity distinct from its partners.\u201d C &amp; A \u00a7 9A-201. As we noted in <em>Creel v. Lilly, </em>354 Md. 77, 89-90, 729 A.2d 385, 392 (1999),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtL\">RUPA\u2019s underlying philosophy differs radically from UPA\u2019s, [which governed partnerships before the enactment of RUPA,] thus laying the foundation for many of its innovative measures. RUPA adopts the \u201centity\u201d theory of partnership as opposed to the \u201caggregate\u201d theory that the UPA espouse[d]. Under the aggregate theory, a partnership is characterized by the collection of its individual members, with the result being that if one of the partners dies or withdraws, the partnership ceases to exist. On the other hand, RUPA\u2019s entity theory allows for the partnership to continue even with -the departure of a member because it views the partnership as \u201can entity distinct from its partners.\u201d (Internal citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>The Suing HALP Partners, quoting from <em>C.T. Carden v. Arkoma Associates, </em>494 U.S. 185, 190, 110 S.Ct. 1015, 1018, 108 L.Ed.2d 157, 165 (1990), argue that the jurisdictional domicile of a limited partnership is the domicile of its partners because \u201cwhile a corporation would be viewed as a legal entity for purposes of jurisdiction, all other entities \u2018would be treated for purposes of the diversity statute pursuant to ... [t]he tradition of the common law, which is to treat as legal persons only incorporated groups and to assimilate all others to partnerships.\u2019 \u201d (Internal quotations omitted). Yet, as the Court of Special Appeals noted in its opinion in the present case, <em>see Mission West, </em>162 Md.App. at 29, 873 A.2d at 379, the Supreme Court, in <em>C.T. Carden, </em>was addressing only whether an artificial entity may be considered a \u201ccitizen\u201d of the state under whose laws it was created with regard to subject matter jurisdiction, in the context specifically of determining diversity jurisdiction in federal courts. <em>C.T. Carden, </em>494 U.S. at 187, 110 S.Ct. at 1017, 108 L.Ed.2d at 163. In addition, Maryland, through its statutes, applies the entity theory approach to partnerships and limited partnerships. Therefore, we find <em>C.T. Carden </em>not instructive in determining the domicile of a foreign limited partnership for purposes of personal jurisdiction in Maryland\u2019s state courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">In the present case, we need not consider whether the state of formation of a limited partnership or the state in which the limited partnership maintains its principle place of business, or any combination of the two, is determinative of a limited partnership\u2019s domicile. The state of incorporation of the corporate entity that may be a general partner (managing or otherwise) of a foreign limited partnership is not, however, the domicile of the limited partnership for the purpose of determining personal jurisdiction in Maryland\u2019s courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">Alternatively, the Suing HALP Partners argue that MWLP was served with process in Maryland under Maryland Rule 2-124(1) because they served the Maryland resident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>agent of MWLP\u2019s general partner, MWINC, and, therefore, satisfied the basis of C &amp; JP \u00a7 6-102(a) providing for jurisdiction \u201cover a person ... served with process in ... the State.\u201d Maryland Rule 2\u2014124(f), which describes the procedure for serving a \u201climited partnership,\u201d provides that \u201c[sjervice is made upon a limited partnership by serving its resident agent. If the limited partnership has no resident agent or if a good faith attempt to serve the resident agent has failed, service may be made upon any general partner or other person expressly or impliedly authorized to receive service of process.\u201d The Suing HALP Partners assert that service of process according to Rule 2\u2014124(f) alone establishes a basis for personal jurisdiction over MWLP.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Assuming that MWLP, a foreign limited partnership, was served properly with process through service on the Maryland resident agent of its general partner, MWINC, as outlined under Maryland Rule 2\u2014124(f),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> such service of pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>cess alone, under the circumstances in the present case, is insufficient to establish personal jurisdiction over MWLP. Rule 2\u2014124(f) does not delimit the jurisdictional limits of Maryland courts, but rather serves as part of the service of process rules that define the procedural requirements that enable a Maryland court to obtain jurisdiction over a defendant where constitutionally permitted. <em>See </em>Md. Rule l-201(b) (\u201cThese rules shall not be construed to extend or limit the jurisdiction of any court or, except as expressly provided, the venue of actions.\u201d); One Hundred Twenty-Seventh Report of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, Letter by the Rules Committee Chairman (Judge Alan M. Wilner) to the Court of Appeals (March 18, 1994) (\u201cThe amendments to Rules 2-124 and 3-124 are designed to make clear how service is to be effected on general and limited partnerships, limited liability companies, and unincorporated associations.\u201d); One Hundred Twenty-Seventh Report of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, Rule 2-124, Reporter\u2019s Note (1994) (stating that section (f) was \u201cproposed to address a gap in the current rules, which do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>address service upon ... a limited partnership\u201d). Therefore, satisfaction of the procedural requirement, Maryland Rule 2-124(f), does not confer, by itself, personal jurisdiction over MWLP by a Maryland state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">In <em>Pennoyer v. Neff, </em>95 U.S. 714, 733, 24 L.Ed. 565, 572 (1878), the U.S. Supreme Court concluded that when an action \u201cinvolves merely a determination of the personal liability of the defendant, he must be brought within its jurisdiction by service of process within the State, or his voluntary appearance.\u201d As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit subsequently noted, \u201c[i]t remains well-established that a state\u2019s sovereignty over persons, property and activities extends only within the state\u2019s geographical borders and that therefore its laws have no operation in another state except as allowed by the other state or by comity.\u201d <em>Lesnick v. Hollingsworth &amp; Vose Co., </em>35 F.3d 939, 941 (4th Cir.1994) (citing <em>Pennoyer v. Neff, </em>95 U.S. 714, 24 L.Ed. 565 (1878)); <em>see also McSherry v. McSherry, </em>113 Md. 395, 400, 77 A. 653, 655 (1910) (\u201cWhere, however, a defendant appears generally, either in person or by attorney, or process is served upon him within the State, the Court acquires jurisdiction over him for the purpose of the suit.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">The Supreme Court continues to recognize the validity of conferring personal jurisdiction based solely on the physical presence of the defendant within the forum. In <em>Burnham v. Superior Court of California, </em>495 U.S. 604, 610, 110 S.Ct. 2105, 2110, 109 L.Ed.2d 631, 639 (1990), the Court addressed \u201cwhether due process requires [an analysis] between the litigation and the defendant\u2019s contacts with the State in cases where the defendant is physically present in the State at the time process is served upon him.\u201d The defendant, while visiting California on business, was served with a California court summons and a copy of the plaintiffs (the defendant\u2019s wife) divorce petition following a visit with one of their children, who resided in California with the plaintiff mother. <em>Burnham, </em>495 U.S. at 608, 110 S.Ct. at 2109, 109 L.Ed.2d at 638. The Supreme Court commenced its analysis by recogniz<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>ing that \u201c[a]mong the most firmly established principles of personal jurisdiction in American tradition is that the courts of a State have jurisdiction over nonresidents who are physically present in the State.\u201d <em>Burnham, </em>495 U.S. at 610, 110 S.Ct. at 2110, 109 L.Ed.2d at 639. This jurisdictional principle, with regard to service upon a physically present defendant, exists \u201cwithout regard to whether the defendant was only briefly in the State or whether the cause of action was related to his activities there.\u201d <em>Burnham, </em>495 U.S. at 612, 110 S.Ct. at 2111, 109 L.Ed.2d at 640. Yet, while instructive, as the Court of Special Appeals correctly noted in the present case, <em>see Mission West, </em>162 Md.App. at 38 n. 13, 873 A.2d at 384 n. 13, <em>Burnham </em>was confined to circumstances where service of process was made upon a natural person who was personally within the forum state when served. The present case is not analogous to that context.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">Since <em>Pennoyer, </em>advancements in commerce and transportation have created a need for determining the jurisdictional reach of state courts over non-residents not dependant solely upon a territorial basis. <em>See Burnham, </em>495 U.S. at 617, 110 S.Ct. at 2114, 109 L.Ed.2d at 643; <em>Lesnick, </em>35 F.3d at 942. Further muddying the traditional physical presence jurisdictional standard was the increased usage of the corporate entity and the fiction it created.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In <em>St. Clair v. Cox, </em>106 U.S. 350, 355, 1 S.Ct. 354, 358, 27 L.Ed. 222, 224 (1882), the Supreme Court noted this concern as corporations increasingly began to enter multiple geographical fora throughout the country: \u201cThis doctrine of the exemption of a corporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>from suit in a state other than that of its creation, was the cause of much inconvenience and often of manifest injustice.\u201d The Court observed that while \u201c[individuals] can act by themselves, and upon them process can be directly served, ... a corporation can only act and be reached through agents.\u201d <em>St. Clair, </em>106 U.S. at 356, 1 S.Ct. at 359, 27 L.Ed. at 225. Yet, service upon the agent of a foreign corporation in the forum was not sufficient by itself to confer personal jurisdiction. As the Supreme Court remarked,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-5\">we are of the opinion that when service is made within the state upon an agent of a foreign corporation it is essential, in order to support the jurisdiction of the court to render a personal judgment, that it should appear somewhere in the record ... that the corporation was engaged in business in the state.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-6\"><em>St. Clair, </em>106 U.S. at 359, 1 S.Ct. at 362, 27 L.Ed. at 226. Thus, where a corporation once was required to be present physically in the state to be subjected to <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction in that forum, the Supreme Court, in <em>St. Clair, </em>recognized that a corporation could be considered present within a state through its authorized agents that conducted the corporation\u2019s activities in the forum state.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">Extending the notion of establishing <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction through implied consent,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> in <em>Pennsylvania Fire Insurance Company of Philadelphia v.

The Court specifically highlighted that the defendant obtained a license to do business in Missouri and, as a result, voluntarily filed a power of attorney consenting to service of process upon the superintendent as equating to personal service upon the company. <em>Pennsylvania Fire, </em>243 U.S. at 94, 37 S.Ct. at 345, 61 L.Ed. at 616. Accordingly, the Court concluded that the defendant, by voluntarily filing the power of attorney document, created the equivalent of an agent authorized to receive service. <em>Pennsylvania Fire, </em>243 U.S. at 95, 37 S.Ct. at 345, 61 L.Ed. at 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\">Decided on the same day as <em>Pennsylvania, Fire, </em>the Court in <em>Philadelphia &amp; Reading Railway Company v.

The Supreme Court concluded that the defendant company was not doing business within New York because it was not situated within the State, had no dock, freight, or passenger ticket office within the state, transacted no business within the state, and no business was transacted in the state on its behalf. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Almost four decades later, the Supreme Court, in its landmark decision, <em>International Shoe Company v. State of Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945), settled upon a more flexible analytical scheme, founded upon the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court determined that the State of Washington could establish <em>in </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number><em>personam, </em>jurisdiction to collect taxes under a state statute from a Delaware corporation where the foreign corporation was served with process through personal service upon a salesman employed by the corporation and received a copy of the notice, by registered mail, at its corporate address in Missouri.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>International Shoe, </em>326 U.S. at 312, 66 S.Ct. at 156, 90 L.Ed. at 99. After recognizing generally the historical physical presence requirement for determining <em>in personam </em>jurisdiction divined in <em>Pennoyer, </em>the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-5\">[b]ut now that the capias ad respondendum has given way to personal service of summons or other form of notice, due process requires only that in order to subject a defendant to a judgment in personam, if he be not present within the territory of the forum, he have certain minimum contacts with it such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend \u201ctraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u201d (Citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-6\"><em>International Shoe, </em>326 U.S. at 316, 66 S.Ct. at 158, 90 L.Ed. at 102. Then, considering the traditional physical presence requirement with regard to corporate entities, the Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>Since the corporate personality is a fiction, although a fiction intended to be acted upon as though it were a fact, <em>Klein v. Board of Tax Supervisors, </em>282 U.S. 19, 24, 51 S.Ct. 15, 16, 75 L.Ed. 140, 73 A.L.R. 679, it is clear that unlike an individual its \u201cpresence\u201d without, as well as within, the state of its origin can be manifested only by activities carried on in its behalf by those who are authorized to act for it. To say that the corporation is so far \u201cpresent\u201d there as to satisfy due process requirements, for purposes of taxation or the maintenance of suits against it in the courts of the state, is to beg the question to be decided. For the terms \u201cpresent\u201d or \u201cpresence\u201d are used merely to symbolize those activities of the corporation\u2019s agent within the state which courts will deem to be sufficient to satisfy the demands of due process. L. Hand, J., in <em>Hutchinson v. Chase &amp; Gilbert, </em>2 Cir., 45 F.2d 139, 141. Those demands may be met by such contacts of the corporation with the state of the forum as make it reasonable, in the context of our federal system of government, to require the corporation to defend the particular suit which is brought there. An \u201cestimate of the inconveniences\u201d which would result to the corporation from a trial away from its \u201chome\u201d or principal place of business is relevant in this connection. <em>Hutchinson v. Chase &amp; Gilbert, supra, </em>45 F.2d [at] 141.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-5\">\u201cPresence\u201d in the state in this sense has never been doubted when the activities of the corporation there have not only been continuous and systematic, but also give rise to the liabilities sued on, even though no consent to be sued or authorization to an agent to accept service of process has been given. <em>St. Clair v. Cox, </em>106 U.S. 350, 355, 1 S.Ct. 354, 359, 27 L.Ed. 222; <em>Connecticut Mutual Life Ins. Co. v.

Conversely it has been generally recognized that the casual presence of the corporate agent or even his conduct of single or isolated items of activities in a state in the corporation\u2019s behalf are not enough to subject it to suit on causes of action unconnected with the activities there. <em>St. Clair v.

Reiterating the analysis developed in <em>International Shoe, </em>the Court stated that \u201c[t]he amount and kind of activities which must be earned on by the foreign corporation in the state of the forum so as to make it reasonable and just to subject the corporation to the jurisdiction of that state are to be determined in each case.\u201d <em>Perkins, </em>342 U.S. at 445, 72 S.Ct. at 418, 96 L.Ed. at 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">With regard to an action not arising out of the corporation\u2019s activities within the forum state, however, the business conducted in the state must be \u201csufficiently substantial.\u201d <em>Perkins, </em>342 U.S. at 447, 72 S.Ct. at 419, 96 L.Ed. at 493. \u201cThe corporate activities of a foreign corporation which, under state statute, make it necessary for it to secure a license and to designate a statutory agent upon whom process may be served provide a helpful but not a conclusive test.\u201d <em>Perkins, </em>342 U.S. at 445, 72 S.Ct. at 418, 96 L.Ed. at 492. Ultimately, the Court determined that the defendant corporation conducted the required amount of business in Ohio in order to establish jurisdiction over the corporation with regard to an action that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>did not arise in the state and did not relate to the corporation\u2019s activities within the forum. <em>Perkins, </em>342 U.S. at 448, 72 S.Ct. at 420, 96 L.Ed. at 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">The Maryland Court of Special Appeals faced a confluence of these same issues in <em>Springle v.

One of those questions was \u201cwhether, and to what extent, jurisdiction may constitutionally attach to a foreign corporation simply by virtue of its being served with process in Maryland.\u201d <em>Springle, </em>40 Md.App. at 270, 391 A.2d at 460. The plaintiff, a resident of North Carolina, sued the defendant corporation, incorporated in Delaware, but maintaining its principle place of business in Virginia, for injuries he suffered while aboard the defendant\u2019s vessel in North Carolina. <em>Springle, </em>40 Md.

Suit was filed in a Maryland state court and service of process was made upon the corporation\u2019s resident agent in Maryland. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Writing at the time for the panel of the Court of Special Appeals, Judge Wilner observed that C &amp; JP \u00a7 6-102(a) \u201cwould appear to provide an independent basis for jurisdiction over appellee, a basis apart from those set forth in [C &amp; JP] \u00a7 6-103 and founded solely upon appellee\u2019s being served with process in Maryland.\u201d <em>Springle, </em>40 Md.App. at 270, 391 A.2d at 459-60. In supplying a detailed review of the historical development of early jurisdictional statutes in Maryland, <em>see Springle, </em>40 Md.App. at 271-79, 391 A.2d at 460-64, the intermediate appellate court noted the impact <em>International Shoe </em>had on the jurisdictional landscape in developing a \u201cnew, more flexible, test.\u201d <em>Springle, </em>40 Md.App. at 280, 391 A.2d at 464.

That question was answered in <em>Perkins v. Benquet Consolidated Mining Co., </em>342 U.S. 437[, 72 S.Ct. 413, 96 L.Ed. 485] (1952), when the Court concluded that due process would not be offended by the exercise of such jurisdiction.

(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-5\"><em>Springle, </em>40 Md.App. at 283, 391 A.2d at 466. In discussing the modification made to the statute, which is included in the current version of C <em>&amp; </em>JP \u00a7 6-102(a), the court noted the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-6\">The dilemma we face here arose from what, if read literally, would have been perhaps the most sweeping and dramatic, and yet the most silent and probably unwitting, change yet made by the General Assembly in this area. In 1973, the Legislature enacted the Courts article, a recodif\u00ed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>cation of the laws relating to courts and judicial proceedings. What had formerly been article 75, \u00a7 95\u2014that bypassed backwater of State jurisdiction\u2014was recodified as \u00a7 6-102(a). The Revisor\u2019s Note says of this new section that \u201csubsection (a) presently appears as Article 75, \u00a7 95.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARA\">This is not the case. As noted, \u00a7 6-102(a) provides for personal jurisdiction as to any cause of action over a person <em>served with process </em>in the state. These words were <em>not </em>in the former law. They were apparently added by the Code Revision Commission subcommittee on Courts, although the minutes of the meeting of the subcommittee reflect no debate, discussion, or reasons given for the addition of that phrase. It was simply added to the draft of \u00a7 6-102 that then existed and that, prior to the addition, was more faithful to the source law. The amendment was approved without discussion (at least without discussion reflected in the minutes) by the full Commission at its meeting on June 7, 1973, and thus was included in the draft bill submitted to the Legislature. No further amendments were made, or apparently offered, to that section, which was enacted as submitted by the Code Revision Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">Compounding the somewhat misleading statement that subsection (a) \u201cpresently appear[ed]\u201d in the law was this additional part of the Revisor\u2019s Note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-5\">\u201cSubsection (a) states the general rule that a state has jurisdiction over its residents and over non-residents served with process in the state as to any cause of action wherever it arose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-6\">\u201cAdditional jurisdiction is conferred by \u00a7 6-103 which grants jurisdiction over a broader class of persons as to causes of action arising in Maryland.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">(Emphasis in original) (Alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\"><em>Springle, </em>40 Md.App. at 285-86, 391 A.2d at 467-68.

Accordingly, it concluded that \u201cservice of process, in Maryland, upon a resident agent appointed by a foreign corporation will subject the corporation to State court jurisdiction if, in addition to the fact, and validity, of that service, it is shown that the corporation has sufficient contact with the State to make it constitutionally subject to suit here.\u201d <em>Springle, </em>40 Md.App. at 288, 391 A.2d at 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Although the cases discussed, <em>supra, </em>concerned corporate business entities, we perceive no substantial reason to treat a foreign limited partnership differently with regard to analyzing <em>in personam, </em>jurisdiction.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Therefore, service of process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>within Maryland upon the resident agent of a domestic corporate general partner of a foreign limited partnership does not confer, by itself, personal jurisdiction over the foreign limited partnership in a Maryland court.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">We have stated that \u201cto exercise either general or specific jurisdiction, the defendant must maintain sufficient minimum contacts with the forum such that the exercise of jurisdiction meets the \u2018general test of essential fairness.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Presbyterian Univ.

Because, on this record, MWLP had no contacts with Maryland other than the fact that its corporate managing general partner re-incorporated in the State, the Suing HALP Partners failed to satisfy the requisite constitutional requirements of demonstrating MWLP\u2019s minimum contacts with the forum.

Apparently aware that they failed to raise an argument under C &amp; JP \u00a7 6-103 before the Court of Special Appeals, <em>see Mission West, </em>162 Md.App. at 26-27, 873 A.2d at 377 (\"Important to our analysis is that appellees disavow any reliance on Maryland\u2019s Long Arm jurisdiction statute, [citing C &amp; JP \u00a7 6\u2014103].\u201d), the Suing HALP Partners waited until rebuttal at oral argument before this Court before asserting here the applicability of C &amp; JP \u00a7 6-103. The Suing HALP Partners also failed to include such an argument in their brief here. Given the timing of insertion of this argument, the lack of opportunity for MWLP and MWINC to respond, and the failure to brief properly the authorities, we shall not consider an argument for personal jurisdiction based on C &amp; JP \u00a7 6-103.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b784-6\">. The argument in the present case involves a dispute over personal jurisdiction, not insufficiency of service of process, <em>see </em>Md. Rule 2-322(a); <em>see also Perkins v. Benguet Consolidated Mining Co., </em>342 U.S. 437, 444, 72 S.Ct. 413, 417, 96 L.Ed. 485, 491-92 (1952) (\"The necessary result was a finding of inadequate service in each case and a conclusion that the foreign corporation was not bound by it. The same would be true today in a like proceeding where the only service had and the only notice given was that directed to a public official who had no authority, by statute or otherwise, to accept it in that kind of a proceeding.\u201d). Therefore, we do not have occasion here to determine whether MWLP, a Delaware limited partnership with its principal place of business in California and which conducts no business in Maryland and thus does not compel appointment of a resident agent in Maryland, was served validly with process through the Maryland resident agent of its corporate general partner in accordance with Maryland Rule 2-124(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">Nonetheless, we note that Rule 2-124(f) refers to service of process procedures for a \"limited partnership.\u201d At no place in the Civil Procedure for Circuit Court Title of the Maryland Rules, however, is the term \"limited partnership\u201d defined. In RULPA, \"limited partnership\u201d is defined: \" \u2018limited partnership\u2019 and \u2018domestic limited partnership' mean a partnership formed by two or more persons under the laws of the State....\" C &amp; A \u00a7 10\u2014101(i); <em>see also </em>C &amp; A \u00a7 9A-101(h) (providing a similar definition under RUPA). RULPA also separately defines a \"foreign limited partnership\u201d: \"a partnership formed under the laws of any state other than the State of Maryland or under the laws of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>foreign country....\u201d C &amp; A \u00a7 10-101(f); <em>see also </em>C &amp; A \u00a7 9A-101(f) (providing a similar definition under RUPA). In addition, Maryland Rule 2-124(o), which sets forth the procedures for substituted service upon the Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation, states that \"[slervice may be made upon a corporation, <em>limited partnership, </em>limited liability partnership, limited liability company, <em>or other entity required by statute of this State to have a resident agent </em>(Emphasis added). While a limited partnership formed in Maryland is required to name a resident agent in Maryland, a foreign limited partnership is not, unless it elects to conduct business lawfully in Maryland. <em>Compare C </em>&amp; A \u00a7 10-104(a) <em>with </em>C &amp; A \u00a7 10-902. Moreover, in discussing proposed amendments to Rule 2-124 on 7 June 1994 during this Court's hearing, Judge Wilner, then Chairman of the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure and Chief Judge of the Court of Special Appeals, stated: \"we really try to set out all of the different entities <em>that now exist in Maryland </em>and to provide a clear statement as to each one as to how you go about serving them.\u201d (Emphasis added). Finally, the language of the Rule the Suing HALP Partners rely upon to authorize how proper service on MWLP may be made (\"If the limited partnership has no resident agent ... service may be made upon any general partner ...\u201d) is the \u201creserve parachute\u201d language of the Rule. This portion of the Rule seems intended to be deployed only upon the failure of service on the resident agent of the limited partnership.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b787-8\">.

While the provisions of RUPA apply also to limited partnerships, limited partnerships are distinct from partnerships and partake of many significant characteristics exhibited by corporations. One important difference between a partnership and a limited partnership in Maryland is that, unlike with a partnership, formation of a limited partnership requires a prescribed act of filing articles with the Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation. <em>Compare </em>C &amp; A \u00a7 9A-202 <em>with </em>C &amp; A \u00a7 10-201.
