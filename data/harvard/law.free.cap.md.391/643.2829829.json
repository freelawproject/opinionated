Although Patricia Walton (\u201cPatricia\u201d) and Audrey Walton (\u201cAudrey\u201d) are both named parties in this case, the issue before us is whether Patricia, an agent for Audrey, can be held personally liable for Audrey\u2019s outstanding debt. On January 10, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>2003, Mariner Health of Southern Maryland (\u201cMariner Health\u201d), a nursing home facility, sued Patricia, as agent, and her mother, Audrey, for breach of contract for failing to pay Audrey\u2019s nursing home bill as allegedly agreed to by the parties. On August 11, 2004, the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County found both mother and daughter liable to Mariner Health for the outstanding balance incurred by Audrey and for attorney fees. The Waltons appealed that decision to the Court of Special Appeals. Before that court could decide the appeal, we granted <em>certiorari. Walton v. Mariner </em>Health, 388 Md. 97, 879 A.2d 42 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">We must determine whether a contract between an agent, on behalf of the nursing home resident, and a nursing home facility, entitles the nursing home to a private cause of action against an agent for the cost of the resident\u2019s care. If an agent neglects his or her duty to apply for Medicare or Medical Assistance <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on behalf of the resident under Maryland Code (1982, 2000 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 19-344(c) of the Health-General Article, can the agent be held personally liable for the debt incurred by the resident of the nursing home? We must also resolve whether \u00a7 19-344(c) of the Health-General Article limits a nursing home facility to statutory remedies or if it may pursue a private cause of action against an agent for personal liability for an outstanding debt incurred by the resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">We reverse the judgment of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County. The Circuit Court erred in holding that the financial agreement signed by the agent on behalf of the resident rendered the agent personally liable for the outstanding nursing home bill<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> even though the agent failed to seek Medicare or Medical Assistance for the resident. In addition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>we hold that a nursing home facility is limited to remedies prescribed by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">On January 26, 2001, Audrey was transferred from Southern Maryland Hospital Center to Mariner Health of Southern Maryland. That same day, Patricia, as an agent of Audrey, signed the Resident\u2019s Agent Financial Agreement with Mariner Health of Southern Maryland (\u201cAgreement\u201d). Patricia indicated in the agreement that the only methods of payment would be Medicare or Medical Assistance. In the agreement, Patricia expressly denied any personal responsibility for Audrey\u2019s bill. When Audrey was admitted to the facility, Medicare paid for Audrey\u2019s nursing home bill, however, at the end of February, 2001, Medicare stopped paying for Audrey\u2019s nursing home care. Patricia, as agent, was required, as stipulated in the agreement, <em>infra </em>at note 9, to reapply for eligibility or Medical Assistance. There was testimony that Audrey would have been a successful candidate for Medical Assistance and, most likely, Medicare. From March 2001 through August 2002, Audrey incurred a debt of approximately $4,800.00 a month for her care. The outstanding balance was $86,235.91 for those eighteen months. On January 10, 2003, Mariner Health filed a Complaint against Patricia and Audrey for Audrey\u2019s outstanding bill. The amount requested by Mariner Health was $86,235.91, representing the outstanding balance due and owing, plus $12,935.39 in attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">On July 6, 2004, Patricia testified at trial that she was not aware that Medicare ceased paying for her mother\u2019s care and that the nursing home debt was being incrementally calculated. Patricia stated that she would have applied for medical benefits for her mother had she been aware that Medicare had stopped paying for Audrey\u2019s nursing home bill. Patricia testified that she was not given notice of the outstanding monetary obligation until after Mariner Health sold the facility to another group. Mariner Health offered no explanation or evidence as to why it failed to notify Audrey or Patricia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>that Medicare had ceased paying or that a debt had been incrementally tallied for eighteen months.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">The trial judge interpreted two provisions of the agreement and, based on that interpretation, held that both Patricia and Audrey were contractually obligated for paying Mariner Health for Audrey\u2019s nursing home bill, but reserved judgment on damages for a compromise by the parties. On August 11, 2004, after the parties failed to settle the issue of damages, the court entered a judgment against both women and in favor of Mariner Health for damages in the amount of $75,000.00 and $11,250.00 for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">RESIDENT AGENT\u2019S FINANCIAL AGREEMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">In the case, <em>sub judiee, </em>the agreement consists of thirty pages collectively. The Resident\u2019s Agent Financial Agreement identified in the Circuit Court record as exhibit one (1) consisted of \u201cThe Financial Agreement With Mariner Health of Southern Maryland\u201d (\u201cFinancial Agreement\u201d) and \u201cExhibit 1 Obligations of the Agent.\u201d Both agreements contained the agent, Patricia Walton\u2019s signature. The Financial Agreement consisted of twenty-two pages and \u201cExhibit 1 Obligations of the Agent\u201d was eight (8) pages long.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Both of the agreements contained several provisions pertinent to our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">FINANCIAL AGREEMENT WITH MARINER HEALTH</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">The Financial Agreement that Patricia signed was an agreement between an agent on behalf of a resident and Mariner Health. The contract explained a resident\u2019s agent\u2019s lights and obligations and required that the agent select the type of financial program responsible for paying for the resident\u2019s care. Several payment options were provided including Medicare and Medical Assistance, other third party insurers, the resident\u2019s personal funds, the agent\u2019s personal funds, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>other methods of payment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The relevant provision in the Financial Agreement that clearly qualified Patricia as a statutory agent, as defined in \u00a7 19\u2014344(c)(1), was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-5\">This Contract is between Mariner Health of Southern Maryland ... and <em>Patricia Walton </em>(the \u201cAgent\u201d or \u201cyou\u201d) because you have access to (use, management or control of) the income, funds and/or assets <em>of Audrey Walton </em>(the \u201cResident\u201d) and because you are willing to act on behalf of the Resident.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2U\">Financial Agreement at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Patricia signified that both \u201cThe Medicare Program\u201d and \u201cThe Medicaid Program\u201d (also known as \u201cMedical Assistance\u201d) would pay for Audrey\u2019s care by marking an \u201cX\u201d in the appropriate boxes. Patricia did not indicate that she would be liable for payment for Audrey\u2019s care from her own personal funds or that payment would be made from Audrey\u2019s personal assets:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-7\">3.... A. <em>Who Can be Required to Pay for the Resident\u2019s Care.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-8\">Only the Resident and the Resident\u2019s insurers can be required to pay for the Resident\u2019s care. You cannot be required to pay for the Resident\u2019s care <em>from you oum funds, </em>unless you knowingly and voluntarily agree to pay for the cost of the Resident\u2019s care with your own funds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-9\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-10\">It is anticipated that the Resident\u2019s care will be paid for by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>[x] The Medicare Program;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-4\">[X] The Medicaid Program (also known as \u201cMedical Assistance);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-5\">\u25a1 Other third-party insurer, ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-6\">\u25a1 You with the Resident\u2019s income, funds and/or other assets;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-7\">\u25a1 You with your own income fund and/or assets;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-8\">\u25a1 Other....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">Financial Agreement at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">Section \u201c3.B <em>Private Pay Resident,\u201d </em>contained information on specific payment and service requirements for residents paying with their own private funds.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Although Audrey was not a Private Pay Resident, this section is relevant to our discussion because the trial judge based his judgment on language contained within this section. The pertinent language in this section provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-11\">You [as an agent to a Private Pay Resident] understand and agree that you are responsible for paying the Facility ... during which [time] the Resident has not been determined eligible for Medical Assistance. If you do not pay the amount owed us after receiving Facility bills and we hire a collection agency or attorney because of your breach of this Agreement, you agree to pay their fees, expenses and court costs with your own funds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-12\">If you do not pay what is owed the Facility, you agree to apply to Medical Assistance for a determination of the Resident\u2019s income and assets available to pay the cost of the Resident\u2019s care. Once Medical Assistance determines the income and assets available to pay for the Resident\u2019s care, you agree to use such income and assets to pay the Facility\u2019s bills.2 (Your request for this determination is not the same as applying for Medical Assistance on behalf of the Resident.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>2 If you do not request a determination by Medical Assistance, or if payment is not made with the income and assets determined to be available for the Resident\u2019s care, the Facility may ask the court to order you to obtain the determination or to make payment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Financial Agreement at 5-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Audrey\u2019s care was not paid for by Medical Assistance because Patricia, as agent, did not apply for Medical Assistance, when Medicare stopped paying her mother\u2019s bill. In section \u201c8.D <em>Medicaid Residents </em>\u201d of the agreement, the first sentence began, \u201c[] [Mariner Health] participate^] in the Medicaid Program.\u201d The following in relevant part states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b690-7\">[] [although it is the Resident\u2019s and your responsibility to apply for and obtain Medicaid benefits for the Resident, we will assist you, by promptly providing Medical Assistance with all required information in our possession.

Therefore, she is personally liable (along with Audrey) for the total sum owed to the nursing home facility for Audrey\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">Patricia contends that under the agreement she, as an agent for Audrey, had two statutory and contractual obligations to Mariner Health. The first obligation was to use the Audrey\u2019s assets and income to pay for her care. The second obligation was to apply for Medical Assistance. Patricia maintains that to hold a nursing home resident\u2019s \u201cagent\u201d personally liable for a resident\u2019s outstanding nursing home bill requires more than a signed agreement or an agent\u2019s simple failure to obtain Medical Assistance benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">The Financial Agreement established Patricia as a statutory agent under \u00a7 19-344(c). An agent, in these types of situations, often a relative of a nursing home resident, manages the resident\u2019s finances or acts on behalf of an elderly or ill relative. In 1988, the Legislature enacted legislation to limit the liability of an agent to a nursing home residence. The Legislature defined an agent as, \u201ca person who manages, uses, or controls the funds or assets that legally may be used to pay the applicant\u2019s or resident\u2019s share of costs or other charges for the facility\u2019s services.\u201d Section 19-344(c)(l) of the Health-General Article. An agent is, \u201c[o]ne who is authorized to act for or in place of another\u2014a representative.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 68 (8th ed.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">An agent\u2019s function is to represent the rights of the principal. An agent\u2019s authority is limited by the instructions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>restrictions and needs of the principal. <em>Penowa Coal, Sales Co. v. Gibbs &amp; Co., </em>199 Md. 114, 119, 85 A.2d 464, 467 (1952); <em>Proctor v. Holden, </em>75 Md.App. 1, 20, 540 A.2d 133, 142; <em>cert. denied, Holden v. Freeman &amp; Kagan, </em>313 Md. 506, 545 A.2d 1343 (1988) (\u201cThree elements are integral to any agency relationship: (1) the agent is subject to the principal\u2019s right of control, (2) the agent has a duty to act primarily for the benefit of the principal, and (3) the agent holds a power to alter the legal relations of the principal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">An agent has the authority to enter into a contract on behalf of the principal. <em>Strawn v. Jones, </em>264 Md. 95, 98, 285 A.2d 659, 662 (1972) (\u201cIt is well established law that an agent can enter into a contractual relationship with a third party to the extent of the agent\u2019s prescribed authority.\u201d). Further, \u201can agent is employed to represent his principal in regard to contractual obligations with a third person.\u201d <em>Henkelmann v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>180 Md. 591, 600, 26 A.2d 418, 423 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">If the contract is to benefit the principal only, the agent is immune from personal liability for breach of that contract. <em>City of Baltimore v. Musgrave, </em>48 Md. 272, 289 (1878) (\u201cIt is also a universal principle of the law of agency that the powers of the agent are to be exercised for the benefit of the principal only, and not of the agent or third parties.\u201d); <em>Local 1852 Waterfront Guard Ass\u2019n of Port of Baltimore I.W.A v. Amstar Corp., </em>363 F.Supp. 1026, 1030 (1973), <em>enforced, </em>508 F.2d 839 (1974), <em>cert. denied, </em>421 U.S. 1000, 95 S.Ct. 2398, 44 L.Ed.2d 667 (1975) (\u201cIt is a well settled principle of agency law that an agent acting within the scope of his authority for a disclosed principal is not bound on a contract made in the principal\u2019s name.\u201d); <em>Curtis G.

Phillips, </em>195 A.2d 400, 402 (D.C.) (1963) (\u201c[W]hen his principal is disclosed ..., the agent ordinarily does not incur personal liability. The law is well settled that when an agent acts in good faith on behalf of a disclosed principal, he is not held responsible in the event of his principal\u2019s default.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Patricia, as an agent, had a primary duty to Audrey, the principal, and Patricia\u2019s duty to Mariner Health, a third party, was limited. Agency law precludes a finding against Patricia for damages. As an agent, Patricia entered into the contract only for the benefit of Audrey and is personally insulated from liability by virtue of her station as an agent. The issue remains however of whether Patricia, as an agent, was personally immune from liability under the terms of the contractual agreement or the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The Agreement</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Mariner Health maintains that although Patricia was an agent, she was, nevertheless, personally liable for the nursing home bill under an apparent \u201cprivity of contract\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> theory because a contract existed between Mariner Health and Patricia. In its Complaint, filed in the Circuit Court, Mariner Health asserted that Patricia agreed that when Audrey\u2019s funds were exhausted, Patricia would seek medical assistance promptly and provide all necessary information and documentation requested to establish Medicare eligibility for her mother. Mariner Health contends that the trial court found Patricia had a contractual obligation, under a contract which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>approved by \u201cDHMH,\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to pay for Audrey\u2019s care using the resident\u2019s funds or applying for Medical Assistance.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Mariner Health asserts that Patricia, as agent, disregarded her duty to apply for medical assistance, therefore she is personally liable for the costs incurred for her mother\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">Patricia specified in the agreement that Audrey\u2019s care would be paid solely from Medicare or Medical Assistance.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Patricia states that she, as an agent, cannot be held personally liable for Audrey\u2019s outstanding nursing home bill because she explicitly indicated in the agreement that she would not \u201cknowingly or voluntarily\u201d use her own personal funds for her mother\u2019s care. Patricia asserts that Mariner Health breached its duty to mitigate damages,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and its contractual duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>advise and assist Patricia with applying for Medical Assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">The trial judge held that the Resident\u2019s Agent Financial Agreement was clear and provided that Patricia, as agent and relative for her mother, was responsible to pay her mother\u2019s expenses as outlined in several provisions. The trial judge continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-5\">The focus of this [cjourt is [Mariner Health\u2019s] Exhibit Number 1, which is the [R]esident[\u2019]s [A]gent [Financial [A]greement with Mariner Health ... and then the evidence that\u2019s been presented as to everybody\u2019s understanding of this agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-6\">This agreement does speak for itself.

This determination raises the issue of whether the contract is ambiguous, particularly the interpretation of specific language contained in a footnote, pertaining to the role and personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>liability of a nursing home resident\u2019s agent. Generally, when seeking to interpret the meaning of a contract our search is limited to the four corners of the agreement. Under the objective theory of contracts we look at what a reasonable person in the same position would have understood as the meaning of the agreement. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v.

When interpreting a contract, our main focus is the \u201ccustomary, ordinary, and accepted meaning\u201d of the language used. <em>Atlantic Contracting and Material Co., Inc. v. Ulico Cas. Co., </em>380 Md. 285, 301, 844 A.2d 460, 469 (2004)(quoting <em>Lloyd E. Mitchell, Inc. v. Maryland Cas. Co., </em>324 Md. 44, 56-57, 595 A.2d 469, 475 (1991)). This Court adheres to a well-settled principle, when interpreting a contract, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-4\">[ujnder Maryland law, the interpretation of a contract, including the question of whether the language of a contract is ambiguous, is a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>See Towson v.

We have long adhered to the objective theory of contract interpretation, giving effect to the clear terms of agreements regardless of what the parties may have intended by those terms at the time of contract formation. <em>Id. </em>at 78, 862 A.2d at 946-47. Under the objective theory:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-5\">\u201cA court construing an agreement under [the objective theory] must first determine from the language of the agreement itself what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have meant at the time it was effectuated. In addition, when the language of the contract is plain and unambiguous there is no room for construction, and a court must presume that the parties meant what they expressed. In these circumstances, the true test of what is meant is not what the parties to the contract intended it to mean, but what a reasonable person in the position of the parties would have thought it meant.\u201d <em>Dennis v.

Kayhoe, </em>391 Md. 188, 197-99, 892 A.2d 520, 526-27 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">We conclude that the trial court was erroneous in its ruling for several reasons. First, Patricia, as agent, can bind Audrey, the principal, to a contract, however, Patricia is not personally liable in damages for breach of that contract. Secondly, the trial judge\u2019s misinterpretation of the contract was based upon two provisions in the document under consideration that specifically did not apply to either Patricia or Audrey.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">The trial judge based his judgment on two provisions contained in section \u201cB\u201d of the agreement, <em>supra </em>at n. 12-13, which applied exclusively to private pay residents. Audrey, however, was not a private pay resident because there was no evidence at trial that her private funds were used to pay for her care. Patricia expressly indicated on the agreement, <em>supra, </em>at 6, that Audrey\u2019s care would be paid with either Medicare or Medical Assistance and not with Audrey\u2019s personal funds. Patricia cannot be held personally liable under the terms of the agreement, <em>supra </em>at 9, because she did not knowingly or voluntarily agree to use her personal funds to pay for her mother\u2019s nursing home care. The Medical Assistance section applicable to Audrey\u2019s care, <em>supra, </em>at 7-8, contained language which stated that Mariner Health would assist the agent in applying for and obtaining Medical Assistance benefits.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Furthermore, if there were services or items not covered by Medical Assistance and Patricia, as agent, did not pay for those services, the facility was free to initiate transfer or discharge procedures against Audrey. <em>See </em>\u00a7 19-345(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Secondly, one of the private pay provisions which is contained in a footnote provides: \u201cIf you do not request a determination by Medical Assistance, or if payment is not made with the income and assets determined to be available for the Resident\u2019s care, the Facility may ask the court to order you to obtain the determination or <em>to make </em>payment.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) The trial judge misinterpreted that provision. The trial judge essentially based his decision on the last three words of the provision to establish Patricia\u2019s personal liability. We disagree with that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">The language of the private pay provision is clear and unambiguous. The trial judge, however, interpreted the language to mean that if Patricia did not request Medical Assistance to pay Audrey\u2019s bill, Patricia would be personally liable for payment. To the contrary, a correct interpretation of the language means that if an agent does not (a) request a determination by Medical Assistance or (b) make payment with the Resident\u2019s assets or income determined available for the Resident\u2019s care, then the facility may ask the court to order the agent to do either (a) or (b). The last three words, <em>\u201cto make payment </em>\u201d does not mean that an agent can be held liable for the principal\u2019s breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">The trial judge was incorrect in (1) basing his opinion on two provisions that do not apply to Patricia or Audrey because they were not private pay residents, and (2) misinterpreting the language to mean that Patricia was personally liable for her mother\u2019s nursing home care. As we note in the next section, <em>infra, </em>the trial judge\u2019s determination contradicts \u00a7 19-844(c) of the Health-General Article and Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) 10.07.09.07 that an agent\u2019s liability is limited regarding nursing home facilities and agreements that stem from that relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">The agreement was based on \u00a7 19-344(c) and was discussed by both petitioner and respondent in their appellate briefs. The Legislative history demonstrates that the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (\u201cDHMH\u201d) and the Maryland State Bar Association reviewed independent nursing home contracts and found inconsistencies and \u201cwidespread use of clauses in violation of existing law or of questioned conformity.\u201d Department of Legislative Reference, Bill Summary, HB 683 at 2 (1988). As a result of legislation, all Maryland nursing homes are required to draft their admissions contracts to reflect the state\u2019s model. COMAR 10.07.09.06 \u00a7 A-B (1996). Mariner Health contends that the agreement was fair, equitable, and that the language paralleled the State\u2019s statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Further, Mariner Health asserts that Patricia breached her duty to apply for Medical Assistance, therefore, Patricia is personally liable under the statute for damages incurred by the nursing home. Moreover, Mariner Health maintains that the absence of an express prohibition in \u00a7 19-344(c) permits a private cause of action against the resident\u2019s agent for breach of <em>contract.</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>According to Mariner Health, because a private <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>cause of action was not expressly authorized does not defeat the contractual right to one. In Mariner Health\u2019s view, it was not required to pursue statutory remedies because the legislative enactments did not bar Mariner Health from seeking a private cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">Patricia argues that the statute provides remedies that Mariner Health failed to pursue before it filed a private cause of action. Further, Patricia contends that Mariner Health failed to notify her promptly that Medicare had ceased paying for Audrey\u2019s care and failed to advise and assist her in applying for Medical Assistance as required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent. <em>O\u2019Connor v. Baltimore County, </em>382 Md. 102, 113, 854 A.2d 1191, 1198 (2004); <em>Privette v. State, </em>320 Md. 738, 744, 580 A.2d 188, 191 (1990) (citations omitted). We may consider the general purpose and aim of a statute in an effort to discern legislative intent. <em>Kaczorowski v. Mayor of Baltimore, </em>309 Md. 505, 513, 525 A.2d 628, 632 (1987). Our long-standing rule is that if the language used in the statute is clear, unambiguous, and consistent with its objective, the words will be accorded their ordinary meaning. <em>Ayres v. Townsend, </em>324 Md. 666, 672, 598 A.2d 470, 473 (1991) (citations omitted); <em>see G. Heileman Brewing Co., Inc. v. Stroh Brewery Co., </em>308 Md. 746, 755, 521 A.2d 1225, 1230 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Advancements in the area of nursing home care regulations by the government began with the Federal Nursing Home Bill of Rights which was derived from the Social Security Act designated as the Patient\u2019s Bill of Rights, as a stipulation for nursing homes participating in the Medicaid program. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 301-1397 (1982); David S. Douglas, et. al., R for the Elderly: Legal Rights (And Wrongs) Within The Health Care System, 20 Harv. C.R.-C.L. L.Rev. 425, 471-72 (1985). The federal Patient\u2019s Bill of Rights offered a compilation of patient rights, which contain provisions that require nursing homes to provide patients with information concerning their medical needs, conditions and costs. In the 1980\u2019s the Maryland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Legislature enacted similar legislation by establishing provisions set forth in Maryland Code (1982, 2000 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7\u00a7 19-342-19-345 of the Health-General Article, sometimes referred to as Maryland Nursing Home Bill of Rights (\u201cNHBR\u201d). <em>See Oak Crest Village, Inc. v. Murphy, </em>379 Md. 229, 240, 841 A.2d 816, 822-23 (2004); <em>Mitchell v. Baltimore Sun Co., </em>164 Md.App. 497, 512, 883 A.2d 1008, 1017 (2005). The NHBR provides a nursing home resident with similar rights and protections. Further, part of the NHBR mandates that nursing home admissions agreements shall be fair, clear, understandable, and conform to the law. <em>See </em>Bill Summary, H.B. 683 at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">In 1988, the General Assembly passed House Bill 683 which amended \u00a7 19-344 of the Health-General Article and prescribed in subsection 19-344(c) the rights and responsibilities of an \u201cagent.\u201d The legislature intended to limit an agent\u2019s personal liability. That intent was evidenced by the bill summary, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-5\">[House] Bill [683] clarifies that the financial responsibility of an applicant\u2019s agent is limited to the extent of the applicant\u2019s funds but the facility may require the agent to distribute any funds of the applicant for the costs of care that are not covered by Medicare that the applicant agreed to pay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Bill Summary, H.B. 683 at 1. Further, the legislative rationale for the amendment was that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-7\">the circumstances surrounding admission to a nursing home are highly stressful for applicants and their families. Most people are not in a position to carefully read and negotiate a contract at this time. It is therefore vital that the contracts be screened to assure that they conform to existing law and are clear and understandable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-8\"><em>Supra </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">Section 19-344(c) provides for the duties of agents (as attorneys-in-fact, guardians, representatives\u2019 payees, or mere family members or friends) who handle income and assets for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>a nursing home resident or have some control over the person\u2019s income and/or assets.

The Maryland statute, however, allows an individual to guarantee payment for a resident\u2019s care. Section 19\u2014344(c)(7) of the Health-General Article (\u201c[Njothing in this subsection may be construed to prohibit any person from knowingly and voluntarily agreeing to guarantee payment for the cost of an applicant\u2019s care\u201d). Thus, an agent could agree to guarantee payment of the resident\u2019s costs. An agent of the nursing home resident may be subject to penalties if the agent willfully or with gross negligence either fails to seek or distribute medical assistance funds earmarked for the resident\u2019s care. <em>See </em>\u00a7 19\u2014344(c)(4) and (5) of the Health-General Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">In summary, an agent\u2019s responsibility is limited to the administration and management of the resident\u2019s funds.

Mariner Health argues that there are no statutory preconditions to a facility\u2019s right to sue an agent for breach of the Resident\u2019s Agent Financial Agreement because \u00a7 19-344(c) does not prohibit or condition a facility\u2019s contractual action against a resident\u2019s agent. Mariner Health contends that one of the remedies is that a facility \u201cmay ... petition the appropriate circuit court for an order .... \u201d The word \u201cmay\u201d denotes, it argues, that the General Assembly considered this remedy to be permissive rather than mandatory. Section 19\u2014344(c)(5)(iii). Mariner Health further asserts that the statute \u201cmerely notes\u201d that the Attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>General is responsible for enforcing and prosecuting agents who fail to apply or request a determination for Medical Assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">Section 19\u2014344(c) does not expressly state that a private cause of action against a resident\u2019s agent is authorized or prohibited under the statute. In the absence of that statutory directive, we think it is not appropriate to expand the statute to include remedies that were not specified. Further, \u201c[a] frequently stated principle of statutory construction is that when legislation expressly provides a remedy or remedies, courts should not expand the coverage of the statute to subsume other remedies.\u201d <em>Sugarloaf Citizens Assoc., Inc. v. Gudis, </em>78 Md.App. 550, 560, 554 A.2d 434, 439 (1989), <em>aff'd, </em>319 Md. 558, 573 A.2d 1325 (1990) (quoting <em>National R.R. Passenger Corp. v. National Ass\u2019n of R.R.

That court examined the legislative intent and relied upon the principle that \u201cit is an elemental canon of statutory construction that where a statute expressly provides a particular remedy or remedies, a court must be chary of reading others into it.\u201d <em>Sugarloaf, 78 </em>Md.App. at 559, 554 A.2d at 438 (quoting <em>Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v.

There, a nursing home resident claimed that the Medicaid Act afforded her an implied private cause of action against a nursing home from which she had been involuntarily discharged in violation of federal Medicaid regulations. Noting that the Medicaid Act provides specific remedies for the enforcement of regulatory rights, the Court refused to provide a private remedy, stating that absent any [\u2018jdirect evidence['] to the contrary, the judiciary [\u2018jwill not engraft a remedy on a statute, no matter how salutary, that congress did not intend to provided.[\u2019] <em>Id. </em>at 1092 (quoting <em>California v.

The thrust of the Bill and the intent of the Legislature was to ensure protection for nursing home residents and their agents from unscrupulous and unethical actions by a nursing home facility. The purpose of the legislation was to place limitations on nursing home facilities and to limit their remedies against residents and their agents pursuant to statute. Thus, the Legislature set forth expressly those remedies a nursing home facility could pursue when dealing with a nonpaying resident.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">If an agent fails to apply for assistance through the medical assistance program on behalf of the resident, the agent is in violation of the requirements of \u00a7 19-344(c)(5) and, \u201cis subject to a civil penalty not exceeding $10,000.00.\u201d Section 19-344(c)(6)(ii).<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number><footnotemark>20</footnotemark> If an agent violates his or her duties under \u00a7 19-344(c)(4) or (5), the agent is also subject to civil penalties.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> A nursing home facility may obtain a court order compelling an agent to fulfill his or her duty to disburse funds and/or apply for medical assistance.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> If a facility elects not to pursue the remedies provided under \u00a7 19-344(c)(4) or (5), to petition a circuit court for an order to compel an agent to either apply or request a determination for Medical Assistance, it may not then, as Mariner Health suggests, seek a private cause of action. The statute does not provide for such a remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">A nursing home facility <em>may </em>choose to obtain a court order to compel an agent to either apply or request a determination for Medical Assistance. It <em>must, </em>however, report any violation of \u00a7 19-344(c)(4) and (5) to the Attorney General because, \u201c[t]he Attorney General is responsible for the enforcement and prosecution of violations of paragraphs (4) and (5) of this subsection.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 19\u2014344(c)(6)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The trial judge did not address the issue of statutory remedies or Mariner Health\u2019s failure to pursue those remedies. Mariner Health was bound under the statute to pursue any applicable statutory remedies. We hold that a trial court may not, carte blanche, ignore the statutory provisions imposed to limit a nursing home facility\u2019s cause of action against family members acting as agents for a sick or elderly family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>member. Both \u00a7 19-344(c) and COMAR prescribe the rights and responsibilities of an agent to essentially the administration and management of a resident\u2019s funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY IS REVERSED.

Further, the Financial Agreement contained seven sections. Some sections contained several subsections. Importantly, in this case, sections 3 A-D are relevant since several payment requirements are profiled, specifically; (i) 3.A. <em>Paying for The Resident\u2019s Care, </em>allows the agent to pick the payment type, and, here, Patricia indicated that only Medicare or Medical Assistance would pay for her mothers care; (ii) 3.B. <em>Private Pay Residents, </em>was applicable to those residents who paid for their care with their own income, funds, and/or assets; and 3.C. <em>Medicare Residents </em>and 3.D. <em>Medicaid Residents, </em>both pertained to those residents, such as Audrey, who indicated, <em>supra </em>at 6, that Medicare or Medicaid (Medical Assistance) benefits would pay for their care.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b688-12\">.

When a nursing home consents to payment from a nursing home resident\u2019s private funds, it means \"a nursing facility\u2019s acceptance of payment from a source other than the Medical Assistance Program.\u201d COMAR 10.07.09.02 \u00a7 B(21)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b694-8\">.

Mariner Health argues that the contractual language expressly stated that an agent would be personally responsible if she or he failed to apply for medical assistance or make payment with the income or assets available for the resident\u2019s care. All Maryland nursing home admission contracts must be approved by the DHMH to ensure that they fall within the parameters of public policy.

At trial, Mariner Health\u2019s counsel acknowledged that Audrey was eligible for Medicare, stating, \"I don't deny that [Audrey] had Medicare benefits\u201d and \u201chad medical assistance been applied for, we wouldn\u2019t be here today.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">Mariner Health stated that neither Patricia nor Audrey contacted Prince George\u2019s Department of Social Services for Medical Assistance. Mariner Health admitted that it had a duty to advise the family to apply and assist them in seeking medical assistance, however did not admit that it breached that duty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-8\">THE COURT: If I understand your testimony correctly ... [Mariner Health] really doesn't oversee the initiation of a Medicaid request.... That would be the department of social services for that jurisdiction. Is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-9\">MARINER HEALTH WITNESS: Correct. The nursing homes d[o] not make that decision. They advise [the] family to apply. They may assist them in getting some to the documentation, \"but they have to make that face to face appointment with the local department.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b695-10\">. Medicare had paid for Audrey\u2019s care initially through February 2001.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b695-11\">. Patricia argues that Mariner Health failed in its duty to mitigate damages when it did not notify them for eighteen months that Medicare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>had ceased paying for Audrey\u2019s nursing home care or that a debt was accruing every month for eighteen months. Instead Mariner Health did nothing for eighteen months as a small manageable debt, which could have been easily remedied by applying for Medical Assistance, became a debt of a large significance in which the time to apply for Medical Assistance had passed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b696-11\">. The indented language was quoted by the trial judge from the agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b697-8\">. This section is located in the \"3.B. <em>Private Pay Residents \" </em>section of the agreement. We hold that this section was not applicable to either Audrey or Patricia. Patricia indicated in the agreement that Audrey's care would be paid only by Medicare and/or Medical Assistance, thus Audrey was not a Private Pay Resident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b697-9\">. This language, also, is contained in the section titled \u201c3.B. <em>Private Pay Residents </em>\u201d section of the agreement. Patricia indicated on the agreement that Audrey's care would be paid only by Medicare and/or Medical Assistance, we find that this section was applicable to residents who paid with private funds, as such, this section was not applicable to Audrey.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">Further, we disagree with Mariner Health\u2019s argument that this section of the agreement makes the agent, Patricia, personally liable to Mariner Health. We interpret the language of the sentence to mean that if Audrey was a private pay resident, Patricia would have to either request a determination from Medical Assistance or pay the nursing home costs with Audrey\u2019s personal funds. <em>See infra </em>at 18-19.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b699-7\">. Before this Court, at oral argument, co-counsel for Patricia stated that a facility would need to aid an individual with requesting a determination and applying for Medical Assistance because the procedures are difficult to understand for a layman.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b700-7\">. The trial judge found the additional language in the Financial Agreement supported the conclusion that Patricia was personally liable. <em>See supra </em>pp. 6-7,15-16. The language was located, <em>supra </em>at note 12, in the Private Pay Residents section of the agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b701-7\">. Mariner Health cites <em>Allfirst Bank v. DHMH, </em>140 Md.App. 334, 780 A.2d 440 (2001) which considers the issue of attorney fees which were not expressly provided for in Health-General \u00a7 19-337. The intermediate appellate court held that attorney lees are based on a contractual right that the, \"statute does not say how payment to a secured creditor is to be made or when it is to be made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 367, 780 A.2d at 459.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">Our case <em>sub judice, </em>is distinguishable from <em>Allfirst, </em>because the language of \u00a7 19-344 clearly provides for a statutory remedy, which Mariner Health chose not to follow. The boundaries of the statute are clear that if an agent fails to request a determination or seek Medical Assistance, a nursing home has two choices: (a) seek an injunction; or, (b) request that the Attorney General seek enforcement of the agent\u2019s statutory duties. In other words, the facility <em>may </em>petition a circuit court to compel the agent to either request a determination for Medical Assistance or apply for Medical Assistance. Whether or not the facility seeks an order from the court, the Attorney General is responsible for pursuing civil enforcement remedies when an agent wilfully or with gross negligence violates the law. <em>See </em>\u00a7 19-344(c)(4)(v), (5)(iii), (6)(iii) of the Health-General Article.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b705-11\">.
