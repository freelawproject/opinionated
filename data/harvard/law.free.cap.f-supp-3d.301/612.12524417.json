On 18 July 2016, it filed this action alleging that WCBOE has violated Section 8 of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (\"NVRA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020507\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 20507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief and attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On 10 August 2016, WCBOE filed its answer, (DE # 13), and motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim for relief pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). On 3 October 2016, defendant-intervenors, three individuals who are actively engaged in voter registration and related work, filed a motion to intervene. (DE # 22.) On 1 December 2016, the court allowed that motion. (DE # 26.) The following day, defendant-intervenors filed their motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

A portion of its analysis bears repeating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Because Ohio law authorizes the statewide DJFS (and thus the Director) to ensure compliance with Section 7 of the NVRA, the Director relies on the following curious proposition: because local authorities have the independent responsibility to comply with the NVRA, the Director should not be held accountable. True, the Ohio General Assembly has\n   tasked the county offices with implementing the NVRA; but, as previously explained, the General Assembly also tasked the Director with the power to enforce any county transgressions of federal law.\n   <em>\n    This is not an either-or proposition.\n   </em>\n   The fact that some states, like Ohio, delegate the administration of public assistance programs to counties or municipalities should not mean that those states are free of all statutory obligations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3859067\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/545/445/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3859067\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/545/445/\">\n    at 457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted) (emphasis added). The court held that the Director was also\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   proper party based on her responsibilities for meeting the requirements of the NVRA distinct from the Secretary of State's responsibilities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3859067\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/545/445/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3859067\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/545/445/\">\n    at 456-57, 458\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

By that letter, VIP-NC notified WCBOE that WCBOE was apparently in violation of Section 8 of the NVRA by failing to conduct a reasonable effort to remove ineligible voters from its rolls and identified the basis for this belief: the \"county has significantly more voters on the registration rolls than it has eligible living citizen voters.\" (Compl., Ex. A.) VIP-NC also requested that WCBOE make available for public inspection records under \u00a7 20507(i). The letter states, among other things, that it serves as the statutory notice required by \u00a7 20510(b) and that if the county did not fully comply with Section 8, VIP-NC may file suit under the NVRA within 20 days after receipt.

While not explicitly saying so, WCBOE's contention appears to be that because the alleged violation occurred more than 120 days before a federal election, VIP-NC was required to wait 90 days after WCBOE's receipt of the notice letter to file suit. VIP-NC has, however, alleged an ongoing violation of Section 8 in that WCBOE is continuing to violate the NVRA's list maintenance requirements. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., DE # 1, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 15.)

Using that data, it alleges \"the registration rate in Wake County has been 104.75 percent during the conduct of a federal election.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) It also cites to more recent data, as of 2 July 2016, from SBOE, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13), and based on that data along with the 2014 census bureau data, alleges \"the registration rate in Wake County remains in excess of 104 percent of eligible citizens residing in Wake County,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14). Also, as an example of WCBOE's \"failure to reasonably maintain the voter rolls,\" VIP-NC alleges WCBOE \"undertakes absolutely no effort whatsoever to use data available from the Wake County Clerk of Superior Court obtained from jury excusal communication\" to identify \"residents who self-identify as non-citizens or non-residents\" or to identify \"potentially obsolete mailing addresses of registrants.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   WCBOE characterizes VIP-NC's reliance on 2014 census bureau data of eligible voters (which is based on an average from 2010 to 2014) as a \"threadbare basis\" to support its allegation that the number of registered voters in Wake County remains in excess of 104 percent of eligible voters. (Mem., DE # 15, at 10.) Somewhat relatedly, defendant-intervenors argue VIP-NC's conclusion based on the cited data is \"oversimplified\" because it disregards the NVRA's requirement that, absent his/her written request, a registered voter cannot be removed from the official list of eligible\n   voters on the ground of a changed residence without written notice and only after two federal general elections after the notice. (Mem., DE # 28, at 8.)\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020507\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 20507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1). \"Thus, [according to defendant-intervenors,] it is entirely plausible that the number of registrants would\n   <em>\n    exceed\n   </em>\n   the eligible voting age population in a jurisdiction with high voter participation and a relatively transient population.\" (Mem., DE # 28, at 9 (emphasis in original).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The court notes that there is nothing inherently wrong with VIP-NC's reliance on census data to support its claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martinez-Rivera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341054\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/166/779/#p791\">\n    166 F.Supp.3d at 791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (recognizing \"that United States census data is reliable\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341054\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/166/779/#p791\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341054\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/166/779/#p791\">\n    at 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (report and recommendation) (taking into consideration registration rate based on census data to determine whether the plaintiff stated a claim for failure to make a reasonable effort to conduct voter list maintenance under Section 8 of the NVRA). While reliance on older data might arguably weaken an inference of wrongdoing, VIP-NC used the most recent census data available at the time of the filing of its complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   https://www.census.gov/rdo/data/voting_age_population_by_citizenship_and_race_cvap.html (last visited 2/16/17) (2011-2015 data published 2/1/17). And, while defendant-intervenors have advanced a potentially reasonable explanation for the high registration rate, that being the two-election cycle waiting period to remove a registrant from the official voter list, the validity of that explanation is not appropriate for determination at this early stage of the litigation, where the court views the factual allegations and inferences drawn therefrom in favor of VIP-NC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Both WCBOE and defendant-intervenors take issue with VIP-NC's supporting its claim with the allegation that WCBOE has failed to use data from jury excusal communication. The parties all appear to agree that the NVRA does not mandate that election officials use a particular tool to conduct a voter list maintenance program, rather the Act provides election officials with discretion in how to conduct that program. Thus, the fact that WCBOE does not use a \"readily available tool,\" (Compl., DE # 1, \u00b6 19), to remove ineligible voters does not mean in and of itself that WCBOE has failed to make a reasonable effort at voter list maintenance. However, it, along with other evidence, may be relevant to determine the reasonableness of WCBOE's efforts at voter list maintenance. As such, the court will consider the allegation along with VIP-NC's other allegations to determine whether it has stated a claim under the NVRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendant-intervenors argue that Section 8's \"safe harbor\" provision defeats VIP-NC's claim under \u00a7 20507(a)(4). Under the \"safe harbor\" provision,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   A State may meet the requirement of subsection (a)(4) by establishing a program under which-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (A) change-of-address information supplied by the Postal Service through its licensees is used to identify registrants whose addresses may have changed; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (B) if it appears from information provided by the Postal Service that-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (i) a registrant has moved to a different residence address in the same registrar's jurisdiction in which the registrant is currently registered, the registrar changes the registration records to show the new address and sends the registrant a notice of the change by forwardable mail and a postage prepaid pre-addressed return form by which the registrant may verify or correct the address information; or\n   (ii) the registrant has moved to a different residence address not in the same registrar's jurisdiction, the registrar uses the notice procedure described in subsection (d)(2) to confirm the change of address.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2020507\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 20507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1). Defendant-intervenors direct the court to a voter registration guideline SBOE has adopted which implements a program whereby the SBOE compares quarterly the statewide voter registration database against the Postal Service's National Change of Address Program and makes available to the county boards of election a report showing voters with changes of address. (Mem., DE # 28, at 7 (citing 23:\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20N.C.%20Reg.%202019\">\n    20 N.C. Reg. 2019\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -20 (Apr. 15, 2009) ).) In accordance with the guideline, the county boards of election are required to check the report and follow certain procedures for any registered voter who is likely to have moved. 23:\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20N.C.%20Reg.%202019\">\n    20 N.C. Reg. 2019\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -20 (Apr. 15, 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Given the stage of this proceeding, the court has no information about WCBOE's compliance with those procedures. Whether WCBOE's compliance is sufficient to satisfy the \"safe harbor\" provision is best resolved after further development of the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bellitto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271283\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/221/1354/#p1360\">\n    221 F.Supp.3d at 1366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that whether a letter attached to the amended complaint from the defendant local election official \"establishes Defendant's full compliance with subsection (c)(1) and defeats Plaintiff's claims is a fact-based argument more properly addressed at a later stage of the proceedings\"). Therefore, at this time, the court is unwilling to find that the \"safe harbor\" provision applies to bar VIP-NC's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Considering VIP-NC's allegation that the number of registered voters in Wake County has exceeded, and continues to exceed, the number of eligible voters, which allegation is in turn supported by reliable data and WBOE's failure to use available jury excuse information, a reasonable inference can be drawn that WCBOE is not making a reasonable effort to conduct a voter list maintenance program in accordance with the NVRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martinez-Rivera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341054\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/166/779/#p791\">\n    166 F.Supp.3d at 793-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that allegations of voter rolls containing more registered voters than citizens eligible to vote-a 105% registration rate-gave rise to a strong inference of a violation of the NVRA and stated a plausible claim for relief).
