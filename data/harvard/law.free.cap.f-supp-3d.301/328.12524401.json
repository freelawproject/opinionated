Ownership of the Marks\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The initial dispute before the Court centers on whether CSL has ownership in the '570' and '579' marks, as established through priority and continuous use. CSL contends that the undisputed evidence shows CSL's ownership in the '570' and '579' marks. For its part, Midsun argues that CSL cannot demonstrate its right to use the marks in question. The Court will consider whether CSL has established its ownership of each mark separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    1. '570'\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   CSL contends that it is indisputable that it was the first to use the '570' mark in commerce in the United States, and argues that Midsun has admitted to CSL's priority in the mark through its\n   witnesses' testimony. Midsun claims that CSL cannot establish priority in the '570' mark because, during the 1990's, CSL did not use '570' as a trademark; and that CSL cannot establish use of the mark in commerce prior to Midsun's own use of the mark. Midsun also contends that CSL cannot rely on the testimony and declaration of its president Faisal Huda to establish priority, as Huda has no firsthand knowledge of certain events that transpired during his absences from CSL. Finally, Midsun argues that the Court should determine which party has priority to the mark by consideration of the parties' previous manufacturer-distributor relationship, and analyze the factors discussed in\n   <em>\n    Haggar Int'l Corp. v.

CSL has established that its employees visited companies in the United States in 1990 in an effort to persuade them to purchase and apply the '570' product to electrical equipment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   December 1, 2016, Deposition of Edward Cherney, Doc. 180-5 at 60-3; Doc. 183-2 at 61-2; Doc. 171-7 at 45-6. Cherney's testimony also establishes that in 1990, CSL retained a distributor in the United States to sell its '570' product, Doc. 183-2 at 62, and that CSL sold the product to Midsun prior to the formation of their exclusive distributor relationship.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Such evidence that CSL's '570' product was on the market prior to Midsun's engagement as exclusive distributor, coupled with CSL's clear intention at that time to continue to exploit its trademark commercially, as evidenced by the parties' 1994 Agreement, is sufficient to establish that CSL was the first to use the '570' mark in the United States.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cross Commerce Media, Inc. v.

Doc. 183-2 at 86. From 1999 to August 2001, Huda worked at CSL in a marketing position, Doc. 161-4 at 31, and \"performed a sales support function.\" Doc. 180-14 at 4. In this capacity, in addition to performing marketing functions, he attended and delivered sales presentations in the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Huda left the United States in August 2001 to attend graduate school; he returned in January 2003.

Huda's testimony regarding his involvement in sales presentations in the United States from 1999 through 2001 does not speak to whether such presentations were for the '570' product, and CSL has not submitted any business records that conclusively establish sales of '570' in the United States from 1999 to 2004. Thus, the only admissible evidence before the Court to establish continuous use during this time is Huda's declaration. However, Midsun raises the factual issue that Huda was not at CSL from August 2001 to January 2003, calling into question his personal knowledge during that time. Midsun also points to Huda's conflicting testimony that he couldn't \"claim to have full knowledge\" of certain sales activity from 1999-2001, because he \"wasn't focused on sales,\" he was \"focused on marketing.\" Doc. 161-4 at 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Viewing the evidence in the manner most favorable to Midsun, the Court concludes that a genuine issue of fact exists as to whether CSL continuously used the '570' mark in commerce in the United States from 1999 to January 2003. Huda's conflicting testimony and his absence from\n   CSL during a time in which no other evidence of sales has been submitted is sufficient to raise a issue of material fact. A reasonable jury could determine that Huda's knowledge of CSL's sales of '570' does not extend to this time period, and that CSL cannot establish continuous use-and thus ownership-of the '570' mark. Accordingly, resolution of this issue is reserved for the trier of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    2. '579'\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   CSL owns an incontestable trademark for the '579' mark. As noted above, an incontestable registration is \"conclusive evidence of the validity of the registered mark and of the registration of the mark, of the registrant's ownership of the mark, and of the registrant's exclusive right to use the registered mark in commerce.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201115\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

CSL qualifies for that status, having achieved registration of the '579' mark in May 2002. Thus, CSL's incontestable registration for the '579' mark is conclusive evidence that CSL owns the mark and has an exclusive right to use the mark in commerce in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In opposition to CSL's motion for summary judgment, Midsun argues that CSL's registration for the '579' mark was obtained by fraud.

Midsun contends that the declaration of the date of first use was fraudulent, as there is no evidence of sales in the United States of the '579' product until March 10, 2004. Midsun claims that CSL's fraudulent intent to deceive the PTO \"can be reasonably inferred\" from \"the evidence produced by CSL.\" Doc. 183 at 31. This argument is insufficient to establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that CSL committed fraud on the PTO. As an initial matter, there is admissible evidence in the record that CSL had sales of its '579' product in the United States prior to 1997, and Midsun offers no evidence to the contrary. Thus, the date of first use, as indicated on the '579' trademark application, does not appear to be inaccurate, let alone fraudulent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Further, even assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that the supplied date was inaccurate, Midsun has fallen far short of showing, by clear and convincing evidence, that such a representation was a deliberate material misrepresentation of fact. There has been no evidence submitted that would show that the first use date of 1997 had any bearing on the PTO's decision to grant the trademark application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Haggar Int'l Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3827676\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/906/96/\">\n    906 F.Supp.2d at 127\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding no clear and\n   convincing evidence of fraud where there was no indication that an inaccurate date of first use was material to the PTO's decision to grant a trademark application, noting that an inaccurate dates \"only becomes relevant and material if the [ ]PTO had to determine which of two companies had the superior claim because of first use in United States commerce\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Midsun's second claim of fraud is based on CSL's Declaration of Incontestability, filed in 2014.

The registrant may file the affidavit within one year after the five-year period that is selected.\"). As it is undisputed that CSL's '579' product was in continuous use from 2004 to present, there is no merit to Midsun's argument that CSL's Declaration of Incontestability in 2014 was fraudulent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Thus, Midsun has not raised a material issue of fact to show that CSL obtained its '579' incontestable trademark registration through fraud.

A: Correct.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   In fact, Midsun itself has applied for trademark protection for the mark '570', and in connection with that application, submitted a declaration that \"570 is arbitrary and has no significance in the chemical or coating industries or as applied to the goods and/or services except insofar as it has been used by applicant first ... as part of the unregistered mark Midsun 570 and then as a registered mark.\" Midsun's Trademark Application for the '570' mark, Doc. 183-2 at 231-33. And in support of its own motion for summary judgment on Count I of CSL's Complaint, Midsun asks the Court to \"accord deference to the PTO's determination [in connection with\n   <em>\n    Midsun's '570' application\n   </em>\n   ] that '570' meets the substantive requirements for registration and award the registration to Midsun.\" Doc. 164 at 25. It is hard to reconcile this statement with the position now espoused by Midsun in opposition to CSL's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Based on the evidence in the record and the admissions of the parties, the Court finds that CSL has established as a matter of law that '570' is an arbitrary mark, inherently distinctive and therefore valid and entitled to protection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jordache Enterprises, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11291410\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/841/506/#p515\">\n    841 F.Supp. at 515-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (determining that the '501' mark is arbitrary and fanciful as it \"does not describe any particular quality or characteristic of jeans or jean apparel\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    2. '579'\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   While Midsun claims that '579' is not inherently distinctive, it has already been established that CSL owns an incontestable registration in the '579' mark, which is conclusive evidence of,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the validity of the registered mark.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201115\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). In arguing that '579' is not inherently distinctive, Midsun does not invoke any of the defenses that the Lanham Act provides for as a challenge to a mark's incontestable status. Accordingly, the Court finds that by virtue of CSL's ownership of an incontestable registration in the '579' mark, the mark is valid and CSL owns the exclusive right to use the '579' mark in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

With this guidance in mind, the Court turns to the\n   <em>\n    Polaroid\n   </em>\n   analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Strength of the Marks\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The first\n   <em>\n    Polaroid\n   </em>\n   factor, the strength of the marks, is defined as the \"tendency to identify the goods as coming from a particular source.\"\n   <em>\n    Lang v.

The Court has already determined that '570' is an arbitrary, inherently distinctive mark. The evidence submitted supports the same conclusion for the '579' mark. Based on the marks' inherent distinctiveness, they are strong, because \"[t]he law accords broad, muscular protection to marks that are arbitrary.\"\n   <em>\n    Virgin Enterprises Ltd. v. Nawab\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1533956\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/335/141/#p147\">\n    335 F.3d 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 147 (2d Cir. 2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   However, the strength of a mark still depends in part on the mark's distinctiveness in the marketplace, known as its acquired distinctiveness.\n   <em>\n    Streetwise Maps, Inc. v. VanDam, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1615441\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/159/739/#p744\">\n    159 F.3d 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 744 (2d Cir. 1998). CSL contends that its marks are commercially strong based on the evidence that the parties advertised, marketed and promoted the marks, and CSL continues to do so. Midsun points to evidence that, in connection denying CSL's trademark application for the '570' mark, the PTO cited other uses of '570', by other companies; Midsun contends that this weakens the strength of CSL's '570' mark.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1615441\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/159/739/#p744\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (determining that while a mark was inherently distinct, it was not strong in its marketplace due to third-party use of the words constituting the mark). The parties do not dispute that the marks are not famous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Midsun, as the Court must on CSL's motion, CSL has failed to show that this factor weighs in its favor as a matter of law. Thus, although the marks are somewhat strong based on their inherent distinctiveness,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Star Indus., Inc. v. Bacardi &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8968907\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/412/373/#p386\">\n    412 F.3d 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 386 (2d Cir. 2005), there is not enough evidence to determine that the marks are strong. This factor therefore militates against a finding of likelihood of confusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Similarity of the Marks\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The second\n   <em>\n    Polaroid\n   </em>\n   factor concerns the similarity of CSL's and Midsun's marks. \"In assessing similarity, courts look to the overall impression created by the [marks] and the context in which they are found and consider the totality of factors that could cause confusion among prospective purchasers.\"\n   <em>\n    Gruner + Jahr USA Pub.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10516309\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/991/1072/#p1076\">\n    991 F.2d at 1078\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). \"[S]ide by side comparison is not the appropriate test.

CSL uses the '570' mark in connection with its high voltage insulator coating product. Midsun uses '570' for its high voltage insulator coating product. CSL uses the '579' mark for its anti-corrosion coating product. Midsun uses '579' in connection with its anti-corrosion coating product. It is clear that the number marks are identical. Nevertheless, Midsun maintains that the marks are not confusingly similar because both companies use their house mark in conjunction with the trademarks at issue: 'CSL 570' or 'CSL Si-Coat 570' and 'Midsun 570'; and 'CSL 579' and 'Midsun 579.' \"[T]he use of brand house marks is considered in the context of the specific facts to evaluate the marks' similarity, which is one factor among the totality of factors and contextual clues relevant to determining whether the marks' overall impression will cause confusion about the products' sources.\"\n   <em>\n    Denimafia Inc. v.

CSL argues that the only reason Midsun has identified for choosing the marks was to trade upon the reputation that it had developed for the marks. CSL also argues that Midsun's ill intent is demonstrated by its declarations to the PTO in connection with seeking to obtain trademark registrations for 'Midsun 570' and for '570'. In further support of its position, CSL points to evidence that it claims shows that Midsun misappropriated CSL's marketing and sales materials, and altered the dates and product names to promote its own competing products. CSL argues that this conduct is evidence of Midsun's intent to confuse consumers as to the source of its products, \"to lead consumers to believe that nothing had changed, when in fact Midsun had stopped distributing and applying CSL's 570 product formulation and started selling its own.\" Doc. 171 at 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Midsun argues that it adopted the marks in connection with its corporate name; at that time, Midsun contends, CSL was not using the numbers as trademarks in the United States. Midsun also argues that CSL has not established the requisite intent, and points to evidence that it adopted its marks after CSL had authorized the relabeling of CSL's product to reflect Midsun's name. Midsun also argues that it reasonably relied on the advice of trademark counsel in adopting its '570' mark, and that its alteration of test reports does not establish the intent to promote Midsun's own product.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Here, it is undisputed that Midsun, CSL's former distributor, adopted the '570' and '579' marks with full knowledge of CSL's own use of the marks. What complicates this analysis is evidence that Midsun affixed its own name to CSL's product during the time the parties were working together to sell CSL's product pursuant to their distribution agreement. Both parties agree that Cherney, then employed by CSL, gave permission for Midsun to do so; however, the parties' accounts diverge on whether such permission was provided with the knowledge and approval of CSL, or if it was done by a rogue and traitorous employee, in breach of his fiduciary duties. The parties also dispute whether the distribution agreements were, in effect, a licensing agreement regarding the marks in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Drawing all inferences in favor of Midsun, it cannot be said that Midsun's first use of the marks under the distribution agreements, in connection with CSL's product, was done in bad faith. And a reasonable jury may believe that upon the termination of CSL and Midsun's relationship, Midsun continued to use the marks in connection with its own products to capitalize on the reputation Midsun believed it had created in connection with its\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   name, rather than any reputation associated with CSL. A reasonable jury could also determine that Midsun did not intend to deceive consumers as to the source of its products. While there is hardly decisive proof of\n   <em>\n    good\n   </em>\n   faith on the part of Midsun-especially in light of the evidence tending to show that Midsun misappropriated test reports that had been conducted on CSL's product-the evidence is not conclusive that Midsun's intent was to deceive purchasers\n   as to the source of its product, which is the relevant inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Drawing all inferences in Midsun's favor as the non-movant, the Court concludes that a genuine factual dispute exists as to whether Midsun acted in bad faith in adopting the trademarks at issue in this matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    The Sports Auth., Inc. v.

Essentially, there are two issues with regard to quality, but only one has relevance to determining the likelihood of confusion. If the quality of the junior user's product is low relative to the senior user's, then this increases the chance of actual injury where there is confusion, i.e., through dilution of the senior user's brand. A marked difference in quality, however, actually tends to reduce the likelihood of confusion in the first instance, because buyers will be less likely to assume that the senior user whose product is high-quality will have produced the lesser-quality products of the junior user. Conversely, where the junior user's products are of approximately the same quality as the senior user's, there is a greater likelihood of confusion, but less possibility of dilution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <em>\n    Savin Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9140553\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/391/439/#p459\">\n    391 F.3d at 460-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks and citations omitted).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lois Sportswear, U.S.A., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 799 F.2d at 875 (finding an increase in the likelihood of confusion as to source where the junior user's product was of good quality).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Here, CSL argues that Midsun has conceded that there are no significant differences in the quality of the parties' products.

CSL argues that Midsun's counterclaims alleging trademark infringement fail because CSL has priority in the marks. CSL also argues that Midsun's CUTPA-based counterclaims are barred by the statute of limitations, as this Court has previously held that CUTPA claims sounding in trademark infringement do not accrue as to each use of a plaintiff's mark, and therefore a timely trademark-based CUTPA claim must be brought within three years of the first occurrence of the allegedly infringing conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CSL Silicones Inc.\n   </em>\n   , 170 F.Supp.3d at 314.

Counts II and IV allege violations of CUTPA for use of the '570' mark and the '579' mark, respectively. Count V alleges a claim of illegal importation for the '570' mark. Count VI alleges a claim of federal trademark dilution for the '570' mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   CSL has established ownership of the '579' mark, and Midsun has failed to raise a triable issue of fact in this regard. Accordingly, Counts III and IV of Midsun's counterclaims fail as a matter of law, and summary judgment in CSL's favor on those counts is warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   Further, the Court has previously determined that a CUTPA claim must be brought within three years of the first occurrence of the allegedly infringing conduct. Here, in regards to Count II and IV, the allegedly infringing conduct-CSL's sales of products marked with '570' and '579'-commenced in the United States, according to Midsun, on or about 2004. Accordingly, any CUTPA claim would have had to be brought within three years of that first conduct. Midsun's counterclaims were filed on July 25, 2016. Doc. 84. Accordingly, Midsun's CUTPA-based counterclaims fail as a matter of law, as they are time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   CSL also seeks summary judgment on Midsun's counterclaim alleging trademark dilution of the '570' mark, pursuant to the Federal Trademark Dilution Act (\"FTDA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).

Midsun expressly admits this fact,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 183-1 \u00b6 80, and does not point to any admissible evidence that would raise a triable issue of fact. As the mark used by Midsun is not famous, Midsun may not prevail on a claim for trademark dilution pursuant to the FTDA. Accordingly, CSL is entitled to summary judgment on Count VI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   However, the Court has determined that an issue of fact exists as to whether CSL owns the '570' mark. CSL's arguments for summary judgment as to Midsun's remaining counterclaims for unfair competition and illegal importation are premised on the assumption that CSL had ownership rights in the '570' mark as a matter of law. CSL has not shown the absence of material issues of fact as to these claims, and thus summary judgment is denied as to Counts I and V of Midsun's counterclaims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   <strong>\n    H. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Accordingly, CSL's\n   <em>\n    Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 170] is GRANTED, in part, and DENIED, in part. CSL has proven, as a matter of law, that it is the owner of a valid, protectable trademark in the '579' mark. A triable issue of fact exists as to whether CSL has used the '570' mark continuously so as to establish ownership of the mark. Triable issues of fact also exist as to whether a likelihood of confusion exists as to Midsun's use of the '570' and '579' marks; specifically, whether Midsun's marks are confusingly similar, and whether Midsun adopted the marks in good faith. CSL has shown entitlement to summary judgment on Counts II, III, IV and VI of Midsun's counterclaims, and summary judgment is denied as to Counts I and V. Triable issues of fact preclude summary judgment on Midsun's affirmative defenses of laches and equitable estoppel. Finally, triable issues of fact exist on the issue of willful infringement, and CSL's motion for an award of attorney's fees is DENIED without prejudice to renewal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

All three criteria do not need to be satisfied to support a finding of unfairness. A practice may be unfair because of the degree to which it meets one of the criteria or because to a lesser extent it meets all three. Thus a violation of CUTPA may be established by showing either an actual deceptive practice or a practice amounting to a violation of public policy.

In this letter, transmitted by facsimile, Barr makes several statements regarding the quality of Midsun's '570' product, noting that it is \"totally different from and inferior to\" CSL's '570' product; that an independent analysis of its constitution reveals that it contains no aluminum trihydrate, and that \"[i]n fact, the product is simply a rubber coating similar to a basic roof coating material.\" Doc. 122-3 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   CSL argues that the statements in this fax do not establish a CUTPA violation as a matter of law, as they are outside the three-year statute of limitations period for CUTPA claims.

In line with these principles, a defamation-based CUTPA claim premised on any statement made in the Sun West correspondence would have had to be brought within three years of July 12, 2002, to be timely under CUTPA.

That duty must not have terminated prior to commencement of the period allowed for bringing an action for such wrong. Where [the Connecticut Supreme Court has] upheld a finding that a duty continued to exist after the cessation of the act or omission relied upon, there has been evidence of either a special relationship between the parties giving rise to such a continuing duty or some later wrongful conduct of a defendant related to the prior act.

Ownership of the 570 Mark\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   Midsun argues that it is entitled to summary judgment on CSL's Lanham Act claim of unfair competition as to the '570' mark, because Midsun has a superior right to the mark. Specifically, Midsun argues that Midsun was the first to use the '570' mark in commerce in the United States, and that it has produced evidence of continuous use from the mid-1990's to present. As to ownership, Midsun asserts many of the same arguments that were raised in opposition to CSL's\n   <em>\n    Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\n   </em>\n   on Count I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   The Court has already determined that, as a matter of law, CSL was the first to use the '570' mark in commerce in the United States. Accordingly, for the reasons stated\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Midsun's argument as to its priority in the mark-and its superior rights under the\n   <em>\n    Haggar\n   </em>\n   factors-fails. Further, it has been established that a material issue of fact exists as to whether CSL continuously used the mark from 1999 through 2003 in the United States. As this issue is reserved for the trier of fact, Midsun's motion for summary judgment on this issue is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Good Faith\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   Midsun argues that it adopted the '570' mark in good faith. It claims that CSL did not object to Midsun's practice of relabeling and repackaging CSL's product as 'Midsun 570' during the term of the 1995 Agreement; that Midsun relied on the advice of counsel in filing for the registration of the trademark 'Midsun 570'; and that there is no evidence of its intent to deceive the PTO.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   In connection with CSL's motion for partial summary judgment, the Court previously determined that issues of fact exist as to whether Midsun adopted the '570' mark in good or bad faith. No additional information has been submitted here that would require summary judgment in Midsun's favor on the issue of bad faith or willfulness. Accordingly, the question of Midsun's intent in this matter is reserved for the trier of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Equitable Defenses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   The Court has already determined that there are questions of fact as to whether the 'unclean hands' doctrine applies; thus, Midsun's motion for summary judgment as to its remaining equitable defenses is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-274\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. MIDSUN'S MOTION FOR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT [Doc. 160]\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   Finally, Midsun seeks summary judgment on Counts V and VI of CSL's Complaint, which allege Lanham Act claims for trademark infringement and unfair competition for use of the '579' mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Ownership of the '579' Mark\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-277\">\n   Midsun argues that it has priority in the '579' mark. As the Court has already determined that CSL has established its ownership of the '579' mark as a matter of law, and that no genuine issue of fact as to fraud exists, Midsun's motion as to the ownership of the '579' mark is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-278\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Good Faith\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-279\">\n   Midsun contends that it adopted the '579' mark in good faith. The Court has previously determined that a material issue of fact exists as to whether Midsun's actions in adopting the marks in question were made in good or bad faith. Accordingly, Midsun's motion as to good faith is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-280\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Equitable Defenses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-281\">\n   Midsun argues that the equitable defenses of laches and acquiescence bar CSL's claims. As the Court has determined that a material issue of fact exists as to whether Midsun has come to court with 'unclean hands,' Midsun's motion for summary judgment as to its equitable defenses is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   <strong>\n    VII.

Conn. L. Civ. R. 56(a)(1) (emphasis added). The two Local Rule 56(a)(1) Statements submitted by Midsun in support of its two motions for partial summary judgment fail to abide by this Rule. Each numbered assertion contains multiple sentences, paragraphs and subparts, and cannot in any way be described as \"concise.\" Many of the facts stated are also immaterial to the motions. Further, Midsun's Local Rule 56(a)(2) Statements in response to CSL's motions for partial summary judgment contain paragraphs of extraneous information that have no discernible bearing on the facts they are purporting to be responsive to. For example, CSL submits that \"CSL was founded in 1984 and is in the business of developing, promoting and selling silicone-based coatings for high voltage insulator, anti-corrosion, and anti-graffiti applications in industries such as electric power, petro-chemical, building &amp; construction, transportation, and public infrastructure.\" Midsun denies this seemingly innocuous statement of fact with a entire page of argument and facts that appear non-responsive; this particular denial is then incorporated into all subsequent denials \"as if fully set forth herein.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. 183-1. \"In this Circuit, a movant's failure to comply with a district court's relevant local rules on a motion for summary judgment permits, but does not require, a court to dispose of that motion.\"\n    <em>\n     Tross v.

In support of its position, Midsun cites to Huda's deposition testimony, attached as Exhibit 33 to Midsun's opposition papers. However, the specific pages that Midsun references are not found at Exhibit 33. This omission prompted a thorough search of the entire record to determine whether the testimony Midsun cites appears elsewhere. Midsun does attach Huda's testimony twice more, to each of its two motions for partial summary judgment; but again, only selected pages. Only by cobbling together three separate excerpts of Huda's testimony was the Court able to find the entirety of the testimony that Midsun cites. Even then, Midsun's citations are startlingly rife with inaccuracies. Midsun states that Huda graduated from college at age 19, however, his testimony is clear that when he\n    <em>\n     commenced\n    </em>\n    his studies, he was 19.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Doc. 164-3 at 112.

This is a material misrepresentation of Huda's testimony; Huda testified that after graduating college in 1998, he worked at Proctor &amp; Gamble in \"up until April 1999.\" Doc. 161-4. He started working at CSL \"the next week,\" in April 1999.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"305\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201115\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Midsun then erroneously claims that Huda left for France to attend school in August 2000, Doc. 183 at 8, when in fact he testified-twice-that he was in France from August 2001 to January 2003, when he returned to Canada to rejoin CSL. Doc. 161-4 at 28, 30. Egregiously, Midsun repeats this inaccurate timeline in each of its Local Rule 56(a)(1) Statements (Docs. 161-1 \u00b6 17, 164-1 \u00b6 15); in its Local Rule 56(a)(2) Statement (Doc. 183-1 \u00b6 3,\n    <em>\n     passim\n    </em>\n    ); and in the memoranda in law in support of its motions for partial summary judgment (Doc. 161 at 12, 34; Doc. 164 at 12, 16, 44). The Court previously had occasion to note that Midsun's submissions to the Court are \"far from a model of clarity.\" Doc. 81 at 2. The Court has also discussed Midsun's mischaracterizations of the law, extending Midsun's counsel \"the benefit of the doubt to refer to such examples as 'sloppy lawyering.' \"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"306\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201115\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"306\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201115\">\n     at 10\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Midsun apparently thinks so as well, as evidenced by the many times in the record that Midsun repeats its argument regarding Huda's absences from CSL, complete with the wrong dates. The Court concludes that such a misrepresentation of this particular chronology is at best another example of sloppy lawyering; at worst, it is an intentionally misleading representation to the Court. The Court reminds Midsun of its authority to impose sanctions pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, for \"making false, misleading, improper, or frivolous representations to the court.\"\n    <em>\n     Williamson v.
