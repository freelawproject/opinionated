(\"Plaintiff\" or \"HOA\") filed the instant action against Defendant Cincinnati Insurance Company (\"CIC\") in the Oconee County Court of Common Pleas in March of 2014; the matter was removed on May 13, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 1.) On December 15, 2014, the parties filed a Consent Motion to Stay, asking that the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   be stayed \"until such time as the underlying South Carolina State Court action\n   <em>\n    Stoneledge At Lake Keowee Owners' Association Inc. v. IMK Development Company, LLC\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 2009-CP-37-0652 (hereinafter 'the underlying case')\" was concluded. (Dkt. No. 23.) The parties noted that the underlying action was tried to a verdict in November of 2013, but, at the time the Consent Motion to Stay was filed, \"post-trial motions, including motions to determine set-offs from settlements Plaintiff made with other underlying defendants, remain[ed] pending.\" (Dkt. No. 23 at 1-2.) The Honorable Bruce Howe Hendricks granted the Consent Motion to Stay on December 16, 2014. (Dkt. No. 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On November 5, 2015, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Lift the Stay, asserting that the \"underlying trial court has ruled on all post-trial motions, judgments have been entered, and the underlying defendants have appealed to the South Carolina Court of Appeals.\" (Dkt. No. 26 at 1.) CIC opposed the motion because the underlying case was on appeal. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 27.) Judge Hendricks granted the Plaintiff's motion on June 20, 2016. (Dkt. No. 31.) On June 30, 2016, CIC filed a Motion for Reconsideration of Judge Hendricks' Order; she denied the Motion for Reconsideration on August 30, 2016. (Dkt. No. 34; Dkt. No. 38.) On September 14, 2016, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Amend its Complaint, stating that it \"seeks to amend its Complaint for filing in this Court to add allegations related to the underlying litigation and to join Builders Mutual Insurance Company as an additional defendant.\" (Dkt. No. 40 at 1.) Judge Hendricks granted Plaintiff's motion, and on September 16, 2016, Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint, wherein Builders Mutual Insurance Company (\"Builders\") was added as a Defendant. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 41; Dkt. No. 42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant CIC answered the Amended Complaint and filed a counterclaim seeking a declaratory judgment. (Dkt. No. 44.) Defendant Builders also answered the Amended Complaint and filed a counterclaim seeking a declaratory judgment. (Dkt. No. 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On April 28, 2017, Defendants filed a Motion to Stay. (Dkt. No. 66.) On April 28, 2017, Defendant Builders filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, (Dkt. No. 67), as did Plaintiff, (Dkt. No. 81). Also on April 28, 2017, Defendant CIC filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. (Dkt. No. 80.) On August 18, 2017, Defendants filed a Motion to Certify Questions to the Supreme Court of South Carolina. (Dkt. No. 103.) The Motion to Stay and Motion to\n   Certify Questions to the Supreme Court of South Carolina have been referred to the undersigned. (Dkt. No. 109.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 22, 2018, the undersigned held a hearing on the Motion to Stay and the Motion to Certify Questions to the Supreme Court of South Carolina. (Dkt. No. 114.) As allowed at the hearing, Plaintiff filed a Reply pertaining to Defendants' reformulated proposed certified questions. (Dkt. No. 118.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ALLEGED FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that it \"is a South Carolina non-profit corporation that manages a horizontal property regime known as Stoneledge at Lake Keowee, consisting of 80 dwelling units located on Lake Keowee in Oconee County, South Carolina.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 1.) Plaintiff further alleges that it \"brought suit against Marick Home Builders, LLC ('Marick Builders'), and against its principal and member Rick Thoennes ('Theonnes') [sic] (referred to collectively as the 'Insureds')...relating to the construction of Stoneledge at Lake Keowee (hereinafter the 'Project') in Oconee County, South Carolina, Civil Action No. 2009-CP-37-0652 (the 'Underlying Action').\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 2.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Plaintiff, it \"is a judgment creditor of the Insureds\" and \"has standing to sue CIC and Builders Mutual to satisfy the judgment and stipulated damages.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that CIC issued a Commercial General Liability policy to Marick Builders and that Builders Mutual issued a policy to the Insureds. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-10.) According to Plaintiff, Thoennes is an insured under both policies. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 11.) The insured tendered the Underlying Action to their insurance carriers \"requesting that their carriers provide a defense and indemnify the Insureds in the event they incurred losses as a result of the Underlying Action.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 13.) The \"Underlying Action was divided for trial into two separate actions, Phase I and Phase II.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As to Phase I, the jury found in favor of the HOA, and against Marick and Thoennes; \"[j]judgment was entered against Marick and Thoennes, which was subsequently amended by order dated January 30, 2015, to an amount, after credit for set-offs, of $2,144,088.23, which is accruing interest at the statutory rate.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.) Plaintiff alleges that in the Underlying Action, \"the HOA alleged, and the evidence establishes[,] that as a direct and proximate result of the negligence of the Insureds, physical injury to tangible property occurred, as well as damage to the work of others, including loss of use, with such damage being caused by the continuous repeated exposure to the same general harmful conditions.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 17.) In anticipation of the Phase II trial, the HOA, Marick, Thoennes, and the Insurers \"stipulated that the damages the HOA would be entitled to recover from Marick\" and Thoennes was $2,000,000.00 \"and that trial for the sole purpose of establishing the exact amount of damages was unnecessary.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 19.) Plaintiff alleges the \"HOA and the Insurers agreed to proceed with a declaratory judgment action for determination of coverage for HOA's Total Phase II Damages under the policies issued by the Insurers.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 20.) Plaintiff seeks \"a Declaratory Judgment that CIC and Builders Mutual are obligated to pay the Phase I Judgment and the Total Phase II Damages plus post-judgment interest.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Motion to Stay (Dkt.

No. 23 at 1-2.) Judge Hendricks granted the Consent Motion to Stay on December 16, 2014. (Dkt. No. 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On November 5, 2015, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Lift the Stay, asserting that the \"underlying trial court has ruled on all post-trial motions, judgments have been entered, and the underlying defendants have appealed to the South Carolina Court of Appeals.\" (Dkt. No. 26 at 1.) CIC opposed the motion because the underlying case was on appeal. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 27.) Judge Hendricks granted that motion on June 20, 2016. (Dkt. No. 31.) In that Order, Judge Hendricks stated,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia\n   </em>\n   ,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court recently granted a renewed motion to stay in a companion matter (Civil Action No.: 8:14-cv-293-BHH) brought by Stoneledge HOA against CIC, concerning different insured entities than those at issue here, and arising from the same judgment in the Underlying Suit. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   C/A No. 8:14-cv-293, ECF No. 70.) In that companion case, the Court found that a stay was appropriate after considering the so-called \"\n   <em>\n    Nautilus\n   </em>\n   factors\" to determine whether that federal declaratory judgment action should continue to proceed in light of the pendency of the parallel state court appeal, namely:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (1) whether the state has a strong interest in having the issues decided in its courts; (2) whether the state courts could resolve the issues more efficiently than the federal courts; (3) whether the presence of \"overlapping issues of fact or law\" might create unnecessary \"entanglement\" between the state and federal courts; and (4) whether the federal action is mere \"procedural fencing,\" in the sense that the action is merely the product of forum-shopping.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Penn-Am. Ins. Co. v. Coffey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9244329\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/368/409/#p412\">\n    368 F.3d 409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 412 (4th Cir. 2004) (citing\n   <em>\n    United Capitol Ins.

There, the Court found that factor three presented the clearest reason to grant a stay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The Court has again considered the\n   <em>\n    Nautilus\n   </em>\n   factors, and finds that the instant case does not present the same potential for entanglement between the state and federal proceedings. Specifically, unlike the companion matter, there are no claims for bad faith refusal to settle and improper claims practices in the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   . Additionally, the Court finds that a continued stay in the instant case does not offer the same potential to maximize judicial economy. In the companion case, there is an open question as to whether Stoneledge HOA's claims against defendant American Home Assurance Company regarding an umbrella policy are viable in the first instance, given the prerequisite that the applicable limits of any underlying insurance coverage must first be exhausted. Resolution of the state court appeal will assist the Court in answering that question definitively. There are no such issues in the instant case, and the utility of a continued stay is therefore diminished. The remainder of the\n   <em>\n    Nautilus\n   </em>\n   factors are not significantly implicated by the posture of this case. The Court finds that there is a ripe dispute between the parties and the declaratory judgment action will proceed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (Dkt. No. 31 at 2-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On June 30, 2016, CIC filed a Motion for Reconsideration of Judge Hendricks' Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (Dkt. No. 34.) Judge Hendricks denied that motion in the following Text Order:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   TEXT ORDER denying 34 Motion for Reconsideration re 31 Order on Motion to Lift Stay. This matter is before the Court on Defendant's Motion to Reconsider the Court's June 20, 2016 Order (ECF No. 31) granting Plaintiff's motion to lift a stay that had been in place, pursuant to a consent motion of the parties (ECF No. 23), since December 16, 2014 (ECF No. 24). The stated ground for Defendant's Motion is that the factors the Court considered in ordering that the stay be lifted relate to abstention, whereas the Court should have been focused particularly on the issue of ripeness and the risk that the Court might issue an improper advisory opinion if it allowed the case to proceed. (See ECF No. 34 at 1-3.) Motions for reconsideration of interlocutory orders are not subject to the strict standards applicable to motions for reconsideration of a final judgment. Am. Canoe Ass'n v.

None of the predicate reasons for granting reconsideration of the Court's Order lifting the stay are present here, and the Court declines to reconsider that ruling. Defendant insists that the issue of whether the stay should be maintained turns on the ripeness of the dispute, but makes this untenable argument while simultaneously acknowledging that the underlying tort case was tried to verdict and findings of fact were made therein. (See ECF No. 34 at 3-5.) In this context, what Defendant is really asking the Court to do is defer action on the case sub judice until the appeals in the underlying tort case are complete. See Princeton Excess &amp; Surplus Lines Ins. Co. v. Immigration Centers of Am. -Farmville, LLC, No. 3:12-CV-895,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206246366\">\n    2013 WL 6246366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (E.D. Va. Nov. 21, 2013) ( [T]he real issue in this case is not whether there is a case or controversy or whether the matter is ripe for decision, it is whether the\n   [c]ourt should defer acting on [the plaintiff's] request for declaratory judgment until the State Litigation is concluded.). For reasons already explained in the Order, the Court does not see the same need for and benefit from a continued stay in this action as in the parallel action, Stoneledge at Lake Keowee Owners' Association, Inc. v. Cincinnati Insurance Company, et al., No. 8:14-CV-293-BHH. Accordingly, the Motion to Reconsider is denied and the case will proceed. Signed by Honorable Bruce Howe Hendricks on 8/30/16.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (Dkt. No. 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Undeterred by Judge Hendricks' previous rulings, on April 28, 2017, CIC and Builders Mutual filed the instant Motion to Stay, asking that the court \"stay this action with respect to coverage for Phase I of the Stoneledge project.\" (Dkt. No. 66-1 at 1.) Defendants contend that \"a ruling on coverage for Phase I at this time would be improper because the evidence upon which such a ruling must be based is not yet final.\" (Dkt. No. 66-1 at 1.) Defendants state,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   ,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Marick's appeal is not yet resolved. As a result, the basis for any ruling as to the amount of coverage for Phase I does not yet exist. If the Court of Appeals rules in favor of Marick, the result could be, among other things, a new trial. (See Exh. D: Appellant's Final Brief at pp. 38-39.) Thus, the issues in this case are not ripe until the appeal is resolved and the judgment becomes final.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ellett Bros., Inc. v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar.

Any declaration this Court issues as to the amount of coverage for Phase I is subject to becoming moot because the Phase I litigation is not yet completed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Due consideration of the issues pending on appeal demonstrates that Marick and Thoennes' arguments have merit and a real possibility exists that the current Phase I judgments may be reversed or modified. Several of the trial judge's rulings during the Phase I trial appear to be inconsistent with current South Carolina law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (Dkt. No. 66-1 at 3.) Defendants point to numerous particulars in which they contend the state court's rulings are erroneous. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 66-1 at 3-8.) Defendants contend that the grounds they have identified \"are by no means the only potential grounds for reversal in the pending appeal of the Phase I judgments,\" but \"these grounds sufficiently demonstrate that the issues Marick raised on appeal create a substantial question as to whether the existing judgments will stand.\" (Dkt. No. 66-1 at 8.) Defendants assert that \"[i]f the Phase I judgments are modified on appeal, it would moot any declaration this Court issues as to the amount of coverage for Phase I.\" (Dkt. No. 66-1 at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Although Judge Hendricks has already twice ruled, the issue here is whether the instant action-the insurance coverage dispute-should be stayed while the underlying case is on appeal. Defendants cited no law in support of the stay in their Memorandum in Support of Their Motion to Stay as to Phase I; the law Defendants cited therein was in their explanation of how the state court erred. In their Reply, Defendants contend their request to stay is based on the court's inherent authority as well as Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt.

The Special Referee considered this argument (and the evidence advanced by Harleysville) and concluded that even if an oral reservation is permitted in South Carolina, the oral reservations Harleysville claimed to have communicated to the principals of\n   the defunct Heritage entities \"fall short of the specificity [required] and are ambiguous at best,\" noting \"[p]roviding timely and specific policy defenses and disclosing actual or potential conflicts are important fiduciary duties of the insurer[,] especially when, as here, Harleysville is controlling the defense of its insured.\" The Special Referee concluded that Harleysville failed to properly reserve its rights to dispute coverage as to actual damages and, thus, Harleysville was precluded from attempting to do so in this action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   Here, except as to punitive damages, Harleysville's reservation letters gave no express reservation or other indication that it disputed coverage for any specific portion or type of damages. Nor did the letters or testimony indicate that, in the event Heritage was found liable in the construction-defect suits, Harleysville intended to file the instant lawsuit to contest various coverage issues. Specifically, Harleysville did not expressly put its insureds on notice that it intended to litigate the issues of whether any damages resulted from acts meeting the definition of occurrence, whether any damages occurred during the applicable policy periods, and what damages were attributable to non-covered faulty workmanship. And in no way did the letters inform the insureds that a conflict of interest may have existed or that they should protect their interests by requesting an appropriate verdict. As the Fifth Circuit found in\n   <em>\n    Duke v. Hoch\n   </em>\n   , Harleysville's reservation \"was no more than a general warning\" and \"too imprecise to shield [the insurer].\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"247596\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/468/973/#p979\">\n    468 F.2d 973\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 979 (5th Cir. 1972). We find there is evidence in the record to support the Special Referee's finding that Harleysville's reservation letters were insufficient to reserve its right to contest coverage of actual damages, and therefore, we affirm.

As to the second question, it does not appear to the undersigned that an answer is necessary in order to adjudicate the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   . Instead, the question appears to focus on the next insurance coverage dispute; certification is therefore not warranted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Henry v. Gov't Emps. Ins.

Defendants appear to have several arguments as to why\n   <em>\n    Harleysville\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable, and therefore does not mandate a particular outcome in the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 107 at 2.) The undersigned expresses no opinions on those argument herein. However, to the extent Defendants seek certification as to what elements must be proved to establish waiver/estoppel under\n   <em>\n    Harleysville\n   </em>\n   , the\n   <em>\n    Harleysville\n   </em>\n   opinion itself provides significant guidance as to that question. Although the court did not specifically outline elements, the court noted that the reservation of rights letters \"gave no express reservation or other indication that it disputed coverage for any specific portion or type of damages\" (except punitive damages); the insurer did not put the insured on notice \"that it intended to litigate the issues of whether any damages resulted from acts meeting the definition of occurrence, whether any damages occurred during the applicable policy periods, and what damages were attributable to non-covered faulty workmanship\"; and the insurer did not \"inform the insureds that a conflict of interest may have existed or that they should protect their interests by requesting an appropriate verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    Harleysville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12278840\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/420/321/\">\n    420 S.C. at 342-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=803%20S.E.2d%20288\">\n    803 S.E.2d at 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Defendants additionally seek certification of whether \"non-waiver provisions in insurance policies preclude waiver as applied\" to reservation of rights letters. In responding to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment, Defendants point to the following language in their policies:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   This policy contains all the agreements between you and us concerning the insurance\n   afforded. The first Named Insured shown in the Declarations is authorized to make changes in the terms of this policy with our consent. This policy's terms can be amended or waived only by endorsement issued by us and made a part of this policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 78 at 39 of 46 as to Builders Mutual; Dkt. No. 82-9 at 2 of 69 as to CIC.) Defendants assert that this provision \"prevents the terms of the policy from being modified by doctrines such as waiver and estoppel\" and contend that \"[t]he policies at issue in\n   <em>\n    Harleysville\n   </em>\n   did not contain this language.\" (Dkt. No. 89 at 6-7.) The opinion in\n   <em>\n    Harleysville\n   </em>\n   did not address this particular provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harleysville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12278840\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/420/321/\">\n    420 S.C. 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=803%20S.E.2d%20288\">\n    803 S.E.2d 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although Defendants contended in their briefing on Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment that the policies in\n   <em>\n    Harleysville\n   </em>\n   did not contain the provision, at the hearing before the undersigned, counsel for Defendants stated his \"position would be we don't know\" whether the policies in\n   <em>\n    Harleysville\n   </em>\n   contained that language.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Contrary to Defendants' arguments, the undersigned is not persuaded that certification is warranted as to this question. The courts in South Carolina have indicated that, at least in certain circumstances, \"a nonwaiver provision in a policy may be waived like any other provision.\"\n   <em>\n    Welch v. N.Y. Life Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2053763\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/183/9/\">\n    183 S.C. 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2053763\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/183/9/\">\n    189 S.E. 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 814 (1936) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   44 Am. Jur. 2d Insurance \u00a7 1585 (\"In general, policy provisions which limit the power of insurance agents or other representatives of the insurer to waive conditions of the policy or to restrict the manner in which waivers may be made do not supersede the recognized principles of the law of waiver and estoppel and are not so conclusive as to prevent the officers or agents of the insurer through whom it must act in the transaction of its business and the conduct of its affairs from binding the insurer by a waiver of a condition or from creating an estoppel against it to assert a breach of condition in avoidance of the policy. In other words, a nonwaiver clause may itself be waived.\" (footnotes omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The third question Defendants seek to certify pertains to whether \"waiver under\n   <em>\n    Harleysville\n   </em>\n   appl[ies] to settlement agreements where the parties agreed to litigate coverage in a declaratory action.\" The\n   <em>\n    Harleysville\n   </em>\n   case did not involve settlement agreements. In the case\n   <em>\n    sub\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    judice\n   </em>\n   , however, there is a settlement agreement as to Phase II between Plaintiff; Marick Home Builders, LLC; Rick Thoennes; CIC; and Builders Mutual. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 81-13.) The agreement states,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   ,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   WHEREAS, The Stoneledge development was constructed in two phases. Likewise, the Underlying Lawsuit was divided for trial into two separate actions, Phase I and Phase II; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   WHEREAS Plaintiff obtained a judgment against Defendants in Phase I on November 8, 2013, which was subsequently amended by order of the court dated January 30, 2015, in the net amount, after credit for set-offs, of $2,144,088.23, which is accruing interest at the judgment rate (the Phase I Judgment); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   WHEREAS, in anticipation of the trial of Phase II against the Defendants, the Parties have agreed to compromise certain aspects of this claim in the form of a stipulation of damages, as set forth more fully below, and to release certain obligations of Rick Thoennes altogether.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    NOW, THEREFORE, IN CONSIDERATION\n   </strong>\n   of the promises, covenants and\n   agreements contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   1. For good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency and receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the Parties agree that the damages sustained by the Plaintiff in connection with Phase II, as more fully set forth in the Underlying Lawsuit, are approximately and may exceed the sum of Five Million Six Hundred Thousand ($5,600,000.00) Dollars. Furthermore, the Defendants and Insurers are entitled to an offset of approximately Three Million Six Hundred Thousand and ($3,600,000.00) Dollars, representing amounts the Plaintiff has received from other sources. Therefore, the Parties stipulate that the damages which Plaintiff would otherwise be entitled to recover from the Defendants, subject to the terms of this Settlement Agreement and resolution of all coverage issues currently pending, is Two Million ($2,000,000.00) Dollars (hereinafter \"Plaintiff's Total Phase II Damages\"). Accordingly, trial for the sole purpose of establishing the exact amount of the Plaintiff's damages for Phase II is unnecessary.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   2. The Plaintiff and Insurers agree to proceed with a declaratory judgment action for a determination of coverage under the policies issued by Cincinnati and Builders Mutual referenced above. Insurers will pay to Plaintiff the total sum of \"covered damages,\" as defined herein. The parties agree that \"covered damages\" means the amount of Plaintiff's Total Phase II Damages that are covered for purposes of indemnification under the above-referenced Cincinnati and Builders Mutual policies, as determined by a final judgment in the above-referenced declaratory judgment action, after exhaustion of any appeals, up to a maximum of two Million ($2,000,000.00) Dollars (hereinafter \"the Phase II Covered Damages\"). This is not intended to be and does not limit the right of Plaintiff to also pursue recovery of sums related to the Phase I Judgment, except as expressly provided for herein, and subject to Defendants' appeal of the Phase I Judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   (Dkt. No. 81-13 at 2-3 of 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The undersigned concludes that certification is not warranted as to the third question. The undersigned notes that the case in\n   <em>\n    Harleysville\n   </em>\n   concerned the sufficiency of the reservation of rights letters, an issue that has been raised in the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   . While\n   <em>\n    Harleysville\n   </em>\n   involved a general jury verdict, and Phase II of the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   involves a settlement agreement, Phase I of this case involves a jury verdict, and the reservation of rights letters at issue as to Phase I are the same letters at issue as to Phase II. While the parties disagree as to the import of the\n   <em>\n    Harleysville\n   </em>\n   decision, and the undersigned does not intend to make any ruling herein limiting the District Judge's analysis of the issues in the pending Motions for Summary Judgment, the undersigned cannot conclude state law is \"clearly insufficient\" as to the issue raised.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Simpson v.
