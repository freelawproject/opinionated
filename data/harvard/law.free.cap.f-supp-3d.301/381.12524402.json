For example, there is no indication Eckert Seamans sold or derived any benefit from the sale of Plaintiff's\n   personal belongings, that Eckert Seamans outwardly or publicly asserted its ownership of the personal belongings, or that it otherwise controlled the personal belongings. The most plausible reading of the asserted facts can go in one of two directions: (1) that Plaintiff continued to exercise his right of ownership and constructively possessed the property by intentionally leaving his personal belongings on the premises; or (2) Accredited asserted its ownership over the items by actually possessing them. The actions alleged to have been taken by Eckert Seamans-i.e. facilitate Accredited efforts to complete the foreclosure and obtain unencumbered possession of the promises-merely constitute a claim that Eckert Seamans acted within the scope of an attorney representing its client in a protracted foreclosure and ejectment proceeding. In light of the fact that Eckert Seamans never actually possessed the personal property and the Complaint suggests nothing more than that Eckert Seamans took ministerial actions on behalf of its client, the Court questions whether Eckert Seamans is the proper party defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Court therefore finds the Complaint presently fails to satisfy Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, because it does not clearly set forth facts allowing the Court to draw a reasonable inference that Eckert Seamans ever had actual or constructive possession of Mr. Vossbrinck's personal belongings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Complaint instead indicates Accredited had actual possession the entire time and that Eckert Seamans never had control over the belongings outside its scope of representation for Accredited. Therefore, the Court need not address the statute of limitations issue regarding the sale of his personal belongings because conversion is not properly alleged against this Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    2.
