ECF 1 (Complaint). LumenR has asserted counterclaims for breach of contract, tortious interference with business relations, and related claims. ECF 12 (Answer and Counterclaims).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Since suit was filed in February 2017, the parties have engaged in the proverbial scorched-earth style of litigation, requiring resolution of numerous discovery disputes and the filing of thousands of pages of vitriolic submissions. Ten motions and cross-motions are pending. This Memorandum Opinion addresses three of them. The first two are cross-motions for judgment on the pleadings under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c). ECF 25; ECF 27. LumenR filed its motion first, seeking to dismiss five of Kantsevoy's six claims. ECF 25. The motion is supported by a memorandum of law (ECF 25-1) (collectively, the \"LumenR Motion\"), and one exhibit. Kantsevoy opposes the LumenR Motion. ECF 26 (\"Kantsevoy Opposition\"). LumenR replied (\"LumenR Reply\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Thereafter, Kantsevoy filed his motion for judgment on the pleadings, seeking to dismiss LumenR's counterclaim for deceit; strike LumenR's affirmative defenses of deceit and promissory estoppel; and strike from LumenR's pleadings \"all allegations regarding Dr. Kantsevoy's financial disclosures to third parties.\" ECF 27. The motion is supported by a memorandum of law (ECF 27-1) (collectively, the \"Kantsevoy Motion\") and two exhibits. LumenR opposes the Kantsevoy Motion. ECF 29 (\"LumenR Opposition\"). Kantsevoy replied. ECF 30 (\"Kantsevoy Reply\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The third motion addressed in this Memorandum Opinion is LumenR's Motion for Leave to Amend Its Answer, Affirmative Defenses and Counterclaims. ECF 120 (\"Motion to Amend\"). The Motion to Amend seeks to add a fifth counterclaim, styled \"Breach of Contract-Third Party Beneficiary.\" ECF 120-2 (proposed\n   Amended Answer and Counterclaims) at 20. Kantsevoy opposes the Motion to Amend. ECF 144. LumenR replied. ECF 158.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   No hearing is necessary to resolve these three motions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Local Rule 105.6. For the reasons that follow, I shall deny the Motion to Amend. And, I shall grant the LumenR Motion and the Kantsevoy Motion in part and deny each in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Given the procedural posture of this case, I must assume the truth of all factual allegations in the Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Kolon Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4196761\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/637/435/#p440\">\n    637 F.3d 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 440 (4th Cir. 2011). Because both parties have filed motions for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c), I shall include the factual allegations in Kantsevoy's Complaint as well as LumenR's Answer and Counterclaims, noting where they conflict. Additionally, where relevant facts are contained in exhibits incorporated into the pleadings (discussed,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   ), I shall refer to those exhibits, as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2009, LumenR was founded by Gregory Piskun, M.D. ECF 1, \u00b6 9. The company focused on developing a medical device that would aid in surgery to remove cancerous lesions and tumors from the colon, stomach, and esophagus.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4196761\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/637/435/#p440\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The device is called the LumenR Tissue Retractor System (\"Tissue Retractor\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4196761\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/637/435/#p440\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In May 2010, Piskun approached Kantsevoy at a convention to discuss the Tissue Retractor, and Kantsevoy said that the device could be useful.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Kantsevoy describes himself as \"an internationally known gastroenterologist,\" practicing at Mercy Hospital in Baltimore. ECF 1, \u00b6 4. He claims that on June 12, 2010, Piskun \"invited Dr. Kantsevoy to formally join the [LumenR] development team.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. Kantsevoy alleges that Piskun made an \"offer\" that \"included a promise to pay Dr. Kantsevoy the lesser of $500 per hour or $2500 per day for his consulting services.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Kantsevoy insists that the \"offer\" \"also included a promise to 'create an equity ownership package' \" for Kantsevoy, by which \"[t]he parties understood that LumenR would provide Dr. Kantsevoy a reasonable equity package [in LumenR], the precise amount of which would be mutually and reasonably agreed upon later.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Kantsevoy alleges that he \"accepted the offer that day,\" and the next day \"Dr. Piskun acknowledged in writing that Dr. Kantsevoy accepted the offer to work for LumenR.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   LumenR alleges a somewhat different story. LumenR agrees that Piskun and Kantsevoy met in May 2010, but alleges that in June, Piskun \"sent an email to Kantsevoy inquiring regarding Kantsevoy's interest in consulting on the LumenR project.\" ECF 12, \u00b6 9. The email, dated June 12, 2010, stated, ECF 25-2:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Sergey-Thank you, It is an honor to get you involved. Let's start by introducing the technology to you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   If this is acceptable to you we would compensate your consulting time with $500/hour and $2500/day if need to spend a day on the company's business (meetings, labs, clinical studies, etc.) If it happens that you really [sic] excited about the technology and believe in its future, we can create an equity ownership package which may be a very substantial exit for you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Please let me know your thoughts. If you prefer to talk on the phone please don't hesitate to call me at [REDACTED].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Best Regards,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Greg\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Kantsevoy replied: \"Yes, I am interested. We can discuss more details by e-mail or by phone-both way [sic] are good for me. Sergey\". ECF 25-2. LumenR asserts\n   that there were \"no further communications on the topic of Kantsevoy's potential consulting arrangement until nearly a year later.\" ECF 12, \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   LumenR claims that when Kantsevoy and Piskun met again in June 2011, Kantsevoy expressed interest in the Tissue Retractor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. LumenR alleges that in September 2011, Piskun and Kantsevoy executed an agreement as to a\n   <em>\n    different\n   </em>\n   project, concerning the \"HET\" project (\"HET Agreement\"), not associated with LumenR, but also supervised by Piskun.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. The HET Agreement specified that Kantsevoy would receive $500 for each product evaluation form he submitted and a $2,000 honorarium for any speaking engagement he attended on behalf of the HET project.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The HET Agreement also provided equity compensation to Kantsevoy of 50,000 shares.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In addition, the HET Agreement contained a confidentiality provision and a requirement that Kantsevoy assign to HET any intellectual property rights obtained in the course of the HET project.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   According to LumenR, Piskun's email forwarding the HET Agreement stated that \"we will create the identical agreement for LumenR when ready to execute.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   LumenR asserts that Kantsevoy executed the HET Agreement, but then later asked to rescind it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Although the HET Agreement was rescinded on an unspecified date, LumenR alleges that Kantsevoy still wished to consult for LumenR on the Tissue Retractor, and Kantsevoy suggested lowering his per diem rate to $2,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   LumenR maintains that when LumenR's patent application for the Tissue Retractor was filed, at an unspecified time, Kantsevoy was named as a co-inventor, but he assigned all his rights in the product to a corporation called \"Macroplata, Inc.,\" and his rights were subsequently assigned to LumenR.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. Kantsevoy states that he signed away his intellectual property rights, \"for a symbolic fee of $1 and 'other good and valuable consideration,' \" which Kantsevoy alleges was understood to include an \" 'equity ownership package' \" in LumenR. ECF 1, \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   According to LumenR, between February 2012 and November 2013, Kantsevoy conducted several tests of the Tissue Retractor on animals and received seven payments from LumenR at his per diem rate. ECF 12, \u00b6 17. Further, LumenR maintains that Kantsevoy \"expressed interest in conducting human clinical trials\" with the Tissue Retractor, but that he \"insisted on not being compensated by LumenR as this would allow him to publish peer reviewed articles, and participate in seminars and speaking engagements while being free of financial conflicts of interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   LumenR alleges that it \"agreed to have Kantsevoy self-sponsor clinical work,\" and \"support[ed] Kantsevoy's efforts\" with sample devices, technical support, and selective reimbursements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. In \"exchange\" for this support, Kantsevoy was expected to \"provide copies of the completed clinical trial data sheets to LumenR and to publish the results of his work.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   LumenR alleges that Kantsevoy never provided the clinical trial data sheets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Further, LumenR insists that throughout Kantsevoy's clinical work, Kantsevoy continually \"represented to LumenR, to peer reviewed publications, to professional organizations and...to the [Institutional Review Board] of Mercy Hospital, that Kantsevoy had no relevant financial disclosures and no financial conflicts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. LumenR\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   asserts that it believed these representations to be true.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Only in April of 2016, LumenR maintains, did Kantsevoy begin ''making unwarranted, unjustified and highly unethical demands for substantial retroactive payment, including company equity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. LumenR contends that it attempted to negotiate a contract with Kantsevoy, but Kantsevoy repeatedly \"escalat[ed] his demands.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   For his part, Kantsevoy asserts that he \"invested time and effort into marketing the Tissue Retractor,\" in addition to publishing an academic paper describing his animal testing and making 36 presentations about the technology. ECF 1, \u00b6 19. He contends that he \"would not have exerted such substantial efforts had he not been promised 'an equity ownership package' in the Tissue Retractor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In addition, Kantsevoy alleges that he was not paid for his work in accordance with the June 2010 \"agreement,\" but was instead underpaid.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. In particular, he asserts that he was paid only for ten workshops, and for only eight of 21 animal experiments he conducted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff also alleges that when LumenR paid him for the eight experiments, \"it underpaid Dr. Kantsevoy by $500 each time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Further, plaintiff contends that he has not been paid for other substantial contributions, and that he was not fully reimbursed for travel costs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Notably, Kantsevoy asserts that during the working relationship, Piskun \"repeatedly assured him that LumenR would adequately compensate Dr. Kantsevoy for his time and efforts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. Kantsevoy cites two occasions, in 2015 and 2016, on which Piskun \"confirmed that Dr. Kantsevoy would be provided an equity stake in LumenR,\" but that \"the exact value of that interest would have to wait for the sale of the technology.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Since that time, however, Kantsevoy alleges that Piskun and LumenR have \"disavowed\" their \"repeated offers of an equity stake in the company and, instead, proposed to compensate Dr. Kantsevoy in the form of vague promises that [another company] would fund Dr. Kantsevoy's future research or sponsor his scientific conferences.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In contrast, LumenR asserts that Kantsevoy threatened to \" 'destroy' LumenR to his professional colleagues\" if his demands were not met, and further threatened to destroy or compromise the data he had collected during his clinical trials. ECF 12, \u00b6 25. LumenR alleges that Kantsevoy in fact carried out one of his threats by removing the Tissue Retractor from a previously announced showcase, thereby \"casting the product in an unjustified negative light.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Finally, LumenR contends that from July 2016 to November 2016, after Kantsevoy discovered that LumenR was in talks with a third party about selling the rights to the Tissue Restractor, Kantsevoy disparaged LumenR to one or more employees of that third party and claimed that he had an interest in the company, so as to discourage the third party from completing the purchase.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. Kantsevoy alleges that the third party, Boston Scientific Corporation (\"BSC\"), purchased the rights to the Tissue Retractor for approximately $40 million. ECF 1, \u00b6 25. However, LumenR asserts that \"Kantsevoy's interference with [BSC] diminished the value\" of the ultimate sale. ECF 12, \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This suit followed in February 2017. ECF 1. Additional facts are included in the Discussion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Motion to Amend\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As noted, suit was filed in February 2017. LumenR initially answered Kantsevoy's Complaint and counterclaimed on\n   February 28, 2017. ECF 12. The Court issued a Scheduling Order on March 23, 2017. ECF 23. It set a deadline of May 24, 2017, for joinder of additional parties and amendment of pleadings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. A deadline of October 23, 2017, was set for completion of discovery, and the dispositive pretrial motions deadline was set for November 20, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On July 18, 2017, at the parties' request (ECF 45), the Court modified the Scheduling Order, extending various deadlines for expert disclosures, and extending the discovery deadline until November 15, 2017. ECF 47. At the eleventh hour, on the last day of discovery, the parties moved to extend discovery until December 1, 2017, and to extend the deadline for dispositive pretrial motions from November 20, 2017, until December 6, 2017. ECF 97. This request was also granted. ECF 98. Finally, on December 8, 2017, the parties moved to extend retroactively the discovery deadline by one day, to allow for the completion of their last deposition. ECF 118. The Court granted this motion. ECF 119.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   LumenR moved to amend its Answer and Counterclaims on December 12, 2017. ECF 120. That motion was filed ten days after the close of the discovery period that had been extended three times, six days after the deadline for dispositive motions, and about six months beyond the deadline for amendment of pleadings. In particular, LumenR seeks to add a counterclaim for Breach of Contract-Third Party Beneficiary. ECF 120-2 at 20-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The proposed counterclaim alleges that Kantsevoy breached a contract by refusing to release to LumenR the data he collected in his human clinical trials.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The \"contract,\" however, is alleged to be an informed consent form that Kantsevoy provided to the subjects of his clinical trial. ECF 120-2, \u00b6 42. The consent form stated,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that \"Mercy Medical Center and/or its outside partners in this research will own these data.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. LumenR alleges that it was the only \"outside partner\" involved in the research and therefore, according to the consent form, it owns the data.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45. Although LumenR was not a party to the consent form, it claims that it was a third-party beneficiary to the agreement, and therefore it can enforce the clause of the consent form against Kantsevoy. ECF 120-1 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In Kantsevoy's opposition to the Motion to Amend (ECF 144), he points out that LumenR did not move to amend its pleadings until long after the deadline of May 24, 2017, that this Court set for doing so (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF 23), and he argues that LumenR's belated amendment fails Fed. R. Civ. P. 16's \"good cause\" standard for modifying a scheduling order. ECF 144 at 18. Kantsevoy asserts that \"LumenR's counsel knew all the facts necessary to bring [the new counterclaim] long before the deadline,\" but declined to do so until after the close of discovery and the pretrial motions deadline.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20. Kantsevoy further contends that allowing the amendment will prejudice him, as he would have no opportunity to conduct further discovery regarding the new claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20. In the alternative, Kantsevoy argues that the Court should deny leave to amend under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15, because the amendment is futile and would cause undue prejudice to Kantsevoy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In its defense, LumenR asserts that \"the relevant facts were not fully known by LumenR until well after the deadline of May 24, 2017 had passed.\" ECF 120-1 at 1. In particular, LumenR cites the deposition of a representative of Mercy Medical Center, taken on July 19, 2017; the deposition of Kantsevoy himself, taken on November 11, 2017; and the deposition of Kantsevoy's expert, taken on December 2, 2017, as confirming that \"no other 'outside partners' other than LumenR were involved\n   in the clinical trial of the LumenR device.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Thus, LumenR maintains that the counterclaim \"was not fully developed by LumenR until nearly the close of discovery.\" ECF 158 at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   A complaint may be amended \"once as a matter of course\" within twenty-one days of service of a defendant's answer or Rule 12(b), (e), or (f) motion, \"whichever is earlier.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(1). \"In all other cases, a party may amend its pleading only with the opposing party's written consent or the court's leave.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). However, the court \"should freely give leave when justice so requires.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   At this juncture, however, LumenR must do more than satisfy the liberal standard for amendments set forth in Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a). When, as here, a party seeks to amend a pleading after the expiration of a deadline set forth in a scheduling order, Rule 16(b)(4) is implicated. Rule 16(b)(4) states that a scheduling order may be modified to amend a pleading \"only for good cause and with the judge's consent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   LumenR must first meet the requirements of Fed.

By all accounts, LumenR was aware of the \"core operative facts\" of its proposed counterclaim before the deadline to amend the pleadings had passed, and \"the fact that [LumenR] may not have had sufficient evidence to\n   <em>\n    prove\n   </em>\n   [its] claim before the deadline for the amendment of pleadings had no bearing on his ability to\n   <em>\n    plead\n   </em>\n   [its] claim in a timely manner.\"\n   <em>\n    Crouch v.

It asserts that \"although LumenR had been aware of the informed consent form at the time of the deadline to amend the pleadings, it was not until its deposition of Mercy on July 19, 2017, when Mercy disclaimed any ownership in the clinical trial data, that LumenR first appreciated the potential counterclaim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   This statement works against LumenR's ultimate goal in two ways. First, the fact that LumenR had not previously \"appreciated\" its potential counterclaim, despite having knowledge of the document that purportedly gave rise to it, does not support its claim of diligence. \"Courts in the Fourth Circuit deny leave to amend a complaint past the deadline established by a scheduling order where the moving party has been careless in developing his claims or where he has failed to satisfactorily account for his failure to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    Tawwaab\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4202490\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/729/757/#p768\">\n    729 F.Supp.2d at 769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Second, and perhaps more important, July 19, 2017, was almost five months prior to the filing of the Motion to Amend on December 12, 2017. If, following the deposition on July 19, 2017, LumenR finally \"appreciated\" its potential counterclaim, it has not adequately explained why it waited five months before moving to amend. Rather, it contends that its delay is justified by its eventual confirmation in November 2017 that there were no other \"outside partners\" involved in the research, and by information obtained from Kantsevoy's expert, Dr. Paresh Shah, on December 2, 2017.

Overview of Kantsevoy's Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   As discussed, Kantsevoy alleges that he formed a contract with LumenR on June 12, 2010. On that date, Piskun, on behalf of LumenR, emailed an \"offer\" to Kantsevoy promising daily or hourly compensation and \" 'an equity ownership package' providing 'a very substantial exit.' \" ECF 1, \u00b6 27. And, Kantsevoy alleges that he \"accepted that offer immediately and performed fully under the contract.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. According to Kantsevoy, LumenR (through Piskun) reaffirmed its intention to grant Kantsevoy an equity package on multiple occasions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. As a result of this agreement, and in reliance on the expectation of cash and equity, Kantsevoy allegedly dedicated his time and expertise to improving and promoting the medical device.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Kantsevoy further asserts that LumenR failed to compensate him properly, both by reducing or refusing to pay him the agreed-upon consulting fees, and by reneging on its promise of an equity interest in LumenR.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-23. Therefore, Kantsevoy demands \"all the fees\" promised in the June 12, 2010 Email, reimbursement for all expenses that he incurred on behalf of LumenR, and \" 'an equity ownership package' (or equivalent consideration) commensurate with his contributions to the company's success.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The LumenR Motion does not dispute the allegations underlying the alleged \"breach.\" Instead, LumenR argues that no contract was formed because, rather than constituting a definite offer, Piskun's June 12, 2010 Email was merely an \"invitation to engage in a future negotiation.\" ECF 25-1 at 9. As noted, the June 12, 2010 Email stated, ECF 25-2:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   Sergey-Thank you, It is an honor to get you involved. Let's start by introducing the technology to you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   If this is acceptable to you we would compensate your consulting time with $500/hour and $2500/day if need to spend a day on the company's business (meetings, labs, clinical studies, etc.) If it\n   happens that you really excited about the technology and believe in its future, we can create an equity ownership package which may be a very substantial exit for you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   Please let me know your thoughts. If you prefer to talk on the phone please don't hesitate to call me at [REDACTED].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   Best Regards,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   Greg\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   And, Kantsevoy responded,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   : \"Yes, I am interested. We can discuss more details by e-mail or by phone-both way [sic] are good for me. Sergey.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   According to LumenR, this exchange did not create \"an enforceable promise.\" ECF 25-1 at 8. LumenR asserts that material terms are missing from the exchange, such as the terms of the \"equity ownership package.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. Thus, LumenR maintains that Kantsevoy's allegations do not state a claim for breach of express contract (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), breach of implied-in-fact contract (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11), or promissory estoppel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13. Likewise, LumenR argues that because the June 12, 2010 Email contains no \"false representation,\" Kantsevoy cannot state a claim for deceit or negligent misrepresentation, either.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   This basic framework of allegations-a promise made, work done, a promise broken-underlies all six of Kantsevoy's claims against LumenR. And, LumenR's argument for dismissal-no promise was made-underlies each part of the LumenR Motion. All of the claims rest on the same logic. I shall divide the discussion of Kantsevoy's claims into two parts: (1) his claim for monetary compensation of $500 per hour or $2,500 per day, and (2) his claim for an \"equity ownership package.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Elements of Kantsevoy's Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   As indicated, LumenR has moved to dismiss Counts I, II, IV, V, and VI of Kantsevoy's Complaint. ECF 25. These counts allege Breach of Express Contract (Count I), Breach of Implied-In-Fact Contract (Count II), Promissory Estoppel (Count IV), Deceit (Count V), and Negligent Misrepresentation (Count VI).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 1. LumenR does not move to dismiss Kantsevoy's Count III, for Breach of Implied-In-Law Contract,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , unjust enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Before discussing the specifics of these claims, it is helpful to define each of them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

But, Kantsevoy and LumenR had no \"previous transactions\" that would clarify the terms of the June 12, 2010 Email.

App. Mar. 10, 2017) (unpublished), the Maryland Court of Special Appeals considered a similar circumstance. There, the plaintiff sought a portion of the proceeds resulting from the sale of a business for which she had worked.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4. Among other theories, the plaintiff alleged a claim of promissory estoppel, supported by the defendant's statement that, \" '[i]f the company comes to sale during, or after the terms of [the plaintiff's employment] contract, [the plaintiff] will receive her shares of the profit of sale.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5 (citation omitted). (first alteration in\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   ).

Because the plaintiff presented no evidence of \"as to what that interest would be,...the language she offered was not clear or definite enough to establish what ownership interest, if any, she would be entitled to at the time of a sale.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *12. Accordingly, \"there was no evidence from which a fact-finder could infer a definite set of promises that estops [the defendant].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Without an \"indication of how the parties intended for [the plaintiff's] ownership interest to be determined....the alleged agreement was too vague.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Likewise, Kantsevoy's reassertions that Piskun \"repeatedly assured him that LumenR would adequately compensate Dr. Kantsevoy for his time and efforts\" (ECF 1, \u00b6 13) are unavailing. The problem is not that Kantsevoy has failed to allege a promise; the problem is that Kantsevoy has failed to allege a\n   <em>\n    clear and definite\n   </em>\n   promise. For this reason, he cannot be considered to have entered an enforceable implied-in-fact contract, and cannot invoke the doctrine of promissory estoppel with regard to his equity claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   Kantsevoy's core argument is that if the June 12, 2010 Email is an \"\n   <em>\n    enforceable\n   </em>\n   offer to provide compensation in the form of fees of [sic] per diem or hourly fees, on one hand, and an\n   <em>\n    unenforceable\n   </em>\n   statement about potential equity interest, on the other hand,\" then \"LumenR could satisfy its debt without compensating Dr. Kantsevoy with any equity interest in the company-and for an amount far less than he was led\n   to believe could result from a successful sale of the Tissue Retractor.\" ECF 26 at 22.

Kantsevoy asserts that the expected event-in his telling, the sale of LumenR to another company-\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   in fact occur, making Piskun's promise of equity no longer contingent. ECF 26 at 23-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   Kantsevoy's claims do not address LumenR's argument. The asserted defect in Kantsevoy's pleading is not the uncertainty of the sale and LumenR's\n   <em>\n    ability\n   </em>\n   to give Kantsevoy an equity package. Rather, LumenR insists that, as is the case for Kantsevoy's contract claims, Piskun never made a promise of equity such that the promise could be broken and the statement of intent rendered false. ECF 25-1 at 15-16. In other words, Piskun never definitively said he would give Kantsevoy equity, so his failure to give the equity does not mean he lied (or negligently misrepresented anything).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   This is accurate as far as the June 12, 2010 Email is concerned. However, both parties largely overlook the rest of Kantsevoy's allegations. In particular, Kantsevoy also alleged that \"during a July 2015 flight to Amsterdam...Dr. Piskun confirmed that Dr. Kantsevoy would be provided an equity stake in LumenR.\" ECF 1, \u00b6 13. In Count V, Kantsevoy \"incorporate[d] by reference the allegations contained in the preceding paragraphs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52. Thus, Kantsevoy has alleged an actual promise of equity, albeit in an undefined amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   This alleged false statement does not rise to the level of definiteness that could support a claim for promissory estoppel, as it lacks a clear price term. But, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of Kantsevoy, I conclude that it meets the heightened pleading requirements of Rule 9(b). Kantsevoy alleged the approximate time (July 2015), place (airplane to Amsterdam),\n   speaker (Piskun), and content (affirmation of an equity interest upon the sale of LumenR) of the false statement. ECF 1, \u00b6 13. And, unlike Kantsevoy's deceit claim regarding payment of his fees, plaintiff has actually alleged that Piskun \"repeatedly assured him\" that he would be paid in equity (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), and later \"disavowed his repeated offers of an equity stake.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. These alleged assurances, coupled with Piskun's alleged \"refus[al] to provide a straightforward answer\" as to the size of the equity package (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23), imply that LumenR sought to string Kantsevoy along to gain the benefit of his services, without any intention to provide him with an equity interest in the company. No comparable facts were pleaded as to the claim concerning the fee agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   The allegations in regard to the equity interest can be fairly construed to allege generally \"[m]alice, intent, knowledge, [or] other conditions\" as to Piskun's state of mind, as contemplated by Rule 9(b). Therefore, \"[t]o the extent that LumenR never intended to follow through\" on its promise and its \"subsequent verbal reaffirmations of this commitment,\" Kantsevoy has satisfactorily alleged the elements of a cause of action for deceit. ECF 1, \u00b6 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   Kantsevoy did not specifically incorporate the preceding paragraphs of his Complaint into Count VI, for negligent misrepresentation. However, as LumenR acknowledges, Kantsevoy's \"claims for Deceit and Negligent Representation rise and fall together.\" ECF 28 at 14. Assuming all the allegations as true and making all reasonable inferences in favor of Kantsevoy, I conclude that the Complaint also states a claim for negligent misrepresentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

ECF 12 at 18-22. LumenR also raises a number of affirmative defenses to Kantsevoy's claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-10. The Kantsevoy Motion seeks to dismiss LumenR's Fourth Counterclaim, for deceit, and to strike two of its affirmative defenses, pleaded as \"doctrine of estoppel\" and \"doctrine of unclean hands.\" ECF 27; ECF 12, \u00b6\u00b6 64, 65. Kantsevoy also moves to strike \"all allegations regarding Dr. Kantsevoy's financial disclosures to third parties because those allegations are both immaterial and scandalous.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   The Fourth Counterclaim alleges that \"Kantsevoy made multiple representations to LumenR, peer reviewed publications, professional associations and even to regulatory bodies that he had no relevant financial interests or conflicts with LumenR.\" ECF 12, \u00b6 45. However, LumenR maintains that Kantsevoy later asserted an entitlement to retroactive payment and an equity interest in LumenR.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46. LumenR contends that Kantsevoy's latter assertion-that he\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   have an interest in LumenR-was false, that Kantsevoy knew it was false, and that he intended to extort and defraud LumenR.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47, 49. Furthermore, LumenR alleges that it \"was justified in relying on Kantsevoy's representations [that he was] free of financial conflicts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50. According to LumenR, \"Kantsevoy's false statements diminished the consideration ultimately paid\" by the company that bought the rights to the Tissue Retractor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   In its Third Affirmative Defense, LumenR alleges that Kantsevoy's contract-based claims are \"barred by the Doctrine of Estoppel based on Kantsevoy's numerous statements to LumenR, and numerous\n   statements to third parties that Kantsevoy has no financial interest or conflict with respect to LumenR.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 64. In its Fourth Affirmative Defense, LumenR asserts that Kantsevoy \"is estopped from obtaining any recovery for any of Counts I-VI under the doctrine of unclean hands.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65. Similar to its Third Affirmative Defense, LumenR asserts that Kantsevoy publicly represented that he had no financial interest in LumenR, and therefore cannot be allowed to maintain a contrary position.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Motion to Dismiss Deceit Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   Kantsevoy's argument for the dismissal of LumenR's deceit claim begins with a repetition of the elements of a cause of action for deceit, ECF 27-1 at 12 (quoting\n   <em>\n    SpinCycle, Inc. v.

He argues that LumenR does meet the fourth element because it never actually relied on the misrepresentation it alleges,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that Kantsevoy was in fact owed \"a retroactive payment by LumenR and/or an equity interest in LumenR.\" ECF 27-1 at 12-13 (quoting ECF 12, \u00b6 46). His point is well taken. To state a claim for deceit, a plaintiff must have justifiably relied on a false representation, to his or her detriment.\n   <em>\n    Nails\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2025975\" index=\"375\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/334/398/#p415\">\n    334 Md. at 415-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2025975\" index=\"376\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/334/398/#p415\">\n    639 A.2d at 668-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But, this entire suit turns on the fact that LumenR did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   credit Kantsevoy's entitlement to compensation, and that entitlement is the assertion that LumenR alleges to be false. ECF 12, \u00b6 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   In its Opposition, LumenR shifts its position and argues that it was harmed by Kantsevoy's false statement because Kantsevoy's unethical behavior harmed the credibility of his work on LumenR and reduced LumenR's sale value. ECF 29 at 10. This may be an accurate assessment, but it does not state a claim for deceit. To claim deceit, a party must allege that the defendant's misrepresentation, at the very least, \"substantially induced\" the party to act.\n   <em>\n    Nails\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2025975\" index=\"377\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/334/398/#p415\">\n    334 Md. at 416-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2025975\" index=\"378\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/334/398/#p415\">\n    639 A.2d at 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, however, LumenR asserts that it relied \"on the belief that Kantsevoy was performing and reporting on his work with the LumenR device in an ethical manner.\" ECF 29 at 10. That is, it relied on the\n   <em>\n    absence\n   </em>\n   of a conflict of interest. And, in its Answer and Counterclaims, LumenR appears to have alleged that there was in fact no conflict. ECF 12, \u00b6\u00b6 46-48.

He insists that the allegations relating to his failure to disclose his alleged financial relationship with LumenR \"are unquestionably irrelevant to the claims and defenses at issue here.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. Moreover, Kantsevoy maintains, they \"are scandalous\n   because LumenR accuses Dr. Kantsevoy of professional dishonesty...and intimates that he might have committed a crime (lying to federal regulators).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   Of import here, Kantsevoy never asserts that these allegations are false, only that they are scandalous. Perhaps they are. But, they are also relevant, both to LumenR's counterclaim for tortious interference with business relations, and to Kantsevoy's own claims for breach of contract and deceit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   Moreover, as LumenR points out (ECF 29 at 13), Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(f) requires that a motion to strike be made \"either before responding to the pleading or, if a response is not allowed, within 21 days after being served with the pleading.\" Kantsevoy's motion did not comport with this timeline, and Kantsevoy utterly fails to offer any justification for its tardiness. Instead, it avers that district courts may consider and grant motions to strike on their own. ECF 30 at 14. I shall decline to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   Kantsevoy's motion to strike is both untimely and meritless.
