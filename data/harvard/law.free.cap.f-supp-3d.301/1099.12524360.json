CORNELIUS, U.S. MAGISTRATE JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs Joseph Garrett, Theresa Hall, Garron Mixon, Rodney Watts, Thomas Foster, and Darren Turner filed a complaint against Tyco Fire Products, LP, alleging racial harassment in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Docs. 1, 12, 20). The court has before it the June 15, 2017 motion for summary judgment filed by Tyco. (Doc. 26). The motion was deemed submitted without oral argument as of September 28, 2017. After a thorough review of the briefs and evidence, the motion is due to be granted for the following reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. STATEMENT OF FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant Tyco Fire Products, LP (\"Tyco\") manufactures water-based fire suppression system components and ancillary building construction products. (Doc. 27-13 at 2). The six Plaintiffs are all former hourly workers at Tyco's Anniston plant who allege they were subjected to racially harassing comments and graffiti at the plant in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Docs. 12 &amp; 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Tyco's anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Every newly hired employee, including the six Plaintiffs, attends orientation sessions where all Tyco policies for the Anniston facility are explained. (Doc. 27-13 at 5). As part of orientation, a member of Tyco management reviews the anti-harassment and anti-discrimination policies in the employee handbook, the Tyco guide to ethical conduct, and the \"Speak Up\" resources. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During orientation, the process of making a complaint is explained. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The handbook encourages employees to bring any complaints of harassment to Human Resources or to their supervisors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). If an employee feels uncomfortable complaining at the plant level, the handbook directs the employee to complain to the director of Human Resources for the Americas team or through the Tyco concern line contained in the handbook and posted in the plant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, 10-12, 18-19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Additionally, Tyco provides employees with training on various ethical issues and trains its employees on a yearly basis on the guide to ethical conduct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 13-17). The guide provides a website where all Tyco's policies and procedures are located. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 16). The guide details the resources available for an employee to lodge a complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 13-17). The guide also provides \"Speak Up\" resources, wherein several additional avenues for lodging complaints are listed, including a toll-free 1-800 concern line, legal or compliance teams, and the Tyco ombudsman office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 16). An employee can also submit a complaint via the internet. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The employee handbook was published and distributed to all employees at the Anniston plant throughout the Plaintiffs' employment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). A summary of both the guide to ethical conduct and the \"Speak Up\" resources was posted by the time clock in the plant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiffs' employment with Tyco\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Thomas Foster\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Allegations of harassment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Thomas Foster worked at the Anniston foundry from 1996\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   until September of 2013. (Doc. 27-1 at 9, 25). Foster's direct supervisor during his employment with Tyco was superintendent Phillip Shivers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15). Although his direct supervisor was David Landers when he was in the finishing department, Foster remained under the supervision of Shivers, who was in charge of the entire third shift. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Shivers made a single racial comment to Foster when he was working in the mold department sometime in the 2000s. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27-29). Foster turned off the furnace to recharge it, and Shivers asked, \"What the hell is going on, n*****? What happened?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29). Additionally, Foster testified Shivers wore a helmet with a hand-drawn lightning bolt on the side. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33). Foster was told after his termination, in a meeting he attended with the other Plaintiffs, the lightning bolt symbolized part of the Ku Klux Klan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8, 33-34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Foster testified Landers used the word \"boy\" on two occasions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27, 30-32). In March 2011, Landers said, \"You need to hurry up, boy, and get this stuff cleaned up, get these shocks and stuff.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31). In September 2013, Landers approached Foster after he mistakenly ran his forklift into the duct work in the ceiling of the plant and said, \"Oh, boy, what have you done now?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30-31). Foster also claims someone he could only identify as \"Ken\" said something to the effect of \"how many black men do you think I've done killed now?\" after Foster complained they were working too hard. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Additionally, in the summer of 2008, Foster saw a drawing in a stall in the men's restroom of a black person's face with a rope drawn around the face. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27-28). The next time he went to the restroom, within a month or so, it had been painted over and removed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Training and reporting of allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Foster was trained on Tyco's policies and understood he could take complaints to his supervisor or to Human Resources. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13, 43). Foster admits the policies were explained to him when he was trained on the handbook in 2003, after Tyco took over the plant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12, 44). Foster signed an acknowledgment form on November 11, 2003, stating, \"I have received the handbook, and I understand that it is my responsibility to read and follow the policies in the handbook and any changes made to it,\" but testified in his deposition he did not receive a handbook on that occasion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He testified he signed the form because he feared for his job but admitted no one threatened his job or otherwise pressured him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11). Foster has trouble reading but never asked anyone to read the policies to him, even though \"they would [have], but [he] didn't never ask them.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Foster never made any complaints to Human Resources or to anyone else in Tyco management about any of the alleged harassing conduct at any point in time during his employment with Tyco. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13, 37). Foster testified he did not complain because Human Resources \"wouldn't do nothing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13). The first time Foster made any complaint of discrimination was when he filed his EEOC Charge after his employment was terminated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13, 48). Foster did not identify any harassment and did not mention the \"boy\" or \"n\" comments in his EEOC charge. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31, 48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Theresa Hall\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Allegations of harassment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Theresa Hall first worked for Tyco from 2001 until 2004, when she was terminated for attendance violations. (Doc. 27-2 at 7-8). She was employed subsequently from February 2013 until January 2014, when she was again terminated for attendance issues. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8; Doc. 27-3 at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Hall contends David Landers said \"y'all\" when addressing her and three other female African-American employees. (Doc. 27-2 at 23-24). Specifically, Landers would say things such as, \"Y'all. Y'all lazy.\" and \"Y'all ain't getting nothing out.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23). These comments occurred 10-15 times over a 2-3 month period in late 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25). Aside from these \"y'all\" comments, Landers never directed any other supposedly racial comments at her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25). She did, however, hear Landers ask \"Where Joe Garrett at? Where that boy at?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24). In addition to these comments, Hall saw lightning bolts on Phillip Shivers' helmet. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28, 29; Doc. 27-3 at 35). She testified she did a Google search for \"thunderbolt\" and \"it had something about Nazi.\" (Doc. 27-2 at 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Training and reporting of allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   During her first employment with Tyco, Hall was trained by the Human Resources manager and understood she could report any harassing behavior to her supervisor or to Human Resources. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15). Hall received a handbook during her first employment and was trained on the harassment policies during her new-employee orientation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Upon her re-hire in February 2013, Hall again went through new-employee orientation and was provided similar training by Human Resources assistant Heidi Chambers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12). Hall signed a form dated February 18, 2013, acknowledging she received training on the EEO policies, the employee handbook, and the topic of \"Tyco Complaint Procedures; Resolution, Reporting to Chain of Command; No Retaliation, and Contact Numbers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17; Doc. 27-3 at 5). Although she signed this acknowledgement of receipt, Hall testified she never received a copy of Tyco's employee handbook and she could not recall receiving training on the harassment and discrimination policies. (Doc. 27-2 at 14, 16-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Hall also received training on Tyco's guide to ethical conduct and signed an acknowledgment form confirming her training. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18, 21; Doc. 27-3 at 8). The form, signed by Hall on February 18, 2013, states: \"I hereby certify that I have read and understand the information set forth in the Tyco Guide to Ethical Conduct and will comply with those policies and principles in my daily work activities ... Should I have a concern about a violation of Tyco policy, I will raise the concern through the appropriate channels as outlined in the Guide.\" (Doc. 27-3 at 8). Hall was aware of Tyco's corporate complaint hotline number and knew the number was posted in the hallway of the plant. (Doc. 27-2 at 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Hall never reported any of the alleged harassing conduct to anyone in Tyco management or Human Resources. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26). Hall chose not to report any conduct because she \"felt like [she] handled\" it herself and did not want to be labeled a \"snitch.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15, 26). The first time Hall made any complaint of discrimination was with her February 7, 2017 EEOC charge, when she alleged she was discriminated against in her termination because of her race. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11; Doc. 27-3 at 1). The EEOC charge did not make any reference to racial harassment or the alleged \"y'all\" or \"boy\" comments. (Doc. 27-3 at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Garron Mixon\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Allegations of harassment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Mixon worked for Tyco for three months from June 2013 until September 2013. (Doc. 27-4 at 14, 45). Mixon testified he was subjected to four instances of racial slurs from Phillip Shivers over approximately five days in September 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27, 30). On one occasion, Mixon asked Shivers for a pair of work gloves, and Shivers responded by saying to another individual, \"[L]et me help this n***** out.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27-28). On another occasion, Shivers said, \"[D]amn, your black ass in here again? I don't like you mother f*cker. I don't like you.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27). Shivers also made a comment regarding Mixon's blood pressure medication, saying, \"[D]amn, your black ass don't know how to take a pill?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Finally, Shivers called Mixon a \"lazy n*****\" on one occasion when he became dizzy at work and sat down. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27, 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Additionally, Mixon saw the phrase \"I hate n*****s\" written in the restroom on two occasions within approximately a one week period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36). The graffiti was later removed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He could not recall if he saw racial graffiti in the restroom aside from these two occasions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37). Mixon also saw lightning bolts on Shivers' and David Landers' hardhats and equated them to a white supremacy symbol. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Training and reporting of allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Mixon attended new employee orientation and signed a form dated June 18, 2013, acknowledging the handbook, Tyco policies, and guide to ethical conduct were covered in the training and that there was \"no tolerance for violence, harassment, drugs, weapons.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-17). Mixon also signed an acknowledgment of receipt of the handbook stating, \"I have received the handbook, and I understand that it is my responsibility to read and follow the policies in this handbook and any changes made to it.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18, 52). Mixon attended a one-hour training session on the Tyco guide to ethical conduct and signed an acknowledgment confirming he read and understood the guide and he should raise any possible violations through the appropriate channels. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20, 60 &amp; 61). Mixon testified, however, he never saw these policies despite his signature on the forms acknowledging receipt of the policies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Mixon did not report any of the alleged comments to Human Resources or Tyco management because he \"didn't trust them.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30). Mixon did not report the graffiti because he was told someone else reported it and he felt there was no point in doing so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38-39). Mixon did not report the lightning bolts on Shivers and Landers' helmets. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38). However, after Mixon was informed of his termination by Human Resource representative Grey Terry, Mixon testified he told Terry \"[W]ell you've got some people in high positions that seem to think it's okay to call somebody a lazy n****** or lazy SOB or whatever and you don't see anything wrong with that.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31). In response, Mixon stated Terry told him, \"[G]ood luck\n   boy. Good luck finding you another job.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Mixon filed an EEOC charge on February 7, 2014, alleging discrimination in his termination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45). The allegations contained in his EEOC charge do not mention any alleged racist comments or graffiti. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Rodney Watts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Allegations of harassment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Watts worked for Tyco from October 2011 until January 2016. (Doc. 27-5 at 8, 10; Doc. 27-6 at 16). Watts testified he heard the words \"boy\" and the \"n\" word \"constantly\" and \"every day\" while working at Tyco. (Doc. 27-5 at 17, 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Specifically, Watts testified about one incident in 2012, when he heard Phillip Shivers use the \"n\" word. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26, 28). Shivers was frustrated with downtime on the furnace and said, \"[M]an, I don't understand. Y'all n*****s. These n*****s just can't do right. Y'all n*****s-I don't understand. Y'all n*****s just don't do right. I don't understand what the problem is.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27). Watts responded by telling Shivers he could not call him that name, but Shivers did not apologize. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Watts testified Shivers used the word \"boy\" throughout the first year of Watts' employment with Tyco. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26). On one occasion, Watts asked Shivers for some welding gloves, and Shivers responded, \"I ain't got nothing to do with that, boy. Get out of my office.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28). Another time, Watts was driving a forklift and Shivers said, \"[H]ey, boy, you think you can go give one of the bull pushers a break?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Watts responded, \"I'm not a boy. Come on, man. I'm a man.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Shivers also asked a group of workers, \"I want y'all boys to be careful now. I want y'all boys to do this.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29). Watts also saw the lightning bolts on Shivers' helmet and equated it with a Nazi symbol. (Doc. 27-6 at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Watts testified Greg Terry also used the term \"boy\" on several occasions. In 2014, in response to Watts' interest in a different position, Terry said \"[L]ook, boy, what you can do is come in on your off day and try and get some experience like that.\" (Doc. 27-5 at 30). On two occasions, Terry held the door for him when they were coming into the plant together and he said, \"[C]ome on in, boy,\" or words to that effect. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30-31). Watts also saw a tattoo of the confederate flag on Terry's right forearm. (Doc. 27-6 at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Watts testified supervisors Patrick Young and Joe McLain and plant manager Paul Campbell also used the term \"boy.\" According to Watts, Young used the word \"boy\" in a \"sneaky way,\" such as in 2014 Young screamed, \"[H]ey boy, I need you to put that pattern on the pattern table,\" when they were about to start production. (Doc. 27-5 at 33-34). Watts overheard McLain say to another person, \"I got a black boy as a son-in-law .... I don't know why she ... ended up marrying that boy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34). Finally, in 2014 or 2015, an employee spilled hot iron onto the floor, and Campbell came to the area and said, \"[W]hat's wrong with that boy?\" (Doc. 27-6 at 1-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Sometime in 2014, Watts saw the \"n\" word written on the wall of the first bathroom stall in the men's restroom. (Doc. 27-5 at 37). Although he did not tell anyone about the graffiti, it was removed within approximately two months. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38). Additionally, Watts saw a rope tied into a noose hanging from a water hydrant pipe in the back of the plant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The rope was there for approximately a month, and Watts never reported it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. 27-6 at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Training and reporting of allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   During his orientation, Tyco reviewed the handbook, anti-harassment policy, and\n   diversity policy with Watts. (Doc. 27-5 at 9, 12-14; Doc. 27-6 at 18-22). On October 17, 2011, Watts signed an acknowledgment of training on Tyco's guide to ethical conduct and a statement he was given handouts regarding the guide. (Doc. 27-5 at 8-9 13; Doc. 27-6 at 17). Watts also signed a form the same day confirming he was trained on Tyco policies, including the anti-harassment and diversity awareness policy, the open door policy, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-23). Watts received additional training on the guide to ethical conduct in December of 2011, 2012, and 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Watts never made any complaints of race discrimination or harassment to anyone in Tyco management or to anyone in Human Resources at the plant. (Doc. 27-5 at 19). Watts testified that in May 2014, he made a telephone call to an unknown number\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   from his cell phone, but he does not recall with whom he spoke. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16). During the call, Watts reported supervisors were \"calling black men boys and the 'n' word. And [he] didn't approve with it.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On June 23, 2014, while he was still employed at Tyco, Watts filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC alleging he was discriminated against because of his race. (Doc. 27-6 at 32). Specifically, Watts alleged he was not considered for a position because of his race, he was paid less than similarly situated white employees, and he was disciplined differently than white employees with regard to the attendance policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The allegations contained in his EEOC charge do not mention any alleged racist comments, graffiti, noose, or any other harassment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Darren Turner\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Allegations of harassment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Darren Turner worked at the Anniston facility from June of 2010 until October of 2014, when his employment was terminated for leaving the plant without proper authorization from management. (Doc. 27-7 at 6, 37). Turner testified Shivers called him the \"n\" word on two occasions in 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-29). The first time was in April 2011 when Shivers slapped the shield on Turner's helmet when he made a mistake in the pouring iron and called him the \"n\" word. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-27). Shivers again called him the \"n\" word in late July 2011 during a heated exchange in Shivers' office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Turner testified Shivers used the \"n\" word on other occasions as well. Turner recalled a day when hand soap was smeared on the mirror in the men's bathroom and Shivers said, \"[I]t wasn't nobody but that n*****,\" referring to Turner. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32-33). Another time, Turner overheard Shivers call Mixon the \"n\" word when Mixon asked Shivers for a pair of work gloves. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36). Turner testified Shivers also referred to him as \"boy\" on a regular basis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Turner also testified about other employees he contends contributed to the alleged harassment. For instance, Eddie Till said, \"[W]hat up boy\" to Turner in the breakroom in 2012 or 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21). Another example was during a training session in 2012 or 2013, an unspecified person asked a question about how to tie a hangman's knot. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23). Additionally, Turner testified a maintenance employee he identified as \"Gaddy\" told him to \"get [his] black ass out there and get that damn pizza,\" when Turner had a pizza delivery\n   waiting at the gate to the facility and when \"Gaddy\" brought his wife to the facility, he told Turner, \"[T]his one ain't going black,\" in reference to his wife. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Finally, Turner testified he was offended by the words \"master\" and \"slave\" on two electrical boxes that operated the furnace. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26). Turner saw the \"n\" word written in the handicap bathroom stall on the wall in green marker sometime in 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15). Turner did not report it to anyone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Training and reporting of allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Turner attended orientation when first hired and was trained on Tyco's anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policies. (Doc. 27-7 at 10-11; Doc. 27-8 13-17). Turner testified the handbook was reviewed with him during his orientation, but he was not given a copy to keep. (Doc. 27-7 at 10-11, 25). On June 28, 2010, Turner signed an acknowledgement stating, \"I have read the handbook, and I understand that it is my responsibility to read and follow the policies in this handbook and any changes made to it.\" (Doc. 27-8 at 17). He also signed an acknowledgment of receipt of Tyco's Equal Employment Opportunity Policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28). Turner understood racial harassment was not tolerated and the anti-harassment policy was specifically covered in his orientation. (Doc. 27-7 at 25). He was also aware of the EEO postings in the plant located by the time clock. (Doc. 27-8 at 3-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Turner never complained to Human Resources representative Greg Terry about any alleged harassment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 27-7 at 12, 34). Turner contends he complained by responding to Phillip Shivers and Patrick Young when he did not like comments they made to him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12, 34-35). Otherwise, he made no formal complaints to Tyco management. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   That being said, Turner testified he sent an email in late 2010 or early 2011 to an unidentified person he described as a \"heavy-set white guy\" he saw on the Tyco website, complaining of discrimination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11). Turner did not recall the name, title, or role of the person he emailed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Turner did not produce a copy of this email during discovery. (Doc. 28 at 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    6.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12). Garrett also saw swastikas, the \"n\" word, \"go back to Africa,\" and \"KKK\" written on the bathroom stalls at various times throughout his employment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13). Each time he saw the graffiti, an employee responsible for restroom maintenance would paint over the graffiti. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Garrett also recounted the lightning bolts on Shivers' helmet and related them to swastika signs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14). He also saw the Confederate flag tattooed on Terry's forearm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Training and reporting of allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Although Garrett was scheduled to attend orientation on November 13, 2012, with seven other new hires, he was late, and Human Resources assistant Heidi Chambers provided Garrett with an individual orientation the next day. (Doc. 27-9 at 10-11; Doc. 27-10 at 18-19). Chambers reviewed the company handbook and the policies therein with Garrett. (Doc. 27-9 at 11; Doc. 27-10 at 20). Garrett signed an\n   acknowledgement form stating he received a copy of the handbook. (Doc. 27-9 at 11-12; Doc. 27-10 at 20). Garrett also signed a document entitled \"Hourly Policy Review Outline\" which contained his acknowledgment on the complaint process and concern line, directive to report harassment or other EEO issues, and Tyco's commitment to equal employment opportunity, among other items. (Doc. 27-10 at 26-27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Garrett received training on the Tyco handbook, as well as the anti-harassment policy, anti-discrimination policy, and guide to ethical conduct. (Doc. 27-9 at 12, 16-17; Doc. 27-10 at 19, 28). Garrett understood harassment should be reported to Tyco management or to Human Resources. (Doc. 27-9 at 12). Garrett was also aware of the posting near the time clock regarding harassment and providing telephone numbers employees could call to lodge complaints. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Garrett made a number of complaints to Greg Terry in 2013. Garrett complained in 2013 about Shaun Griffin using the \"n\" word. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-24, 36). Terry later told Garrett he addressed the issue with Griffin and to let him know if he had any further problems. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24). Garrett had no further issues with Griffin. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Additionally, during an investigation of an incident where Garrett was accused of racing motorcycles in the parking lot with a co-worker in July 2013, Garrett complained maintenance supervisor Mike Kimbrell yelled, \"Boy, this ain't no mother f*cking racetrack. Where the f*ck you think you are at?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24). Although Kimbrell denied the allegation, Terry reviewed Tyco's anti-harassment policies with him. (Doc. 27-13 at 6). Garrett did not have any further problems with Kimbrell. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25). Garrett also complained to Terry that he had not received a position in the melt/mold department. (Doc. 27-9 at 39). Terry reviewed the situation and got Garrett moved into the position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Garrett filed his first charge of discrimination with the EEOC on February 14, 2014. (Doc. 27-10 at 29). In his charge, Garrett alleged he heard \"boy\" and the \"n\" word used by management at the Anniston facility. (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .). Tyco Human Resources manager Dwendy \"Dee\" Jones investigated Garrett's allegations of harassment in his EEOC charge and met with Garrett for approximately an hour on March 6, 2014. (Doc. 27-9 at 19; Doc. 27-13 at 29-30). Jones asked Garrett to describe all his allegations of harassment and discrimination. (Doc. 27-9 at 34; Doc. 27-13 at 30, 32). According to Garrett, he told Jones about nine incidents of racial harassment,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   although during his deposition he produced a list of twenty-four incidents occurring up to that date. (Doc. 27-9 at 27; Doc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   27-10 at 33-34). Jones' notes of her conversation with Garrett recount three specific incidents: (1) the \"boy\" comment made by Kimbrell during the motorcycle racing incident; (2) a former employee told Garrett that Shaun Griffin referred to Garrett as a \"damn n*****;\" and (3) another employee told Garrett he heard Shivers and Griffin say \"we are going to make those n****** work.\" (Doc. 27-13 at 36-37). Garrett did not mention any graffiti to Jones. (Doc. 27-13 at 32).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Jones asked Garrett to provide a written statement, but he refused and told Jones to use the allegations in his EEOC Charge. (Doc. 27-13 at 33). Jones gave Garrett her cellular telephone number to call if he had any further issues. (Doc. 27-9 at 33; Doc. 27-13 at 33). Although Garrett later remembered additional instances he had not recounted to Jones, Garrett never contacted Jones to supplement his conversation. (Doc, 27-9 at 34-35; Doc. 27-13 at 33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Jones investigated Garrett's claims and interviewed the witnesses identified by Garrett. (Doc. 27-13 at 33-34). She attempted to contact those witnesses who no longer worked at the plant, but none of them returned her calls. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Jones also randomly selected other employees at the plant to interview regarding the plant environment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30). No one interviewed corroborated Garrett's claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Garrett filed a second EEOC charge on October 2, 2014. (Doc. 27-10 at 36). In his charge, he complained he was denied a machinery maintenance II position on June 24, 2014, because of his race and in retaliation for his prior charge. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Garrett did not make any allegations of harassment or that Tyco's investigation into his first EEOC charge was inadequate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Tasia Jones replaced Greg Terry as the director of Human Resources at the facility in December of 2014. (Doc. 27-13 at 3). Garrett made a complaint about his move from the melt/molding department. (Doc. 27-10 at 1). While lodging that complaint, Garrett told Tasia Jones the term \"boy\" and the \"n\" word \"were used loosely within the plant. (Doc 27-9 at 40). Specifically, Garrett told Jones that Joe McClain previously told a co-worker Garrett was a \"sorry n*****,\" and Shaun Griffin previously told someone his grandfather was the grand wizard of the KKK, both of which occurred months before Jones arrived at the facility. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Garrett also told Jones' supervisor, Richard Oakes, about the comment by McClain. (Doc. 27-10 at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Garrett's complaint was resolved to his satisfaction when he was allowed to return to the melt/molding department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Jones told Garrett she \"handled\" the issues raised about Griffin and McClain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Garrett testified the only problem he had thereafter was \"little picking\" and scrutiny of his work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Garrett filed a third charge of discrimination with the EEOC after his termination. (Doc. 27-10 at 38). In that charge, Garrett alleged he was \"subjected to racially derogatory terms such as boy and n*****.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He contended he was denied a promotion and terminated because of his race and in retaliation for his previous charges of discrimination.

Plaintiffs Foster, Hall, Mixon, Watts, and Turner failed to utilize the reporting procedures established by Tyco. As such, these Plaintiffs failed to put Tyco on notice as a matter of law.

Even his EEOC charge, filed after his termination, did not mention any alleged harassment. Additionally, Foster's subjective conclusion that any complaint he made would have been automatically considered meritless is insufficient to alleviate him of his responsibility to report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walton v.

Garrett made a number of complaints to Greg Terry in 2013, two of which involved alleged harassment. Garrett complained in early 2013 about Shaun Griffin using the \"n\" word. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-24, 36). Terry later told Garrett he addressed the issue with Griffin and to let him know if he had any further problems. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24). Garrett had no further issues with Griffin. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Additionally, Garrett complained to Terry about maintenance supervisor Kimbrell calling him a \"boy\" after the drag racing incident in July 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Although Terry did not find any corroborating evidence, he verbally counseled the employee. (Doc. 27-13 at 6). Garrett testified he had no further problems with Kimbrell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Regarding these complaints, Tyco's actions constitute immediate and appropriate corrective action, and therefore, Tyco cannot be held liable for the alleged conduct. After Garrett reported the inappropriate conduct in each instance, Terry spoke with the people involved and Garrett either did not have any further problems with the people involved, or did not report any further problems. Such measures are sufficient as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Faragher v.

(Doc. 27-10 at 29). Tyco assigned Dwendy Jones to investigate the allegations contained in Garrett's EEOC charge. (Doc. 27-9 at 19). Garrett met with Dwendy Jones on March 6, 2014, and reported nine incidents of alleged harassment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27; Doc. 27-10 at 33-34). Jones offered Garrett the chance to provide a written statement, but Garrett refused and told Jones to use the allegations in his EEOC charge. (Doc. 27-13 at 33). Additionally, Jones gave Garrett her cell phone number if he needed to add anything to his complaint, and Garrett never called her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. 27-9 at 33-34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   During their meeting, Jones asked Garrett to tell her about each and every incident of harassment. (Doc. 27-9 at 34). Garrett admits, however, he did not inform Jones about all the harassment he experienced. He only told Jones about nine of the alleged twenty-four incidents he recalled in preparation for his deposition. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27; Doc. 27-10 at 33-34). Garrett contends he could not remember some of the incidents he recalled three years later because he did not know when Jones was coming to talk to him about his EEOC charge and he did not have time to prepare and think about it. (Doc. 34 at 77-78). Additionally, Garrett contends he withheld information from Jones because she was in an \"adversarial position to Garrett\" because two of Garrett's co-workers made complaints against him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Garrett's arguments do not excuse his failure to inform Tyco and fully cooperate in the investigation.

Garrett's explanations as to why he did not report all the alleged harassment are unpersuasive. His argument regarding lack of time to prepare before speaking with Jones does not excuse his failure to report all the alleged harassment. Jones gave Garrett her cell phone number and told him to contact her for any reason. Even though he had her phone number and he remembered some additional unreported incidents, Garrett chose not to report the additional alleged harassment. That choice reflects a decision by Garrett to not fully participate in the investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Additionally, the court rejects Garrett's argument regarding the complaints against him as an excuse for his failure to fully inform Jones of all the alleged harassment. First, Jones met with Garrett in March 2014. The complaints against Garrett were not made until August 2014. (Doc. 27-3 at 22-24). Jones, therefore, could not have had any knowledge of the future complaints when she met with Garrett initially. Moreover, his failure to supplement Jones when he recalled other alleged harassment is not excused even after the women made their complaints against Garrett.

Had Tyco been fully informed about the alleged scope of the harassment, there is a chance the primary goal of preventing harm would have been served. By not fully informing Tyco regarding the full scope of the alleged harassment, Garrett thwarted that goal. As a result, his claim is barred as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   In summary, the court concludes Thomas Foster, Theresa Hall, and Garron Mixon's claims fail because the harassment alleged was not severe or pervasive as a matter of law. In the alternative, their claims fail because they unreasonably failed to take advantage of the corrective opportunities offered by Tyco. Although the court concludes Rodney Watts, Darren Turner, and Joseph Garrett established a claim of hostile work environment, their claims fail because they unreasonably failed to take advantage of the corrective opportunities offered by Tyco. As such, Defendant Tyco Fire Products, LP is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on all the claims asserted by Plaintiffs. Defendant's motion for summary judgment (Doc. 26) is due to be granted in full. A separate order will be entered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   <strong>\n    DONE\n   </strong>\n   this 14th day of March, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-167\">\n    When Foster began his employment, he worked for Central Castings.
