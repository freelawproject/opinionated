Borman, United States District Judge\n   Plaintiff TC Reiner first brought this copyright suit, alleging both infringement and wrongful removal of copyright information, against Saginaw Valley State University (\"\n   <strong>\n    SVSU\n   </strong>\n   \"), the Saginaw Valley State University Board of Control (\"\n   <strong>\n    SVSU Board\n   </strong>\n   \"), a former SVSU student, and an initially unnamed SVSU professor. The first three of those defendants have since been dismissed, and the professor has since been identified as Defendant Thomas Canale (\"\n   <strong>\n    Defendant\n   </strong>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Now before the Court is Defendant Canale's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. Defendant advances two potential grounds for dismissal of this action: (1) untimeliness, because he was not named as a defendant until after the limitations period had expired, and the amended pleading adding him as a party does not relate back to the date of the earlier complaint; and (2) immunity, on the assertion that Defendant has qualified immunity in his individual capacity, and Eleventh Amendment immunity in his official capacity. Both arguments have merit, and the Court will therefore grant Defendant's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff is a professional fashion and fine-art photographer. (ECF No. 32, 2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 3.) He is the creator of the work at issue in this lawsuit (the \"\n   <strong>\n    Work\n   </strong>\n   \"): a photograph of a seated woman entitled\n   <em>\n    Nikki.\n   </em>\n   (2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 11; Ex. 1, Photograph entitled \"\n   <em>\n    Nikki\n   </em>\n   \".) He also owns a copyright in the Work, which was registered in 2004. (2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 12-13; Ex. 2, Copyright Catalog Entry.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant is a Professor of Art at SVSU, and held that position during all times relevant to this lawsuit. (2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 4; ECF No. 39, Answer \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On or around April 28, 2014, Plaintiff learned that the Work had been included in materials distributed by SVSU to its students. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 15.) Plaintiff alleges that Defendant copied and distributed the Work to his students, and alleges on information and belief that at least one student used the Work in designing an advertisement for a domestic violence shelter as part of a class assignment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2d Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 16; Ex. 3, Advertisement.) Plaintiff further alleges that Defendant encourages students to use works created in class or for class assignments as a way of promoting themselves to potential employers, and that at least the one student (but possibly others) included the work along among materials provided to potential employers. (2d Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 6, 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant did not have or obtain a license or permission to use the Work. (2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 20.) At no point were students advised to seek permission from Plaintiff to use the Work, and the Work as provided to students did not contain copyright information. (2d Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 26.) While SVSU maintains policies regarding the use of copyrighted material, Plaintiff alleges, those policies do not require strict adherence, nor do they require instructors to educate their students on either the copyright policies themselves or\n   on applicable copyright laws and regulations. (2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 21; Ex. 4, Copyright Policy.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In a letter dated August 18, 2015, Plaintiff (through an attorney) notified SVSU that its use of the Work violated federal copyright law, and demanded that SVSU cease and desist from further use of the Work. SVSU denied violating any copyright law. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that \"[b]y failing to obtain a license for the Work or other works\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   by [Plaintiff] and allowing students access to and use of [such works], both inside and outside of the school setting, Defendant has profited from the name, reputation and signature image of [Plaintiff].\" (2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 27.) Plaintiff alleges that he \"has sustained and will continue to sustain substantial injury, loss and damage to his ownership rights in The Work.\" (2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Relevant Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff first filed suit on May 16, 2016 against SVSU and the SVSU Board of Control (\"\n   <strong>\n    SVSU Board\n   </strong>\n   \") only. (ECF No. 1, Compl.) The original Complaint asserted two claims for copyright infringement under the Copyright Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20106\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 501. (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 27-42.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The following November, Magistrate Judge Patricia T. Morris granted Plaintiff leave to amend his complaint, and Plaintiff added two defendants to the action: the student whom Plaintiff alleges used the Work in a class assignment, and the professor who taught the class. (ECF No. 16, Am. Compl.) In the Amended Complaint, the professor-now identified as Defendant Canale-was referred to as \"Jane Doe.\" (Am. Compl. at 2, Pg ID 193.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A few days after Plaintiff filed his Amended Complaint, SVSU and SVSU Board moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint (to the extent that it asserted claims against SVSU and the SVSU Board) on Eleventh Amendment grounds. The parties fully briefed that motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF Nos. 17, 19, 20.) At the May 19, 2017 hearing on the Motion, however, the parties agreed on the record that SVSU and SVSU Board should be dismissed as Defendants, and the Court entered an Order dismissing SVSU and SVSU Board from the action the same day. (ECF No. 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On July 7, 2017, Plaintiff filed his Second Amended Complaint, which is pled against Defendant Canale only, and which is now the operative complaint in this case. (ECF No. 32, 2d Am. Compl.) The Second Amended Complaint asserts two claims: one claim of copyright infringement under the Copyright Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20106\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 501 (Count I); and one claim of wrongful removal of copyright information under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201202\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Count II). (2d Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 29-44.) Four days later, Plaintiff stipulated to dismiss the student defendant, leaving Canale as the sole defendant in the action. (ECF No. 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On September 15, 2017, Defendant filed the instant Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. (ECF No. 40, Pl.'s Mot.) Plaintiff did not file a timely response, and sought the Court's leave on October 27 to\n   file a late response. (ECF No. 43.) The Court granted Plaintiff leave to file a late response (ECF No. 47), which Plaintiff did on November 7 (ECF No. 48, Pl.'s Resp.). Defendant filed a Reply the following day. (ECF No. 49, Def.'s Reply.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court conducted a hearing on Defendant's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings on Wednesday, November 22, 2017, and now issues the following ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Defendant advances two lines of argument in his Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. First, he argues that Plaintiff's claims are time-barred, since amended pleadings naming previously unnamed defendants (commonly known as \"Doe defendants\") do not relate back to the date of the original pleading under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c), and Defendant Canale was not named as a party to this action until after the applicable three-year limitations period expired. Second, Defendant argues in the alternative that he is entitled to qualified immunity insofar as he is being sued in his individual capacity, and Eleventh Amendment immunity insofar as he is being sued as a state employee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As discussed in detail below, Plaintiff's claims are indeed time-barred under the governing statute of limitations. Even if they were not, Defendant would be entitled to both forms of immunity that he invokes. Accordingly, the Court will grant Defendant's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Plaintiff's claims are time-barred.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As a threshold matter, Defendant argues that this action is barred by the three-year limitations period that applies to both of Plaintiff's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Both claims arise under Title 17 of the United States Code: his copyright infringement claim is asserted under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20106\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 501, and his wrongful removal of copyright information claim is asserted under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201202\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 15.)

In this regard, the court recognized that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   , as an unpublished opinion of the Sixth Circuit, is not necessarily binding on this Court.\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   is, however, highly persuasive authority for how the Sixth Circuit would so rule if the issue of \"John Doe\" defendants and Rule 15(c) relation back were to be reconsidered.

Plaintiff also cites two other Sixth Circuit cases for the general proposition that \"a plaintiff may sue an unnamed 'John Doe' defendant as a placeholder until the plaintiff learns the identity of the 'John Doe' Defendant\" (Pl.'s Resp. at 3, Pg ID 707), but both cases are unavailing to him. In\n   <em>\n    Brown v. Owens Corning Inv.

In\n   <em>\n    Hall v. City of Detroit\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20U.S.%20App.%20LEXIS%2021175\">\n    2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 21175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (CA 6, 2016), the Sixth Circuit upheld the district court's dismissal of a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   civil rights action to the extent that it was asserted against a municipal defendant, but reversed the district court's dismissal as to three unnamed police officer defendants. The court in\n   <em>\n    Hall\n   </em>\n   noted that the plaintiff's claims may have been time-barred-and also pointed out that while the plaintiff was entitled to bring suit against Doe defendants, he could not do so in order to circumvent a statute of limitations-but ultimately declined to rule on whether the lawsuit was timely in first instance because the district court had not itself addressed the issue. (Pl.'s Resp. Ex. 3,\n   <em>\n    Hall v. City of Detroit\n   </em>\n   at 2-3, Pg ID 729-30.) Neither of these two cases touches the issue of whether a plaintiff's use of a Doe defendant in a complaint is a \"mistake concerning the proper party's identity\" under Rule 15(c), so neither is relevant here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Lastly, the parties argue fairly extensively in their briefs over when exactly Plaintiff became aware that Defendant Canale was the proper defendant in this action. Plaintiff maintains that it was not until \"June or July of this year.\" (Pl.'s Resp. at 3, Pg ID 698.) Defendant counters that Plaintiff had notice of the fact as early as June 2014, and attaches as an exhibit to his Reply an email exchange between a representative of Plaintiff's and the former student defendant, in which the former student defendant identified \"Tom Canel\" as the instructor of the design class in which she allegedly made use of the Work. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply at 2-3, Pg ID 743-44; Ex. A, June 2014 Emails.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   This issue is outside the scope of the instant Motion for three distinct reasons. First and most importantly, the email exchange attached as an exhibit to Defendant's Reply is extrinsic to the pleadings, and for that reason this Court cannot consider it without converting the instant Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings to a summary judgment motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d) (\"If, on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) or 12(c), matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56. All parties must be given a reasonable opportunity to present all the material\n   that is pertinent to the motion.\"). Conversion of the instant Motion under Rule 12(d) is unnecessary because, for the reasons that follow, the precise time at which Plaintiff learned of Defendant's identity is not ultimately a relevant issue. The Court excludes this evidence accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Second, the binding precedent and ample persuasive authority discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   establishes that regardless of when Plaintiff learned of Defendant Canale's existence, his claims are barred because Defendant Canale was added as a defendant after the statute of limitations had run, and Plaintiff's earlier use of a Doe defendant does not constitute \"a mistake concerning the proper party's identity\" as required for the amendment to relate back under Rule 15(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Finally, the Supreme Court has held that as a general rule, \"relation back under Rule 15(c)(1)(C) depends on what the party to be added knew or should have known,\n   <em>\n    not on the amending party's knowledge or its timeliness in seeking to amend the pleading.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Krupski v. Costa Crociere S.p.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641809,12454862\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/538/\">\n    560 U.S. 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 541,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641809,12454862\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/538/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 2485\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641809,12454862\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/560/538/\">\n    177 L.Ed.2d 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) (emphasis added). Even if Sixth Circuit case law did not foreclose any argument that this matter involves \"a mistake concerning the proper party's identity\" under Rule 15(c)(1)(C)(ii), the time at which Plaintiff learned of Defendant's identity would be irrelevant for this independent reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Although there is arguably conflicting Sixth Circuit case law on the issue of whether an initial lack of knowledge as to the identity of a defendant constitutes a \"mistake\" under Rule 15(c)(1)(c)(ii), the weight of authority clearly favors a finding that it does not. Therefore, Plaintiff's addition of Defendant Canale as a defendant in this action does not relate back to the original pleadings under Rule 15(c), and both of Plaintiff's claims in this action are time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The only case Plaintiff cites in this regard is\n   <em>\n    Princeton University Press\n   </em>\n   , which he cites seemingly in order to concede that \"the question of what constitutes fair use in an educational setting has not been decided in this Circuit.\" (Pl.'s Resp. at 5, Pg ID 709.) Plaintiff's arguments are otherwise devoid of case support. He first points out that SVSU had a copyright policy in place, and contends that Defendant, as \"a professor in a field where copyrights are often an issue ... would have known that copyrighted works are protected in general, and is assumed to have been aware of the University's copyright policy.\" (Pl.'s Resp. at 5, Pg ID 709.) Apart from this, Plaintiff argues that Defendant, as someone \"working in the field, would have some idea of what constitutes fair use and what does not. He certainly knew, from his employer, that the way to avoid a breach of copyright is to request permission to use the work. There is no dispute that [Defendant] never did that.\" (Pl.'s Resp. at 5-6, Pg ID 709-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   There is no merit to these arguments. Beyond failing to cite any authority suggesting-let alone clearly establishing-that Defendant's use of the Work was not fair use, Plaintiff has all but conceded that his rights were not clearly established for qualified-immunity purposes by acknowledging that neither the Supreme Court nor the Sixth Circuit has addressed the fair use doctrine in the higher education context.

Among them are the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits, as well as several district courts (including at least one in this District).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The Fifth Circuit was the first to call the CRCA's constitutionality into question.

Applying that framework to the CRCA in the context of a copyright lawsuit by an author against a public university, the Fifth Circuit held that the statute's legislative history did not demonstrate a pattern of state copyright infringement (as\n   <em>\n    Florida Prepaid\n   </em>\n   had suggested was required); that Congress gave little thought to state remedies at all; and that the legislature took no apparent steps to cabin the scope of the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11470963\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/204/601/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11470963\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/204/601/\">\n    at 605-07\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court thus held that the Copyright Clause of Article I,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   which was the stated\n   constitutional basis for the CRCA when it was enacted, could no longer justify an abrogation of state sovereign immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091014\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/1297/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091014\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/1297/\">\n    at 1315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court explained that Congress can validly abrogate state sovereign immunity under Fourteenth Amendment in two ways: either by \"creat[ing] private remedies against the States for\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   violations\" of the Fourteenth Amendment, or by enacting \"prophylactic legislation which deters or remedies [Fourteenth Amendment] violations ... even if in the process it prohibits conduct which is not itself unconstitutional, so long as there [is] a congruence and proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091014\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/1297/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091014\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/1297/\">\n    at 1315-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis and alterations in original) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The latter (\"prophylactic\") option, which was at issue in\n   <em>\n    Chavez\n   </em>\n   , was not raised in\n   <em>\n    NABP\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   The question before the court in\n   <em>\n    NABP\n   </em>\n   was therefore whether the plaintiff-a nonprofit corporation which alleged that a public university and affiliated parties had appropriated its copyrighted materials-had alleged an \"actual violation\" of its Fourteenth Amendment due process rights. The Eleventh Circuit concluded that it had not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091014\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/1297/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4091014\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/633/1297/\">\n    at 1315-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <em>\n    Chavez\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    NABP\n   </em>\n   thus reached similar outcomes on different doctrinal grounds. The Fifth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Chavez\n   </em>\n   had to do with whether there was enough evidence in the CRCA's legislative history of a pattern of state-committed copyright violations to justify the law's abrogation of state sovereign immunity. In\n   <em>\n    NABP\n   </em>\n   , by contrast, the Eleventh Circuit analyzed whether the plaintiff's allegation of copyright infringement was in itself an allegation of a due process violation by the state, and ultimately concluded that it was not. In other words,\n   <em>\n    Chavez\n   </em>\n   analyzed the CRCA as a prophylactic remedy for a societal problem, while\n   <em>\n    NABP\n   </em>\n   analyzed the CRCA as a vehicle for remedying state actions that are themselves violations of a plaintiff's constitutional rights. Both courts concluded that it was not a valid exercise of congressional power. And while these are the only two circuit courts that have weighed in on the CRCA's constitutionality thus far, various district courts have reached the same results, including several within the Sixth Circuit.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Campinha-Bacote v.

A court in this District recently did the same in\n   <em>\n    Wolf\n   </em>\n   , rejecting the plaintiff's attempt to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Chavez\n   </em>\n   and declining her \"invitation to examine the Copyright Act ab initio.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <em>\n    Wolf\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207048812\">\n    2016 WL 7048812\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (E.D. Mich. Dec. 5, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   This Court is not aware of any cases in which a court has upheld the CRCA against a challenge like those that were made in the cases discussed above. Moreover, Plaintiff has not presented the Court with contrary legal authority, evidence of a pattern of state university copyright violations, a colorable argument that his due process rights were violated, or any other reason not to follow the sound reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Chavez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    NABP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Wolf\n   </em>\n   , and the other cases that have invalidated the CRCA's purported abrogation of state sovereign immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ii. DMCA claim (Count II)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The same analysis applies to Plaintiff's DMCA claim. The CRCA purports to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity based on violations \"of any of the exclusive rights of a copyright owner provided by [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20106\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 122 ], for importing copies of phonorecords in violation of [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20602\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ], or for any other violation under this title.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20511\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The CRCA thus includes the DMCA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201202\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 1202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , within its scope. None of the authorities discussed above that have invalidated the CRCA have noted any basis for distinguishing between the DMCA and other provisions of Title 17, so the CRCA cannot validly abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity from liability under the DMCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Plaintiff has cited no other statute that purports to abrogate state sovereign immunity as to the DMCA, nor does the text of the DMCA itself demonstrate any congressional intent to that effect.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Because Plaintiff named Defendant Canale as a defendant in this action after the governing limitations period expired, and since the amended pleading in which he did so does not relate back to the date of the original pleading under Rule 15(c), this action is time-barred. Even if it were not, Defendant Canale is entitled to qualified immunity insofar as he is sued in his individual capacity, and Eleventh Amendment immunity insofar as he is sued in his official capacity.
