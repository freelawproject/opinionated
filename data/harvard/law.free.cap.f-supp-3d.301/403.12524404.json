WOLFORD, United States District Judge\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     INTRODUCTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs, Taiwanese investors, bring this putative class action against defendant Wilmington Trust Company (\"Defendant\" or \"Wilmington\"), alleging claims for aiding and abetting fraud, aiding and abetting conversion, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, gross negligence, and breach of fiduciary duty. (Dkt. 16). Presently before the Court is Defendant's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint (the \"amended complaint\") pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b) and 12(b)(6). (Dkt. 19). Because Plaintiffs have plausibly asserted claims for aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty, gross negligence, and breach of fiduciary duty, Defendant's motion to dismiss those claims is denied. However, Plaintiffs have failed to plausibly allege claims for aiding and abetting fraud, and aiding and abetting conversion. Therefore, for the reasons set forth below, Plaintiffs' claims for aiding and abetting fraud and aiding and abetting conversion are dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs are Taiwanese residents\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   who purchased interests in investment funds, known as the Bio Profit Series, LLC (\"BPS\") Funds. (Dkt. 16 at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 39-50). Plaintiffs allege that between 2005 and 2013, the BPS Fund managers operated the Funds as a Ponzi scheme, causing Plaintiffs' investment to lose value. As a result, Plaintiffs filed this action against Wilmington-the bank at which the BPS Fund managers maintained their accounts-alleging that Wilmington knowingly assisted in the Ponzi scheme, was grossly negligent in failing to discover the scheme, and breached its fiduciary duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following recitation of facts is taken from Plaintiffs' amended complaint, which is over 70 pages long and contains approximately 300 numbered paragraphs. Plaintiffs allege that Velocity Investment Group, Inc. (\"Velocity\"), based in Pasadena, California, was an entity owned and controlled by Michael Wang (\"Wang\") with the assistance of Wendy Ko (\"Ko\") (collectively, \"the Fund managers\"), both of whom were also located in California. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 17, 60). Through Velocity, Wang and Ko managed the California-based BPS Funds and solicited investors to invest in such funds by informing them that the investor money would be primarily used for buying and making residential loans, secured by first or second deeds of trust and mortgages on real property located in California, and buying and making commercial loans, secured by real property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that BPS consisted of several California-based investment funds purporting to invest in real estate-including BPS Funds I, II, III, and V, and Velocity Valley &amp; Grand (\"VVG\") (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2)-although these entities actually functioned as one fraudulent entity with investor funds being commingled among the BPS Funds' Wilmington escrow/custodial/trust accounts (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3). Plaintiffs' amended complaint alleges that, in order to assure the investors that their invested monies were safe, the Fund managers entered into \"escrow and/or custodial/trust agreements\" with Wilmington for the BPS Funds, and established \"custodial/escrow/trust accounts\" for such funds with\n   Wilmington. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4). Plaintiffs further allege that the escrow/custodial/trust accounts were opened for the benefit of the investors and/or for the safekeeping of their funds, and Wilmington-the trustee, custodian and/or escrow agent-undertook certain custodial/escrow duties to those investors, including the duties to monitor those accounts, oversee the transactions in the accounts, safeguard the investor money while in its custody, and transfer the investor money to the BPS Fund in which such money was intended to be held for use according to each fund's Private Placement Memorandum (\"PPM\") and Subscription Agreement provisions (the \"Use of Proceeds Provisions\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that their money was being converted, with Wilmington's assistance, by the Fund managers. Pursuant to instructions in the offering memoranda, investors sent their money, through checks made payable to \"Wilmington Trust Company as Escrow Agent for [each BPS Fund, respectively],\" to Velocity's offices with the understanding that it would be transferred to a Wilmington escrow account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 66, 68). After their money was deposited in certain Wilmington escrow or custodial accounts, instead of being invested in real estate loans as represented in each BPS Fund's offering materials, investor money was \"improperly - and knowingly - transferred by Wilmington,\" at the request of the Fund managers, to other BPS Funds' escrow/custodial/trust accounts held by Wilmington, commingled in those accounts with money of investors in other BPS Funds, and/or paid out of the Wilmington accounts as \"interest\" or \"redemption\" to other BPS investors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6). Plaintiffs allege that as a result of their participation in the scheme, Wilmington profited in fees from serving as the trustee, custodian, and/or escrow agent for the BPS Funds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that while misconduct occurred in several escrow/custodial accounts, BPS Fund I became the \"epicenter\" of the scheme. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 12, 23). Ultimately, through an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), the Ponzi scheme was exposed and Plaintiffs discovered their monies were gone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Wilmington engaged in the fraudulent scheme in four ways: (1) using new-investor monies to make \"interest\" and redemption payments to existing investors; (2) commingling investor money among the BPS Funds, in violation of its custodial and fiduciary duties to investors; (3) diverting investor money from the custodial accounts it managed and oversaw without the investors' knowledge or permission; and (4) assisting the Fund managers in their fraud, breach of fiduciary duty to the BPS Fund investors, and conversion of investor money in violation of its own fiduciary duties to such investors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14). Plaintiffs further allege that the investors, when deciding to invest in the BPS Funds, understood and believed Wilmington's role to be that of an escrow agent for their funds, and that the accounts in which their money was going to be held were to be escrow-or trust-accounts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Wilmington entered into escrow/custodial agreements with each BPS Fund, respectively, of which the BPS Fund investors were third-party beneficiaries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 28). Pursuant to those agreements, Wilmington undertook various duties, including to monitor and safeguard the BPS Fund investors' monies and to disburse those funds pursuant to the terms of the BPS Funds' offering materials. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiffs similarly allege that these offering materials indicated that Wilmington was the escrow agent for the respective BPS Fund's investor proceeds (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 65),\n   and that Wilmington may be held liable to the investors for the loss of the funds held in the escrow accounts in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 69).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Wilmington assigned the same two individuals to oversee and manage all BPS Fund custodial/trust/escrow accounts, Sally Molina (\"Molina\") and Scott Huff (\"Huff\") (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 30, 201), and that those employees developed a close working relationship with Ko and Wang, a keen understanding of the scheme's business and operations, and extensive knowledge of the sources and destinations of the BPS Funds' cash inflows and outflows (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 31). For example, Plaintiffs allege that upon the deposit of new investor money in the BPS Fund accounts, Wilmington's trust account specialist overseeing those accounts was frequently contacted by the \"BPS Funds' principals\" and directed to transfer the new investor money from the respective account in which it was deposited chiefly to the BPS I custodial/escrow account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32). Wilmington would then be directed by the BPS Funds' principals to wire massive amounts from the BPS I custodial/escrow account to \"clearly improper uses\" as alleged in the amended complaint, including payments to Wang and his family. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33). These transactions occurred for about seven years, concluding in 2013, and involved around $150 million in investor monies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 143). Plaintiffs allege that as a result of the Fund manager's scheme and Wilmington's misconduct, they have \"lost a substantial portion of the money they invested in the BPS Funds.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 252, 263, 275, 287, 298).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiffs filed their initial complaint on November 6, 2014. (Dkt. 1). Defendant moved to dismiss that complaint on May 1, 2015. (Dkt. 13). Plaintiffs thereafter filed the operative pleading in this case-the amended complaint-on May 22, 2015. (Dkt. 16). Defendant filed the pending motion to dismiss on June 19, 2015. (Dkt. 19). On July 24, 2015, Plaintiffs filed their response papers, and Defendant replied on August 7, 2015. (Dkt. 24; Dkt. 26). Plaintiffs obtained permission to file a sur-reply (Dkt. 28; Dkt. 29), which was filed on August 18, 2015 (Dkt. 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Court scheduled oral argument for November 13, 2015. (Dkt. 32). Oral argument was rescheduled for January 4, 2016. (Dkt. 33). Prior to oral argument, Plaintiffs filed a notice of supplemental authority on December 17, 2015. (Dkt. 34). Defendant responded on December 23, 2015 (Dkt. 35), and Plaintiffs replied on the same day. (Dkt. 36). Oral argument was held on January 4, 2016, and the Court reserved decision on the motion. (Dkt. 37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Following oral argument, the Court received submissions from the parties via facsimile. Plaintiffs sent a letter dated January 5, 2016, relating to Exhibit 4 to the amended complaint. Defendant responded via facsimile on January 7, 2016. Plaintiffs then filed a motion for leave to file a response to Defendant's January 7 \"letter brief\" on January 8, 2016. (Dkt. 38). Defendant replied in kind with its own response on the same day (Dkt. 39), and Plaintiffs filed a second motion to file a response to the letter brief on January 11, 2016 (Dkt. 40).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Then, the parties continued to communicate to the Court through letter submissions. On June 16, 2016, counsel for Defendant sent a letter to the Court. Plaintiffs' counsel responded by letter, dated June 17, 2016. Counsel for Defendant sent a further letter on July 7, 2016, and Plaintiffs' counsel also submitted a further letter on July 10, 2016. On September 23, 2016, the Court entered a Text Order indicating that it would \"accept and consider all post-argument communications submitted\n   by the parties,\" and placed all such communications on the docket.

Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant provided \"highly personalized services\" to the Fund managers and that Huff and Molina established a close professional relationship with Wang and Ko. (Dkt. 16 at \u00b6\u00b6 207, 217). Plaintiffs emphasize that Huff and Molina oversaw a substantial volume of illicit transactions relating to the BPS Funds over several years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiffs further allege that Huff and Molina \"executed atypical transactions and/or fraudulent transactions\" at the behest of the Fund managers, most frequently arising out of the \"BPS [Fund] I escrow and custodial accounts\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 208), and that Defendant knew the monies invested in the BPS Funds were investor proceeds (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 209-11). Plaintiffs also assert that the \"massive volume of highly suspicious transactions ... may have 'only' amounted in some cases to individual red flags,\" but together they constituted a \" 'forest of red flags,' \" which made it \"inescapably obvious\" that the Fund managers were stealing money from the BPS investors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at\n   <em>\n    \u00b6\n   </em>\n   225).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Plaintiffs state that Defendant was also aware that the Fund managers \"were paying distributions, 'interest' payments, and/or 'redemptions,' to other BPS Fund investors from the same Wilmington escrow/custodial accounts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 212-13, 218-19). Plaintiffs allege that Defendant became aware of the misuse of investor funds each time Molina or Huff processed\n   the Fund managers' requests to divert BPS investor monies to another account, commingling them with other investor funds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 214-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Plaintiffs further allege that Defendant was aware of the Fund managers' fraudulent conduct because Defendant received \"substantial benefits\" from its participation in the scheme. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 220). Specifically, Defendant allegedly derived hundreds of thousands of dollars from BPS investor monies by charging \"trustee/custodian/escrow fees.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 221-22). In addition, Plaintiffs also claim that Defendant received additional fees based on the quantity of wire transfers it processed, creating a \"perverse incentive\" for Defendant to maximize the number of \"improper and atypical money transfers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 223).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Despite these allegations, the Court finds that Plaintiffs' allegations do not surmount the heightened pleading requirement for alleging\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   knowledge of\n   <em>\n    fraudulent\n   </em>\n   conduct. The allegedly close professional relationship between the Fund managers and Huff and Molina does not come close to alleging actual knowledge of fraud.

Specifically, the California federal court found that actual knowledge was sufficiently alleged because the complaint alleged that the defendant performed two audits which revealed that the fraudster was not even registered to sell the securities the fraudster had been promoting to investors, and that the defendant knew the investors wrongfully believed they were purchasing these securities in the form of \"certificates of deposit,\" colloquially referred to as \"CDs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *3.

First, there is no allegation that the Fund managers were not permitted to engage in the purported security transactions at issue here-let alone that Defendant was aware of such impropriety-or that Defendant was aware that the BPS Funds were not created for the purpose of legitimate investment. Indeed, several of the transfer correspondence-which have been attached to the amended complaint-indicate that the monetary transfers were being requested to facilitate \"preparation for investment funding.\" (Dkt. 16-5 at 2; Dkt. 16-6 at 2-4). According to Plaintiffs, the offering materials promoting investment to the BPS investors indicated that their monies would be \"invested in each particular Fund [and] would be used by that Fund to buy and make residential loans ... [and] commercial loans.\" (Dkt. 16 at \u00b6 62).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Second, it is significant that the\n   <em>\n    Benson\n   </em>\n   court's conclusion was also based upon the \"close business relationship\" between the defendant bank and the fraudster.\n   <em>\n    Benson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%201526394\">\n    2010 WL 1526394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. As already stated, Plaintiffs' allegations fall far short of raising a strong inference of actual fraud based upon the relationship between Huff and Molina and the Fund managers. Notably,\n   <em>\n    Agape II\n   </em>\n   distinguished\n   <em>\n    Benson\n   </em>\n   on this point, stating that \"while the California court in\n   <em>\n    Benson\n   </em>\n   may have been willing, without more, to infer actual knowledge from a close relationship between a bank employee and the perpetrators of the Ponzi scheme, that holding is not consistent\n   with the law in the Second Circuit.\" 773 F.Supp.2d at 315.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Therefore, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently allege a strong inference of actual knowledge required for asserting a cause of action for aiding and abetting fraud under Delaware law.
