Plaintiffs also filed a Motion for Leave to File a Sur-Reply in Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 124), to which Defendants have filed a Response in Opposition (ECF No. 127). These motions are ripe for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Additionally, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, for Summary Judgment on Count II of the\n   <em>\n    Goodman\n   </em>\n   Complaint for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction (\n   <em>\n    Def.

Plaintiffs then filed a Reply Memorandum of Law (\n   <em>\n    Pl.

INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs in this consolidated action are five shareholders of seven mutual funds (the \"Funds\") managed by Defendants J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc. (\"JPMIM\") and J.P. Morgan Funds Management, Inc. (\"JPMFM\") (collectively, \"Defendants\"). The Funds are registered investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (\"ICA\"), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-1,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs brought suit under Section 36(b) of the ICA against Defendants for allegedly charging excessive advisory and/or administrative fees in violation of their fiduciary duty under the ICA. Section 36(b) of the ICA gives private litigants a one-year limitations period in which to bring suit. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-35(b). Damages are limited to fees received by investment advisers within the prior year. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-35(b)(3). Because Section 36(b) is \"equitable\" in nature, Plaintiffs are not entitled to a jury trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

(ECF No. 106.) Plaintiffs maintain their remaining claims on behalf of the JPMorgan Core Bond Fund and the JPMorgan High Yield Fund against JPMIM with regard to advisory fees (Counts I and II), and maintain all of their claims on behalf of all three funds against JPMFM with regard to administrative fees (Counts IV, V, and VI).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     2.

Bradley, Casey Leblanc, Jack Hornstein, Joseph Lipovich, Jacqueline Peiffer, Campbell Family Trust and Valderrama Family Trust (together, \"\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs\") bring this action against Defendants on behalf of and for the benefit of these four equity funds: (1) the JPMorgan Mid Cap Value Fund (\"Mid Cap Value Fund\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) the JPMorgan Large Cap Growth Fund (\"Large Cap Growth Fund\"), (3) the JPMorgan Value Advantage Fund (\"Value Advantage Fund\"), and (4) the JPMorgan US Equity Fund (\"US Equity Fund\") (collectively, the \"Equity Funds\" or the \"Funds\"), pursuant to Section 36(b) of the ICA. (\n   <em>\n    Compl.,\n   </em>\n   Case No. 2:15-cv-2923, ECF No. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs assert two types of claims against the Defendants on behalf of each of the funds-a claim that Defendant JPMIM charged excessive advisory fees to each of the funds (Counts I, II, and III), and a claim that JPMFM charged excessive administrative fees to each of the funds (Counts IV, V, VI, and VIII).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3. The Defendants\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Defendants are JPMIM (or \"Advisor\") and JPMFM (or \"Administrator\"), Adviser and Administrator for the Funds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   JPMIM is a wholly-owned subsidiary of JPMorgan Asset Management, Holdings Inc., which itself is a wholly-owned subsidiary of J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co (\"the Bank\" or \"JPMorgan\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Funds are overseen by a Board of Trustees (the \"Board\"), which is responsible for, among other things, selecting and monitoring the Fund's service providers. The Board selected Defendants to serve as service providers for the Funds. Defendant JPMIM is the investment adviser to the Funds and receives an annual fee from each Fund for providing investment advisory services, including managing each Fund's portfolio of securities, researching potential investments and deciding which securities will be purchased for or sold from the portfolio of assets. Defendant JPMFM is the administrator to the Funds (and an affiliate of JPMIM) and receives\n   an annual fee from each Fund for providing administration services, including supplying the Funds with officers approved by the Board of Directors, drafting amendments to the Funds' governing documents, negotiating contracts with and evaluating the Funds' other service providers, and overseeing other services for the Funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     4. The Funds\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Each of the funds is an \"open-end\" management investment company, also known as a \"mutual fund,\" registered under the ICA. The Funds do not have employees or facilities of their own. The Funds' operations are conducted by external service providers, such as Defendants, pursuant to contracts. In exchange for the investment advisory services provided by the Adviser to the Funds, the contracts, known as Investment Advisor Agreements (\"IAAs\"), require each of the Funds to pay the Adviser an annual fee that is calculated as a percentage of each of the Fund's assets under management or \"AUM.\" The fees were approved by the Board, and were disclosed in each Fund's prospectus and other SEC filings. Collectively, the Funds had $105 billion in AUM at the close of their respective Fiscal Years 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

R. Civ. P. 56(a). The movant has the burden of establishing that there are no genuine issues of material fact, which may be accomplished by demonstrating that the nonmoving party lacks evidence to support an essential element of its case. As the Supreme Court has explained, \"the plain language of Rule 56 [ ] mandates entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

Plaintiffs assert that fees are shown excessive by the lower fees Defendants charge when they serve in the role as a subadviser or subadministrator to other funds. On the other hand, Defendants assert that (1) the fact that Defendants' fees are in line with their peer group funds, and (2) the fact that they have provided a better than average ultimate rate of return to the Funds after the fees are accounted, prohibits a finding that they breached their fiduciary duty under Section 36(b). Defendants contend that under\n   <em>\n    Jones II\n   </em>\n   these \"two points 'jointly suffice under the Supreme Court's standard' to warrant summary judgment in for of the defendant in a Section 36(b) case.\" (\n   <em>\n    Def. Mot. S.J.,\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 113, p. 14.) It is true that, in\n   <em>\n    Jones II,\n   </em>\n   the Seventh Circuit stated that in the case before it, the funds' fees were in line with those charged by comparable funds and the funds' returns (net of fees) exceeded the norm for comparable investment vehicles, and that those factors \"jointly suffice under the Supreme Court's standard.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones II,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=611%20Fed.%20Appx.%20359\">\n    611 Fed.Appx. at 360-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   However, this Court disagrees with Defendants' interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Jones II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that undisputed evidence on these two factors alone requires summary judgment in favor of a defendant. Yet, to the extent that\n   <em>\n    Jones II\n   </em>\n   does hold as Defendants contend, it is of no moment. The Supreme Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Jones,\n   </em>\n   which is what governs this Court's decisions, clearly requires a trial court to review all of the relevant factors before making the determination as to whether a defendant violated Section 36(b).\n   <em>\n    Accord,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    N.

The Thomson Reuters Lipper (\"Lipper\") reports, one of the most commonly used sources to measure fees and performance in the mutual fund industry, show that overall the Funds performed better than, and the fees were in line with, other mutual funds of similar scope. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Paragraph B.3,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   ; Shlissel Decl. Ex. 4, Appendix C1 (Lipper Expense Data) and Appendix C2 (Lipper Performance Data). Plaintiffs do not and cannot deny this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Additionally, the Funds, through fee waivers, gave back millions of dollars of fees that they were entitled to receive pursuant to their contracts. Plaintiffs do not contend that fees were not remitted; rather, they contend that even though the Funds were not required to return any of the fees, the amounts remitted were not enough. Moreover, the fees and the performance of the Funds, and the amounts of fee waivers were all part of the information considered by the Board in its review and approval of the contracts, discussed at length below. And, as mentioned at note 10\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , per SEC regulation, this information is part of the factors that must be discussed by the Board as part of its process for selecting an investment advisor, and approving the advisory fee and any other amounts to be paid by the Fund under the contract. The Court examines all of this information in more detail below in its evaluation of the relevant factors indicative of whether Defendants violated Section 36(b) of the ICA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1.

Defendants' expert witness, Professor Stulz, explained that there are different risks in the different roles of adviser or subadviser:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   4. I concluded that JPMIM faces substantial risks in its role as adviser to the mutual funds at issue in the above-captioned actions. These risks, which can be categorized as liquidity risks,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   business risks, operational risks, pricing risks, litigation risks, regulatory risks, and reputational risks, all affect JPMIM's financial health, and\n   therefore must be accounted for when assessing the fees collected by JPMIM.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   5. Further, I concluded that the risks faced by JPMIM in its role as adviser differ in type and magnitude from those faced by JPMIM in its role as subadviser such that JPMIM faces greater risk as an adviser. Because a subadviser faces a different risk profile than an adviser, the fees collected in each role are not directly comparable. An analysis of the fees of an adviser or a subadviser would be incomplete without assessing the relevant risks faced by each.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   6. Advisers and subadvisers have different responsibilities. Because they have different responsibilities, they are exposed to different risks. As a subadviser, JPMIM is shielded from certain risks and is able to share costs associated with certain risks with a fund's adviser.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   7. The increased exposure to risk JPMIM faces as an adviser decreases its expected profitability for several reasons.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   8. First, JPMIM must set up and run the operational infrastructure required to manage these risks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   9. Second, when these risks materialize, the financial repercussions directly affect JPMIM's profitability and may have an impact on the profitability of other businesses of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   10. Third, because financial institutions have to hold more capital to support these risks, they incur an opportunity cost, as they are not able to deploy that capital elsewhere. Just like other financial institutions, as JPMIM is exposed to more risk, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. has to hold more capital-in part because regulators requires it to do so and in part because a company's value will decrease if it is financially fragile. For a given amount of allocated capital, JPMIM faces limitations in taking on additional risks because there is only so much risk that an institution can bear without endangering its financial stability. Therefore, the additional risk of taking on the adviser role may preclude JPMIM, or more generally, JPMorgan Asset Management, Holdings Inc., from starting valuable but risky projects.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   11. Fourth, a financial institution's risk exposures can lead to higher funding costs as its debt and equity may become riskier. If investors view a company as risky, they will require higher rates of return on their investments. Therefore, in order to attract investors, higher risk would lead to higher rates for debt financing and a higher required expected return for equity investors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   12. The fees collected by JPMIM in its role as adviser help compensate it for the costs involved in managing these risks on behalf of the fund and for bearing additional risks itself.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   13. Any comparison between the fees that JPMIM charges as an adviser and as a subadviser would be incomplete and unusable if it did not fully consider the substantial differences in risks borne by JPMIM when it acts as an adviser and when it acts as a subadviser.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   (Stulz Decl., ECF No. 117-5, at pp. 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Plaintiffs' expert witness, Professor Ayres, acknowledged that JPMIM assumed \"a variety of different risks\" in its two roles as adviser and subadviser, including risks identified by Professor Stulz.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   (David Decl., Ex. 24 (Ayres Tr.) at 87:23-88:16.) Further, Defendants have provided evidence that there are differences in the services provided to subadvised funds. As an example of some of the differences in services, Defendants assert that JPMIM provided substantially more compliance services in both \"scale\" and \"scope\" to the Funds, as compared to the Subadvised Funds.

In her expert report, Professor Stulz explained that some of the subadvisory agreements are explicit about the fact that the compliance obligations of the subadviser differ from those of the adviser. As an example, she notes that the Voya agreement has the following clause:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   The Subadviser and the Adviser acknowledge that the Subadviser is not the compliance agent for the Portfolio, and does not have access to all of the Company's books and records necessary to perform certain compliance testing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   (Stulz Decl., Ex. 1, Stulz Report, p. 21, \u00b6 71.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Additionally, Joseph Bertini, the former Chief Compliance Officer of the JPMorgan funds, testified at deposition that the Adviser provides more compliance services:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Q. Okay. Were the compliance services provided to the JP Morgan funds and to the sub-advised funds similar in scope?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   A. No ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   Q. Were the compliance services provided to the JP Morgan funds and the sub-advised funds similar in scale?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   Q. Were there compliance services provided to the JP Morgan funds that were not provided to the sub-advised funds?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   Q. With respect to a sub-advised fund, is there anyone other than JP Morgan Investment Management that has responsibility for providing compliance services to the sub-advised fund?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   A. The compliance group of the advis[e]r to the funds would also provide compliance services to those funds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   citing David Decl., ECF No. 117-4, Ex. 22 (Bertini Tr.) at 130:21-131:19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Defendants also provided testimony concerning differences in shareholder services provided by JPMIM depending on whether JPMIM's function was as adviser or subadviser. For example, Maria Connolly, the client portfolio manager for the Mid Cap Value Fund, explained the difference in client services:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   Q. Is that the portfolio manager who was involved in making the investments for a particular fund?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   Q. Or for a particular strategy, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   A. Yes, exactly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   Q. That strategy could be the strategy for JP proprietary funds or for subadvised funds, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   A. Yes. The cash situation for proprietary funds is a whole different animal. So, you know, yes, Jonathan is making investment decisions for both, but the process I just described would be for institutional accounts and subadvisory accounts, which I consider part of institutional. The funds, it's a whole different process, because obviously there is thousands and thousands of shareholders, and it's a very different process for managing the cash in those proprietary funds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   Q. How often do you or your team meet with investors of the J.P. Morgan funds?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   A. It depends on how you define \"investors.\" So if you are looking at all the meetings we have with investors of the funds, I mean, literally I have hundreds\n   of meetings every year with investors of the funds ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   Q. Do you or your team have any communication with shareholders of the subadvised Mid Cap Value Funds or the Value Advantage Fund?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   A. We don't.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   (David Decl., Ex.21 (Connolly Tr.) 48:3-49:9; 63:20-24; 74:10-75:9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Defendants further assert that a proper comparison of fees is not between what the Adviser charges the Funds versus what the Adviser charges other funds when it acts as a subadviser, because, in those instances, the subadviser's fee is just a part of the fee charged by that fund's adviser. As an example, Defendants cite Plaintiffs' Appendix 3, which lists the subadvisory fee for the Columbia VP-Partners Core Bond Fund as 0.12%. \"That rate is the subadvisory fee the fund's Sponsoring Adviser paid JPMIM, not the 0.44% advisory fee that the fund paid its Sponsoring Adviser in the fiscal year ending 2015.\" (\n   <em>\n    Def. Mem. Opp. Partial S.J.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 117, p. 5, n. 12.) Thus, Defendants assert that \"Plaintiffs have not presented any evidence about 'the investment advisory fees that JPMIM charges other, independent mutual funds,' but only evidence of what JPMIM charges the Sponsoring Advisers, which are not mutual funds but instead are institutional clients.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 5.) To illustrate their position that these fees are not comparable, Defendants provide charts showing the subadvisory fees paid to JPMIM by Sponsoring Advisers, in comparison to the fee the Sponsoring Adviser receives from its fund.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 113-1, Appendix E. For example, when serving as a subadviser for the Pacific Select Fund Value Advantage Portfolio, JPMIM receives 0.36% on all AUM, whereas the fund Advisor receives 0.66%.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12447672,3581983\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/335/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Consequently, Defendants conclude that Advisers are paid higher fees than subadvisers, because their roles are not the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Giving the above comparisons the weight they merit as\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   requires, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have not \"show[n] that the fees [charged by JPMIM] are beyond the range of arm's-length bargaining.\"\n   <em>\n    Jones,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12447672,3581983\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/335/\">\n    559 U.S. at 350, &amp; n.8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12447672,3581983\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/335/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , citing 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-35(b)(1).

Mot. S.J.,\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 113, p. 19.) In their Complaints, Plaintiffs allege that three entities, JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. (an affiliate of the Adviser and Administrator), State Street Bank &amp; Trust Co., and U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC (collectively, \"comparison entities\") provided administration services to mutual funds for lower fees than the Funds paid.

Mot. S.J.,\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 113, p. 21.)

(\n   <em>\n    Pl. Mem. in Opp\n   </em>\n   ., ECF No. 118 p. 27, n. 64-66) (citing Boyle Aff. and Exs.). Plaintiffs also assert that the Administrator charged the Funds a disproportionately large fee \"because the services of the Administrator provided 'overlap[ped]' with services provided by other service providers to the Funds, so that the Funds paid 'duplicative fees.' \" (Goodman Compl. \u00b6 151; Campbell Compl. \u00b6 153.) The allegation of \"overlapping\" services is addressed by Brian Shlissel, Head of U.S. Funds Platform Management and President of JP Morgan Funds in his declaration:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   13.

Again, the actual services provided are different. The Administrator oversees and coordinates the creation of prospectuses and shareholder reports, while the Transfer Agent has responsibility for delivery of certain communications, including prospectuses and shareholder reports. The Administrator oversees the preparation of Blue Sky filings with state authorities; the Transfer Agent provides certain data in connection with those filings. In addition, the Administrator has contracted with BFDS, at the Administrator's expense, to provide additional services related to Blue Sky filings.

These reports compared each Fund's performance and \"management fees\" (which are the sum of the Fund's advisory and administration fees) to a universe of similar funds.

What matters is whether, in light of all of the pertinent factors as identified by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Jones,\n   </em>\n   there is such a disconnect between what the Funds were paid, and what the services were worth, that the fees could not have been the product of arm's length negotiations.

JPMIM's motion is joined by two non-parties, SEI Investments Management Corporation (\"SEI\") (ECF No. 130), and SunAmerica Asset Management, LLC (\"SunAmerica\") (ECF No. 131) (the \"non-parties\"), who, under protective order and having designated the information as Confidential, complied with Plaintiffs' subpoenas to provide confidential, nonpublic fee information. The non-parties specifically request redactions to fee schedules that are part of the submissions attached to Wilson Decl., Ex. 25, 30, and 31. SEI seeks to redact the fee schedules located in Schedule B to Wilson Decl., Ex. 30 (SIMCJPMIM00000015; SIMCJPMIM-00000004) and Schedule B to Wilson Decl., Ex. 31 (S1MCJPMIM00000044; SIMC-JPMIM00000017). SunAmerica seeks to redact the fee schedules located in Schedule A to Wilson Decl., Ex. 25 (SAAM_0001862) and in Amendment No. 6 to Wilson Decl., Ex. 25 (SAAM_0001843; SAAM_00018423). The nonparties have provided extensive justification for redacting this confidential information. Furthermore, the nonparties have been granted exemptions from the Securities and Exchange Commission such that the fees at issue are filed publically as part of an aggregate number only, and have operated under this exemption for years. (Buser Decl., ECF No. 130-1; Bressler Decl., ECF No. 131-1.) This Court finds that the materials are confidential and proprietary. The documents are ordered to remain under seal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   JPMIM seeks to seal 47 documents and redact 28 others. All but 4 of the documents that JPMIM seeks to seal or redact were filed by Plaintiffs, who oppose the motion (ECF No. 128.) Defendants assert that this motion has become necessary in the course of this litigation:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-184\">\n   In fact, it is Plaintiffs' failure to observe the local rules of this Court that now requires JPMIM to seek to either seal or redact many of the documents that are the subject of its Motion to Seal. Under Local Civil Rule 7.2(e), \"[e]vidence submitted, including discovery documents, shall be limited to that necessary for decision and shall include only essential portions of transcripts or exhibits referenced in the memorandum.\" Plaintiffs ignored this Local Civil Rule, filing voluminous exhibits in their entirety instead of excerpting only the \"essential portions.\" Plaintiffs should not be allowed to abuse the litigation process and harm JPMIM and third parties by injecting their public court filings with highly confidential and irrelevant information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Reply Memorandum of Law in Further Support of Motion to Seal,\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 129, at p. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   Defendants further assert that the sealed or redacted documents represent a small number of the many documents associated with the dispositive motions, that those documents contain the nonpublic, confidential information of JPMIM (or its employees, affiliates, or experts), the J.P. Morgan Funds, or the J.P. Morgan Funds' service providers, and that public disclosure of this information would result in competitive harm, by disclosing information that a competitor could use to gain an unfair advantage, or another type of harm. JPMIM asserts that it has requested the narrowest possible seal necessary to prevent the substantial risk of harm from materializing. In proposing that certain materials be sealed or redacted, JPMIM asserts that it has been careful to ensure that the substance of the parties' arguments would be available to the public. The Court has thoroughly reviewed the documents in Appendix 1 and the supporting affidavits, and finds that the types of information that JPMIM seeks to protect fall into 7 categories: (1) confidential\n   profitability information, (2) confidential information regarding subadvisory business relationships, (3) confidential compliance information, (4) confidential business strategy information provided to the Board of Trustees/Directors of the J.P.

As mentioned above, open-end mutual funds (such as the At-Issue Funds) have to redeem shares daily for investors who want to redeem. If a day's inflows do not cover that day's outflows, the fund risks having to sell securities or otherwise adjust the portfolio to honor the redemption requests. To help manage this risk, advisers, on behalf of funds, hold some assets in cash and/or highly liquid assets, maintain contingent sources of cash in the form of lines of credit, and/or have the ability to borrow from other funds in a complex. Liquidity risk also forces advisers to pay more attention to the liquidity of the fund's assets and to monitor inflows and outflows more closely than would typically be the case for the subadviser of a non-retail fund.
