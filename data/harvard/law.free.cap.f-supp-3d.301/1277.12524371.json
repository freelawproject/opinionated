BACKGROUND\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Amin bought a Class Vehicle in November, 2012. (Compl., Doc. 1 \u00b6 14.) He \"first experienced a noxious odor caused by the HVAC System in approximately January of 2014.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) Plaintiff Patel bought a Class Vehicle in January, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) He \"first experienced a noxious, pungent, sour, musty odor caused by the HVAC System in approximately March or April 2015.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that \"because of the HVAC System Defect, the HVAC Systems in the Class Vehicles are predisposed to produce a moldy odor under normal use conditions that would not cause non-defective HVAC systems to produce a moldy odor ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61.) More specifically, Plaintiffs allege that the design of the HVAC System is such that moisture does not evaporate properly from the system via the evaporator. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.) Because the moisture does not evaporate, \"[t]he residual moisture provides a haven for the growth of mold and mildew as spores enter the system through outside vents.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs allege that several mold species are present in the vehicle because of the defect. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65.) These species are \"known to secrete mycotoxins ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   According to Plaintiffs, the defect in the HVAC Systems of the Class Vehicles is one of design, such that even with regular treatment, the mold and accompanying odor will continue to reappear. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 77-79, 82-83.) The near-certain reoccurrence of the condensation, mold, and foul odor requires that Plaintiffs and other putative class members undergo periodic, \"costly maintenance\" to temporarily ameliorate the effects of the defect. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17, 27, 118, 119e.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Mercedes knew about the defect before selling the Class Vehicles. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 72-102.) They offer several different reasons that Mercedes knew or should have known about the defect, including (1) a consumer arbitration panel decision in 2008 regarding the same alleged defect; (2) Mercedes' own technical bulletins discussing the defect as early as 2007; (3) Mercedes' own system repair data from the owners of Class Vehicles; (4) a correspondingly large number of replacement parts ordered to address the problem; (5) complaints made directly to Mercedes from putative class members; (6) complaints about the defect collected by NHTSA's Office of Defect Investigations; and (7) public complaints made by consumers in online forums. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs further allege that Mercedes \"knowingly manufactured and sold the Class Vehicles with the HVAC System Defect, while willfully concealing the true inferior quality and sub-standard performance of the Class Vehicles' HVAC Systems.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 107.) Mercedes knew of the defect in the Class Vehicles and failed to notify putative class members and other potential purchasers before they made a purchase. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 110.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In particular, Mercedes advertised the HVAC Systems in the Class Vehicles as having HVAC Systems that clean air in the cabin (i.e., filtering \" 'dust and pollen as small as 0.0002' from the air\") and providing \"individualized comfort in any season.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 112.) Mercedes also stated in advertising that Certified Pre-Owned (CPO) vehicles have received a rigorous inspection which extends to the HVAC Systems. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 114.) Mercedes further advertised that before a CPO vehicle is sold, \" '[a]ny deficiencies' \" to its HVAC System are \" 'repaired, replaced or reconditioned.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Mercedes \"actively concealed\" the defect in a number of ways. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 119.) Mercedes \"forced Class Members to bear the cost of temporary measures to address the moldy smells,\" but also reduced the price for vocal complainants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 119e.) When consumers brought their Class Vehicles in for service due to the defect, Mercedes treated the car with \"temporary measures ... while leaving the HVAC Systems as they were.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 119f.) In this way, the HVAC Systems were \"never permanently corrected\" and thus, Mercedes did \"not prevent the recurrence\" of the formation of mold. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 119f-g.) Rather than disclose the defect when confronted by complaints of the smell, Mercedes blamed the putative class members for the smells. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 122C.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs \"previously filed a class action complaint in the Central District of California on May 9, 2016\" in which they made substantially similar allegations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 128.)\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manan Bhatt, et al. v. Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:16-cv-03171-TJH-RAO (C.D Cal.). Plaintiffs were dismissed without prejudice for misjoinder on March 9, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   They filed their Complaint in this action in May 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl.) Plaintiffs assert the following claims in the Complaint: (1) breach of express warranty; (2) breach of express warranty under the Magnuson-Moss Act; (3) breach of implied warranty; (4) breach of implied warranty under the Magnuson-Moss Act; (5) violations of the Georgia Fair Business Practices Act,\n   O.C.G.A. \u00a7 10-1-390,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; (6) violations of Georgia's Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act, O.C.G.A. \u00a7 10-1-370,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; (7) breach of implied warranty of merchatability, O.C.G.A. \u00a7 11-2-314 ; (8) fraud by concealment; and (9) unjust enrichment. (Compl., Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 141-254.) Thereafter, Mercedes moved to dismiss all claims. (Motion to Dismiss, Doc. 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In this case, the provision limiting the warranty appears earlier in the warranty than the latter, broader provisions. (Warranty at 14, 19.) The limitation also appears to encapsulate more of the 'dominant purpose' of the contract. For example, Mercedes refers to the warranty as the \"New Vehicle Limited Warranty.\" (Warranty at 5.) (\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11) (\"limited warranty\").

(Doc. 17-1 at 14). As Mercedes points out, Plaintiff Amin thus did not file suit until \"more than six months after the expiration of the four-year limitations period.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs argue that the claim is timely under Georgia's renewal statute, O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-2-61(a), since Plaintiff Amin refiled \"within six months of the California court's dismissal.\" (Doc. 18 at 15.) Plaintiffs make two alternative arguments: (1) that even if the renewal statute does not apply, the statute of limitations was tolled while Amin's claims were pending in the California court; and (2) that the Court should apply the doctrine of equitable tolling to Amin's claims in light of the California filing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16.) In its Reply, Mercedes correctly points out that the renewal statute cited by Plaintiffs is inapplicable in this case because it specifically does \"not apply to contracts for the sale of goods covered by Article 2 of Title 11.\" O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-2-61(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   However, the Court does not need to address either of Plaintiffs' alternative arguments, because the plain language of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 11-2-725 is dispositive. Subsection (3) of that provision reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   [w]here an action commenced within the time limited by subsection (1) of [ O.C.G.A. \u00a7 11-2-725 ] is so terminated as to leave available a remedy by another action for the same breach such other action may be commenced after the expiration of the time limited and within six months after the termination of the first action unless the termination resulted from voluntary discontinuance or from dismissal for failure or neglect to prosecute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   O.C.G.A. \u00a7 11-2-725(3). Plaintiffs' previous action in California plainly falls under this provision, and Plaintiff timely filed after dismissal. The Court need not address equitable tolling in light of such clear authority.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The language of this subsection renders Plaintiff Amin's claim for breach of implied warranty timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs have plausibly stated a claim for breach of implied warranty.

Further, Plaintiffs allege that \"Mercedes went on to say that the water that accumulates is what ultimately leads to the moldy odor\" and that \"[u]nder questioning from the Arbitration Board, Mercedes admitted that as long as the consumer keeps the car, she's going to have to keep getting Mercedes's temporary 'fix', which one Board member called 'a band-aid.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 75-76.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege that Mercedes issued several Technical Service Bulletins addressing the alleged defect as far back as 2007. (Compl., Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 80-84.) One of these Bulletins allegedly stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   A moldy (foul) odor can typically occur for a short time after engine start in all vehicles with air conditioning, is a technically inherent effect which likewise cannot be eliminated by cleaning the evaporator.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83.)

Plaintiffs argue that they have alleged harm that is both ongoing and will likely occur in the future. (Doc. 18 at 30-31.)

This is because Plaintiffs have alleged that when they brought their vehicles to Mercedes for service related to the defect, Mercedes represented that the Class Vehicles were defect-free and possessed a certain quality with respect to the HVAC Systems-namely, the quality of being free from the specific defect alleged.

(\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl., Doc. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 75, 84, 118, 127.) Thus, as stated above, Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that Mercedes concealed an intrinsic quality of the Class Vehicles that Plaintiffs and consumers generally could not have discovered in the exercise of reasonable care. In light of these allegations, the particular circumstances of this case support a finding that Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged justifiable reliance. Under these circumstances, Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that Mercedes had an obligation under Georgia law to disclose the defective HVAC system and failed to do so. Accordingly, Plaintiffs have stated a claim for fraudulent concealment and Mercedes' Motion to Dismiss this claim is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    h. Plaintiffs' Alternative Claim for Unjust Enrichment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Mercedes argues that \"Plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claims are precluded by their allegations of an express warranty that covers the alleged defect.\" (Doc. 17-1 at 22.) However, Plaintiffs' claim for breach of express warranty has been dismissed. To the extent that Mercedes applies this same argument to Plaintiffs' claims for breach of implied warranty, that argument fails since Plaintiffs' claim for unjust enrichment was pled in the alternative. \"While a party, indeed, cannot\n   <em>\n    recover\n   </em>\n   under both a breach of contract and unjust enrichment theory, a plaintiff may plead these claims in the alternative.\"\n   <em>\n    Clark v. Aaron's, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4296774\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/914/1301/#p1309\">\n    914 F.Supp.2d 1301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1309 (N.D. Ga. 2012) (emphasis in original);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Techjet Innovations Corp. v.

Ga. 2016). This is the sole ground upon which Mercedes moves to dismiss the unjust enrichment claim and the Court finds that it lacks merit. Thus, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Mercedes' Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' claim for unjust enrichment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Plaintiffs' Claims for Injunctive Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Mercedes challenges Plaintiffs' prayer for injunctive relief. (Doc. 17-1 at 31.) While some courts have entertained injunctive relief at the motion to dismiss stage,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Buske\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201062371\">\n    2017 WL 1062371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3, this Court declines to do so. Plaintiffs may later prove that they are entitled to injunctive relief, or they may not, but they will not be stripped of the opportunity to do so before the Court has the opportunity to weigh equitable relief factors upon a fuller evidentiary record. Therefore, Mercedes' motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' prayer for injunctive relief is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Mercedes' Motion to Dismiss [Doc. 17] is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   in part and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   in part. Mercedes' Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to (a) Plaintiffs' claims for breach of express warranty, (b) Magnuson-Moss breach of express warranty, (c) violation of GUDTPA regarding Mercedes' marketing and advertising. Mercedes' Motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   as to all other claims. The parties are\n   <strong>\n    DIRECTED\n   </strong>\n   to confer and develop a scheduling order that addresses the time frames for fact and expert discovery as well as timing of Plaintiffs' class certification motion and briefing. The parties shall also address in their submission the extent to which discovery information and testimony gleaned in the parallel California action against Mercedes Benz,\n   <em>\n    Manan Bhatt et al. v. Mercedes-Benz USA LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 2:16-cv-03171 (C.D. Cal. 2017), may be relied upon in this case so as to avoid redundancy and time delays. The parties shall file their proposed scheduling order within 15 days of the entry of this Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   this 13th day of March, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    According to the Complaint,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n    [t]he vehicles at issue in this action include the 2004-2012 Mercedes A-Class, 2001-2017 Mercedes C-Class, 2000-2014 Mercedes CL-Class, 2013-2017 Mercedes CLA-Class, 2003-2009 Mercedes CLK-Class, 2004-2017 Mercedes CLS-Class, 2003-2016 Mercedes E-Class, 2007-2017 Mercedes GLClass, 2010-2016 Mercedes GLK-Class, 2006-2016 Mercedes M-Class, 2017 Mercedes GLE-Class, 2006-2015 Mercedes R-Class, 1999-2017 Mercedes SClass, 2003-2012 Mercedes SL-Class, 2004-2016 Mercedes SLK-Class, and 2002-2013 Maybach 57 and 62.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    (Compl., Doc. 1 \u00b6 2.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    Although two defendants are named in this action, Mercedes has filed this Motion alone.
