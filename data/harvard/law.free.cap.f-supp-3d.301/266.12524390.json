Gorton, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this civil enforcement action, the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\" or \"the Commission\") alleges that TelexFree, Inc. and TelexFree, LLC (collectively, \"TelexFree\") and eight individual defendants operated and promoted an illegal pyramid and Ponzi scheme, raising more than $300 million through a fraudulent and unregistered offering of securities since at least November, 2012. TelexFree allegedly received more than $340 million from hundreds of thousands of investors and promised to pay those investors more than $1.1 billion, even though the company's retail product generated only $1.3 million in sales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The SEC alleges that Faith R. Sloan (\"Sloan\") and Santiago De La Rosa (\"De La Rosa\") violated federal securities laws by acting as \"promoters\" for TelexFree and that they 1) violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5 thereunder,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .10b-5 ; 2) violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q(a) ; and 3) violated Section 5(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77e(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Pending before the Court are separate motions to dismiss of both defendants. For the following reasons, those motions will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The SEC alleges that the entire TelexFree enterprise was an elaborate \"Ponzi/pyramid scheme\". According to the SEC, the scheme worked as follows: TelexFree promised investors in its \"AdCentral\" program that it would make weekly payments to investors generating an annual return of over 200%. Investors were required to post ads for TelexFree's voice over internet (\"VoIP\") service but those ads \"were essentially meaningless\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Investors were encouraged to recruit new investors and TelexFree offered commissions for sales of its VoIP service. When an investor purchased the VoIP service, TelexFree debited the balance in that investor's internal account. Accordingly, such sales generated no revenue for the\n   company. TelexFree received over $340 million from investors and \"effectively promised to pay more than $1.1 billion to [them].\" Because sales of the VoIP service generated only $1.3 million in retail sales revenue, however, that promise was illusory. Instead, TelexFree paid early investors with the moneys contributed by later investors. In April, 2014, TelexFree filed for bankruptcy, claiming $600 million in liabilities and approximately $100 million in assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In April, 2014, the SEC filed a sealed complaint in the instant case. The following month, the SEC amended the complaint to include significantly more factual allegations relating to the alleged Ponzi scheme. Alongside TelexFree, the SEC named four TelexFree \"principals\" in this suit as individual defendants. Among them were James M. Merrill, the co-owner of both TelexFree entities and the president of TelexFree, Inc. and Carlos N. Wanzeler, co-owner of both TelexFree entities and the treasurer of TelexFree, Inc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The SEC also named four \"promoters\" of the TelexFree business model in the suit, including Sloan and De La Rosa. The Commission alleges that Sloan \"was a prominent promoter of TelexFree,\" who operated websites touting TelexFree and appeared in promotional videos that were posted on YouTube. De La Rosa is also described as a \"prominent promoter of TelexFree\" who provided the voiceover for multiple videos posted on YouTube and appeared onstage at a TelexFree event in Boston.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \"state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl.

Plaintiff responds that it has met the heightened pleading requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   When pleading an action that sounds in fraud, a plaintiff \"must state with particularity the circumstances constituting\" the fraud. Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). Particularity requires alleging the \"time, place, and content of the alleged misrepresentation with specificity.\"\n   <em>\n    SEC v. Tambone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4219678\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/597/436/#p442\">\n    597 F.3d 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 442 (1st Cir. 2010) (\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   ) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Greebel v.

Here, plaintiff has met that burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff, in its second amended complaint, identifies specific statements that Sloan allegedly made to investors and provides the substance and dates of those statements. Thus, plaintiff alleges fraud with specificity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Sloan's argument that her statements were neither manipulative nor deceptive is unavailing. At the motion to dismiss stage, this Court accepts all plausibly alleged facts as true. The SEC has plausibly alleged that Sloan omitted material facts about TelexFree being a Ponzi and pyramid scheme. Accordingly, plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that her statements were manipulative or deceptive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Sloan avers that plaintiff has failed to allege\n   <em>\n    scienter\n   </em>\n   . To prove\n   <em>\n    scienter\n   </em>\n   under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and its accompanying Rule 10b-5 as well as Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act, a party must demonstrate \"a showing of either conscious intent to defraud or a high degree of recklessness.\"\n   <em>\n    SEC v.

Plaintiff has plausibly alleged that Sloan possessed material knowledge of TelexFree's business model with respect to revenue from AdCentral and retail sales. Drawing all reasonable inferences in the nonmovant's favor, the SEC has plausibly alleged that Sloan was at least reckless in not becoming aware that TelexFree was a Ponzi and pyramid scheme. This logic applies\n   <em>\n    a fortiori\n   </em>\n   to the SEC's claims under Section 17(a)(2) and 17(a)(3) which require only a showing of negligence.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3894556\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/546/45/#p47\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Sloan does not move to dismiss the second amended complaint's third claim alleging violations of Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77e(a), (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Accordingly, Sloan's motion to dismiss will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Motion to dismiss of Santiago De La Rosa\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   De La Rosa contends that the SEC fails to allege that he made any untrue or misleading statement of material fact. As explained above, however, material omissions of fact may render a statement fraudulent.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SEC v. Druffner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9036232\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/353/141/#p148\">\n    353 F.Supp.2d 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 148 (D. Mass. 2005). Plaintiff has plausibly alleged that De La Rosa knew that TelexFree was a Ponzi and pyramid schemed and that his omission of that fact from his statements violated the securities laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Second, De La Rosa submits that the SEC has failed to allege\n   <em>\n    scienter\n   </em>\n   . Among other facts, plaintiff alleged that 1) De La Rosa had access to back office information concerning sales and revenue, 2) investors would be paid merely for posting internet ads, 3) investors would receive an outsized return on investment and 4) De La Rosa received more than $2 million from investors. Taking all of plaintiff's plausible allegations as true, and drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor, plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that De La Rosa acted at least recklessly by not disclosing that TelexFree was a Ponzi and pyramid scheme.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SEC v. Better Life Club of Am., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"208422\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/995/167/#p178\">\n    995 F.Supp. 167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 178 (D.D.C. 1998),\n   <em>\n    aff'd\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=203%20F.3d%2054\">\n    203 F.3d 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. Cir. 1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Finally, as to Count III of the second amended complaint, De La Rosa argues that plaintiff has failed to allege that he sold or offered unregistered securities. A\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case for violations of Section 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act requires a plaintiff to allege that (1) no registration statement was in effect as to the securities, (2) the defendant directly or indirectly offered to sell or sold the securities, and (3) the offer or sale was made in connection with the use of interstate transportation, communication or the mails.\n   <em>\n    SEC v.

Mass. 2017) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Here, TelexFree's agreements with investors with respect to the AdCentral scheme were \"investment contracts\" and thus unregistered \"securities\".\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SEC v.
