(Docket Nos. 97 and 98.) For the reasons set forth below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Tirado's motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 7, 2017, a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging Tirado with count one, \"conspiracy to manufacture, distribute or dispense or possess with intent to distribute or dispense a controlled substance,\" and count three, \"possession with intent to dispense a controlled substance outside the scope of professional practice and not for a legitimate medical purpose.\" (Docket No. 3 at pp. 1 &amp; 7.) According to the indictment, \"[b]eginning on a date unknown, but no later than in or about the year 2009, and continuing up to and until the return of the indictment,\" Tirado knowingly conspired to dispense \"at least 70,000 units of Oxycodone\" and \"at least 40,000 units of Alprazolam\" \"outside the scope of professional practice and not for a legitimate medical purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 1-2. The indictment alleges that Tirado also possessed the Oxycodone and Alprazolam with the intent to dispense them \"outside the scope of professional practice and not for a legitimate medical purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Tirado seeks dismissal of these counts because, he argues, the indictment \"fail[s] to inform sufficiently [sic] to prepare a defense and protect against Double Jeopardy\" and count three \"violates the statute of limitations.\" (Docket No. 97 at pp. 3 and 6.) Tirado asserts that the counts are \"supported by conclusory language, without providing an ever-important statement of facts and circumstances to inform Dr. Tirado of the specific offense with which he is charged.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 5. He maintains that the indictment is insufficient because it fails to \"mention which patients are involved, or the number of patients,\" and does not include \"the dates when the controlled substances were allegedly prescribed or dispense [sic].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Tirado also contends that the statute of limitations\n   governing count three \"prescribes a period of limitation of five years,\" and that the conduct in the indictment covers a time span of \"roughly nine years.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 6. He argues that \"the offense in question here is not a continuous offense\" and thus is time-barred.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In a separate motion, Tirado requests that the Court require the United States to submit a bill of particulars \"so that [Tirado] may adequately prepare for trial, minimize surprise at trial, and enjoy the protections of the double jeopardy clause.\" (Docket No. 98 at p. 1.) Tirado supports this motion with arguments similar to those made in his motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 2-5. The Court rejects Tirado's arguments supporting both motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. MOTION TO DISMISS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   An indictment \"must be a plain, concise, and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged.\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 7. When considering a motion to dismiss an indictment, the Court \"must take the allegations in the indictment as true\" and must be mindful that \"the question is not whether the government has presented enough evidence to support the charge, but solely whether the allegations in the indictment are sufficient to apprise the defendant of the charged offense.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

A bill of particulars, however, is not a proper vehicle for Tirado to obtain detailed disclosure of the government's preparations for trial or witness lists.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez-Torres\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4025315\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/560/108/#p111\">\n    560 F.Supp.2d at 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   To prevail on a motion for a bill of particulars, \"[a] defendant must show actual prejudice and point to specific evidence or witnesses that the lack of particularization prevented him from obtaining.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Nelson-Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9328084\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/319/12/#p31\">\n    319 F.3d 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 31 (1st Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sepulveda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1527601\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/15/1161/#p1192\">\n    15 F.3d at 1193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Neither appellant convincingly relates a concrete instance of inability to prepare, untenable surprise, or other cognizable prejudice stemming from the trial court's refusal to\n   mandate further particulars.\"). Tirado fails to provide a concrete example of actual prejudice resulting from the alleged lack of specificity in the indictment and the government's discovery. Indeed, Tirado's access to thorough discovery undermines his case for a bill of particulars.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Urban\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9015298\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/404/754/#p772\">\n    404 F.3d 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 772 (3d Cir. 2005) (finding that the appellants' access to discovery \"further weakens the case for a bill of particulars\") (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Tirado's motion for a bill of particulars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Tirado's motion to dismiss counts one and three (Docket No. 97) and Tirado's motion for a bill of particulars (Docket No. 98) are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    In the government's discussion of continuing offenses, the United States relies heavily on\n    <em>\n     Yashar\n    </em>\n    , often using identical language, without citing the case.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Docket No. 133 at pp. 4-5.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    According to the government, the files that they provided to Tirado are categorized by controlled substance and the year dispensed for greater accessibility.
