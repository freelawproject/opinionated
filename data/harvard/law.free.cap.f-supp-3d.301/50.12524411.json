BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n  Once more into the breach over the Dakota Access Pipeline goes this Court, though for the first time addressing claims of the Yankton Sioux Tribe and Robert Flying Hawk, the Chairman of the Tribe's Business and Claims Committee. While the Plaintiffs may have changed, the underlying claims are quite familiar. As with the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux Tribes before them, the Yankton Sioux challenge the construction and operation of the Dakota Access Pipeline under the National Historic Preservation Act, the National Environmental Protection Act, and the 1851 Treaty of Laramie. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that Defendants-the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and an assortment of federal employees of both agencies-violated the NHPA by failing to adequately consult with the Tribe regarding historical and cultural sites, violated NEPA by unlawfully segmenting their analyses of the pipeline's environmental impacts, and violated the 1851 Treaty by granting approvals for DAPL without first obtaining the Tribe's consent.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-11\">\n  Both sides have now filed Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment on the Tribe's NEPA and Treaty-based claims. Defendants additionally urge the Court to dismiss as moot Plaintiffs' NHPA counts, asserting that they are no longer viable in light of DAPL's completed construction. Agreeing that it can provide no effective remedy on this last score, the Court will dismiss the NHPA claims. It will also grant summary judgment for Defendants with respect to Plaintiffs' Treaty-based count, which the Tribe essentially withdrew during briefing. Finally, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have not shown that the Corps and FWS improperly \"segmented\" their analysis of the pipeline's environmental consequences, thus yielding summary judgment for Defendants on the NEPA claims as well.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Factual and Statutory Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The lengthy factual history of the Dakota Access Pipeline, a 1,200-mile domestic-oil pipeline running from North Dakota to Illinois, is set forth in this Court's prior Opinions and need not be repeated here.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Standing Rock I)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=205%20F.%20Supp.%203d%204\">\n    205 F.Supp.3d 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 12-15 (D.D.C. 2016). The Court will, however, provide a brief background of this Tribe's participation in DAPL's development and an overview of the specific federal actions related to the pipeline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A federally recognized Tribe that is headquartered in Wagner, South Dakota, the Yankton Sioux have approximately 9,000 enrolled members.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 292 (Yankton MSJ) at 3. Their Reservation is located in South Dakota, hundreds of miles from the much-contested Lake Oahe crossing and at least 60 miles from any other part of DAPL's path.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 321 at 5 (Map 2). The Tribe nonetheless opposes the construction and routing of the pipeline, alleging that it will harm a number of its environmental interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Since the pipeline project was proposed, Plaintiffs insist that they have \"continually sought to protect\" their tribal lands from the \"serious risk of harm\" it poses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Yankton MSJ at 4. This assertion is somewhat belied, however, by the record regarding the Tribe's cooperation (or lack thereof) with the federal agencies involved in the project. The Yankton did not attend multiple meetings held by the Corps and FWS to discuss DAPL (meetings that were attended by other interested tribes),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Exhs. I (January 25, 2016, Corps Meeting Log), J (December 8, 2015, Corps Meeting Log), V (List of Invitees to FWS Meetings), W (FWS Meeting Log), nor did they respond to numerous efforts by the Corps and FWS to engage in discussion regarding the pipeline.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhs. N (Letter from Col. Henderson, May 10, 2016), O (Letter from Col. Henderson, May 6, 2016), P (Email Chain Discussing Corps' Attempts to Contact Yankton, May 2, 2016), Q (Email Chain Discussing Consultation, April 15-22, 2016), T (Letter from FWS to Chairman Flying Hawk), U (Letter from FWS to Tribal Officer Little). Regardless of the Tribe's level of participation in the consultation process, however, the Yankton have since objected to the pipeline's construction and routing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In particular, Plaintiffs contest the process by which the Corps and FWS issued a series of permits and permissions necessary for the pipeline to cross federally regulated lands and waters. Although DAPL runs almost entirely across private property, 3% of the pipeline is on federally managed land and thus required governmental approval.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Standing Rock I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=205%20F.%20Supp.%203d%204\">\n    205 F.Supp.3d at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The permits needed for these portions of the pipeline were issued by four separate entities-three districts of the Corps and one district of FWS. In evaluating these permissions, each agency division conducted an environmental assessment under the National Environmental Protection Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   NEPA requires that federal agencies evaluate the environmental effects of major government actions, but it \"imposes only procedural requirements.\"\n   <em>\n    Dep't of Transp. v. Public Citizen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5923753\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/752/#p756\">\n    541 U.S. 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 756,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5923753\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/752/#p756\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5923753\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/752/#p756\">\n    159 L.Ed.2d 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). If a project will \"significantly\" affect the \"quality of the human environment,\" NEPA requires that the agency complete a detailed Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204332\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C). To determine whether or not there will be such significant effects, however, the agency first prepares a shorter Environmental Analysis (EA). This \"concise public document\" discusses the need for the proposal, the alternatives, the environmental impacts of the proposed action, and the agencies and persons consulted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201508.9\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (b). If the EA concludes that there will be no significant environmental impact, the agency may forgo completing a full EIS and may instead issue the EA and a Finding of No Significance (FONSI).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   This was the route chosen by the federal agencies charged with evaluating the DAPL-related permissions. In July 2016, the Corps' Omaha District issued an EA and FONSI related to the crossings of Corps-managed lands and flowage easements at Lake Oahe and Lake Sakakawea\n   in North Dakota.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exh. A (Omaha District EA and FONSI). In August of that year, the Corps' St. Louis District issued its own EA and FONSI, which addressed four crossings in Illinois, three of which spanned less than 700 feet, and one of which crossed a federal flowage easement for approximately 2.5 miles.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exh. B (St. Louis District EA and FONSI). The Corps' Rock Island District also issued a permission under Section 408 of the Rivers and Harbors Act for a crossing of the Mississippi River, after the district determined that the proposal qualified for a categorical exclusion under NEPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exh. C (Rock Island District Memorandum). Finally, the FWS issued an EA in May 2016 and a FONSI in June of that year, and it granted Dakota Access permission to cross five wetland easements and one grassland easement in North Dakota.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhs. D (FWS EA), E (FWS FONSI). These easements, which were over 60 miles from the water crossings evaluated by the Corps, affected 71.8 acres of the pipeline route, or less than 1% of the total North Dakota and South Dakota project area.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FWS EA at 18. In total, therefore, the federal agencies issued three EAs and complementary FONSIs and one categorical exclusion, each of which in turn facilitated the various permissions and permits needed for DAPL to cross federally managed lands. It is these NEPA analyses, and the process by which they were conducted, to which Plaintiffs now object.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    History of DAPL Litigation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Yankton Sioux Tribe initiated the instant suit on September 9, 2016, when it filed a Complaint against the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and four individual Defendants-Dan Ashe, Director of FWS; John W. Henderson, Commander of the Corps' Omaha District; Anthony Mitchell, Commander of the Corps' St. Louis District; and Todd Semonite, the Corps' Commanding General and Chief of Engineers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Case No. 16-1796, ECF No. 1 (Yankton Sioux Compl.). In February 2017, Defendant Dakota Access moved to intervene in support of federal Defendants, a motion that was not opposed by the Tribe and was subsequently granted by the Court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201508.9\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201508.9\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ECF No. 17 (Dakota Access Motion to Intervene); Minute Order of March 13, 2017 (Granting Motion to Intervene as Unopposed). That March, upon an unopposed motion by the Corps, the Tribe's case was consolidated with challenges to DAPL filed by the Standing Rock, Cheyenne River, and Oglala Sioux Tribes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minute Order of March 17 (Consolidation Order).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   For the past fourteen months, others among the consolidated Plaintiffs have made multiple attempts to prevent oil from flowing through the pipeline. Indeed, this Court has now issued five Opinions in this case-all addressing various claims by the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux Tribes. These Tribes' first pass at preventing pipeline construction was a motion for a preliminary injunction based solely on the NHPA, asserting that the ongoing clearing and grading of the land along DAPL's route disrupted sacred tribal sites.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Standing Rock I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=205%20F.%20Supp.%203d%204\">\n    205 F.Supp.3d at 7-9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On September 9, 2016, the Court denied emergency relief, and construction proceeded.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=205%20F.%20Supp.%203d%204\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=205%20F.%20Supp.%203d%204\">\n    at 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On February 8, 2017, the Corps granted Dakota Access an easement pursuant to the Mineral Leasing Act, authorizing it to cross federal lands at Lake Oahe and complete the pipeline.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 172-11 (Easement). The next day, Cheyenne River filed another motion for preliminary injunction and an application for a temporary\n   restraining order, this time alleging violations of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 98, 99;\n   <em>\n    Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Standing Rock II)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267693\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/239/77/#p81\">\n    239 F.Supp.3d 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 81 (D.D.C. 2017),\n   <em>\n    appeal dismissed\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-5043,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204071136\">\n    2017 WL 4071136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. Cir. May 15, 2017). Believing these religious-freedom claims unlikely to succeed, the Court issued an Opinion denying this preliminary injunction as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Standing Rock II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267693\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/239/77/#p81\">\n    239 F.Supp.3d at 80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As these emergency motions were ongoing, Standing Rock and Cheyenne River filed cross-motions for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 117 (SRST MSJ), 131 (CRST MSJ), 172 (Corps MSJ), 185 (DA MSJ). Now focusing on their environmental claims, the Tribes challenged the Corps' decision to issue the easement on the basis of its July 25, 2016, EA and FONSI, contending that the agency had violated NEPA by failing to complete a full EIS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On June 14, 2017, two weeks after DAPL became fully operational, the Court granted in part and denied in part the parties' motions and remanded certain issues to the Corps.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v.

Although the Court remanded these issues to the Corps for further analysis, it did not decide whether the easement should be vacated pending such remand.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274679\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/255/101/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274679\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/255/101/\">\n    at 147-48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That determination followed in the Court's October 11, 2017, Opinion, in which it concluded that there was a \"serious possibility\" that the Corps would be able to substantiate its prior determinations and thus denied vacatur pending remand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v.

Specifically, the Tribe asserts that Defendants violated NEPA by segmenting their evaluation of DAPL's environmental impacts among multiple federal agencies and Corps divisions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-16. Arguing that the various federal permissions for the pipeline are \"connected\" or \"similar\" actions under the meaning of NEPA's implementing regulations, Plaintiffs contend that Defendants were thus required to conduct a consolidated, programmatic assessment of the approvals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6. Plaintiffs additionally move for summary judgment on their claim that, by failing to obtain the Tribe's free and informed consent prior to granting authorizations for DAPL's construction, the Corps and FWS violated the\n   Tribe's 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie and the federal government's trust responsibilities to the Tribe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On January 10, 2018, federal Defendants filed their Opposition to Plaintiffs' claims and cross-moved for partial summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 320 (Corps Opp.) Dakota Access, as a Defendant-Intervenor and Cross-Claimant, also filed its own Opposition and brief in support of federal Defendants' Cross-Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DA Opp. In their briefing, Defendants additionally moved to dismiss the Tribe's NHPA claims as moot in light of DAPL's completed construction and current operation.

They are not. Indeed, as Defendants accurately note, Rule 7(h) does not apply in cases such as this one in which judicial review is based solely on the administrative record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    All. for Nat.

The Court, therefore, will not treat Plaintiff's facts as admitted and will instead evaluate the parties' claims on the basis of the underlying administrative record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Treaty and Trust Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court next looks at the Tribe's Treaty-based claims. Plaintiffs' Motion relies in part on the first count of their Complaint, which alleged that Defendants violated the 1851 Treaty of Laramie, the federal trust responsibilities to the Tribe, and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 81-90. More specifically, Plaintiffs assert that Defendants failed to \"consider the impacts of [their] actions to the Tribe's 1851 Treaty Rights\" and that the Corps breached its \"fiduciary duty to consider how its actions may affect a tribe's treaty rights.\" Yankton MSJ at 20, 29. In their Oppositions and Cross-Motions, Defendants contend that this matter was already disposed of in\n   <em>\n    Standing Rock II\n   </em>\n   . They argue, moreover, that regardless of this Court's prior Opinion, Plaintiffs are unable to identify any retained tribal rights in land or waters that would be affected by DAPL's construction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Corps Opp. at 18-19 (stating that \"Plaintiffs offer no \"compelling reason why this Court should reconsider\" its prior Opinion addressing treaty rights), 27-28 (noting that Yankton's current lands are 230 miles away from the Lake Oahe crossing and the Tribe has \"not identified any possibility ... that a spill would impact [its] lands\"); DA Opp. at 21 (\"Yankton's arguments based on treaty and trust obligation are indistinguishable from those the Court already considered and resolved.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiffs were apparently persuaded by such arguments. In its Reply, the Tribe stated that \"after reviewing [f]ederal Defendants' response, and given the complexities of rules for interpretation of treaties, Plaintiffs hereby withdraw the [ ] claim presented in their motion for partial summary judgment regarding [Defendants'] failure to consider the Tribe's treaty rights, and choose not to pursue that claim at this time.\" Yankton Reply at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   This attempt at a limited \"withdrawal\" is, unfortunately for the Tribe, not a fruitful legal tactic. Parties are not permitted to float trial balloons in motions for summary judgment, only to retract but preserve their claims when the opposing\n   party makes a stronger argument. Instead, by retreating from their Treaty-based claims \"after reviewing\" Defendants' response, the Tribe has essentially conceded that the Court should grant the Corps' Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment on this issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abraham v.

Corp. of Texas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11105651\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/138/809/#p816\">\n    138 F.Supp.2d 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 816 (S.D. Tex. 2001) (granting summary judgment for opposing party when plaintiff \"cho[se] not to pursue\" a given claim raised in initial motion for summary judgment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Yet even if the Tribe had not withdrawn the relevant portions of its Motion, it would not have prevailed. Defendants are correct that in light of this Court's prior Opinion rejecting nearly identical trust and treaty arguments made by the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux Tribes, Yankton's claims are ultimately futile.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Standing Rock III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274679\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/255/101/\">\n    255 F.Supp.3d at 145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, Plaintiffs make no attempt to distinguish their position from that deemed deficient in\n   <em>\n    Standing Rock III\n   </em>\n   . They instead assert that they \"object to this Court's holding in [its] June 14, 2017, Memorandum Opinion\" and \"incorporate[ ] Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's arguments ... as to why treaties and U.S. trust responsibilities can provide the law to apply.\" Yankton MSJ at 30 n.4;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274679\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/255/101/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 29 n.3 (\"adopt[ing]\" Standing Rock's arguments regarding federal Defendants' \"enhanced responsibility to consider Tribe's treaty rights\").

As Defendants accurately note, courts have consistently held that UNDRIP is a non-binding declaration that does not create a federal cause of action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Corps Opp. at 19 n.8;\n   <em>\n    Isaac v.

In particular, the Corps asserts that Plaintiffs \"do not provide a specific and concrete plan to return to or use Lake Oahe specifically or identify how any federal action causes them harm.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30. The Tribe's declarations, according to Defendants, \"do not establish current or future use of the areas around Lake Oahe\" and instead only \"mention past visits\" to the area and the fact that \"unnamed tribal members hunt, gather and perform ceremony with water including the Missouri River in North and South Dakota.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Corps casts these assertions as \"generalized grievance[s]\" and thus insufficient to confer standing under Article III.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In order to establish standing, a plaintiff must show that: (1) she has suffered an \"injury in fact\" that is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, rather than conjectural or hypothetical; 2) the injury is caused by, or fairly traceable to, the challenged action; and 3) it is likely, rather than merely\n   speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Friends of the Earth, Inc. v.

The Tribe alleged in its Complaint that, as a result of this inadequate consultation, DAPL's ongoing construction would pose an impermissible risk to tribal sites.

The alleged \"injuries\" arising from Defendants' NHPA violations are tethered to the timeline of DAPL's construction and operation; in other words, tribal consultation and the granting of relevant federal permissions are actions that take place\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   to the execution of a given project.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Standing Rock I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=205%20F.%20Supp.%203d%204\">\n    205 F.Supp.3d at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (NHPA \"encompasses sites of cultural or religious significance to Indian tribes and requires that federal agencies consult with tribes\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    to\n   </em>\n   issuing permits that might affect these historic resources\"). Indeed, in its very first Opinion in this case, the Court found as much. A year and a half ago, addressing Standing Rock's similar contention, this Court wrote that \"[t]he risk that construction may damage or destroy cultural resources is now moot for the 48% of the pipeline that has already been completed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=205%20F.%20Supp.%203d%204\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=205%20F.%20Supp.%203d%204\">\n    at 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This advancement in DAPL's development in turn dooms Yankton's NHPA efforts. The Tribe's first three claims mentioned above are explicitly premised on alleged violations of the consultation requirements under \u00a7 106 of the Act. Now that construction of the pipeline has occurred, the Court agrees with Defendants (and the Standing Rock Sioux) that such consultation would no longer be \"meaningful.\" Similarly, the Court is unable to order effective relief with respect to Plaintiff's final NHPA claim, which alleges that the Corps improperly defined the area of potential effects. This count relies on the Tribe's assertion that \"the clearing, grading, excavation, and construction that would occur along the duration of the [p]ipeline route would destroy any historic or culturally significant sites encountered.\" Compl., \u00b6 139.

According to federal Defendants, \"[A]n agency's scoping decision is entitled to deference,\" including the Corps' and FWS's decision to \"limit[ ] their review to areas within their jurisdiction.\" Corps Opp. at 8. Plaintiffs counter, somewhat confusingly, that because federal Defendants \"are part of the same entity-the United States-and the United States is required to conduct the NEPA analysis,\" no deference is due to the agencies' independent scoping determinations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Yankton Reply at 13. This line of argument is unavailing, as the scoping process\n   clearly falls under the authority of each agency charged with conducting a NEPA analysis.

The Tribe would, moreover, be precluded from making such an argument not only by the holding in\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club\n   </em>\n   , but also by one of the Court's prior Opinions in this case. In\n   <em>\n    Standing Rock I\n   </em>\n   , it rebuffed Standing Rock's argument that federal Defendants were required to engage in a whole-pipeline analysis. The Court denied the need for any such comprehensive evaluation, finding that \"a federal agency with limited jurisdiction over specific activities related to a pipeline\" is not \"required to consider\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   the effects of the\n   <em>\n    entire\n   </em>\n   pipeline.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=205%20F.%20Supp.%203d%204\">\n    205 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   31 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club, Inc. v.

Rather, it fits within a line of argument explicitly left open by that opinion. As the court there noted, plaintiff had, at oral argument, advanced the claim that \"the connected action regulation require[s] that the federal actions in this case-the easements, the other areas within federal jurisdiction\"-should have been considered connected and \"analyzed together\" under NEPA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173839,4345799\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/31/\">\n    803 F.3d at 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, Plaintiffs are challenging federal Defendants' decision to issue \"three separate and distinct EAs, three separate and distinct FONSIs, and one categorical exclusion classification for their own respective actions related to the Pipeline project,\" in lieu of a consolidated analysis of all such\n   <em>\n    federal permissions\n   </em>\n   related to DAPL.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Yankton MSJ at 11.

Plaintiffs offer four major arguments in favor of finding such a relationship: (1) the federal projects do not have \"substantial independent utility\"; (2) the approval of each federal permit constrained the consideration of alternatives for other portions of the pipeline; (3) the permits and permissions were \"justified by\" a larger federal action; and (4) the federal projects are \"interdependent\" and have a \"synergistic\" environmental\n   effect. The Court addresses each separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   a. Substantial Independent Utility\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Under this Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Taxpayers\n   </em>\n   , federal projects can only be analyzed separately if each project has,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \"substantial independent utility.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1710221,4330487\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/819/294/\">\n    819 F.2d at 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

On this issue, Plaintiffs argue that \"no separate component of the Pipeline considered by Federal Defendants and analyzed in three separate EAs can possibly have independent utility\" because \"[i]f one federal approval for the Pipeline had been denied, Pipeline construction could not have been completed and the whole project would have been rendered utterly useless.\" Yankton MSJ at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   This line of argument, as Defendants accurately note, ignores the facts on the ground. Most significantly, 97% of DAPL runs through private land. This means that vast swaths of the pipeline could be constructed without any federal permissions or permits whatsoever, and that, if a given federal authorization was denied for a portion of the remaining 3%, the project could be re-routed to avoid the contentious crossing or easement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Standing Rock I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=205%20F.%20Supp.%203d%204\">\n    205 F.Supp.3d at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that \"the route taken by the pipeline through private lands ... is driven by factors that have little to do with the discrete activities that the Corps needs to permit\").

Far from rendering the \"whole project ... entirely useless,\" the denial of one federal approval could simply result in a shift in the pipeline's course.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   It follows, therefore, that each discrete federal permission had \"substantial independent utility,\" as each would allow that portion of the pipeline to proceed as planned, while any denial would result in re-routing-with no apparent impact on the other federally regulated components of the project.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Williams v.

In that case, the projects at issue addressed upgrades to a natural-gas pipeline, meaning that a federal agency-FERC-had jurisdiction over projects along its entire length.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5918307,4280527\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/753/1304/\">\n    753 F.3d at 1307-08\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Consideration of Alternatives\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Tribe next posits that \"each approval issued [by the Corps and FWS] sufficiently constrained the consideration of alternatives for other portions of the pipeline to mandate consideration of all approvals in a single NEPA document.\" Yankton MSJ at 13. According to Plaintiffs, the \"approval of one segment clearly foreclosed the opportunity to consider other reasonable alternatives, as the approval of one segment at a specific location decreased route options for other segments of the pipeline.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=205%20F.%20Supp.%203d%204\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendants counter that their consideration of alternatives to each permit and permission was not so constrained, pointing to the fact that the EAs each \"contains a section devoted to alternatives to the federal action.\" DA Opp. at 19\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Defendants have the better of this argument. Indeed, a review of the three EAs at issue demonstrates that the two Corps districts and FWS clearly considered a full panoply of alternatives-including, in each case, a \"no-action\" alternative that consisted of a scenario in which the pipeline was not constructed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Omaha Dist. EA at 12-13; St. Louis Dist. EA at 12-15; FWS EA at 15. As made evident by the agencies' analyses, the approval for any one crossing or permission did not restrict the consideration of different route options or alternatives for the other proposed actions.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coal. on Sensible Transp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331736,1741295\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/826/60/\">\n    826 F.2d at 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting claim that project approval would \"restrict consideration of alternatives for related projects\" because no indication that each permission would \"effectively commit [federal] decisionmakers to a future course of action\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   c.

They contend that the actions of the Corps and FWS were \"clearly parts of a larger action,\" stating that \"the permits and permissions issued by Federal Defendants were part of, and justified by, the ... greater implementation of the Pipeline.\" Yankton Reply at 10-11. Yet, as discussed above, any suggestion that DAPL as a whole constitutes a \"federal action\" is unavailing in light of\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Standing Rock II\n   </em>\n   . The narrower question, therefore, is whether the federal permits and permissions were justified by any larger\n   <em>\n    federal\n   </em>\n   action and thus required a consolidated NEPA analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Yankton Reply at 12 (acknowledging that Tribe \"do[es] not argue that the entire pipeline should have been analyzed, but rather, that the permits and permissions ... should have been analyzed together in a single NEPA process\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club v.

Indeed, it is difficult to imagine how the construction of a river crossing in Illinois could possibly affect the environment at Lake Oahe, which is located hundreds miles away and separated by the states of Iowa and South Dakota.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DA Opp. at 1 (Map 1). This, therefore, is not a case in which the environmental impacts or harms arising from a set of discrete federal permissions would, if combined, be greater than the sum of the parts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   This lack of interaction between the sites addressed in each EA distinguishes this case from\n   <em>\n    NRDC v.

Counter to Plaintiffs' assertion that the sites are \"interdependent,\" Yankton MSJ at 14, there is no indication that DAPL's passage through one crossing or easement would have spillover environmental effects at another. The Court, consequently, finds no basis upon which to deem the federal approvals \"interdependent\" or as having any synergistic environmental impact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Earth Island Inst.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523339\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/290/1102/#p1123\">\n    290 F.Supp.3d at 1123-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%205526572\">\n    2017 WL 5526572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *14 (separate NEPA review appropriate where actions in question were located in different watersheds on opposite sides of Greenhorn Mountains).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Similar Actions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   In addition to maintaining that the approvals were \"\n   <em>\n    connected\n   </em>\n   actions,\" Plaintiffs assert that the Corps' and FWS's assessments were \"\n   <em>\n    similar\n   </em>\n   actions\" under \u00a7 1504.25. The Court begins with the threshold issue of whether the Tribe has in fact forfeited this claim. According to Defendants, the \"similar actions\" contention is unavailable, as \"neither Plaintiffs nor any other commenter raised the argument that FWS and the Corps' actions should be considered together as 'similar actions,' \" Corps Opp. at 13 n.5, and \"[i]t is well-established that issues not raised in comments before the agency are waived.\" DA Opp. at 24 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n v.

In response, the Tribe asserts that it need not have identified the similar-actions claim during the comment period \"because a different entity ... had explicitly raised the issue.\" Yankton Reply at 25. Plaintiffs then refer to a lone comment on the proposed St. Louis District EA that quoted the text of \u00a7 1508.25, including the \"connected, cumulative, or similar actions\" language.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3698718,940839\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/286/554/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 27 (citing St. Louis EA, Comment 2-2).

Cir. 1991). The single mention of the word \"similar\" in the comments appears to be the one Plaintiffs cite from the St. Louis EA, which arises in the context of reciting verbatim the full language of \u00a7 1504.25. Neither that comment, nor any other, makes any attempt to\n   <em>\n    apply\n   </em>\n   that \"similar actions\" text to the DAPL decisionmaking process or argues that federal Defendants erred in failing to consider their respective permissions and permits under that prong of the regulation. As Defendants acknowledge, this is in contrast to the \"connected actions\" issue, which was explicitly raised and addressed in depth by a number of commenters.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Exh. 14 (Sierra Club Comment) (discussing \u00a7 1504.25, but addressing only \"connected actions\" prong of regulation). While the Tribe is correct that it may rely on the comments of other entities in arguing against waiver,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat. Res. Def. Council v.

Cir. 1987), here it cannot show that\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   entity sufficiently raised the \"similar actions\" claim before the agencies so as to give them notice of the issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Northside Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v. Thomas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12043922,5655806\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/849/1516/\">\n    849 F.2d 1516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1519 (D.C.

Indeed, it stands to reason that if the \"similar actions\" argument was so self-evident, the multiple commenters who addressed the issue of segmentation would have at least referred to such an allegedly straightforward claim. The fact that the comments instead discussed only the \"connected actions\" prong of \u00a7 1508.25 speaks to the relative obscurity of the \"similar actions\" issue. Because no commenter made any substantive contention that the agencies' actions were similar, and because such an argument was not \"obvious,\" the Court will deem this issue forfeited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Out of an abundance of caution, however, the Court also notes that even if this claim were preserved, the Tribe would still not prevail. Under \u00a7 1508.25, similar actions are those that, \"when viewed with other reasonably foreseeable or proposed agency actions, have similarities that provide a basis for evaluating their environmental consequences together, such as common timing or geography.\" Plaintiffs contend that the federal permissions at issue in this case share such a resemblance. In particular, the Tribe focuses on the \"common timing\" of the Corps' and FWS's actions, noting that the agencies' decisionmaking processes \"took place at roughly the same time,\" with the relevant federal permits and permissions issued within a span of ten months.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Yankton MSJ at 15; Reply at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Simultaneity of agency actions is not, however, dispositive of their similarity. Instead, \u00a7 1508.25 clearly states that the ultimate question is whether a set of actions \"ha[s] similarities that provide a basis for evaluating their environmental consequences\" in a single assessment. As this Circuit has put it, a comprehensive analysis is appropriate under \u00a7 1508.25 when the \"sufficiently similar character of actions is such that [a programmatic analysis] is the 'best way' to assess their combined impacts.\"\n   <em>\n    Coal. on Sensible Transp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331736,1741295\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/826/60/\">\n    826 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   70 n.8 (citation omitted). Such a standard does not, contrary to the Tribe's suggestion, mandate that all actions with temporal proximity are \"best\" assessed in a single EIS or EA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The implementing regulation, moreover, also lists common geography as another potential indicator of similarity-a factor that, in this case, cuts against finding such commonality between the DAPL-related permissions. As discussed above, the three EAs and FONSIs were for geographically and ecologically distinct areas of federal control. As Defendants note, the assessments addressed actions that were \"not physically connected\" and instead were \"spread over hundreds of miles across multiple states.\" Corps Opp. at 16. The permissions and permits, moreover, were for different environmental resources: the Omaha District EA addressed the crossing of Lakes Oahe and Sakakawea; the St. Louis EA looked at a series of lake, creek, and channel crossings and drainage districts in Illinois; and the FWS EA was concerned with the agency's jurisdiction over wetland and grassland easements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Such geographic isolation and ecological diversity, the Corps contends, defeat any suggestions of similarity between the federal actions. Plaintiffs counter that \"[w]hile the geographic locations for the various agency actions are not the same, they all\n   occurred along the same linear pipeline route,\" and thus \"[t]here can be no doubt that Federal Defendants' actions were 'similar.' \" Yankton MSJ at 16 (emphasis omitted). The Court does not share the Tribe's certainty on this issue. Instead, it finds that the geographic and substantive differences among the three actions demonstrate that they are not \"similar\" within the meaning of \u00a7 1508.25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Plaintiffs also vaguely allude to other alleged similarities among the DAPL-related actions. Although it focuses largely on the temporal overlap between the various federal permissions, the Tribe asserts that \"Defendants' actions involved the same singular pipeline which would transport the same crude oil, rendering the actions' potential impacts similar if not identical.\" Yankton MSJ at 15. Again, this argument does not reflect the reality of the pipeline-a project that spans four states over its 1,200-mile route. The discrete parcels of federal lands and easements the pipeline encounters along this corridor are not, simply by virtue of being in DAPL's path, \"similar.\" Indeed, one need only reference the EAs at issue in this case to understand that, far from presenting \"identical\" environmental considerations, each federal permission reflects site-specific and distinct ecological concerns. Although the pipeline may be a \"singular\" private undertaking, its environmental impacts and the related federal assessments are far more diverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In sum, the Court concludes that Defendants' environmental assessments are not \"connected\" or \"similar\" federal actions. Instead, they are discrete analyses that address ecologically and geographically disparate areas of federal jurisdiction. The Corps and FWS, accordingly, were under no obligation to consider these authorizations together. The Court observes, moreover, that a major rationale for the anti-segmentation rule is especially inapplicable in this case. Enforcement of the principle seeks, in large part, to prevent agencies from disguising the actual environmental impacts of a given governmental project by dividing the action into artificially created components.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Macht v. Skinner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7393208\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/715/1131/#p1135\">\n    715 F.Supp. 1131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1135 (D.D.C. 1989),\n   <em>\n    aff'd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=889%20F.2d%20291\">\n    889 F.2d 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. Cir. 1989) (anti-segmentation principle serves to \"weed out projects which are pretextually segmented,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   for which there is no independent reason to exist\"). Yet this is not a case in which a broader agency action was fragmented into arbitrary parts in order to hide its total environmental effect. DAPL is a largely private project, and Defendants' decision to treat the limited federal involvement with the pipeline as discrete agency actions evinces no bad faith or attempt to circumvent NEPA's environmental protections. Such a determination was instead a reasonable exercise of the agencies' discretion, and the Court will therefore defer to Defendants' decision to conduct three separate EAs and FONSIs in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Harmless Error\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Finally, even if Defendants' actions did violate NEPA, the Court concludes that such violations did not prejudice Plaintiffs, as there is no indication that the agencies would have reached a different outcome if they had in fact considered the DAPL-related actions\n   <em>\n    in toto\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The Tribe argues that the Court should not apply harmless-error doctrine in this context, noting that certain cases finding improper segmentation of NEPA analyses have not explicitly addressed the question of prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Yankton Reply at 21. Yet just because other courts have not applied harmless error does not prevent this Court\n   from doing so. Rather, the inquiry into whether a NEPA plaintiff suffered prejudice is well established in the relevant precedent.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Pub. Employees for Envtl.

The Court agrees. The Tribe describes the actual impact of Defendants' allegedly improper segmentation in only the vaguest of terms, stating that the use of separate analyses left the Tribe \"with no means to truly understand or weigh in on the vast cumulative impacts this project can and will have on the human environment\" and generally alleging that by using three separate EAs, Defendants \"concealed the cumulative environmental impacts of the project.\" Yankton MSJ at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Yet there is no indication in the record that Defendants \"concealed\" any cumulative environmental impacts or that they \"faile[ed] to do the analysis ... to determine the cumulative impacts\" of all of the federal actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Yankton Reply at 5-6. On the contrary, each of the three EAs contains a section\n   <em>\n    explicitly titled\n   </em>\n   \"cumulative impacts,\" discussing the potential cumulative effects of each permission and addressing the potential for the relevant permit to interact with other federal actions-including those related to the pipeline.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Omaha EA at 98-107; FWS EA at 33-35; St. Louis EA and FONSI at 83-94. If the agencies were attempting to \"hid[e] the ball\" as to DAPL's cumulative impacts,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Yankton MSJ at 19, they did a poor job indeed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Beyond providing no evidence of Defendants' alleged \"concealment,\" Plaintiffs have not identified any actual harms that arose from the division of the agencies' analysis. The goal of NEPA is to ensure that the public is provided with relevant information and the opportunity to participate in agency decisionmaking.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Robertson v.

Although the Tribe may have preferred that the assessments be combined into a single document, there is no indication in the record that such consolidation would have had any meaningful effect.
