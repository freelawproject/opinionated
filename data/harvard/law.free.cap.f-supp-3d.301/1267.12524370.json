Scola, Jr., United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Plaintiff Tecnoglass, LLC, brings claims of copyright infringement, unfair competition under the Lanham Act, and several state-law causes of action against the Defendant, RC Home Showcase, Inc. (Compl., ECF No. 1.) Tecnoglass asserts that RC Home unlawfully copied its technical drawings and unfairly competed with its business. RC Home asks this Court to dismiss Tecnoglass's Complaint for failure to state a cause of action. (Mot., ECF No. 19). Tecnoglass responded (Resp., ECF No. 26), and RC Home replied (Reply, ECF No. 44). This matter is ripe for the Court's decision. For the reasons set forth in this Order, the Court\n   <strong>\n    denies in part\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    grants in part\n   </strong>\n   the Motion (\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 19\n   </strong>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In November 2013, Tecnoglass acquired intellectual property rights from non-party RC Aluminum Industries, Inc.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   including rights related to RC Aluminum's Miami-Dade Notices of Acceptance (\"NOA\") for various windows, sliding glass doors, and window wall systems. (Compl. \u00b6 3, ECF No. 1.). An NOA signifies compliance with the Florida Building Code and indicates that the Miami-Dade County Product Control Approval System has reviewed and approved technical drawings for a particular construction product.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) Almost a year after Tecnoglass acquired the right to use these NOAs, it initiated litigation in state court against RC Home alleging improper use of a subset of the NOAs acquired from RC Aluminum, which Tecnoglass terms \"shared NOAs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.) This previous state-court litigation resulted in a settlement agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.) The settlement agreement provided RC Home limited\n   rights to use the shared NOAs, subject to termination of those rights after six months. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Now at issue in this case are Tecnoglass's copyright registrations for six technical drawings of window wall systems and sliding glass doors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) According to Tecnoglass, RC Home accessed the technical drawings from Tecnoglass's NOAs available on the Miami-Dade County website. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) RC Home then copied the technical drawings and used the drawings in RC Home's own NOA applications, representing that the technical drawings in its applications belonged to RC Home. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29-30.) Additionally, RC Home's product designations are similar to those used by Tecnoglass-compare, for example, \"Tecnoglass HP3070\" with \"RC Home FX 370.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.) RC Home has sold its products, which are based on Tecnoglass's designs, to existing, former, and potential Tecnoglass customers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40-44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Due to RC Home's actions, Tecnoglass submitted expedited applications for copyright registration for six of the technical drawings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47.) The U.S. Copyright Office registered the six technical drawings on September 22, 2016, the same date Tecnoglass filed the applications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.) Tecnoglass included the copyright registrations as exhibits to the Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Exs. C-H.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Based on these facts, the Complaint asserts seven counts against RC Home: (1) Copyright Infringement; (2) Injunction and Temporary Restraining Order; (3) Breach of Contract; (4) Unjust Enrichment; (5) Tortious Interference with Business Relationship; (6) Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (\"FDUTPA\"); and (7) Federal Unfair Competition under the Lanham Act. Defendant moves to dismiss, arguing that: (1) Tecnoglass's copyright registrations are invalid as a matter of law; (2) the Lanham Act claim is simply a restated claim for copyright infringement, and therefore preempted by the Copyright Act; (3) as both federal claims are invalid, the Court should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims; or (4) in the alternative, if the Court does not dismiss the federal claims, Tecnoglass's FDUTPA claim is preempted by the Copyright Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When considering a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), the Court must accept all of the Complaint's allegations as true, construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Pielage v.

Castle Rock Entm't\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11567270\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/193/1241/#p1247\">\n    193 F.3d 1241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1247-48 (11th Cir. 1999). RC Home argues the Court should dismiss Tecnoglass's claim for copyright infringement because technical drawings for windows and doors are not subject to copyright protection, and therefore the registrations are invalid as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   RC Home attacks prong one of Tecnoglass's prima facie case, ownership of a valid copyright, in two ways. First, RC Home asserts that \"[t]he allegations of Tecnoglass'[s] complaint establish that the works at issue were useful articles not subject to copyright.\" (Mot. at 4.) Second, RC Home argues that the U.S. Copyright Office regulations specifically exclude \" 'individual standard features, such as windows, doors, and other staple building components[.]' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 n.4 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20202.11\">\n    37 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2) ).) Both arguments misinterpret copyright law and erroneously conflate the technical drawings actually at issue with the objects they depict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As an initial matter, the Copyright Act protects two categories of works related to architecture: (1) \"pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20102\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5) ; and (2) \"architectural works.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20102\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 102(a)(8). The Architectural Works Copyright Protection Act (AWCPA), which amended the Copyright Act in 1990, added the second category to distinguish between the \"drafting skill and spatial, two-dimensional layout\" protected in section 102(a)(5) and the \"artistic, three-dimensional creativity\" protected in section 102(a)(8). 2 Patry on Copyright \u00a7 3:116. Tecnoglass claims copyright in only the technical drawings\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   -in other words, the \"pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works\" under section 102(a)(5) -and not in the as-built structures of physical windows or doors-in other words, the \"architectural works\" under section 102(a)(8). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. at 6;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 18, 29-30, 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Further, the Copyright Act does not provide blanket protection to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works. Instead, the statutory definition limits\n   copyright protection in two ways: (1) it excludes from protection the \"mechanical or utilitarian aspects\" of pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works; and (2) it excludes from protection \"the design of a useful article\" whose specific features remain inseparable from \"the utilitarian aspects of the article.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

RC Home discusses at length cases that apply section 301(a) of the Copyright Act to preempt state-law claims. While RC Home suggests analysis of these cases is \"instructive\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12), the Court disagrees.

(Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 29-30, 34-36, 101-03.) Tecnoglass further alleges that consumers could be confused by the substantially similar product names used by RC Home.

Tecnoglass's additional allegations regarding consumer confusion fail because the alleged consumer confusion results from similarly sounding product names-not any false representation, or designation by RC Home. Further, although not addressed by the parties, it is unclear to the Court that Tecnoglass's Lanham Act claim could survive even if it were not duplicative of its copyright claim. In particular, the Lanham Act protects against false designations used in commerce and likely to cause consumer confusion. It is unlikely that use of the drawings in the NOA application constitutes commerce, or that Miami-Dade County can constitute a consumer, or both.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Accordingly, the Court dismisses Count 7 for Lanham Act Unfair Competition as duplicative of Tecnoglass's copyright infringement claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

As Tecnoglass acknowledges, a \"Federal cause of action under the Lanham Act often mirrors a cause of action brought under FDUTPA.\" (Resp. at 11, ECF No. 26 (citing\n   <em>\n    Suntree Techs.

More than \"often\" mirroring the cause of action, the Eleventh Circuit has held that \"the legal standards we apply to [a FDUTPA] claim are the same as those we have applied under section 43(a) of the Lanham Act [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A).]\"\n   <em>\n    Crystal Entm't &amp; Filmworks, Inc. v.

So, while \" '[c]laims asserted pursuant to\n   FDUTPA are not per se preempted by the Copyright Act[,] ... where ... the only unfair or deceptive practice is the same conduct which forms the basis of the plaintiff's copyright claim, the FDUTPA claim is preempted.' \"\n   <em>\n    Stripteaser, Inc. v.

Nov. 25, 2008) ). Thus, under the same analysis the Court applied to Tecnoglass's Lanham Act claim, the Court finds that Tecnoglass's copyright infringement claim precludes its FDUTPA claim. The Court therefore dismisses Count 6, Tecnoglass's claim for violations of FDUTPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Remaining State Law Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Regarding Tecnoglass's remaining state-law claims, the only argument put forth by RC Home is that the Court should, in its discretion, decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over these claims. (Mot. at 2.) This argument presumes dismissal of both Tecnoglass's federal causes of action, over which the Court has original jurisdiction. As discussed above, Tecnoglass sufficiently alleges a claim for copyright infringement. The Court will not dismiss the remaining state law claims on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   However, the Court notes that to succeed on its state law claims, Tecnoglass will need to satisfy the Eleventh Circuit's extra element test to avoid copyright preemption.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bateman v.

As RC Home did not argue copyright preemption as to these claims, the Court takes no position on whether Tecnoglass's remaining state law claims satisfy the extra element test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

Tecnoglass's claim for Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices under Florida Law is dismissed (Count 6). And Tecnoglass's claim for unfair competition under the Lanham Act is dismissed (Count 7).
