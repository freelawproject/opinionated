(collectively \"Caribbean\"), United Financial Casualty Company (\"UFCC\"), James B. Johnston, and Evanston Insurance Company seeking declaratory judgments against UFCC (Counts 1, 2) and Evanston (Count 10). (Compl., ECF No. 1.) Republic also alleges claims for bad faith against UFCC (Count 3), breach of contract against Caribbean (Counts 4 and 5) and\n   negligent misrepresentation (Count 6), negligence (Count 7), breach of contract (Count 8) and breach of fiduciary duty (Count 9) against Johnston. UFCC filed a Motion to Dismiss Count 1 (UFCC Mot., ECF No. 14) and Johnston filed a Motion to Dismiss Counts 6-9 (Johnston Mot., ECF No. 25). On March 1, 2018, the Court heard oral argument on both motions. (ECF No. 37.) The Court grants UFCC's Motion (ECF No. 14) and grants in part and denies in part Johnston's Motion (ECF No. 25) for the reasons that follow. The case is stayed with respect to all remaining claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Republic, a waste disposal service, contracted with Caribbean to perform trash hauling services. (Compl., Ex. A.) On the morning of September 19, 2014, Roberto Jones, while in the course of his Caribbean employment, was transporting trash in a Caribbean owned 2001 tractor trailer with vehicle identification number 1FUJA6CGX1LJ39963 and an attached semi-trailer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 26, 16-17.) While driving on Pennsylvania Route 340, Jones collided with a truck driven by Jacob Long. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 31, 36.) Long and two of his passengers, Marcus Ruff and another individual, died as a result of the accident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38.) Long and Ruff's estates brought separate lawsuits against Jones, Caribbean Operators, Gomes Express and Republic Services. The cases (\"Underlying Action\") were consolidated and are pending before the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County. (Compl. \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Republic and Caribbean's business venture was governed by a January 10, 2013 Master Transportation Services Agreement (\"MTSA\") which was in effect on the date of the accident. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.) The MTSA required Caribbean to obtain insurance coverage as outlined therein. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 25-31; MTSA \u00b6 12, Compl., Ex. B.) Specifically, Caribbean was obligated to maintain automobile liability insurance with limits of at least $2,000,000 per accident and umbrella/excess liability insurance with limits of at least $2,000,000 per occurrence. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 26, 29; MTSA \u00b6 12.1.) Caribbean agreed that all insurance policies would be primary without the right of contribution from other insurance maintained by Republic (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 28, 31; MTSA \u00b6 12.2) and agreed to list Republic as an additional insured on each policy (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 27, 30; MTSA \u00b6 12.2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Caribbean retained Johnston, an insurance broker, to place its insurance policies. (Compl. \u00b6 47.) Caribbean informed Johnston about the MTSA requirements (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 48-49) and relied on Johnston to obtain policies in accordance with those requirements (Compl. \u00b6 50). UFCC subsequently issued two policies to Caribbean: policy number 03079347-0 (Policy 1, Compl., Ex. C) and policy number 05281021-5 (Policy 2, Compl. Ex. D). UFCC issued one policy to Gomes: policy number 07651616-3 (Policy 3, Compl. Ex. E). (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 32-35.) Each UFCC policy was in effect during September 2014 and provided for a combined single limit of $1,000,000 per accident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Further, each UFCC policy provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   We will settle or defend, at our option, any claim or lawsuit for damages covered by this Part I. We have no duty to settle or defend any lawsuit, or make any additional payments, after the Limit of Liability for this coverage has been exhausted by payment of judgments or settlements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In addition to our Limit of Liability, we will pay for an insured:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   1. all expenses that we incur in the settlement of any claim or defense of any lawsuit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (Policy 1, at 6-8; Policy 2, at 6-8; Policy 3, at 6-8.) None of the UFCC policies explicitly list Republic as an \"additional insured\" (Policy 1, Policy 2, Policy 3), and only Policy 3 expressly includes the 2001 tractor trailer on its auto coverage schedule (Policy 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Johnston also helped Caribbean place its umbrella/excess policy with Associated International. The Associated Policy, number XOBW4307213, was also in effect in September 2014 and provides coverage up to $1,000,000 per occurrence. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 43-44.) Evanston assumed all rights and obligations under this policy through its merger with Associated International. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 46, 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Republic acknowledges that UFCC is currently providing a defense to Republic in the Underlying Action \"under one or more of the UFCC Policies\" subject to a reservation of rights (Compl. \u00b6 42; UFCC Mot. at 3 n.1) and no judgment has been entered against Republic (Hr'g Tr. 43:2-7). Notwithstanding these facts, Republic now seeks largely to have the Court provide Republic with more \"certainty\" that UFCC will continue to do that which it is already doing-defend Republic. (ECF No. 1.) UFCC moves to dismiss Count 1 for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) and in the alternative, for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). (UFCC Mot. at 4-9.) Johnston moves to dismiss Counts 6-9 for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) and, also in the alternative, for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). (Johnston Mot. at 11-28.) Republic filed a Response in Opposition to both motions. (Opp. to UFCC, ECF No. 20; Opp. to Johnston, ECF No. 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A party's Rule 12(b)(1) motion \"may be treated as either a facial or factual challenge to the court's subject matter jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Gould Elecs.

In its brief, Republic does no more than summarize\n   <em>\n    Scarpitti\n   </em>\n   , claim that it has \"alleged enough facts to show that it is an intended third party beneficiary\" and restate that Caribbean relied on Johnston to place its insurance coverage.

After a fire damaged the home, the Caciolos sued Masco for the faulty installation. Although the Caciolos never contracted with Masco, they claimed to be intended third party beneficiaries of Monogram and Masco's contract.

Counts 2 and 3 against UFCC and Counts 4 and 5 against Caribbean for breach of contract remain. The Court will stay the proceedings in this case on those remaining counts. District courts have \"broad discretion to stay proceedings as an incident to its power to control its own docket.\"\n   <em>\n    Allstate Ins. Co. v.

Staying the proceedings in this case will not prejudice the remaining parties. Counsel for Caribbean supports this course of action. (Hr'g Tr. 63:2-10.) While counsel for Republic indicated his client's desire to move forward with the remnants of the litigation should the Court grant UFCC and Johnston's motions, he could not articulate a persuasive reason why the Court should do so. He explained that there are a lot of issues in the case and Republic is \"looking to sort out...as many of them as they can.\" (Hr'g Tr. 65:5-17.) In fact, a resolution in Republic's favor on its claims against Caribbean would only entitle it to nominal damages before the Underlying Action's resolution, something that makes little sense. Additionally, staying the case will preserve judicial resources. Litigating the remaining claims against UFCC now while resolving (in Republic's view the more pressing) claims against Caribbean later would result in piecemeal litigation which would not entitle Republic, even if successful, to obtain the money it seeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   An appropriate Order follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    The parties agree that Pennsylvania law applies to the UFCC Policies and all claims in the litigation.
