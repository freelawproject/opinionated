Turner, DDS\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"Plaintiff\") was a dentist in the Roanoke, Virginia area during the period relevant to the Complaint. (Compl. \u00b6 1.) From 2008 to 2014, Plaintiff treated Medicaid patients in the Smiles for Children (\"SFC\") program pursuant to an agreement with Defendant Dentaquest, LLC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant DMAS is the Virginia agency tasked with overseeing the SFC program and contracted Defendant Dentaquest to administer and supervise the program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) DMAS is managed by the Secretary of Human Resources and a Director of Medical Assistance Services, who is appointed by the Governor and subject to confirmation by the General Assembly.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2032.1-323\">\n    Va.

Code Ann. \u00a7 32.1-325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The SFC program is split into two parts: one component of the program is dedicated to treating patients up to the age of twenty one and the other component focuses on treating patients that are over the age of twenty one. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) Plaintiff \"worked exclusively with the Over 21 portion\" of the SFC program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) During his involvement with the SFC program, Plaintiff operated what was likely \"the largest safety net adult Medicaid practice in Virginia\" and \"was treating at least 75% of the eligible Medicaid adults receiving treatment in the Roanoke Valley.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.) The patients Plaintiff treated under the SFC program formed the entirety of his practice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Roanoke-based Mission of Mercy Clinic (\"MOM\") was a project of the Virginia Dental Association (\"VDA\") that provided \"free, volunteer traveling dental\" services to the same segment of the population as Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.) Defendant Dickinson, the Executive Director of the VDA, and Defendant Black, a VDA board member, are Founders of MOM, and Defendant Black serves as its Dental Director. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13, 27.) Plaintiff claims that competition with the MOM was detrimental to his practice, but he also credits his dental practice as a \"contributing factor [to] the Roanoke Mission of Mercy going out of business.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) The MOM's financial model proved unworkable, and, sometime after September 2012, the program was reorganized into a Mini-MOM concept, which was \"fully endorsed\" by the VDA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14, 42, 44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In January 2014, Defendant Dentaquest ended Plaintiff's eligibility under the SFC program by terminating Plaintiff's contract\n   \"without cause.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21, 45.) Starting in 2014, Commonwealth Dental Clinic (\"CDC\"), which is owned by Defendant Harvey, became the only \"provider[ ] for Adult (Over 21) Medicaid dental services in Western Virginia.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that the \"defendant dentists exercised their market power to push the Plaintiff out of his dental market niche, and out of business\" and that DMAS and Dentaquest \"knew there was antitrust activity\" and took action that led to \"further cover up and concealment of Defendants' actions against [Plaintiff].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18, 54-55.) Specifically, Plaintiff claims that, in downsizing from the financially inviable MOM, Defendants agreed to provide treatment to non-Medicaid-eligible patients at the Mini-MOMs and funnel all Medicaid-eligible patients to Defendant Harvey's CDC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14, 18, 43.) Plaintiff further alleges that \"Defendant Greg Harvey agreed to absorb the Over 21 Medicaid practice of Plaintiff on the condition that he would not have to compete directly with Plaintiff.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.) As such, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants Dickinson, Black and Harvey \"joined together ... to put [Plaintiff] out of business in the Medicaid [SFC] program.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   As mentioned above, Defendant Dentaquest terminated Plaintiff's contract, ending his eligibility under the SFC program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21, 45.) Plaintiff does not contend that Defendant Dentaquest lacked the contractual right to terminate his contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Dentaquest \"did not act independently,\" that \"DMAS sought the Plaintiff's termination based upon the advice of Defendants Terry Dickinson, David Black and/or Greg Harvey,\" and that Defendant Dentaquest notified Plaintiff's patients of his termination before the deadline for his appeal had passed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45, 46, 61.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Dickinson communicated the progress of Plaintiff's termination to Defendant Black; that Defendants Black and Harvey purchased a building to house CDC prior to Plaintiff's termination \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     with the knowledge and intent\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ... that one of their main competitors ( [Plaintiff] ) would be eliminated by Defendant Dentaquest;\" and that the VDA, led by Defendant Dickinson, supported the CDC despite \"not support[ing] the Over 21 Benefit in the past.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24, 35, 47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In January 2015, Plaintiff filed an ethics complaint (\"2015 complaint\") against Defendants Harvey and Black with the VDA Ethics Committee regarding ethics violations surrounding the naming and advertising of CDC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27; Exhibit D, ECF No. 1-4.) Plaintiff states that the VDA \"likely did not conduct a review of [Plaintiff]'s Ethics Complaint, as, if they did, David Black would have been found blatantly guilty.\" (Compl. \u00b6 27.) Further, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Parris-Wilkins, a member of the VDA and the VDA Ethics Committee, \"presumably\" ruled against this complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In April 2016, Plaintiff was the subject of an inquiry by the Virginia Board of Dentistry (\"BOD\") and was ultimately sanctioned for violations stemming from the closure of his dental practice in 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31; Exhibit N, ECF No. 1-17.) Defendant Parris-Wilkins was on the BOD panel that ruled against Plaintiff. (Compl. \u00b6 31.) Plaintiff contends that Defendant Parris-Wilkins' service on this panel was a clear conflict of interest, due to her \"close relationship\" with Defendant Dickinson and her role in ruling against the 2015 complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.) In sum, Plaintiff claims that \"Defendant Parris-Wilkins was involved in the Defendants' attempts to\n   cover up their actions against Plaintiff.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff asserts a cause of action under Section One of the Sherman Act and alleges that the relevant service market is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (1) adult (over 21) dental services recognized under the Medicaid approved\n   <em>\n    Smiles For Children\n   </em>\n   program; (2) tooth extractions and related services, as identified under Medicaid approved Over 21\n   <em>\n    Smiles For Children\n   </em>\n   program; and (3) Medicaid approved services for the Over 21 members of the\n   <em>\n    Smiles For Children\n   </em>\n   program in Western Virginia, and within a two hour drive of Roanoke, Virginia.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.) Plaintiff claims that, as a result of Defendants' anticompetitive actions, dentists have been deterred from entering the market and there has been a significant reduction in the availability of dental services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.) Further, CDC will continue to exercise its \"influence\" to maintain a \"monopoly\" over the market. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff also claims that he has been \"directly harmed\" by Defendants' anticompetitive conduct and continues to suffer \"significant economic and financial loss.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff previously brought a nearly identical action against a nearly identical cast of defendants in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Turner v.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Each of the Defendants that are parties to the Motions presently before the Court have challenged the sufficiency of the factual allegations made in Plaintiff's Complaint under the\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   standard. In addition, Defendant DMAS argues that the doctrine of issue preclusion bars re-litigating Judge Kiser's determination that it is immune from liability for violations of the Sherman Act. Alternatively, Defendant DMAS argues that it is immune from liability under the Sherman Act for the same reasons enunciated in the Western District Case. Because the immunity determination would preclude liability regardless of the sufficiency of the factual allegations to state a claim under the Sherman Act, the Court will address the issue preclusion and state action immunity arguments first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Issue Preclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   First and foremost, the Court may properly consider whether the doctrine of issue preclusion bars re-litigation of the immunity issue at this stage of litigation. The doctrine of issue preclusion, also known as collateral estoppel, is an affirmative defense. It is well-settled in the Fourth Circuit that a court ruling on a motion to dismiss may properly consider affirmative defenses when such defenses \"clearly appear on the face of the complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Richmond, Fredericksburg &amp; Potomac R.R. Co. v.

As discussed below, in making this claim, Plaintiff is attempting to re-litigate the determination in the Western District Case that DMAS is immune from this action. Because the question of issue preclusion clearly appears on the face of the Complaint, the Court can appropriately consider the preclusive effects of Judge Kiser's opinion in the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The burden is on the party seeking the preclusive effect of a determination to show that issue preclusion is applicable. Issue preclusion is only appropriate when the proponent demonstrates:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (1) the issue or fact is identical to the one previously litigated; (2) the issue or fact was actually resolved in the prior proceeding; (3) the issue or fact was critical and necessary to the judgment in the prior proceeding; (4) the judgment in the prior proceeding is final and valid; and (5) the party to be foreclosed by the prior resolution of the issue or fact had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue or fact in the prior proceeding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Kloth v.

Plaintiff does not address the issue preclusion argument in his memorandum opposing DMAS's Motion. For the reasons below, the Court finds that issue preclusion does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The first, second, fourth and fifth elements are satisfied in the present case. The state action immunity issue presently before the Court is identical to the one decided by Judge Kiser in the Western District Case.\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269575\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/230/498/\">\n    230 F.Supp.3d at 505-07\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Judge Kiser resolved the immunity issue, and his dismissal of Plaintiff's action against DMAS was based in part on that immunity determination.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269575\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/230/498/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269575\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/230/498/\">\n    at 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover,\n   Plaintiff clearly had a full and fair opportunity to be heard, as the dismissal came after the court heard arguments from both parties.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269575\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/230/498/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269575\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/230/498/\">\n    at 505-07\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Lastly, the dismissal operates as a final and valid order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   With regard to the third element, the Court must consider whether the determination that state action immunity applied to DMAS was critical and necessary to the dismissal of the complaint against DMAS. In\n   <em>\n    Ritter v. Mount St. Mary's College\n   </em>\n   , the Fourth Circuit found that \"where the court in the prior suit has determined two issues, either of which could independently support the result, then neither determination is considered essential to the judgment.

While clearly relying on DMAS's immunity as one basis for his dismissal of Plaintiff's action against it, Judge Kiser went on to determine that dismissal was also warranted because Plaintiff failed to meet the plausibility standard under\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269575\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/230/498/\">\n    230 F.Supp.3d at 508-09\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Because two independent reasons for dismissal of the claim against DMAS exist, collateral estoppel will not attach to the immunity determination from the Western District Case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

The clearly articulated policy standard is satisfied when \"the displacement of competition is the inherent, logical, or ordinary result of the exercise of authority delegated by the state legislature.\"\n   <em>\n    N.C. State Bd. of Dental Exam'rs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12586992\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1101/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 1112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted). The Code of Virginia authorizes DMAS to develop a plan for administering medical assistance services and further entrusts the Director of DMAS with the authority to enter into contracts that are \"necessary or incidental\" to DMAS performing the duties and executing the power it is invested with by law. Va. Code. Ann. \u00a7 32.1-325(A), (D)(1). Implicit in the authority to enter into contracts is the power to terminate them. Further, the displacement of some competition is the natural consequence of DMAS exercising its administrative authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Plaintiff does not appear to contest that the Commonwealth of Virginia has conferred this specific authority to DMAS or that the exercise of this authority would necessarily have an impact on the competitive market. Instead, he contends that Virginia has not articulated a clear policy allowing DMAS to engage in anticompetitive conduct. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 52-54, 70.) As detailed above, however, there is no requirement that a state explicitly endorse the anticompetitive effects of a clearly articulated policy. Rather, those effects need only be the inherent, logical, or ordinary result of exercising the delegated authority. In this case, the exclusion or inclusion of various service providers is the obvious and foreseeable result of the exercise of the administrative authority that the Virginia General Assembly delegated to DMAS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   For these reasons, DMAS has satisfied the clearly articulated policy prong of the\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   Immunity analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   DMAS is not subject to the active supervision requirement. The primary mission of DMAS is the provision of medical assistance services and not the regulation or licensure of members of the dental profession.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Va.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2032.1-323\">\n    Va.

It is overseen by the Secretary of Human Resources and the Director of DMAS, who is appointed by the Governor and subject to confirmation by the General Assembly. To the extent the DMAS Board is relevant to the actions underlying this case, only a minority of its members are health care providers.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    N.C.

Plainly put, the concern animating the Court's active supervision line of cases-that private actors cloaked in the authority of the state will subvert public priorities to private self-interest-is not present with DMAS, which functions as a prototypical state agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiff's arguments that DMAS requires active supervision are unavailing. Plaintiff essentially contends that in making its decision to terminate him DMAS relied on the opinions and suggestions of active market participants and therefore \"ceased to maintain an objective approach to Plaintiff.\" (Compl. \u00b6 55.) Conspicuously absent from the Complaint is any allegation that DMAS-the entity which ultimately made the decision to terminate Plaintiff-is controlled by market participants. Plaintiff instead alleges that DMAS \"conspired\" or \"agreed\" with the other Defendants to exclude him from the Medicaid market. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 29, 59.)

Plaintiff essentially contends that DMAS ordered Dentaquest to terminate its contract with Plaintiff only after agreeing with Defendants Dickinson, Parris-Wilkins, Black and Harvey that Defendant Harvey would fill the gap created by Plaintiff's termination. It is undisputed, however, that Plaintiff's contract allowed for termination without cause. It is also undisputed that DMAS and Dentaquest were the only entity with the authority to terminate Plaintiff's contract. That the individual Defendants may have lobbied for Plaintiff's termination or even agreed with DMAS that Plaintiff should be removed from the Smiles for Children program does not change the fact that the power to exclude Plaintiff from the program rested with DMAS and Dentaquest. As the Court stated in\n   <em>\n    Omni\n   </em>\n   , \"it is both inevitable and desirable that public officials [will] agree to do what one or another group of private citizens urges upon them.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318959\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/365/#p374\">\n    499 U.S. at 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318959\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/365/#p374\">\n    111 S.Ct. 1344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Also noticeably absent from the Complaint is any explanation as to how the individual Defendants could have conceivably excluded Plaintiff from the SFC program market wielding powers that they did not have. Plaintiff broadly claims that \"[DMAS], Dentaquest ... and the [i]ndividual\n   Defendants have exercised the power to exclude dentists from competing in the relevant service markets. These Defendants have the power and perceived power to provide contracts, issue finds, and order dentists to take or refrain from certain conduct.\" (Compl. \u00b6 58.)

The fact that Defendant Dickinson communicated with Defendant Black on the progress of Plaintiff's termination does not suggest that the two were working together to bring the termination about. The fact that Defendant Harvey had advanced knowledge of Plaintiff's termination and took steps to fill the gap created by his termination does not suggest that he was active in causing the termination.

Plaintiff's loss of his \"niche\" practice due to the decision by DMAS to terminate his contact and to contract with a replacement service provider is not the type of injury that the antitrust laws were designed to prevent. The Complaint contains no plausible allegations that this decision by DMAS will produce anticompetitive results in the relevant market. Plaintiff's contention that his termination will serve as a deterrent to others seeking to enter the market is a conclusion that is not tethered to any specific factual allegations. Moreover, while DMAS's decision to remove Plaintiff as a service provider may have had the effect of\n   shutting him out of the Medicaid market, that is the natural consequence of substituting one contractor for another.\n   <em>\n    Drs.

In this case, Plaintiff's contract was terminable by either party without cause. Plaintiff's alleged injury stems from the termination of his contract and Defendant Harvey's practice filling the coverage gap created by his termination. According to Plaintiff, this has had the effect of shutting him out of the relevant market. But, because Plaintiff narrowly defines the relevant market as participation in the Over 21 SFC program, any termination by Dentaquest would have resulted in Plaintiff's exclusion from the relevant market. In essence, he is attempting to use the Sherman Act to make an end-run around his at-will contract. The antitrust laws were not created to protect against this type of injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Plaintiff failed to allege the requisite agreement to restrain trade and failed to demonstrate that he suffered an antitrust injury. As such, the Sherman Act claim will be dismissed with prejudice\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    4. State Law Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In addition to his claim under the Sherman Act, Plaintiff alleges five counts under various state laws. The Court's original jurisdiction over this action stems from the presence of a federal question based upon the Sherman Act count.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Now that the sole federal question presented in this case has been dismissed, the Court will decline to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). As such, the remaining state law counts will be dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Complaint will be dismissed. Consequently, Defendant Harvey's Motion to Transfer Venue will be denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Court additionally notes that it gave serious consideration to imposing sanctions in this case. The protracted history of this litigation reveals that Plaintiff has had ample opportunity to have his Sherman Act claims heard. Rather than address the deficiencies identified with particularity by Judge Kiser, Plaintiff re-filed a nearly identical Complaint in this District. The most substantive change by Plaintiff was the addition of Defendant Parris-Wilkins, whom he alleges engaged in a conspiracy that occurred more than two years before he alleges any conduct on her part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Plaintiff's filings in Opposition to the Motions to Dismiss are similarly, if not more egregiously, inadequate. Plaintiff quite apparently copied wholesale from filings he made in the Western District Case, often with limited applicability. For instance, the second page of his Opposition to Defendants DMAS and Parris-Wilkins's Motion contains a paragraph that references a \"First Amended Complaint\" and the \"Blue Ridge Defendants.\" Plaintiff has not defined any group of Defendants by\n   that term in this case and the Complaint in this case has not been amended. Instead, this paragraph appears verbatim in a Response in Opposition to a Motion to Dismiss filed by Plaintiff in the Western District Case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Civil Case No. 4:16-cv-43 (W.D. Va. 2017), ECF No. 52.) Additionally, Defendants DMAS and Parris-Wilkins point out that several of the arguments advanced by Plaintiff's Opposition appear to stem from an entirely different case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants DMAS and Parris-Wilkins Reply 3, n. 1, ECF No. 22.) And Plaintiff generally failed to address several of the points raised by all the Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In spite of these questionable tactics, the Court does not feel that imposing sanctions is appropriate at this time. However, subsequent filings by Plaintiff attempting to rehash this same claim against these same Defendants will be viewed by this Court as an attempt to harass and will not engender a favorable response. Plainly put, if Plaintiff again charts the same course he has in this case, his path will likely include penalties under Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   An appropriate Order will accompany this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Defendants Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services (\"DMAS\") and Dr. Tonya Parris-Wilkins, DDS (\"Parris-Wilkins\") filed a joint motion on August 25, 2017.
