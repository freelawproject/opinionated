The Court heard argument on all four motions at a hearing held on September 9, 2016. For the reasons\n   discussed below, the motions to dismiss (DE 78; DE 82; DE 83; DE 87) are\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case is about defective airbag control units (\"ACUs\") that are featured in an unascertained number of vehicles across the United States. As of September 8, 2016, 630,004 vehicles in the United States were subject to a \"warning or recall\" related to the defective ACUs. (DE 50 \u00b6 1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   DE 121 at 1). According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\"NHTSA\"), which initiated a preliminary investigation into the defective ACUs in August 2015, up to five million vehicles in the United States may eventually be subject to such warning or recall. (DE 50 \u00b6\u00b6 12, 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A properly functioning ACU \"controls the airbag and other safety systems, including seatbelt pre-tensioners\" within a vehicle, and causes these systems \"to deploy rapidly during an automobile collision.\" (DE 50 \u00b6 3). But a faulty electrical connection within the power supply component (\"ASIC\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the defective ACUs at issue in this case causes the \"airbags and other safety systems not to deploy during crashes\" (DE 50 \u00b6 11) as well as \"unexpected deployments\" of the airbags and other safety systems (DE 50 \u00b6 9). Honda and Mercedes Benz manufacture vehicles containing the defective ACUs, including the 2008, 2009, and 2010 model Honda Accord and the 2008 and 2009 model Mercedes Benz C Class. (DE 50 \u00b6 1). Continental manufactures the defective ACUs (DE 50 \u00b6\u00b6 15, 77) and Atmel supplies Continental with the ASIC that is allegedly the source of the defect (DE 50 \u00b6\u00b6 6, 78). Plaintiffs are thirteen individuals who purchased vehicles containing the defective ACUs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Three purchased vehicles manufactured\n   by Mercedes Benz, six purchased vehicles manufactured by Honda, and four purchased vehicles manufactured by non-party FCA US LLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs purport to be the class representatives for a nationwide class (DE 50 \u00b6 96), a Florida sub-class (DE 50 \u00b6 97), a New Jersey sub-class (DE 50 \u00b6 98), a Michigan sub-class (DE 50 \u00b6 99), and a Louisiana sub-class (DE 50 \u00b6\u00b6 100). Their Complaint alleges that Defendants knew about the defective ACUs well before they disclosed this knowledge to NHTSA in late 2015 and early 2016. (DE 50 \u00b6\u00b6 6-18). Specifically, it alleges that Continental manufactured the defective ACUs from at least 2006 through the end of 2010, and that Continental, Atmel, and MBUSA became aware of the defective ACUs in January 2008 after \"Continental ... received an air bag control unit that Mercedes Benz ... removed from a vehicle whose owner complained of an illuminated airbag warning light.\" (DE 50 \u00b6 6). After Continental examined this unit and determined the ASIC to be the source of the defect, it sent the ACU to Atmel, which determined that \"corrosion in the ASIC's semiconductor material could cause interruptions in electrical connections in the ASIC, leading to failure of the ASIC component.\" (DE 50 \u00b6 6). Continental and Atmel then \"allegedly implemented countermeasures to prevent the defect from continuing\" but \"these countermeasures failed, if they were implemented at all.\" (DE 50 \u00b6 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Complaint also alleges several other events in the years between 2008 and 2015 which suggest that Defendants had knowledge of the defective ACUs before disclosing the defects to NHTSA (DE 50 \u00b6\u00b6 13-14):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 In early 2011, Continental, Atmel, Mercedes Benz, and non-party FCA US LLC \"became aware of two unexpected deployments of airbags and other safety systems\" in vehicles featuring the defective ACU. (DE 50 \u00b6 9).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 In March 2013, Mercedes Benz, \"based on its actual knowledge\" of the defective ACUs, \"initiated a campaign\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     outside\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   the U.S. to address\" the defective ACUs but \"failed to take similar action\" in the United States. (DE 50 \u00b6 10) (emphasis in original).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 In early 2014, Continental \"was named as a defendant in a suit relating to the recall of millions of General Motors-manufactured vehicles as a result of a defect that potentially caused Continental-manufactured\n   airbags in those vehicles not to deploy.\" (DE 50 \u00b6 15).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 In late 2014, \"Audi recalled approximately 850,000 vehicles as a result of a different defect in Continental-manufactured airbags that also potentially caused the Continental-manufactured airbags not to deploy.\" (DE 50 \u00b6 15).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 In early 2015, Continental, Atmel, and Honda \"became aware of additional cars\" with defective ACUs that \"caused airbags and other safety systems not to deploy during crashes,\" including one Honda vehicle \"involved in an accident in 2013\" that was the subject of a lawsuit against Honda and another Honda vehicle \"involved in an accident in 2015\" that was \"the subject of a complaint\" to NHTSA. (DE 50 \u00b6 11).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 Finally, in August 2015, NHTSA began its investigation into the \"scope, frequency, and consequence\" of the defective ACUs in Honda-manufactured vehicles. (DE 50 \u00b6 12).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Accordingly, Plaintiffs contend that even though Continental, Atmel, and Mercedes Benz knew about the defective ACUs \"by 2008, at the latest\" (DE 50 \u00b6\u00b6 17, 87) and that Honda knew about the defective ACUs \"by early 2015, at the latest\" (DE 50 \u00b6\u00b6 18, 87), Defendants \"concealed their knowledge of the nature and extent of the defects from the public\" (DE 50 \u00b6 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On these facts, the Complaint advances-on behalf of various classes and sub-classes-four causes of action against MBUSA, five causes of action against Honda, ten causes of action against Continental, and thirteen causes of action against Atmel:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 Count 1 on behalf of a nationwide class against all Defendants for violations of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act (\"MMWA\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 Count 2 on behalf of a nationwide class against all Defendants for fraudulent concealment;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 Count 3 on behalf of a nationwide class against the Airbag Manufacturer Defendants for violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\"RICO\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 Count 4 on behalf of a Florida sub-class against all Defendants for violations of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (\"FDUTPA\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 Count 5 on behalf of a Florida sub-class against all Defendants for fraudulent concealment;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 Count 6 on behalf of a New Jersey sub-class against Continental, Atmel, and Honda for violation of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act (\"NJCFA\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 Count 7 on behalf of a Michigan sub-class against Continental and Atmel for violation of the Michigan Consumer Protection Act (\"MCPA\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 Count 8 on behalf of a Michigan sub-class against Continental and Atmel for silent fraud;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 Count 9 on behalf of a Michigan sub-class against Continental and Atmel for fraud;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 Count 10 on behalf of a nationwide class against Atmel for violations of the California Unfair Competition Law (\"CUCL\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 Count 11 on behalf of a nationwide class against Atmel for violations of the California False Advertising Law (\"CFAL\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 Count 12 on behalf of a nationwide class against Atmel for violations of the California Consumers Legal Remedies Act (\"CLRA\"); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \u2022 Count 13 on behalf of a Louisiana sub-class against Continental and Atmel for fraudulent concealment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Based on these causes of action, Plaintiffs request myriad relief, including: (1) certification of all proposed classes and subclasses; (2) a declaration that the defective ACUs were in fact defective; (3) a declaration that Defendants are financially responsible for notifying all class members about the defective nature of the vehicles containing the defective ACUs; (4) an injunction preventing Defendants from \"further deceptive distribution, sales, and lease practices\" with regards to vehicles containing the defective ACUs and requiring Defendants to \"permanently, expeditiously, and completely repair\" vehicles containing the defective ACUs and eliminate the defective ACUs; (5) compensatory, exemplary, and statutory damages; (6) damages for the return of the purchase prices of all vehicles containing the defective ACUs and the reasonable expenses occasioned by sale; (7) establishment of a Defendant-funded program under which out-of-pocket expenses and damages claims associated with the defective ACUs can be made and paid; (8) a declaration that Defendants disgorge \"all or part of the ill-gotten profits received from the sale or lease of vehicles containing the defective ACUs; (9) attorneys' fees and costs; (10) pre-judgment and post-judgment interest; and (11) permission to amend the Complaint \"to conform to the evidence produced during discovery and at trial.\" (DE 50 at 68-70).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

They also assert that \"some of Plaintiffs' claims arise out of Defendants'... committing a tortious act in this state[.]\" (DE 98 at 6). But these generalized statements-devoid of specificity as to Honda and in tension with specific allegations elsewhere in the Complaint-do not support an inference that Honda committed a tortious act in Florida as contemplated by Section 48.193(1)(a)(2). Indeed, the Complaint states only that Honda \"conducts the sale, marketing, and operational activities for Honda cars, trucks, and sport utility vehicles automobile parts in the United States\" (DE 50 \u00b6 84); \"manufactures and assembles its vehicles for sale in the United States in automobile plants located in Greensburg, Indiana; East Liberty, Ohio; Lincoln, Alabama; and Marysville, Ohio\" (DE 50 \u00b6 84); and that four Florida Plaintiffs purchased or leased Honda vehicles in Florida (DE 50 \u00b6\u00b6 35, 38, 62, 65). Notably, and contrary to Plaintiffs' suggestion in their briefing,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Complaint does not allege that these purchases or leases were from a Honda-affiliated dealer in Florida. Thus, the Complaint is insufficient to support specific\n   personal jurisdiction under a \"stream of commerce\" theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Plaintiffs' reliance on\n   <em>\n    Bolton v.

In that case, the court reversed and remanded the trial court's dismissal of claims against an out-of-state defendant for lack of personal jurisdiction because \"delivery of a defective product into Florida for placement in the stream of commerce ... constitute[d] 'committing a tortious act within this state' as provided\" in the predecessor to Section 48.193(1)(a)(2). However, in\n   <em>\n    Bolton,\n   </em>\n   there were particular allegations that the out-of-state defendant, \"pursuant to a contractual relationship\" with a co-defendant Florida corporation, \"delivere[d] conversion vans to [the Florida co-defendant]\n   <strong>\n    in Florida\n   </strong>\n   for placement into the stream of commerce in Florida.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7569928\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/521/327/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). In contrast, Plaintiffs offer only the unsupported inference that Honda delivered its vehicles into Florida for placement into the stream of commerce through a contract or otherwise and the allegation that Honda manufactures and markets its vehicles \"in the United States.\" (DE 50 \u00b6 84). As such, the Complaint's allegations do not support the Court's specific personal jurisdiction over Honda. Therefore, the Court dismisses Counts 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   as alleged against Honda without prejudice, but will afford Plaintiffs another chance to allege sufficient facts in support of the Court's personal jurisdiction over Honda.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

MBUSA first argues that Plaintiffs lack Article III standing to pursue these claims and that their NHTSA-supervised recall of the defective ACUs renders Plaintiffs' claims prudentially moot. Next, MBUSA contends that Florida's economic loss rule bars the fraud claims against them. Finally, MBUSA asserts that Plaintiffs fail to state fraud claims for a variety of other reasons, including failure to allege supporting facts with the specificity required by Rule 9(b). The Court finds that although Plaintiffs have standing to pursue most of their claims against MBUSA, each of the Complaint's counts against MBUSA fail to sufficiently state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Standing and Prudential Mootness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   MBUSA's motion first seeks dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), contending that the three Plaintiffs who purchased or leased Mercedes Benz vehicles-Leon, Paz, and Morrow-lack standing for four reasons. First, it contends that Mercedes Benz's voluntarily initiated program to recall certain vehicles and replace certain parts free of charge moots Leon and Paz's claims. Second, it argues that Morrow lacks standing because she does not own a vehicle that was subject to this recall and repair program. Third, it asserts that Leon, Paz, and Morrow-all of whom purchased Mercedes Benz C-Class vehicles-cannot bring claims on behalf of owners of Mercedes Benz vehicle models different from those that they did purchase. Fourth, it argues that Leon, Paz, and Morrow-all\n   Florida plaintiffs who purchased their vehicles in Florida-cannot bring claims on behalf of a nationwide class.

Accordingly, Leon and Paz seek to recoup the \"lost benefit of the bargain [and] the diminished value of their [d]efective [v]ehicles\" (DE 97 at 7) from Mercedes Benz-the same company that manufactured their vehicles. Moreover, the scope of the relief requested here-which includes \"awarding Plaintiffs ... damages for the return of the purchase prices of the Defective Vehicles\"; \"establishing a Defendant-funded program ... under which out-of-pocket expenses and damages claims associated with the [defective ACUs] ... can be made and paid\"; and \"disgorg[ing] ... all or part of the ill-gotten profits received from the sale or lease of vehicles containing the defective ACUs-exceeds both the scope of the relief requested in\n   <em>\n    Hadley\n   </em>\n   and the scope of the already-performed recall and repairs here.

Accordingly, the analysis in\n   <em>\n    Hadley\n   </em>\n   does not support dismissal of Leon's or Paz's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   MBUSA also relies on\n   <em>\n    Winzler v.

Notably, the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Winzler\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Cheng\n   </em>\n   requested only declaratory and injunctive relief through a court-ordered recall and did not seek damages. Thus, as the court observed in\n   <em>\n    Philips v.

July 15, 2016) (\"Because the recalls, even those sufficient to remedy the defects, do not compensate Plaintiffs fully for the damages sought here, the Court declines to exercise its discretion to dismiss the remaining claims as prudentially moot.\"). Because MBUSA's initiation\n   of a recall does not render all of Plaintiffs' claims moot as did the recalls in\n   <em>\n    Winzler\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Cheng,\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs may still be able to recover economic losses should their claims succeed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Second, MBUSA attacks Plaintiff Morrow's standing to bring any claims against MBUSA because her vehicle was not subject to MBUSA's voluntary 2015 recall and reimbursement program. This argument also relies on Lowery's declaration, which states that Morrow's vehicle was \"produced on April 24, 2009\" and contains a \"control unit module that was manufactured according to a different process than those at issue\" in the vehicles that Mercedes Benz recalled in 2015. (DE 80 \u00b6 9). Although Lowery's declaration brings into question the Complaint's allegation that Morrow's vehicle \"is subject to the recall\" (DE 50 \u00b6 69), it has no impact on the Court's standing inquiry. The Complaint expressly states that some vehicles which contain the defective ACU have not yet been subject to recall; indeed, the Complaint states the \"manufacturing defect in the [d]efective [ACUs] dates back to at least 2006\n   <strong>\n    and continued through the end of 2010\n   </strong>\n   \" (DE 50 \u00b6 6) (emphasis added) and that any \"countermeasure[s]\" taken to resolve the defect from March 2008 onward \"failed, if they were implemented\n   at all\" (DE 50 \u00b6 8). Consequently, at this stage in the litigation, the Court cannot reasonably infer from Lowery's declaration that Morrow's vehicle does not contain the defective ACU and that Morrow lacks standing to bring claims against MBUSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Third, MBUSA raises the meritorious argument that Leon, Paz, and Morrow-all of whom purchased Mercedes Benz C Class model vehicles in Florida-have no standing to bring Counts 1, 2, 4, and 5 on behalf of owners of Mercedes Benz GLK Class model vehicles. In support, MBUSA cites several cases from this District which hold that a class representative in a consumer class action may not bring claims on behalf of purchasers of a product that the representative did not herself purchase.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bohlke v.

(DE 50 \u00b6\u00b6 1, 4). Next, they correctly point out that some courts in other districts have allowed class claims on behalf of purchasers of products that the named plaintiff did not purchase, so long as those products are sufficiently similar to a product that the named plaintiff did purchase.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Glenn v.

First, they argue that Florida law does not require privity of contract to establish an implied warranty, citing\n   <em>\n    Manheim v. Ford Motor Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9782676\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/201/440/\">\n    201 So.2d 440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 1967). In\n   <em>\n    Manheim,\n   </em>\n   the Florida Supreme Court reversed summary judgment for an automobile manufacturer, holding that \"the absence of privity between the manufacturer and a purchaser\" of a defective 1964 Lincoln Continental four-door convertible did not \"preclude recovery on the basis of implied warranty of a product due to its defects and lack of fitness and suitability.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9782676\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/201/440/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9782676\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/201/440/\">\n    at 442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the Florida Supreme Court later abrogated this decision by\n   holding that it \"abolished the no-privity, breach of implied warranty cause of action for personal injury upon its adoption of the doctrine of strict liability in tort.\"\n   <em>\n    Kramer v. Piper Aircraft Corp.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7560374\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/520/37/#p39\">\n    520 So.2d 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 39 (Fla. 1988) (citing\n   <em>\n    West v.

Thus, subsequent implied warranty cases have required privity and Florida appellate courts have affirmed dismissals of claims that do not sufficiently allege privity.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cerasani v. Am. Honda Motor Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9012392\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/916/843/#p847\">\n    916 So.2d 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 847 (Fla. 2d DCA 2005) (affirming dismissal of breach of implied warranty claim where plaintiff failed to the allege privity of contract with automobile manufacturer defendant);\n   <em>\n    Rentas v. DaimlerChrysler Corp.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8476320\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/936/747/#p751\">\n    936 So.2d 747\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 751 (Fla. 4th DCA 2006) (same). Thus, privity is required to state a breach of implied warranty claim under Florida law and Plaintiffs have not alleged privity here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs argue that MBUSA may not raise the privity defense where Plaintiffs are the \"intended third-party beneficiaries of MBUSA's warranty.\" (DE 97 at 14). This argument relies primarily on\n   <em>\n    Sanchez-Knutson,\n   </em>\n   in which another court of this District held that although\n   <em>\n    Kramer\n   </em>\n   overruled\n   <em>\n    Manheim,\n   </em>\n   a \"[p]laintiff can pursue a claim of breach of implied warranty through third-party beneficiary status.\"\n   <em>\n    Sanchez-Knutson,\n   </em>\n   52 F.Supp.3d at 1333-34. However, the complaint in\n   <em>\n    Sanchez-Knutson\n   </em>\n   featured specific allegations regarding how the plaintiff obtained her allegedly defective vehicle, including that she purchased it from an authorized dealership over which the defendant automobile manufacturer appeared to exercise control.\n   <em>\n    Sanchez-Knutson v. Ford Motor. Co.,\n   </em>\n   No. 14-cv-61344, DE 1 \u00b6\u00b6 12, 34-35 (S.D. Fla. June 9, 2014). Here, Plaintiffs offer no facts about the persons or entities from whom they obtained their Mercedes Benz vehicles, let alone that MBUSA exercised any degree of control over them. A claim for a breach of implied warranty under a third-party beneficiary theory, if it exists, does not arise from the conclusory assertion that Plaintiffs were \"the intended third-party beneficiaries of contracts between Defendants and its dealers.\" (DE 50 \u00b6 129). Therefore, Plaintiffs' MMWA claim against MBUSA is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Counts 2 and 5: Fraudulent Concealment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   MBUSA next contends that Counts 2 and 5, which the Florida Plaintiffs Leon, Paz, and Morrow bring on behalf of a nationwide class and a Florida sub-class, respectively, fail pursuant to Florida's economic loss rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court agrees. Florida's economic loss rule applies in products liability cases to preclude \"recovery of economic damages in tort where there is no property damage or personal injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Tiara Condo.

In\n   <em>\n    Tiara,\n   </em>\n   the Florida Supreme Court explained that \"[t]he rule has its roots in the products liability arena, and was primarily intended to limit actions in the products liability context.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7003010\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/110/399/#p404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7003010\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/110/399/#p404\">\n    at 401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, the court explained the economic loss rule is \"the fundamental boundary between contract law, which is designed to enforce the expectancy interests of the parties, and tort law, which imposes a duty of reasonable care and thereby encourages citizens to avoid causing physical harm to others.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7003010\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/110/399/#p404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7003010\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/110/399/#p404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Counts 2 and 5, in which Plaintiffs allege MBUSA's fraudulent concealment of defects and request\n   diminished value damages despite alleging no specific property damage or personal injury, are precisely the type of claim barred by this rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Plaintiffs respond by characterizing their fraudulent concealment claims as fraudulent inducement claims based on their allegations that Defendants including MBUSA \"concealed and/or suppressed material facts concerning the safety\" of Plaintiffs' vehicles (DE 50 \u00b6 140) and that this \"concealment was material\" to Plaintiffs' purchasing decisions (DE 50 \u00b6 195). Relying on this characterization, Plaintiffs argue that the Florida Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Tiara\n   </em>\n   acknowledged an exception to Florida's economic loss rule for claims of \"fraudulent inducement, and negligent misrepresentation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tiara,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7003010\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/110/399/#p404\">\n    110 So.3d at 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiffs contend that eight facts contained in the Complaint-two of which are not alleged as part of the RICO cause of action-satisfy Rule 9(b) : (1) the Atmel and Continental enterprise implemented unspecified countermeasures to correct the defective ACUs and informed customers of these countermeasures while failing to issue a warning or recall (DE 50 \u00b6\u00b6 8, 156); (2) Atmel made \"material statements about the safety and reliability\" of the defective ACUs between 2007 and 2008 (DE 50 \u00b6 277)\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; (3) Continental shipped parts that contained the countermeasures to nonparty Chrysler via interstate mail without documenting the change in Chrysler's systems (DE 50 \u00b6\u00b6 8, 157); (4) Continental similarly shipped such parts without documenting the changes to Mercedes Benz and Honda (DE 50 \u00b6\u00b6 8, 157); (5) Continental issued a September 2009 press release regarding its \"aim ... to improve vehicle passenger safety\" including \"[a]irbags and other safety systems\" (DE 50 \u00b6 176d)\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; (6) the enterprise became aware of unexpected deployments of airbags in vehicles containing the defective ACUs in 2011 but failed to disclose the full scope of the defect until early 2016 (DE 50 \u00b6\u00b6 9, 156); (7) the enterprise became aware of \"additional cars\" with defective ACUs in early 2015, but failed to disclose the full scope of the defect until\n   early 2016 (DE 50 \u00b6\u00b6 11, 14); and (8) from 2008 to 2016, the Airbag Manufacturer Defendants \"were in regular contact\" about the defective ACUs (DE 50 \u00b6 158).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Plaintiffs claim that these allegations support the Complaint's conclusory statement that \"Airbag Manufacturer Defendants comprised and comprise an association-in-fact enterprise ... [with] the common purpose to conceal ... the defective [ACU] problems ... [which] was formed by at least 2008.\" (DE 50 \u00b6\u00b6 154-56). They argue that the Airbag Manufacturer Defendants \"operated or managed\" this enterprise because they knew about the defective ACUs and made public statements about the ACUs, yet did not institute a recall or warn authorities or the public about the defect. (DE 50 \u00b6\u00b6 8, 154-58). However, as in\n   <em>\n    Brooks,\n   </em>\n   the allegations pertaining to whether Airbag Manufacturer Defendants \"operated or managed\" an \"enterprise\" do not distinguish between Atmel and Continental and therefore fail to provide each with fair notice of the claims against them. For instance, Plaintiffs do not specify which Defendant implemented what countermeasures, when each Defendant became aware of the unexpected deployments of airbags in 2011, and when each Defendant became aware of \"additional cars\" with the defective ACUs in early 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Even putting aside the lack of specificity about the conduct of each Defendant, these allegations also do not establish that a RICO \"enterprise\" existed. For example, the \"regular contact\" between Airbag Manufacturer Defendants from 2008 to 2016 does not mention who at each company was in contact, what they were in contact about, or when, where, and how\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   these communications occurred and constituted a part of the scheme. Thus, the Complaint presents almost no detail-let alone the precise detail required by Rule 9(b) -to support the notion that there was \"a purpose, relationships among those associated with the enterprise, and longevity sufficient to permit these associates to pursue the enterprise's purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Ray,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354095\" index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/1340/#p1348\">\n    836 F.3d at 1352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Boyle,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653895\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/938/#p944\">\n    556 U.S. at 946\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653895\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/938/#p944\">\n    129 S.Ct. 2237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Without such allegations, the Complaint does not establish that the Airbag Manufacturer Defendants \"operated or managed\" an \"enterprise.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Next, Plaintiffs' allegations pertaining to the purported predicate acts-mail and wire fraud-also do not rise to the level of specificity required to state a civil RICO claim pursuant to Rule 9(b). Plaintiffs respond that the Complaint sufficiently describes two or more acts of mail or wire fraud by including allegations regarding the Airbag Manufacturer Defendants' \"knowing shipment of defective goods, specific communications between them conspiring to conceal the defect, failure to timely disclose the defect to both NHTSA and the public, and active concealment of ongoing malfunctions after countermeasures were implemented.\" (DE 99 at 17; DE 100 at 24;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   DE 50 \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8, 17, 23, 156-58). However, the Complaint fails to specify who at Continental shipped what remediated parts to Chrysler, Mercedes Benz, or Honda; when or where these shipments occurred; or how these shipments constituted part of a scheme to defraud. That \"Continental sent the ASIC\" (DE 50 \u00b6 6) it received from Mercedes Benz in January 2008 to Atmel is similarly unhelpful in that there is no description of what role this played in the alleged scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Finally, the Complaint also states that Airbag Manufacturer Defendants breached\n   a \"duty to disclose\" information to NHTSA and the public. But violation of the only statutory duty pled in the Complaint-the duty to disclose information to NHTSA pursuant to the Motor Vehicle Safety Act-cannot be a RICO predicate act.\n   <em>\n    Ayres v.

Further, Plaintiffs never allege what each Airbag Manufacturer Defendant stood to gain from the alleged acts of mail and wire fraud or how those acts deceived Plaintiffs as opposed to vehicle manufacturer clients. Finally, the Complaint fails to describe sufficiently the nature or content of the public statements or internal communications that allegedly aided the Airbag Manufacturer Defendants' concealment of the defective ACUs. Consequently, the Complaint does not allege a \"pattern\" of \"racketeering activity\" pursuant to Rule 9(b) and cannot support Plaintiffs' RICO claim.

As to 12(b)(2) motions, the Eleventh Circuit held that \"[w]hen a jurisdictional motion to dismiss depends, as in this case, on the assertion of a right created by a federal statute, the court should dismiss for lack of jurisdiction only if 'the right claimed is so insubstantial, implausible, foreclosed by prior decisions of this Court, or otherwise devoid of merit as not to involve a federal controversy.' \"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 941 (quoting\n    <em>\n     IUE AFL-CIO Pension Fund v.

Airbag Manufacturer Defendants argue that because the Complaint's RICO claim requests \"diminished value\" damages (DE 50 \u00b6 164a, 164b), and because no Plaintiff has yet sold their vehicle or had a vehicle that manifested a defect, the Complaint does not allege the requisite injury to business or property. They also contend that the ACUs themselves caused the diminishment of value in Plaintiffs' vehicles-not any alleged scheme to conceal that the ACUs were defective. Plaintiffs respond that they suffered injury the moment they purchased or leased their vehicles under the false pretense that the vehicles had fully operational ACUs. (DE 99 at 20). They point to the Complaint's statement that these purchases or leases were the \"direct and proximate result\" (DE 50 \u00b6 164) of Atmel and Continental's failure to disclose the defective ACUs as required by the Safety Act-an assertion in significant tension with the Eleventh Circuit's holding that the Safety Act \"was not meant to create the kind of duty, a breach of which would create ... civil liability under our RICO statute.\"\n    <em>\n     Ayres v.

Finally, Plaintiffs claim that the damages that resulted from their injuries-i.e., their overpayments at the time of sale or lease-are recoverable under RICO. The Court observes that Plaintiffs' theories of RICO injury and causation do not follow clearly from the Complaint or from applicable case law. Nonetheless, because the Complaint fails to state the four elements of a RICO claim even assuming that Plaintiffs had standing, the Court declines to reach the RICO standing issue at this juncture.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"20\">\n   <p id=\"p-165\">\n    Plaintiffs cite a Second Circuit case for the proposition that \"allegations regarding the existence of an 'enterprise' are not subject to Rule 9(b).\" (DE 99 at 16).

They similarly argue for the lenient application of Rule 9(b) to their allegations on a \"pattern of racketeering activity\" because Plaintiffs \"do not know all the ongoing actions of Atmel and Continental, but clearly allege 'there is a substantial threat that the activities will continue in the future.' \" (DE 99 at 18-19; DE 50 \u00b6 163);\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Hill v.
