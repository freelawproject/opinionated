And because plaintiff had a full opportunity to oppose the motion, and treated it as a Rule 56 motion himself by submitting a cross-motion supported by a statement of facts and a declaration, as well as an opposition, the Court concludes that the parties have had an opportunity to present all the material pertinent to the motion, and that it is fair to both parties to convert defendants' motion to one for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hollis v.
