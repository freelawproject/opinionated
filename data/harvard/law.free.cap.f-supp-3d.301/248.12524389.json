The IFRs expand the religious exemption to the contraceptive mandate of the Affordable Care Act (\"ACA\") and create a new moral exemption to that mandate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Commonwealth of Massachusetts (\"plaintiff\" or \"the Commonwealth\") alleges that 1) the Departments did not engage in notice and comment rulemaking before issuing the IFRs in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2) the IFRs are not in accordance with law and exceed the defendants authority in violation of the APA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 3) the IFRs violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and 4) the IFRs violate the equal protection guarantee of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The Commonwealth requests that this Court declare the IFRs unlawful and permanently enjoin their implementation on a nationwide, universal basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pending before the Court are plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and defendants' cross-motion to dismiss or for summary judgment. Because the Commonwealth has failed to set forth specific facts establishing that it will likely suffer future injury from the defendants' conduct, it lacks standing to prosecute this action and defendants' motion for summary judgment will therefore be allowed and plaintiff's motion for summary judgment will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The contraceptive mandate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act generally requires that employer-sponsored healthcare plans include a range of preventive care services on a no-cost basis (\"the preventive services requirement\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2018022\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 18022\n   </extracted-citation>\n   &amp; 300gg-13. That requirement mandates no-cost coverage\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   with respect to women, ... as provided for in comprehensive guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration [\"HRSA\"].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   S. Amdt. 2791, 111\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Congress (2009-2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Thus, instead of including specific preventive care services, Congress delegated authority to HRSA, an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\"). HRSA and HHS enlisted the Institute of Medicine (\"IOM\"), which convened a committee to assess what preventive services should be included. The IOM recommended that the services include\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   the full range of Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for women with reproductive capacity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   IOM Report at 104.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Accordingly, when the HRSA promulgated its Women's Preventive Services Guidelines in August 2011, non-exempt employers were required to provide\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   coverage, without cost sharing, [for] [a]ll Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (\"the contraceptive mandate\"). Those guidelines went into effect in August, 2012. The HRSA updated the Women's Preventive Services Guidelines in December 2016, reaffirming that the Guidelines should continue to require full coverage for contraceptive care and services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Accommodations for religious objections to the contraceptive mandate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In 2011 and 2012, the Departments issued regulations automatically exempting churches and their integrated auxiliaries, conventions and associations of churches and the exclusively religious activities of religious orders from the contraceptive mandate. This \"Church Exemption\" corresponds to a category of employers defined in the Internal Revenue Code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%208725\">\n    77 Fed.

The accommodation created a system whereby insurers and third parties paid the full cost of contraceptive care and employees received seamless coverage (\"the accommodation process\"). That process was expanded to cover closely held, for-profit companies in response to\n   <em>\n    Burwell\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12582424\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2751/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 2751\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12582424\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2751/\">\n    189 L.Ed.2d 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014), in which the Supreme Court held that the contraceptive mandate violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (\"RFRA\") for certain closely-held, for-profit employers.

In May, 2016, those cases were remanded to their respective circuit courts for further consideration of whether the accommodation process could be altered to address the religious employers' concerns while still providing seamless contraceptive coverage. In January, 2017, after reviewing more than 50,000 comments, the Departments announced that the answer was \"No\".

Estimated Impact of the IFRs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Departments provided two estimates for the number of women who will\n   likely be affected by the IFRs nationwide. The first, lower, estimate is derived largely from the Departments' experience litigating the contraceptive mandate, the Church Exemption and the accommodation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Departments begin their estimate by excluding certain categories of employers as unlikely to avail themselves of the expanded exemptions. The Religious IFR estimates that, for certain categories of employers, no women of child bearing age that use contraception and had access to no-cost contraceptive care through their employer before the Religious IFR was put into effect would lose coverage because of the employer's availment of the Religious IFR. Although these employers would be transitioning from the accommodation to the exemption, the Departments estimated that the Religious IFR would have no effect on those employers' employees. That is because\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   the Departments continue to assume that such plans are similar to other objecting entities using self-insured church plans with respect to their third party administrators being unlikely to provide contraceptive coverage to plan participants and beneficiaries under the previous rule.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2047792\">\n    82 Fed.

For instance, the Departments state that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   although publicly traded entities could make use of exempt status under these interim final rules, the Departments do not expect that very many will do so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2047792\">\n    82 Fed.

Massachusetts state legislation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has addressed the issue of contraceptive access through state legislation. In 2002, the Commonwealth enacted the Contraceptive Equity Law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mass. St. 2002, ch. 49, \u00a7\u00a7 1-4. That statute requires employer-sponsored health plans that cover outpatient services, prescriptions or devices to provide the same level of coverage for all FDA-approved contraceptive services, prescriptions and devices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.G.L. c. 175, \u00a7 47W ; M.G.L. c. 176A, \u00a7 8W ; M.G.L. c. 176B, \u00a7 4W ; M.G.L. c. 176G, \u00a7 4O. The law does not mandate that those benefits be provided at no cost. Instead, covered citizens are still responsible for deductibles, copays and other cost-sharing payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In November, 2017, Massachusetts enacted \"an Act Relative to Advancing Contraceptive Coverage and Economic Security in Our State,\" otherwise known as the \"ACCESS Act\".\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mass. St. 2017, ch. 120. The bill was reported out of the House Committee on Financial Services on November 6, 2017, enacted on November 14, 2017, and signed into law on November 20, 2017. The statute has been described as \"codifying the Affordable Care Act's guarantee of no copay birth control coverage into state law.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"With Governor's Signature, Massachusetts protects birth control access\", Planned Parenthood Action Fund, Nov. 20, 2017, available online at https://perma.cc/44NZ-9RMC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The statute prohibits certain employer-sponsored health plans from imposing cost-sharing fees (such as co-pays and deductibles) in connection with the provision of contraceptives.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Mass. St. 2017, ch. 120, \u00a7 4 (providing that insurance contracts between a subscriber and corporations that provide benefits for outpatient services shall offer \"at least 1 drug, device or other product ... [for all] FDA approved contraceptive drugs, devices and other products [excluding male condoms and certain oral contraceptives] ... without cost-sharing\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The ACCESS Act includes no moral exemption. Churches and \"qualified church-controlled organization[s]\" are exempted from certain provisions of the Act, provided that they\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   provide written notice to prospective enrollees prior to enrollment with the plan and such notice shall list the contraceptive health care methods and services for which the employer will not provide coverage for religious reasons.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Mass.

As such, some employers that are able to invoke an exemption from the ACA mandate under the expanded exemptions of the IFRs are unable to invoke an exemption under the ACCESS Act mandate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Neither the ACCESS Act nor the Contraceptive Equity Law apply to self-insured employer plans. Rather, such plans are governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\"ERISA\").\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201144\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (b)(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Massachusetts' system of contraceptive care\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Commonwealth of Massachusetts \"supports access to contraceptive care and services through an interrelated system\" that includes direct coverage and reimbursements. In Massachusetts, Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (\"CHIP\") are combined into one program called MassHealth. Almost two million Massachusetts residents are enrolled\n   members of the program. Contraceptive services are a federally-mandated Medicaid benefit for eligible enrollees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In addition, MassHealth serves as a secondary payer for approximately 150,000 residents who have commercial coverage, including employer-sponsored insurance and student health insurance. This means that MassHealth provides \"wrap around\" coverage for certain services not provided by the resident's commercial insurance, including federally mandated Medicaid benefits such as contraceptive services. Should an employer avail itself of the religious or moral exemption in the IFRs, \"wrap around\" enrollees will be entitled to receive replacement coverage through MassHealth. Under federal law, the Commonwealth is responsible for paying 10% of all sums expended on the \"offering, arranging, and furnishing ... of family planning services and supplies.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b(a)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Sexual and Reproductive Health Program (\"SRHP\") of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (\"DPH\") reimburses a network of family planning program providers offering contraception in the Commonwealth. Approximately three-quarters of SRHP's funding emanates from state appropriation. The SRHP funds plans that offer low or no-cost contraceptive services to low-income Massachusetts residents, including all FDA-approved contraceptives. Those services are available to 1) uninsured Massachusetts residents whose income is less than 300% of the federal poverty level, 2) Massachusetts residents whose income is less than 300% of the federal poverty level with a health plan that does not cover all contraception methods and services and 3) Massachusetts residents of any insurance status who desire confidential care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The role of summary judgment is \"to pierce the pleadings and to assess the proof in order to see whether there is a genuine need for trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Mesnick\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gen.

On the other hand, it denies that the estimates render the IFRs \"arbitrary and capricious\" in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. Accordingly, although the parties quibble about whether various figures over (or under) estimate the number of affected women, the Court will assume that the Departments' figures comprise an accurate estimation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The Commonwealth adds the Departments' moral and religious exemption estimates together to reach a total of between 31,715 and 120,015 women of child-bearing age who are currently using contraception who will be affected by the IFRs nationwide. The Commonwealth then multiplies the Departments' nationwide estimate by the appropriate population percentage (2.1%) to conclude that \"between 666 and 2,520 Massachusetts women\" who are currently using contraception will likely lose comprehensive employer-sponsored contraceptive coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The Departments determined that the average financial transfer effect attributed to a woman's loss of contraception would be approximately $584 per year. Multiplying that $584 figure by the Commonwealth's affected employee estimates yields an increased annual out-of-pocket cost of contraceptives of between $388,944 and $1,471,680.

Most importantly, the Commonwealth does not address the \"ACCESS Act\", which was\n   enacted after the filing of this lawsuit. That state statute was reported out of the House Committee on Financial Services exactly one month after the IFRs were promulgated and was signed into law two weeks later. In its amended complaint and motion for summary judgment, the Commonwealth states that the statute was enacted to \"remedy [the] gap\" of the Contraceptive Equity Law, which, \"unlike the ACA ... does not mandate no-cost contraceptive coverage.\" At oral argument, counsel for the Commonwealth explained that the statute requires essentially the same coverage as the ACA mandate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The ACCESS Act does not protect all Massachusetts employees. It does not apply to self-insured employer plans, for instance, which are governed solely by federal law,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201144\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (b)(2)(A). Nevertheless, the Act will almost certainly compel some employers that would otherwise avail themselves of the expanded exemptions to provide their employees no-cost contraceptive coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Unlike the expanded religious exemption and the new moral exemption of the IFRs, the ACCESS Act includes a church exemption that mirrors the Church Exemption found in the Departments' previous regulations.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   M.G.L. c. 175, \u00a7 47W(c) (providing an exemption if the employer is a \"church or qualified church-controlled organization\")\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%208725\">\n    77 Fed. Reg. 8725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 8726 (providing an exemption for \"churches, their integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or associations of churches, as well as to the exclusively religious activities of any religious order\"). Thus, certain Massachusetts employers that were ineligible for the exemption under previous federal regulations and became eligible under the new IFRs, are not eligible for an exemption under the ACCESS Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   At oral argument, plaintiff's counsel emphasized that 60% of the State's workforce will not be covered by the protection afforded by the ACCESS Act. When the Court inquired about what kinds of employers the Commonwealth expects to use the expanded exemptions but not to be covered by the ACCESS Act, however, counsel responded that the relevant inquiry involves statistical probabilities and not individual employers. That approach produces further uncertainty. For instance, it is unclear how 60% of the Massachusetts workface overlaps with the 31% of employees in the private sector employed by publicly traded companies who the Departments estimate will not be affected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Without further information about the 60% of employers referred to, the Court cannot determine whether it is likely that the Commonwealth will incur a fiscal injury. It is clear that, given the new ACCESS Act, Massachusetts will be affected differently by the IFRs than other states but it is not at all clear how the coverage of the ACCESS Act will impact employers who may have intended to utilize the expanded exemptions. The Commonwealth, as well as this Court, is left to surmise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The Commonwealth has not established that it is likely that any Massachusetts employers will avail themselves of the IFRs' expanded exemptions.
