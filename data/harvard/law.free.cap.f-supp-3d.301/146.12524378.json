BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Pro se\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff Dennis Chase, a federal prisoner, seeks to obtain documents relating to his 2011 arrest, booking, and detention in Minnesota. To that end, he submitted several Freedom of Information Act requests to Defendants Department of Justice, Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys, U.S. Marshals Service, and Federal Bureau of Investigation in late 2015 and early 2016. When these requests were left unanswered for over a year, he filed this civil action to compel Defendants to respond. Defendants thereafter released several hundred pages of information; claiming that they have fully satisfied their FOIA obligations, they now move for summary judgment. Believing the opposite, Chase has cross-moved for summary judgment. Finding Defendants have adequately\n   complied with FOIA's dictates, the Court will grant their Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Beginning in November 2015, Plaintiff sent FOIA requests to USMS and EOUSA seeking,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , all records concerning his detention, arrest, booking, and criminal prosecution for the transportation and possession of child pornography in 2011.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 (Complaint), Exhs. A (USMS FOIA Request); E (EOUSA FOIA Request). Both agencies proceeded to request verification of identity-although EOUSA did so 44 days beyond the 20 business days required by FOIA-which Chase then provided.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., Exhs. A; B (US Marshal Verification Request); C (Certification of Identity); D (Letter to USMS); E; F (EOUSA Verification Request); G (Certification of Identity). Several months of follow-up calls by Chase and delayed or limited responses by EOUSA and USMS ensued.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. at 4-6. Having grown frustrated with this non-responsiveness, Plaintiff filed this Complaint on February 23, 2017. Spurred to action, those agencies then conducted a search for relevant documents and have now released 458 pages to Plaintiff, 15 of which are partially redacted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 28-2 (Declaration of Princina Stone), \u00b6 13; 28-9 (Declaration of William E. Bordley), \u00b6 7. EOUSA additionally referred approximately 1,216 pages of records to the FBI for its review and direct response to Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 28-11 (Declaration of David M. Hardy), \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Bureau then sent Plaintiff a letter notifying him that it had received the records from EOUSA and informing him of the estimated total cost for processing his request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hardy Decl., Exh. A. Chase responded with a request for a waiver of those fees pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2016.10\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 16.10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (K), which requires agencies to waive fees when disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2016.10\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2016.10\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Exh.

Unfortunately for Chase, however, this type of conduct does not render Defendants' search inadequate.

The Rule's grand-jury-secrecy requirement is applied broadly and embraces any information that \"tend[s] to reveal some secret aspect of the grand jury's investigation, [including] the identities of witnesses or jurors, the substance of testimony, the strategy or direction of the investigation, the deliberations or questions of jurors, and the like.\"\n   <em>\n    Lopez v.

In the absence of\n   a statutory exception to the general presumption of grand-jury secrecy-not an issue here- Rule 6 is \"quite clear that disclosure of matters occurring before the grand jury is the exception and not the rule,\" and \"the rule's ban on disclosure is for FOIA purposes absolute and falls within ...

Exemption 7(C) covers records that \"could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,\" while 7(E) protects documents that \"would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions.\" For either exemption, the Government must first show that the documents were in fact \"compiled for law enforcement purposes\" and not for some other reason.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pub.

Opp. &amp; MSJ at 9. Plaintiff's argument is a non-starter. Whether an agency provides a requester with documents free of charge above and beyond what it is required to by statute has no bearing on whether that\n   agency (or a receiving agency) may later charge that requester for additional material.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court, in fact, noting that Defendants had failed to comply with FOIA's timelines for processing requests and appeals, inquired,\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , whether their non-compliance constituted a waiver of their right to request fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 33 (Order).

While it is true that summary judgment for an agency may be inappropriate in such an instance because such conduct could undermine the reliability of affidavits the court must rely on,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hamilton Sec.

In addition to Defendants' repeated failures to respond to his requests before his Complaint was filed, Chase argues that they used \"needless stay[s] of proceedings,\" attempts \"to confuse the court,\" and other stalling methods to intentionally drag their feet in responding to his requests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Opp. &amp; MSJ at 13. As noted above, while Defendants are clearly not faultless for the delay in processing and releasing the initial batch of documents, mere delay in responding to a FOIA request is routinely found to be insufficient to support a finding of bad faith, even in cases where the agency delay is considerably longer than Defendants' year-long delay here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Competitive Enter.

In addition, Defendants' repeated failures to respond to Plaintiff's communications and apparent misplacement of some of his correspondence do not, without more, constitute bad faith.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Budik v.
