For the reasons set forth below, Defendants' motion is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Factual Background as Alleged by Plaintiff\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2000, Plaintiff began working as a police officer at the Framingham Police Department (\"FPD\"). First. Am. Compl. \u00b6 12. He was promoted to Police Sergeant in 2008, and to Police Lieutenant in 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Prior to his suspension, Plaintiff was the Commanding Officer of the FPD's Weapons Training Unit for roughly 3.5 years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. He was also the FPD's SWAT Team Leader, Tactical Operations Commander, liaison to the Massachusetts State Police STOP Team, and Shift Commander of the evening shift.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13, 15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant Simoneau joined the FPD as a dispatcher in the 1990s.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. During his time as a dispatcher, Simoneau also\n   attended the Massachusetts School of Law, passed the bar, and opened a private law practice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. At some time in the 1990s, Simoneau was given the honorific title of \"Special Police Officer\" by former FPD Chief of Police Brent Larrabee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. Under former FPD Chief of Police Steven Carl, Simoneau became the Assistant to the Chief and provided administrative assistance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that in 2013, around the time Chief Kenneth Ferguson became chief of the FPD, Simoneau's role and authority greatly increased.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. According to Plaintiff, Chief Ferguson gave Simoneau a gun (after a one-week basic firearms course for reserve officers), uniform, citation book, and police cruiser.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. Plaintiff raised concerns regarding Simoneau to Chief Ferguson on several occasions prior to April 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47. Around April 2015, Plaintiff informed Chief Ferguson that Simoneau had been conducting motor vehicle stops, responding to police calls, and appearing at active crime scenes, all without adequate screening, training, and experience, and that these actions were endangering the general public, compromising police investigations, and opening the FPD to significant legal liability.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46. The specific instances which Plaintiff contends led to his April 2015 report included, but were not limited to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-14\">\n   1) Plaintiff alleges that on October 5, 2014, while driving his personal vehicle, Simoneau allegedly conducted a motor vehicle stop in which he allowed both occupants to exit the vehicle, allowed the passenger to walk away, and allowed the driver to return to the vehicle and spend several minutes looking for his license, \"thereby committing multiple officer safety violations.\" Simoneau did not ask dispatch to send a marked unit, and he could not issue a citation because he did not have his citation book with him. Afterwards, back at the police station, Simoneau asked for the driver's record and learned that the driver had 26 entries including OUI and numerous drug offenses.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-15\">\n   2) Plaintiff alleges that on November 11, 2014, while in his police cruiser, Simoneau allegedly stopped a vehicle for an illegal U-turn and issued a warning citation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Chief Ferguson stated that he would maintain the status quo and told Plaintiff to ignore Simoneau.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49. Plaintiff continued to raise concerns to Chief Ferguson over the ensuing month.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50. Plaintiff alleges that the specific instances which led to these further complaints included:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   1) On April 22, 2015, Simoneau allegedly responded to a police call and interfered with an active crime scene involving a reported breaking and entering, in which two individuals who were possibly armed fled the scene. A perimeter was set up and tracking dogs deployed. Without informing anyone that he was in the area, Simoneau allegedly drove past or through the perimeter in his cruiser with blue lights at least 6-7 times.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-18\">\n   2) On May 1, 2015, a radio call went out to Area A cars to respond to a fight on Hollis Street. Simoneau, without identifying himself, allegedly used the police radio to ask for clarification regarding the call and stated that there was \"nothing showing yet\" and advised units to \"slow down, it's a simple domestic.\" Simoneau drove to the call location and when other officers arrived, Simoneau was standing outside of his\n   vehicle, his gun visible while his badge was not.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    Chief Ferguson allegedly told Plaintiff to ignore Simoneau.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 51.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    After multiple attempts to convince Chief Ferguson of the seriousness of the situation, Plaintiff brought his concerns to his union, the Framingham Police Superior Officers Association (\"FPSOA\").\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 52. In early June 2015, the FPSOA Executive Board sent a letter to Chief Ferguson detailing specific allegations regarding Simoneau's actions as a \"Special Officer.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 53 &amp; Ex. A [# 1-3]. The letter continued:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n    The incident in Tulsa[,] Oklahoma[,] in April, where a Part time Deputy[ ] shot and killed an individual was 100% preventable. Those that allowed him to operate as a \"part-time\" officer did so, knowing that he was not trained or qualified. Having that individual on the road has resulted in the death of one individual and long term law suits to come. The supervisors on that agency had long expressed their concerns regarding the part-time deputy's qualifications and training.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n    Allowing Brian [Simoneau] to operate in this similar capacity, conducting motor vehicle stops, and responding to calls opens members of the Superior Officers Union to tremendous liability issues.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n    ...\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n    [T]his letter is being submitted out of professional concerns given the recent trends nationwide in policing; surrounding the issues of training, legitimacy and procedural justice.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Ex. A. The letter concluded with the hope \"that members of the FPSOA will not be retaliated against for addressing this public safety issue.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    The letter was signed by the six-member FPSOA Executive Board, including Plaintiff, who was responsible for most of the contents of the letter.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 53. Plaintiff alleges on information and belief that Simoneau understood that Plaintiff had been the moving force behind, as well as the primary author of, the letter.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    Following these complaints, Simoneau allegedly began to target Plaintiff by executing a series of retaliatory actions against him.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 57. First, less than 2 weeks after the FPSOA letter, Simoneau convinced Chief Ferguson to shut down the Active Shooter/Patrol Rifle monthly training, which Plaintiff created and oversaw.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 58. Second, Simoneau changed the booking policy so that Shift Commanders, like Plaintiff, would be required to personally book and process all prisoners.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 60. Third, around August 2015, Simoneau conducted an allegedly unauthorized investigation into Plaintiff's work hours, including obtaining several months of video surveillance.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 62.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    Around October 2015, Plaintiff, who was responsible for all firearms training, brought to Chief Ferguson concerns that one of Plaintiff's instructors had been teaching courses for roughly 8 years without proper certification and thereby collecting overtime pay for which he was not entitled, which was a criminal violation.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 73. In June 2016, an investigation was commenced into that officer's conduct and qualifications.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 76. Two months later, in August 2016, the investigation was re-directed towards Plaintiff.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 77. At the direction of Chief Ferguson, Plaintiff was made a subject of an Internal Administrative Investigation as to whether he had knowingly put false information into his complaint, and was given a Notice of Suspension, placed on administrative leave, and relieved of his duties.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 78-79.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    Simoneau allegedly was involved in the investigation of Plaintiff.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 83. Although Simoneau did not conduct the formal investigation interviews of Plaintiff, Simoneau\n    drafted the questions asked during the interview.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 84. Furthermore, Simoneau participated in drafting the report regarding the investigation into Plaintiff.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 85-86. Although Plaintiff was found not to have knowingly filed a false complaint, the report falsely concluded that Plaintiff included subsidiary untrue statements in his complaint.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 87-88.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    In February 2017, the FPD sent a Notice of Discharge terminating Plaintiff.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 94.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Discussion\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    <em>\n     A.
