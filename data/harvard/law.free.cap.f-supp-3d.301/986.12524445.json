Browning, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   This matter comes before the Court on the Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to Proceed on Appeal Without Prepayment of Costs and Fees, filed September 1, 2017 (Doc. 28)(\"Motion\"). Christopher Scott Dangim originally filed the Motion in the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit on September 1, 2017, and the Tenth Circuit forwarded Dangim's Motion to this Court. For the reasons explained below, the Court will grant Dangim's permission to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and construe Dangim's Motion as a Notice of Appeal of the Court's Memorandum Opinion and Order of Dismissal, filed August 23, 2017 (Doc. 26), and Final Judgment, filed August 23, 2017 (Doc. 27)(\"MOO\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Dangim was granted permission to proceed in forma pauperis in the District Court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order Quashing Order to Show Cause, Granting Leave to Proceed Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and Denying Motion to Disqualify, filed August 22, 2016 (Doc. 13). Rule 24(a)(3) of the Rules of Appellate Procedure provide that \"[a] party who was permitted to proceed in forma pauperis in the district-court action ... may proceed on appeal in forma pauperis without further authorization\" provided that the appeal is taken in good faith. Fed. R. App. P. 24(a)(3). The Court concludes that Dangim has a good-faith basis to file an appeal from the Court's MOO and Final Judgment and, therefore, will grant Dangim's Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Dangim has not filed a notice of appeal, but he timely filed the present motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal within the time permitted to file a notice of appeal under rule 4 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A) (providing that a notice of appeal \"must be filed with the district clerk within 30 days after entry of the judgment or order appealed from\"). \"[T]he timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement,\"\n   <em>\n    Bowles v.

Rule 3 provides that the notice of appeal must: (1) \"specify the party or parties taking the appeal by naming each one in the caption or body of the notice\"; (2) \"designate the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed\"; and (3) \"name the court to which the appeal is taken.\" Fed.
