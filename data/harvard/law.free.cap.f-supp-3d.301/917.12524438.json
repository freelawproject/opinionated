KENNELLY, District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The defendants in this civil RICO case-AbbVie Inc. and other manufacturers of testosterone replacement therapy drugs-have moved for an order barring plaintiff Medical Mutual of Ohio (MMO) from clawing back six documents it produced to defendants. Defendants argue that the attorney-client privilege does not protect the documents and that even if it does, MMO has waived the privilege. Defendants alternatively ask the Court to order MMO to produce redacted versions of the documents, leaving visible the unprivileged facts they contain. For the following reasons, the Court denies defendants' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Between March 2017 and September 29, 2017, MMO produced to defendants approximately 180,000 documents totaling more than 1.4 million pages. MMO produced the documents pursuant to the parties' agreed protective order, which the Court entered on January 18, 2017. The protective order's purpose is to \"facilitat[e] the exchange of information between the Parties to this Action without involving the Court unnecessarily in this process.\" D.E. 194 \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Paragraphs Seventeen and Eighteen of the protective order contain what the parties describe as claw-back procedures for inadvertent production of confidential or privileged material. Paragraph Seventeen states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   If a Producing Party inadvertently or unintentionally produces a document or information without marking it as Designated Confidential or Highly Confidential Information or marking it with the incorrect Confidentiality designation, the Producing Party shall, within twenty (20) business days of discovering the inadvertent production, give notice to the Receiving Party in writing, and thereafter the Receiving Party shall treat the document according to its new designation. Inadvertent or unintentional disclosure shall not be deemed a waiver in whole or in part of the Producing Party's claim of restriction either as to specific documents and information disclosed or on the same or related subject matter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Paragraph Eighteen states that if a producing party inadvertently or unintentionally produces any document(s) or information\n   that it determines is protected from discovery by, among other things, the attorney-client privilege, the producing party must notify the receiving party and the MDL plaintiffs' co-lead counsel in writing within twenty business days of discovering the inadvertent production.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. Paragraph Eighteen sets forth the procedures that the receiving party and plaintiffs' co-lead counsel must follow to sequester the document(s), determine whether to challenge the producing party's claim of privilege or protection from discovery, and, if applicable, destroy the document(s).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Paragraph Eighteen also states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Inadvertent or unintentional production may not be deemed a waiver in whole or in part of the Producing Party's claim of privilege or immunity from discovery either as to specific documents and information disclosed or on the same or related subject matter based on the facts constituting the inadvertent production. This provision is, and shall be construed as, an Order under Rule 502(d) of the Federal Rules of Evidence. Accordingly, as is explicitly set forth in Rule 502(d), a Party's production of documents, whether inadvertent or intentional, is not a waiver of any privilege or protection \"in any other federal or state proceeding.\" Fed. R. Evid. 502(d).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Paragraph Four of the protective order likewise contains a non-waiver provision. It states that \"[n]othing in this Protective Order, nor the production of any documents or disclosure of any information pursuant to this Order, shall be deemed to have the effect of (a) an admission or waiver, including waiver under the Federal Rules of Evidence or applicable Local Rules.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The present dispute arose when MMO invoked the protective order to claw back six documents that MMO claims it produced inadvertently. MMO represents that it discovered the inadvertent productions in a piecemeal fashion. First, on October 3, 2017, MMO discovered that it had produced six privileged documents, including three of the documents (e-mails) at issue here. The e-mails contain an inquiry from one of MMO's in-house attorneys, Timothy Kibler, to three non-attorney employees of MMO. The inquiry seeks information about an AbbVie account manager that Kibler and Brien Shanahan, another of MMO's in-house attorneys, believe is relevant to this litigation. The e-mails also contain the employees' responses to the inquiry. Goroff Decl., Exs. B, C, D (\"Goroff Ex(s).\"). On the day it discovered the disclosures, MMO wrote to defendants and the MDL plaintiffs' co-lead counsel to ask defendants to destroy the documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   MMO states that it did a quality check of its production after discovering the above disclosures. On October 20, 2017, while doing the quality check and preparing for depositions, MMO discovered that it had inadvertently produced another e-mail chain, which is the fourth document in dispute. In the e-mail chain, Kibler sends questions from Shanahan to three non-attorney MMO employees. The questions relate to Shanahan's work with outside counsel on the present litigation. One of the employees replies to Kibler, Shanahan, and the others with responses to the questions. Goroff Ex. A. On October 25, 2017, MMO notified defendants and the MDL plaintiffs' co-lead counsel of the disclosure and asked defendants to destroy the document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The fifth document in dispute is an e-mail chain between two non-attorney MMO employees, Dr. Kathryn Canaday and Dr. Marko Blagojevic. In the first e-mail, Dr. Blagojevic relays statements and an inquiry from attorney Kibler regarding a defense in this litigation. Dr. Blagojevic also requests information from Dr. Canaday for Kibler's inquiry. The second e-mail\n   contains Dr. Canaday's response. Goroff Ex. E.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants used Goroff Exhibit E in questioning Dr. Canaday during her deposition on November 29, 2017. Defense counsel questioned Dr. Canaday about the document for approximately ten minutes without objection by MMO's counsel. Several days later, an attorney for MMO who had not attended the deposition identified the document as privileged and inadvertently produced. On December 6, 2017, MMO notified defendants and the MDL plaintiffs' co-lead counsel of the disclosure and asked defendants to destroy the document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The sixth document in dispute is an e-mail from Dr. Blagojevic to Dr. Canaday that appears in Goroff Exhibit E, but that MMO produced under a different Bates number. Goroff Ex. F. MMO learned that it had produced this document when defendants used it (along with Goroff Exhibit E) during Dr. Blagojevic's deposition on December 7, 2017. MMO's counsel objected during the deposition on the basis of privilege and invoked the protective order's claw-back provisions, but allowed questioning subject to this alleged reservation of rights. On December 15, 2017, MMO contacted defendants and the MDL plaintiffs' co-lead counsel in writing and asked defendants to destroy the document.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendants state that in addition to Goroff Exhibits A through F, MMO has produced hundreds of other documents \"that contain or describe exchanges with MMO's inside and outside counsel,\" some of which are marked \"TRT MDL Lawsuit-Attorney Client Privileged Communication.\" Defs.' Mot. at 1-2. Defendants attach several such documents as exhibits to their reply. Second Goroff Decl., Exs. 1-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Based on these facts, defendants argue that none of the documents at issue are protected by the attorney-client privilege.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants further argue that even if the attorney-client privilege once protected the documents, and notwithstanding the parties' protective order, the Court should find that MMO has waived the privilege because (1) MMO's document production was not inadvertent; (2) MMO failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the disclosures; and (3) MMO failed to take reasonable steps to rectify its errors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 502(b). Defendants separately argue that even if the parties' protective order precludes the Court from applying Federal Rule of Evidence 502(b), MMO waived the privilege for Goroff Exhibits E and F by failing to timely object when defendants used Goroff Exhibit E during Dr. Canaday's deposition. Finally, defendants argue that allowing MMO to preserve the privilege would be fundamentally unfair. More specifically, defendants state that \"the documents in question show that MMO knowingly made false assertions in its pleadings and other filings that go to the core of its claims.\" Defs.' Mot. at 15. Defendants argue that they need to use Goroff Exhibits A through F in order to rebut MMO's claims, because when they questioned MMO's witnesses about non-privileged facts in the documents, \"the witnesses were either unable or unwilling to answer truthfully.\" Defs.'

Paragraph 18 of the protective order states that it \"is, and shall be construed as, an Order under Rule 502(d).\" D.E. 194 \u00b6 18. It also reiterates the non-waiver language from Rule 502(d) and quotes from the Rule.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202834535\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Paragraphs Four and Seventeen of the protective order likewise contain non-waiver language, and Paragraph Four states that the purpose of the protective order is to \"facilitat[e] the exchange of information ... without involving the Court unnecessarily.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.

This includes defendants' appeal to fairness, which is not a factor under the protective order. The Court observes, however, that the proposition that one or more of the privileged documents at issue is arguably damaging, even highly damaging, to MMO's case does not provide a basis to disregard the attorney-client privilege. The Court notes in this regard that defendants do not invoke any exception to the attorney-client privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Inadvertent Disclosure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Because the Court has held that the parties' protective order governs the issue of waiver for inadvertently produced privileged documents, the Court must decide whether MMO's production was inadvertent. The protective order does not define \"inadvertent,\" so the Court follows its plain meaning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Sulfuric Acid\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12253824\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/235/407/#p415\">\n    235 F.R.D. at 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (assigning plain meaning to the term \"discovery\" in protective order).

This definition is consistent with the standard that the majority of courts in this District use to determine whether a disclosure is inadvertent under Rule 502(b)(1).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Excel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201570772\">\n    2012 WL 1570772\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *2 (\"[T]he inadvertence inquiry asks merely whether the production was unintentional.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendants argue that MMO's \"conduct in this case goes far beyond mere inadvertence\" because MMO has produced-without seeking to claw back-approximately 360 documents that are marked privileged or confidential, that refer to MMO's attorneys by name, or that contain exchanges with MMO's in-house and outside counsel.

Compliance With Protective Order\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendants suggest that even if MMO's disclosures were inadvertent, MMO did not comply with the \"timing provision of the Protective Order's claw back clause\" because MMO had discovered the first inadvertent disclosures by October 3, 2017 but did not make made its last claw-back request until December 15, 2017. Defs.' Mot. at 13 n.14. The protective order, however, does not state that once the producing party discovers an inadvertent production, it has only twenty business days to give notice of every\n   <em>\n    subsequent\n   </em>\n   inadvertent production. Rather, it simply requires that the producing party give notice \"within twenty (20) business days of discovering the inadvertent production.\" D.E. 194 \u00b6\u00b6 17, 18. MMO made a claw-back request for each disputed document within twenty business days of discovering that document's disclosure. It complied with the timing provision in the protective order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Defendants also suggest that MMO did not comply with the protective order because it failed to timely serve a privilege log. But nothing in the protective order suggests that failure to serve a privilege log-or late service of a log-waives privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court finds that MMO complied with the protective order's provisions governing inadvertent disclosure. Therefore, MMO did not waive privilege for Goroff Exhibits A through F.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Waiver During Deposition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Defendants argue that even if the parties' protective order supersedes Rule 502(b), MMO separately waived the privilege for Exhibit E (and by extension Exhibit F) by failing to object when defendants used Exhibit E during Dr. Canaday's deposition, allowing Dr. Canaday to testify about it for approximately ten minutes, and waiting seven days to claw it back. Defendants support their argument with a district court decision holding that \"failure to timely object to the introduction of an exhibit [during deposition] waives any privilege, regardless of the presence of a claw-back provision\" that is \"intended to override the common law as to inadvertent disclosure.\"\n   <em>\n    Hologram USA, Inc. v.
