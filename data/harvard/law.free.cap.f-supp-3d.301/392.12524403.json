This review happens at periodic intervals but may happen sooner if SSA learns of a change in the recipient's financial situation.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.204\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

However, plaintiffs allege that, in practice, the benefits terminate even if a request for reconsideration is timely made because SSA employees fail to docket the request.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. SSA's Alleged Failure to Docket Requests\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   According to plaintiffs, SSA's failure takes many forms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sometimes, SSA employees tell a recipient that he or she has no basis to appeal and refuse to accept the request. Sometimes, they wrongly refuse to accept written requests, insisting that the recipient make the request in person (only to be denied in person as well). Sometimes, they accept the request but refuse to file supporting documentation. Sometimes, they take the request in person but fail to file it in the computer system, leaving the request sitting on somebody's desk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Between 2014 and 2015, the New York Legal Assistance Group (\"NYLAG\") conducted a study of these failings. The organization found that about half of requests had to be submitted more than once and that repeated telephone calls and legal representation was often necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege that SSA employees have made the following comments when pressed on the failure to timely docket requests: (1) the request \"might be on someone's desk,\" (2) \"I know what the rules are but I am only one person and you have to be realistic,\" (3) the NYLAG lawyer needed to pressure the employees' supervisors to allot time to docket requests, (4) while the worker understood the urgency, other requests were still waiting to be processed, and (5) no one was available to docket the request because of understaffing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Plaintiffs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The eight plaintiffs each allege that they have been affected by SSA's failure to docket requests. The allegations are laid out in great detail in the FAC; the following is a summary of their experiences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Sylvia Fabelo\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff Sylvia Fabelo has received benefits since 2013 based on her age. In 2014, she began receiving foster care benefits, which do not count against financial eligibility. On January 15, 2015, she informed the SSA about the foster care benefits. SSA scheduled automatic termination of the SSI benefits unless she could provide additional proof of the source of the foster care benefits. She did so on January 30, 2015, but was turned away at the check-in window and not allowed to submit her evidence. As a result, she did not receive her February benefits. On February 17, 2015, she received a notice of termination backdated to February 1, 2015, and was told she had been overpaid from September 2014 until January 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On March 20, 2015, Fabelo filed a request for reconsideration. It was not docketed. Her representative called the SSA office seven times between April 1, 2015, and May 4, 2015, but was unsuccessful in docketing her request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On May 5, 2015, Fabelo and her representative went to the local SSA office and finally secured submission of her request for reconsideration. Her representative contacted the office three times by telephone between May 14 and May 18, 2015. Finally, on May 19, 2015, a favorable reconsideration decision was issued, and her benefits were reinstated on May 27, 2015. However, the SSA failed to issue the improperly withheld benefits from February,\n   March, and April. Her representative finally succeeded in securing her missing benefits on June 24, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Fabelo relied on her SSI benefits as her sole source of income. During the four months when her benefits were denied, she relied on loans from her daughter to pay rent and fell behind on her bills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Judy Menczer, on behalf of her minor child, E.M.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff Judy Menczer provides for E.M., a disabled 14-year-old girl who qualifies for SSI. E.M.'s benefits were wrongfully terminated in 2012 and 2014 because the SSA mistakenly treated a business account owned by her uncle as a countable resource. Both mistakes took months to resolve.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In 2015, her benefits were again terminated and an overpayment posted to her SSI record because of the same account. She received two notices, on August 5, 2015, and August 6, 2015, each claiming a different amount of money was due for overpayment. She timely filed requests for reconsideration of both. Neither was docketed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On August 17, 2015, Menczer filed supporting documentation and an advocacy letter in support of the requests. On August 21, 2015, an SSA worker told her that the requests were not in the system but \"might be on someone's desk.\" The office failed to respond to two follow-up calls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   E.M. did not receive her September benefits. Menczer followed up again and was told there was no appeal on file. On September 18, 2015, an informal conference appeared to resolve the issue in E.M.'s favor. However, on October 7, 2015, the request for reconsideration was denied. At the time of the FAC, E.M. had still not received restoration of her benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Liam Beck, on behalf of his minor child, M.B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff Liam Beck provides for his minor child, M.B., who receives SSI benefits for her mental illness. On June 29, 2015, SSA terminated M.B.'s SSI benefits. It did so because it improperly treated the money in Beck's religious congregation's bank account as his personal resources because he helped the congregation with accounting. He filed a request for reconsideration. Despite three attempts at filing this request and six telephone calls to SSA, it was never docketed. As a result, M.B. did not receive her August 2015 benefits on time. After retaining legal representation, M.B.'s family finally secured the benefits in late August 2015. The loss of benefits led the family to miss a rent payment and borrow money to pay M.B.'s school fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Icho Cohen, on behalf of his minor child, S.C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff Icho Cohen provides for his minor child, S.C., a 17-year-old disabled girl. S.C. received disability benefits until January 2014, when SSA wrongfully scheduled the automatic termination of the benefits due to an exempt business loan made to S.C.'s mother by her grandfather. On February 14, 2014, Cohen timely filed a waiver request, but his request for reconsideration was rejected by the SSA worker. He filed additional requests on May 22 and June 23, 2014, which were not docketed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On September 5, 2014, Cohen and his representative attended an appointment at the local SSA office. The SSA worker claimed they did not receive his request but refused to accept a proffered request in person. Cohen's representative then filed the request by facsimile and certified mail. On April 2, 2015, the SSA informally denied the waiver request. On May 24, 2015, S.C.'s representative filed a request for reconsideration. It was denied orally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   S.C. had not received benefits at the time of the FAC, and an overpayment remained posted to her account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Constantin Kehaya\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff Constantin Kehaya receives SSI benefits based on his age. On January 19, 2015, SSA sent him a notice that he had been overpaid SSI benefits for three months in 2014 because his bank balances exceeded the $2000 resource limit for a single person. These balances were caused by SSA depositing the next month's benefit check early and counting it as \"savings.\" SSA then applied the \"overpaid\" benefits to a prior \"overpayment\" from 2013 that was also caused by SSA misdepositing funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On February 20, 2015, Kehaya and his representative submitted a request for reconsideration. SSA failed to docket it. In April 2016, SSA contacted him and asked for a copy of the February 2015 request. He submitted it in May 2016. At the time of the filing of the FAC, he had not received his withheld benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    6. Aron Braver, on behalf of his minor child R.B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiff Aron Braver cares for his 8-year-old child, R.B, who receives SSI benefits for her disability. On December 15, 2014, R.B.'s parents received a notice that her benefits would be terminated because of exempt settlement funds stemming from a successful malpractice lawsuit. On December 24, 2014, R.B.'s parents filed a request for reconsideration advising that R.B. did not have access to the funds until her 18th birthday. SSA did not docket it, and R.B.'s benefits terminated. On January 12, 2015, R.B.'s representative called the SSA office and was told that no record of the request existed and that it was likely sitting on a desk. After continued pressure on the office, R.B.'s benefits were reinstated on January 22, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On October 9, 2015, SSA issued R.B. a new notice of termination based on a savings account containing funds for retroactive SSI benefits. The account was required by SSA for minor children and should have been excluded for eligibility purposes. On October 23, 2015, Braver filed a request for reconsideration. On October 29, 2015, he followed up and was told SSA did not docket his request. He sent a second request. On October 30, 2015, he was informed that the office received the second request but that it was missing a required signed statement. He drafted and signed the required statement. SSA still failed to pay R.B.'s November 2015 benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On November 13, 2015, SSA granted the request and informed Braver that the withheld benefits would be paid on December 1. SSA did not pay the benefits. His representative contacted SSA four additional times and finally secured the benefits in late December.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    7. Nabil Sarga, on behalf of his minor child, K.S.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiff Nabil Sarga cares for his 13-year-old child K.S., who receives disability benefits. In April 2014, K.S.'s SSI benefits were improperly terminated due to excess resources based on the deposit of an exempt tax refund into his bank. An overpayment was posted to his record. He filed a new application for SSI benefits, which was granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On January 9, 2015, Sarga received notice that his SSI benefits would terminate due to excess resources because he had again deposited his tax refund into his bank account. K.S. did not receive his February 2015 benefits. On February 2, 2015, Sarga received a notice of overpayments for $2,221.00 and $6,803.00 based on these tax returns. On February 18, 2015, he filed a request for reconsideration. It was not\n   docketed. K.S.'s lawyer followed up on February 20 and 26 and eventually secured docketing of the request. On April 17, 2015, K.S. received a written favorable decision, and the 2015 benefits were reinstated. However, the requests for reconsideration regarding the initial recoupment were never resolved, and SSA continues to recoup 10% of K.S.'s benefits each month.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    8. Stavroula Kapeles\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiff Stavroula Kapeles is 24 years old and disabled. On January 12, 2016, she received notice that her benefits were terminated and that she had been overpaid benefits based on her exempt supplemental needs trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On January 22, 2016, she filed a request for reconsideration. It was never docketed, and she was not paid benefits in February. On February 3, 2016, an overpayment notice for $20,846.88 was posted to her account. On March 15, 2016, she went to her local office for her reconsideration appointment. However, because her request had never been docketed, she was treated as a walk-in. She waited three hours and resubmitted the request for reconsideration in person. It was not docketed. Additional attempts to resolve the matter failed. She was not receiving benefits at the time the FAC was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Complaint\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   On December 31, 2015, plaintiffs filed their first complaint. On July 1, 2016, plaintiffs filed the operative FAC, claiming (1) violation of federal regulations, namely\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20416.550\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 416.550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 416.1336, 416.1413, 416.557, and 416.570(a) ; (2) violation of the Due Process Clause; and (3) mandamus.

For example, E.M. had her benefits terminated three times for the same exempt business account owned by her uncle, and K.S. had her benefits terminated twice based on her father's valid deposit of tax returns. SSA regulations require regular reassessment of benefit eligibility, meaning each of these plaintiffs will be subjected to future review. And the SSA's position in this case-that it has no duty to docket appeals in a timely manner-strongly suggests the failure to docket will continue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss at 23 (\"... the statute and regulations cited to do not impose any obligation on SSA to timely document requests for reconsideration and/or waiver in MSSICS.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Defendants attempt to moot the case by (1) asserting it has granted all due benefits to plaintiffs since the FAC was filed; and (2) asserting it has implemented reforms that make it more likely that appeals will be timely docketed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   However, the voluntary conduct of a defendant cannot moot a case unless \"subsequent events made it absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.\"\n   <em>\n    Friends of the Earth, Inc. v.

Plaintiffs' FAC does cite to federal regulations and one statute allegedly violated by defendants:\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20416.550\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 416.550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 416.557, 416.570(a), 416.1336, and 416.1413 and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201383\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). The information in POMS is only provided to supplement the regulatory requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Defendants also argue that while the cited regulations provide plaintiffs with the right to file requests, they do not provide them with the right to have those requests effectively noticed. But the regulations provide plaintiffs not only with the right to appeal adverse rulings, but also with the right to continue to receive payments pending an appeal \"[i]f appeal is filed within 10 days after the individual's receipt of the notice ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.1336\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   For a recipient to receive these benefits, the SSA must record the submission of that recipient's appeal within the ten-day period. If not, the recipient loses benefits after that period has expired. This is exactly what the plaintiffs have alleged happened here-for example, Kapeles alleges she timely filed a request for reconsideration of the SSA's January 12, 2016 notice that her benefits were terminated, but the request was not docketed, and she lost her February benefits. These time-sensitive\n   rights require the appeals to be docketed as recieved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Therefore, plaintiffs have successfully alleged a violation of federal regulations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    B. It is Premature to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Requested Injunctive Relief Barring the SSA's Automatic Reduction or Termination of Benefits.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief related to the SSA's automatic reduction or termination of benefits. Defendants assert that this remedy should be dismissed because \"Plaintiffs have conceded[ ] SSA's policies and procedures relating to the automatic scheduling fully comply with due process and do not violate any agency regulations.\" Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss at 25. While the Court agrees that plaintiffs have conceded the facial validity of these regulations, whether they violate due process as applied is unresolved. Plaintiffs allege the automatic termination effectively denies plaintiffs their rightful benefits because their appeal is not timely docketed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The most effective solution to this alleged deficiency is likely to fix the timeliness of docketing the appeals. However, if the SSA shows such a remedy is impractical due to volume of applications and budgetary restrictions, ending the automatic termination process may be an alternative means to protect plaintiffs' rights, as the plaintiffs would continue to collect benefits while waiting for their appeal to be docketed, and the harm caused by the failure to docket would instead fall on the SSA. Therefore, on the pleadings, it is premature to speculate what form injunctive relief, if any, may take.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    IV\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Defendants' motion to dismiss is granted as to the mandamus claim and otherwise denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Nancy A.
