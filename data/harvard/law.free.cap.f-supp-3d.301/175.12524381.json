In the Jurisdiction Decision, the arbitral tribunal explained that its consideration of issues relating to jurisdiction and admissibility was undertaken at the behest of Ukraine. \"Respondent [Ukraine] made in its Statement of Defense [a request] that the Tribunal rule on the issue of jurisdiction as a preliminary question, in accordance with Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Rules.\" Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The arbitral tribunal's Jurisdiction Decision addressed and rebutted a variety of jurisdictional objections raised by Ukraine, including that: (1) the Russia-Ukraine BIT does not apply to disputes concerning Ukrtatnafta; (2) Tatneft is not an investor within the meaning of the BIT because it is controlled by the Government of Tatarstan; (3) Tatneft's participation in Ukrtatnafta is not an investment within the meaning of the BIT; and (4) Tatneft's participation in Ukrtatnafta is not in conformity with Ukrainian legislation. The tribunal further addressed a number of admissibility objections raised by Ukraine, including that: (1) Tatneft has no standing on behalf of AmRuz and Seagroup; (2) Tatneft has no standing to claim for unpaid oil deliveries; and (3) Tatneft failed to state an arguable case concerning alleged violations of its rights under the BIT and for damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jurisdiction Decision at 30-49 (addressing objections to jurisdiction); 72-88 (addressing objections to admissibility).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   With regard to the allegations that Ukraine is relying on in this case-that Tatneft is not a private party, the \"fair and equitable treatment\" provision is not incorporated in the BIT, and Tatneft has no standing on behalf of AmRuz and Seagroup-the Court notes that the tribunal made specific findings in favor of Tatneft on each of these claims. By way of example, the tribunal found that \"[t]here is undoubtedly a government presence in Tatneft [ ],\" but it concluded that \"business-related aspects predominate in Tatneft's operations and [ ] it is thus entitled to claim as a private investor under the Russia-Ukraine BIT.\" Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6\u00b6 129, 151. The tribunal characterized the issue regarding the fair and equitable treatment provision as \"a matter for the merits,\" and upon consideration of the merits, the tribunal found that Ukraine agreed to provide fair and equitable treatment to Tatneft by incorporation through the most-favored-nation clause, but failed to provide such treatment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6 249; Merits Award \u00b6\u00b6 391-413.

The FSIA is a jurisdictional statute that speak[s] to the power of the court rather than to the rights and obligations of the parties. Likewise \u00a7 1605(a) does not affect the contractual right of the parties to arbitration but only the tribunal that may hear a dispute concerning enforcement of an arbitral award.

This Court notes that an abrogation proceeding does not directly challenge the Merits Award; instead, the purpose of this new proceeding is to \"seek [ ] abrogation of the decree that introduced Article 1009-1 of the French Code of Civil Procedure before the French State Council\" and in the event Ukraine prevails on that challenge, the Cassation Court's Radiation Order \"will be annulled, and the French cassation proceeding will resume.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The Court finds that a stay of the recognition and enforcement proceeding in this case is without merit because Ukraine's motion to stay is based on the idea that the ongoing French setting aside proceeding was a parallel proceeding that warranted consideration of the\n   <em>\n    Europcar\n   </em>\n   factors addressed in\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   , but that setting aside proceeding is no longer active. Despite the fact that Ukraine has indicated its intent to challenge the French Court of Cassation's decision to \"deactivate\" the setting aside proceeding, Ukraine's prospective challenge is not a \"parallel proceeding\" that will have any immediate effect on the Paris Court of Appeals' upholding of the Merits Award;\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the most that Ukraine can hope to accomplish is the reactivation of the setting aside proceeding in the French Court of Cassation. \"[A] court abuses its discretion in ordering a stay 'of indefinite duration in the absence of a pressing need.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <em>\n    Belize Soc.
