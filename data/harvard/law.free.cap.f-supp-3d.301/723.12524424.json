No. 28. On November 15, 2017, the Defendant moved to dismiss Counts III and IV of Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint. Dkt. No. 30. Count III is a claim for negligent violations of the MCPA, and Count IV is a claim for willful violations of that Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 28, p. 14 (Pg.

The motion is fully briefed. The Court held a hearing on the motion on Tuesday, March 13, 2018 at 3:00 p.m. Ruling from the bench, the Court DENIED the Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Counts III and IV of the Second Amended Complaint [30].

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Defendant seeks dismissal of Counts III and IV of Plaintiff's Second Amended Complaint. Dkt. No. 30. Counts III and IV are for negligent and willful violations of the MCPA, respectively. The parties do not dispute the merits of Plaintiff's MCPA claims. Rather, they disagree about whether the Defendant is subject to the MCPA. Because the Court finds that the Act applies to the Defendant, the Court will deny the Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Claims III and IV of Plaintiff's Complaint [30]. Plaintiff's claims for negligent and willful violations of the MCPA, then, will continue in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A. \"Regulated Person\" under the MCPA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The sole issue for resolution here is whether Ocwen is a \"regulated person\" under the MCPA. The answer to that question is \"yes,\" and thus, Claims III and IV of the Second Amended Complaint will survive the Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The MCPA only applies to \"regulated persons.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MICH. COMP. LAWS \u00a7 445.251(g). In pertinent part, the MCPA defines \"regulated person\" as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   A person whose collection activities are confined and are directly related to the operation of a business other than that of a collection agency including any of the following ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    (ii)\n   </em>\n   A state or federally chartered bank that collects its own claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    vii\n   </em>\n   ) A business that is licensed by this state under a regulatory act that regulates collection activity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   MICH. COMP. LAWS \u00a7 445.251(g)(ii), (vii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Based on its statutory definition, \"regulated persons\" includes Ocwen. All agree Ocwen is a mortgage loan servicer licensed under Michigan laws. Specifically, Ocwen is licensed under the following Michigan state laws: (1) the Mortgage Brokers, Lenders, and Servicers Licensing Act, MICH. COMP. LAWS \u00a7 445.1651 ; and (2) the Secondary Mortgage Loan Act, MICH. COMP. LAWS \u00a7 493.51. Dkt. No. 32, pp. 13-14 (Pg. ID 319);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 33, p. 2 (Pg. ID 334). And absent from Ocwen's briefings is any argument that these statutes do not regulate collection activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Yet in resisting the motion, Ocwen contends a pair of cases demonstrate that it is not subject to the MCPA-\n   <em>\n    Casper v. Nationstar Mortg. LLC\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-cv-14251,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%2013376708\">\n    2015 WL 13376708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Mich. June 2, 2015), and\n   <em>\n    Botsford v. Bank of Am., N.A.\n   </em>\n   , No. 13-13379,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204897529\">\n    2014 WL 4897529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Mich. Sept. 30, 2014). Ocwen is mistaken, however, as these cases are distinguishable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Knight argues, and the Court agrees, that in deciding whether a mortgage loan servicer was a \"regulated person,\" both of these cases only analyzed one provision, and that provision is not relevant here: if a state or federally chartered bank is collecting its own claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MICH. COMP. LAWS \u00a7 445.251(g)(ii). Thus, the provision at issue in this case-status as a business licensed by Michigan under a regulatory act that regulates collection activity, MICH. COMP. LAWS \u00a7 445.251(g)(vii) -was not discussed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Casper\n   </em>\n   , for example, the court held the MCPA did not apply to a mortgage-loan servicer because it was collecting a claim on behalf of a federally charted bank, and not its own claim.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%2013376708\">\n    2015 WL 13376708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5. Likewise, as Bank of America is a federally chartered bank and in\n   <em>\n    Botsford\n   </em>\n   was not collecting on its own claim, the\n   <em>\n    Botsford\n   </em>\n   court concluded Bank of America was not subject to the MCPA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Ocwen, though, does not maintain it is a state or federally chartered bank. As a result, MICH. COMP. LAWS \u00a7 445.251(g)(ii) is inapplicable, rendering Ocwen's reliance\n   on\n   <em>\n    Casper\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Botsford\n   </em>\n   misplaced. Without authority to the contrary, the plain language defining \"regulated person\" establishes that Plaintiff's claim must survive the 12(b)(6) motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   What is more, case law reinforces the conclusion that Ocwen must comply with the MCPA.\n   <em>\n    Misleh v. Timothy E. Baxter &amp; Assocs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4253916\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/786/1330/\">\n    786 F.Supp.2d 1330\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1336 &amp; n.5 (E.D. Mich. 2011), is instructive.
