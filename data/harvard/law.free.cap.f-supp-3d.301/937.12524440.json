LEON HOLMES, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Sidney McLendon brings this action against his former employer, Schlumberger Technology Corporation, for failure to pay overtime wages in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20201\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 219. Schlumberger moves for summary judgment, arguing that it was not required to pay McLendon overtime wages because he was a highly-compensated employee under the FLSA. Because there are genuine disputes of fact as to whether the highly-compensated employee exemption applies, the motion for summary judgment is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Schlumberger is an oilfield services company. It operates in locations throughout the United States, but McLendon primarily worked out of the Conway, Arkansas location. He became a Tubing Conveyed Perforating Specialist (\"TCP\" specialist) in February 2011. Perforating creates holes in the casing-sometimes made from concrete-of an oil or natural gas wellbore. These holes create a connection between the wellbore and the reservoir, which is a\n   part of the production process. A perforating gun, which contains explosive charges, is used to create the holes. A drill pipe is used to send the gun down into the wellbore and the charges are detonated according to where holes are required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Schlumberger and McLendon give different descriptions of McLendon's duties and responsibilities as a TCP specialist. Schlumberger says that McLendon was responsible for consulting with the client to determine what equipment was most suitable and that he had the discretion to implement that determination and make changes to it. According to Schlumberger, McLendon was responsible for the overall safety of the operation. He supervised a crew, enforced safety rules, and led safety meetings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Conversely, McLendon says he did not consult with the client or make decisions about what the job would require. Neither did he supervise the crew or lead safety meetings. McLendon says that a TCP Specialist elsewhere may have those responsibilities but that he worked with smaller-scale operations in Arkansas and was never required to supervise a crew. Instead, he was merely responsible for the equipment he transported from the shop. He built perforating guns in the shop, loaded the guns into his truck, transported the guns to the site, assembled the guns by attaching the firing heads, and then watched from his truck as the guns were run down into the well. Once the guns were in place, McLendon made sure the charges detonated. Then, after the guns were brought back up out of the well, McLendon disassembled and cleaned them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   McLendon's annual salary in 2011 was $53,000. By the time Schlumberger terminated McLendon's employment in 2015, his annual salary was $72,000. In addition to his salary, McLendon earned and received non-discretionary bonuses for each completed job. Schlumberger determined the amount of the bonus by a pre-determined percentage of the net amount of the client's payment. With the non-discretionary bonuses, McLendon's total income exceeded $100,000 in the years 2012, 2013, and 2014. McLendon's total income also would have exceeded $100,000 in the year 2015 had he not been terminated in November.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A court should grant summary judgment if the evidence demonstrates that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

Then, he fastened the guns to the tubing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   After that, McLendon returned to his truck and watched as the rig crew \"torqued up\" the fastenings and sent the guns down into the well.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This process, his part and the rig crew's part, usually took around an hour.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22. McLendon testified that he was responsible for the equipment he brought.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. He did not shoot the guns, but ensured that they did shoot.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22. To ensure the guns discharged, McLendon says he stood there \"holding on to the pipe to see if [he] fe[lt] it go bang, bang, bang.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22. Then, after the guns were brought back up out of the well, McLendon disassembled and cleaned them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19. McLendon testified that his interactions with the client were limited.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37. Apart from ensuring that they each had the same well procedure, McLendon said: \"They tell me what they want for lunch.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As stated above, Schlumberger and McLendon describe his primary duties as a TCP Specialist differently. An employee's job description, the job description of a lower paying job with some overlapping duties, and a representative of the employer's reiteration of that description without first-hand knowledge, are insufficient to establish the exempt status of an employee. Rather, \"[t]he exempt or nonexempt status of any particular employee must be determined on the basis of whether the employee's salary and duties meet the requirements of the regulations....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20541.2\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, there is a genuine dispute as to what duties McLendon actually performed on a daily basis. Schlumberger says one thing and McLendon says another. Absent more convincing evidence in favor of Schlumberger, the jury is entitled to determine who they believe.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Torgerson v. City of Rochester\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5648351\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/643/1031/#p1042\">\n    643 F.3d 1031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1042 (8th Cir. 2011) (\"Credibility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inference from the facts should be left to the jury\") (internal quotation omitted),\n   <em>\n    cf.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pruneda v.

Tex. June 20, 2017) (holding in oilfield case where employee and employer described duties similarly but emphasized different duties that employer had presented sufficient evidence to establish that primary duty was managerial work). Specifically, the jury needs to weigh the evidence and determine the duties McLendon performed as a TCP Specialist before the Court can decide the legal question of whether the highly-compensated employee exemption applies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grage\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088658\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/813/1051/#p1054\">\n    813 F.3d at 1056\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A reasonable juror could find in favor of McLendon based on the evidence in the record. Therefore, Schlumberger has failed to meet its burden and summary judgment is improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Schlumberger's motion for summary judgment is DENIED.
