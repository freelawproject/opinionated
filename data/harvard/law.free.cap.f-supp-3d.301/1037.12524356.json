BROWNING, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS MATTER\n   </strong>\n   comes before the Court on Defendant Kevin Folse's Formal Objections to Presentence Report, filed May 15, 2017 (Doc. 223)(\"Objections\"). The primary issues are: (i) whether Defendant Kevin Folse qualifies for a \"career offender\" sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 based on his prior felony convictions for aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, as well as the two carjacking convictions rendered in this case; (ii) whether the Court should apply a 2-level obstruction-of-justice enhancement for witness intimidation under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 ; and (iii) whether the Court should apply a 2-level obstruction-of-justice enhancement for reckless endangerment during flight under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2. The Court concludes that all three enhancements apply. First, Folse qualifies as a career offender, because his carjacking conviction in this case is a \"crime of violence\" under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a), his prior aggravated battery with a deadly weapon conviction was a \"crime of violence\" under U.S.S.G. 4B1.2(a), and his prior possession of marijuana with intent to distribute conviction is a controlled substance offense under \u00a7 4B1.2(b). Second, Folse qualifies for the obstruction-of-justice enhancement, because he asked \"Creeper\" to tell a potential witness to go \"M.I.A.\" prior to trial. Third, he qualifies for the obstruction-of-justice reckless-endangerment-during-flight enhancement, because Folse put pedestrians and other drivers at substantial risk of serious injury or death while fleeing police when he threw a gun out of a moving vehicle, drove at high speeds, and ran both a red light and a stop sign.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court takes its factual account from the Presentence Investigation Report, filed May 10, 2017 (Doc. 220)(\"PSR\"). Later, the Court will note Folse's factual objections and, where necessary to determine whether the disputed sentencing enhancements apply, the Court will resolve them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Between June 30 and July 2, 2015, Albuquerque Police Department (\"APD\") detectives searched for Folse, a.k.a. \"Criminal,\" who was fleeing from law enforcement and had \"committed various violent crimes\" during flight. PSR \u00b6 5, at 4. On July 2, 2015, APD officers stopped a stolen black Cadillac, which Folse \"had been driving a few hours earlier.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   PSR\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 6, at 4. Although the officers determined that Folse was not the driver, the driver stated that he had just purchased the vehicle from Folse and that Folse was located at 1825 Pitt Street NE in Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 6, at 4. APD dispatched officers to the residence, where they observed an individual matching Folse's description close the front door.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 7, at 4. The officers failed, however, to positively identify the man.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 7, at 4. An APD detective then proceeded to the back of the residence and observed an individual-later identified as Valente Estrada-looking out the back window.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 7, at 4. Estrada said the front door was \"barricaded\" and that he was alone in the residence. PSR \u00b6 8, at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Shortly thereafter, the man first observed at the front door-later identified as Folse-\"had [Estrada] join four other individuals in the bedroom with Angela Murray,\" Folse's girlfriend,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   where Folse \"proceeded to take all of their cellular telephones and remove[ ] their batteries....\" PSR \u00b6 8, at 5. Estrada \"observed that Folse had both a knife and a handgun in his possession.\" PSR \u00b6 8, at 5. To help \"ease the tension,\" Estrada offered Folse and the others marijuana and methamphetamine. PSR \u00b6 9, at 5. After consuming the methamphetamine, Folse threatened to stab one of the individuals and to hold \"everyone in the room at gunpoint for seven hours.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   PSR \u00b6 9, at 5. Tensions were high, because Murray had challenged Folse to prove that he had not \"been with any of the women in the house[.]\" PSR \u00b6 10, at 5. In response to this challenge, Folse \"pulled out his gun and started pistol-whipping one of the females in the home.\" PSR \u00b6 10, at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Folse eventually decided to leave the residence, but, before leaving, Folse ordered Estrada to hand over the keys to his 2002 silver Saturn passenger vehicle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 11, at 5. Estrada complied with Folse's order, fearing that he \"had no choice ... based on the continuous threats and acts of violence against him.\" PSR \u00b6 11, at 5. Folse and Murray then exited the house, and ordered Estrada and one of Murray's female friends into the Saturn.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 11, at 5. Estrada and the friend \"did not feel they had a choice but to go with Folse....\" PSR \u00b6 11, at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   APD received information that Folse had departed the house in a silver Saturn.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 12, at 5. Officers soon caught up to the Saturn and attempted to conduct a traffic stop; Folse refused to yield, however, and, during the ensuing flight, threw a semiautomatic pistol from the vehicle.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 12, at 5. Folse eventually lost control of the vehicle and \"crashed violently, rolling the car onto its roof.\" PSR \u00b6 13,\n   at 6. As APD arrived on the scene, \"the vehicle was still spinning and four individuals emerged from the broken windows.\" PSR \u00b6 13, at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Folse and Murray fled on foot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 13, at 6. As they entered a residential street, they came upon a 2008 Kia Sorrento sitting in a driveway with the engine running.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 14, at 6. Folse opened the driver-side door and told Michael B., a juvenile sitting in the passenger seat, that he had \"three seconds to get out.\" PSR \u00b6 14, at 6. Michael B. complied with Folse's order, but as Michael B. was exiting the car, Folse backed the car out of the driveway and clipped Michael B.'s left shoulder with the open car door.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 14, at 6;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16, at 6. In an interview and later at trial, Michael B. testified that Folse had a firearm; immediately after the incident, however, he told a 911 operator that Folse did not have a firearm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 14, at 6;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16, at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   APD officers later located the Kia Sorrento and recognized Folse as the driver.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 15, at 6. When the officers attempted another vehicle stop, Folse again failed to yield.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 15, at 6. \"A vehicle pursuit ensued, but was discontinued due to the reckless driving by Folse.\" PSR \u00b6 15, at 6. Folse eventually abandoned the Kia Sorrento on Interstate 40, hopped the freeway retaining wall, and \"ran towards a business complex where he was able to get a ride out of the area.\" PSR \u00b6 15, at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The next day, on July 3, 2015, APD located Folse at a Seven-Eleven store in Albuquerque.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 17, at 6. When officers attempted to arrest Folse, he fled the scene in a stolen 1999 Ford F-150 truck.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 17, at 6. A vehicle pursuit again ensued, but \"officers disengaged from the chase because Folse was putting the public at risk of being harmed.\" PSR \u00b6 17, at 6. Later that day, Isleta Pueblo Police Department officers observed the Ford F-150 truck parked at the Isleta Casino outside Albuquerque.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 17, at 6. After reviewing security tapes, officers confirmed that Folse was in the Casino.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 17, at 6. When Folse exited Isleta Casino, officers arrested him without incident.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 17, at 6. The keys to the stolen F-150 were in his pocket.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 17, at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In September 2015, Folse wrote a letter to a friend known as \"Creeper,\" asking him \"to do what he could in assuring that [Estrada] would not show up to testify.\" PSR \u00b6 18, at 6. \"The letter was given to [Estrada] who then gave it to law enforcement.\" PSR \u00b6 18, at 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On July 14, 2015, a grand jury indicted Folse for: (i) being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1) and 924(a)(2) (Count I); (ii) carjacking a silver Saturn, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202119\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Count II); and (iii) using, carrying, and brandishing a firearm in relation to and in furtherance of a crime of violence,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , carjacking the Saturn, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (Count III).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment at 1-2, filed July 14, 2015 (Doc. 10)(\"Indictment\").

The Superseding Indictment preserves the original Indictment's three counts and adds two new counts.

On October 8, 2015, following a three-day trial, a jury convicted Folse on all four remaining counts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Verdict at 1, filed October 8, 2015 (Doc. 105).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The United States Probation Office (\"USPO\") filed a Presentence Investigation Report on May 10, 2017. PSR at 1. In the PSR, the USPO notes that, with respect to the violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) in Count III, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4 provides that the guideline sentence is a minimum seven-year term of imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6\u00b6 25-26, at 7-8. The PSR then groups Counts I and II for guideline calculation purposes pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(c).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 27, at 8. For these two counts, the PSR calculates an adjusted offense level of 30, including a base offense level of 20, a 4-level enhancement under \u00a7 2B3.1(4)(A) for abduction of Estrada, a 2-level enhancement under \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(5) for carjacking the Saturn, a 2-level obstruction-of-justice enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.1 for witness intimidation, and a 2-level enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.2 for reckless endangerment during flight.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6\u00b6 28-35, at 8. Regarding Count IV, the PSR calculates an adjusted offense level of 24, including a base offense level of 20, a 2-level enhancement under \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(5) for carjacking the Kia Sorrento, and a 2-level obstruction-of-justice enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.2 for reckless endangerment during flight.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6\u00b6 36-41, at 9. Given the multiple counts of conviction, the PSR calculates a combined adjusted offense level of 31.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6\u00b6 42-45, at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Finally, the PSR notes that Folse is a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1(a), because (i) he was at least eighteen years old when he committed the two federal carjackings; (ii) those carjackings are crimes of violence; and (iii) he has at least two prior felony convictions for a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 46, at 9.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 115, at 26 (noting that Folse has prior felony convictions for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and aggravated battery with a deadly weapon). The PSR accordingly calculates a criminal history category of VI under \u00a7 4B1.1(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 62, at 14. The PSR provides, however, that the total offense level remains 31, because, under \u00a7 4B1.1(b), \"if the offense level that is otherwise applicable is greater than the offense level listed in the table,\" the Court should \"use the otherwise applicable offense level.\" PSR \u00b6 47, at 9. The PSR notes that, here, the otherwise applicable offense level-31-is greater than the offense level listed in the table.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 47, at 9. The PSR adds that, pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.1(c), the applicable guideline range for a career-offender defendant convicted under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) is determined as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   In the case of multiple counts of conviction, the guideline range shall be the greater of (A) the guideline range that results by adding the mandatory minimum consecutive penalty required by the\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) to the minimum and maximum of the otherwise applicable guideline range, which results in a range of 272 months to 319 months; and (B) the guideline range determined using the table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(c)(3), which is 360 months to life.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   PSR \u00b6 47, at 9-10. The PSR concludes that, \"[s]ince it is the greater of the two\n   options, the guideline range shall be determined under 4B1.1(c)(3).\" PSR \u00b6 47, at 9. Thus, the PSR calculates a guideline imprisonment range of 360 months to life.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 97, at 23. The PSR notes, however, that, if he were not a career offender, Folse's total offense level of 31 and criminal history category of VI would yield a guideline imprisonment range of 188 to 235 months, plus a consecutive 84-month term for the\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) violation in Count III, resulting in an effective guideline range of 272 to 319 months.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PSR \u00b6 97, at 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Folse's Objections to the PSR.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Folse filed his formal objections to the PSR on May 15, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objections at 1. Folse makes three primary objections.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objections at 2-22. First, Folse argues that the career offender enhancement under \u00a7 4B1.1(a) does not apply, because (i) his prior felony conviction for aggravated battery with a deadly weapon is not a \"crime of violence\" under \u00a7 4B1.2(a) ; (ii) his prior conviction for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute should not be considered a \"controlled substance offense\" under \u00a7 4B1.2(b) ; and (iii) the carjackings for which he was convicted in this case do not constitute crimes of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objections at 2-17. Second, Folse contends that the 2-level obstruction-of-justice enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.2 for reckless endangerment during flight is not warranted, because his driving, while admittedly unsafe, was not \"reckless\" as \u00a7 3C1.2 requires. Objections at 18-19. Third, Folse avers that the 2-level obstruction-of-justice enhancement under \u00a7 3C1.1 for witness intimidation is not warranted, because he did not \"threaten, intimidate, or unlawfully influence\" a witness, nor did he enlist \"Creeper\" to do so. Objections at 19-22. In light of these objections, Folse disputes the PSR's guideline imprisonment calculation, and proffers an alternative calculation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objections at 23-24. Finally, Folse objects to several factual statements in the PSR.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objections at 24-27. The Court discusses all these objections in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    a.\n    <em>\n     Objections to the \"Career Offender\" Enhancement.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   For context, Folse begins by noting that a \"defendant who qualifies for the Career Offender enhancement faces a significantly longer sentence of imprisonment than one who does not.\" Objections at 3. He notes that, \"[r]egardless of a career offender's actual criminal history category, the Guidelines assign him the highest possible Criminal History Category: Category VI.\" Objections at 3 (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(b) ). Moreover, he notes, the \"Career Offender guideline is particularly onerous for a defendant convicted under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c),\" because it imposes a guideline range of 360 months to life for such offenders. Objections at 3. Here, he asserts, neither his conviction for aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, nor his conviction for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, justify the career offender enhancement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objections at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   First, Folse argues that his felony conviction for aggravated battery with a deadly weapon is not a \"crime of violence\" under \u00a7 4B1.2(a). Objections at 4. Section 4B1.2(a), he notes, defines \"crime of violence\" as an offense punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year that (i) \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another\"; or (ii) is one of several enumerated offenses. Objections at 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   He argues that, because his\n   conviction is not an enumerated offense under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2), it can \"only trigger application of the Career Offender guideline ... [if it] 'has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.' \" Objections at 4 (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1) ). Although he admits that courts in the United States District of New Mexico have concluded that \"New Mexico aggravated battery constitutes a 'crime of violence,' \" he contends that \"there is no controlling law on this point from the Tenth Circuit.\" Objections at 4.

Folse adds that, given the mandatory seven-year sentence for his conviction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), his effective guideline range is 194 to 221 months.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objections at 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    e.\n    <em>\n     Folse's Factual Objections.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Folse closes by noting his objections to several factual statements in the PSR which, he argues, lack support in evidence adduced either at trial or in investigative reports.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objections at 24-26. First, he contends that there is no evidence that he \"was observed driving a stolen black Cadillac on July 2, 2015 or at any time.\" Objections at 24 (citing PSR \u00b6 6, at 4). Second, he objects to the PSR's assertion that someone \"who matched the description of Folse\" closed the front door at 1825 Pitt Street NE in Albuquerque, New Mexico, PSR \u00b6 7, at 4, because \"that person was never positively identified as Mr. Folse,\" Objections at 24. Third, he asserts that there is no evidence that he held people \"at gunpoint\" inside the home. Objections at 25 (citing PSR \u00b6 9, at 5). Fourth, he avers that the PSR's statements regarding his \"pistol-whipping one of the females in the home,\" PSR \u00b6 10, at 5, are irrelevant to determining his sentence, and says that, regardless, the statements should be excluded from the PSR pursuant to rule 32(d)(3)(C) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   because the statements, if disclosed, \"might result in physical or other harm to the defendant or others,\" Objections at 25. Fifth, he objects to the statements that APD \"confirmed that Folse was the driver\" of the Saturn and that officers saw him throw a gun from the Saturn, PSR \u00b6 12, at 5, because \"no witnesses from APD testified that they observed and identified Mr. Folse as the driver of the Saturn,\" or that \"they had seen Mr. Folse throw a gun from the Saturn,\" Objections at 25. Sixth, he objects to the statement that people at the home\n   were \"kidnapped,\" PSR \u00b6 13, at 6, because he \"was never charged with or convicted of kidnapping, and the testimony adduced at trial does not establish the crime of kidnapping,\" Objections at 25. Seventh, he objects to the statement that he pointed a gun at Michael B., because the United States \"dismissed Count VI, the \u00a7 924(c) brandishing charge in connection with the second carjacking, based on the 911 audio recording in which M[ichael]\" said that Folse did not have a gun. Objections at 25-26 (citing PSR \u00b6 16, at 6). Eighth, he objects to the statement that he stole the Cadillac, because \"he was never positively identified as the perpetrator of that crime.\" Objections at 26 (citing PSR \u00b6 50, at 10). Last, he objects to the statements that he was identified as the driver of the Cadillac on June 30, 2015, and that he ran a red light and almost struck the APD officer, because \"[t]he police reports corresponding to that incident do not contain a positive identification of Mr. Folse as the driver of that vehicle during that incident.\" Objections at 26 (citing PSR \u00b6 51, at 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     The USPO's Third Addendum.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The USPO responds to Folse's Objections by way of an addendum to the PSR.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Addendum to the Presentence Report at 1, filed May 10, 2017 (Doc. 222)(\"Third Addendum\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The USPO responds first to Folse's objection to the 2-level obstruction-of-justice enhancement for witness intimidation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Addendum at 4-5. The USPO argues that the \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement should apply, because Folse asked \"Creeper\" to \"do what he could to assure that [Estrada] would not show up to testify.\" Third Addendum at 4. The USPO contends that Application Note (K) to \u00a7 3C1.1 provides that \"threatening the victim of the offense in an attempt to prevent the victim from reporting the conduct constituting the offense of conviction is obstruction.\" Third Addendum at 4. Next, the USPO responds to Folse's objection to the 2-level obstruction-of-justice enhancement for reckless endangerment under \u00a7 3C1.2.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Addendum at 4-5. The USPO asserts that the \u00a7 3C1.2 enhancement should apply, because Folse \"recklessly created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury ... in the course of fleeing from\" APD officers. Third Addendum at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Finally, the USPO responds to Folse's objection to the career-offender enhancement under \u00a7 4B1.1.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Addendum at 5-6. First, the USPO contends that Folse's prior conviction for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute qualifies as a \"controlled substance offense,\" because it is a fourth-degree felony punishable\n   by 18 months imprisonment. Third Addendum at 5-6. Second, the USPO asserts that Folse's prior conviction for aggravated battery with a deadly weapon qualifies as a \"crime of violence.\" Third Addendum at 6. The USPO notes that, under \u00a7 4B1.2, an offense is a crime of violence if its \"statutory definition contains any of the elements within the elements clause, which states, has the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\" Third Addendum at 6.

First, the Court concludes that Folse is a \"career offender\" under \u00a7 4B1.1, because: (i) the federal carjackings for which he was convicted in this case are crimes of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2(a) ; (ii) his prior conviction for aggravated battery with a deadly weapon is a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2(a) ; and (iii) his prior conviction for possession of marijuana with intent to distribute is a controlled substance offense under \u00a7 4B1.2(b). The Court thus concludes that Folse's criminal history category is VI and that, given his conviction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), the PSR correctly calculates his guideline imprisonment range at 360 months to life.

Objections at 4. Tenth Circuit decisions concerning New Mexico aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, however, are persuasive in this context. In\n   <em>\n    United States v. Maldonado-Palma\n   </em>\n   , for example, the Tenth Circuit concluded that, under New Mexico law, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon requires that the defendant actually use such a weapon,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that \"merely possessing a deadly weapon\" is insufficient.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177590\" index=\"289\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/839/1244/\">\n    839 F.3d at 1250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnote omitted). The Tenth Circuit, accordingly, held that New Mexico aggravated assault with a deadly weapon categorically is a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2, because employing a deadly weapon \"necessarily threatens the use of physical force, i.e., 'force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The same logic applies to aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, which, in New Mexico, requires proof of a deadly weapon's use in the offense and not its mere possession.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"293\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2030-3-5\">\n    N.M.

UJI 14-322 (instructing that aggravated battery with a deadly weapon requires proof that the defendant \"touched or applied force to\" the victim with a deadly weapon, and that the defendant \"used\" a deadly weapon). Indeed, this logic is especially persuasive here, because, unlike an attempted-battery assault, Folse's conviction involves a completed battery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Folse objects that\n   <em>\n    United States v. Maldonado-Palma\n   </em>\n   and other aggravated-assault cases are inapposite, because, he asserts, aggravated battery with a deadly weapon \"does not require 'use' of a deadly weapon,' \" but rather that the defendant \"touch[ ] a person 'with' a firearm or deadly weapon.\" Objections at 12 (citing NMRA, Crim. UJI 14-322 ). In support of\n   this argument, Folse adverts to New Mexico's uniform jury instruction for aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, which directs the jury to decide, in relevant part, whether:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   1. The defendant touched or applied force to _______ (\n   <em>\n    name of victim\n   </em>\n   ) by _______ with a [_______] [deadly weapon. The defendant used a _______ (\n   <em>\n    name of instrument or object\n   </em>\n   ). A _______ (\n   <em>\n    name of instrument or object\n   </em>\n   ) is a deadly weapon only if you find that a _______ (\n   <em>\n    name of object\n   </em>\n   ), when used as a weapon, could cause death or great bodily harm]....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   NMRA, Crim. UJI 14-322 (bracketed material and emphases in original)(footnotes omitted). The instruction's use notes specify that, if the subject weapon is listed in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"294\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2030-1-12\">\n    N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 30-1-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (B), the weapon's name should be inserted into the first pair of brackets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NMRA, Crim. UJI 14-322 cmt. n.3. Section 30-1-12(B), in turn, designates as \"deadly weapons\" items such as \"any firearm\" and various knives. The use notes state that if, however, \u00a7 30-1-12(B) does not list the subject weapon, the jury should receive the \"alternative\" instruction that the second pair of brackets delineates. NMRA, Crim. UJI 14-322 cmt. n.5. Thus, if the defendant is charged, for example, with aggravated battery with a firearm, the jury must decide whether the defendant \"touched or applied force to [the victim] ... with a [firearm]\"; alternatively, if \u00a7 30-1-12(B) does not list the subject weapon, the jury must decide whether the defendant \"used\" the weapon. NMRA, Crim. UJI 14-322. Folse, therefore, is technically correct that aggravated battery with a firearm does not require a jury instruction on the defendant's \"use\" of the firearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   This conclusion, however, is immaterial, because, in this context, touching or applying force to someone \"with\" a firearm is the same as \"using\" a firearm.

The Tenth Circuit, relying on this interpretation, has construed \"use\" in New Mexico's uniform jury instruction on aggravated assault with a deadly weapon as requiring that the defendant \"employ the deadly weapon in committing the assault\" and not \"merely possess[ ] a deadly weapon.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Similarly, the only way to touch or apply force \"with\" a deadly weapon, as the aggravated-battery instruction requires, NMRA, Crim. UJI 14-322, is to\n   <em>\n    employ\n   </em>\n   a deadly weapon in committing the battery. Folse, however, contends-without analysis-that \" 'with' ... [is] '[a] word denoting a relation of proximity, contiguity, or association.' \" Objections at 12 (citing\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (6th ed. 1990) ). While this definition is accurate, it is meaningless in a vacuum, because it begs the question\n   <em>\n    what\n   </em>\n   is related and\n   <em>\n    how.\n   </em>\n   Here, the prepositional phrase \"with a [deadly weapon]\" modifies the verbs \"touched\" and \"applied,\" with the preposition denoting a causal relationship between the deadly weapon on the one hand and the physical contact on the other. Folse's apparent suggestion that the term \"with\" denotes a deadly weapon's mere proximity to, rather than its use in, a battery, contravenes this plain reading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Folse, in a further attempt to distinguish aggravated-assault cases, contends that those cases \"focus on the 'threat' of physical force in determining that the statutes at issue necessitated '\n   <em>\n    violent\n   </em>\n   force....' \" Objections at 8 (emphasis in original). The focus on threats of force, however, is not a\n   distinguishing factor, because any offense may qualify as a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2 if it \"has as an element the ... threatened use of physical force....\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1). Nevertheless, Folse avers that, because \"it is possible to commit battery without threatening a person,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , without \" 'causing the person to believe the person is about to be battered,' \" the aggravated-assault cases' \"logic ... does not translate to New Mexico aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.\" Objections at 10 (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

This analysis is unavailing for two primary reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   First, the Tenth Circuit's threat analysis in its aggravated-assault cases is not limited to overt threats of violence that the victims subjectively apprehend. In\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ramon Silva\n   </em>\n   , for example, the Tenth Circuit held that aggravated assault with a deadly weapon carries two threats of violence: (i) \"[t]he conduct 'could always lead to ... substantial and violent contact,' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3687866\" index=\"300\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/608/663/#p670\">\n    608 F.3d at 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Thus, the Tenth Circuit found threats in (i) the conduct's inherent propensity to lead to violence; and (ii) the victim's subjective apprehension of additional violence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Here, although Folse may be correct that aggravated battery does not necessarily have as an element the subjective-apprehension threat, because it is possible to commit a battery without the victim apprehending any violence,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Objections at 10, it does not follow that aggravated-assault cases are inapposite. To the contrary, those cases have persuasive force, because they hold that the use of a deadly weapon in the commission of an aggravated assault inherently risks leading to physical violence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Though the Tenth Circuit \"recognize[d] that\n   <em>\n    Treto-Martinez\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Dominguez\n   </em>\n   analyzed aggravated battery statutes that criminalized intentional physical contact\n   with a deadly weapon,\" it nevertheless \"consider[ed] these decisions persuasive,\" because they turn on threats of violence that stem from the use of a deadly weapon in the offense.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The same logic counsels the Court's reliance on aggravated-assault jurisprudence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Folse's final argument is that aggravated battery with a deadly weapon is not a \"crime of violence,\" because the offense does not necessarily entail \"death or bodily harm.\" Objections at 5-6.

If the Department of Justice is not going to go after wealthy Anglo-owned marijuana establishments in Colorado and other states, the Court is not likely to defer to the United States' requests in New Mexico that it should detain Hispanic defendants charged only with marijuana-only drug crimes. Similarly, if a defendants' criminal background includes marijuana-only possession, or marijuana-only drug convictions or arrests, the Court is not likely to give them much, if any, weight, in deciding whether to detain that defendant before trial. Similarly, at the sentencing of a marijuana-only crime, the Court is likely to vary downward as much as possible. Those\n   are areas in which the Court has some discretion. In calculating the correct guideline range-as opposed to deciding what to do with the guideline range-the Court has to calculate the guideline range correctly.
