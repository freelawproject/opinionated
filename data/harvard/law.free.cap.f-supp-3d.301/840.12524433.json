Durkin, United States District Judge\n   In this class action lawsuit, plaintiff Practice Management Support Services, Inc. challenges the alleged practice of defendants Cirque du Soleil, Inc., and Cirque du Soleil (US), Inc., of using a fax broadcasting service to advertise theatrical shows without providing sufficient instructions about how to opt out, in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\"TCPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The eight-year procedural history of this case is set forth in two prior orders. R. 63; R. 116. The parties have litigated a variety of procedural issues in state and federal court, and they have engaged in protracted discovery three times. R. 116 at 2. Currently before the Court is Practice Management's motion for class certification (R. 68). For the reasons explained below, the Court grants that motion in part.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants produce theatrical shows worldwide under the \"Cirque du Soleil\" trade name. In January 2009, one or both of the defendants contracted with a fax broadcasting company called ProFax to market shows to a list of fax numbers purchased from list providers. R. 68-6 at 18-19; R. 68-5 at 15-17; R. 68-8. A single employee of defendants was in charge of communicating with ProFax with respect to all of the fax blasts at issue in this case, and two other employees were responsible for determining what fax target lists would be sent to Profax. R. 68-6 at 41-44. Defendants' employees do not recall calling any companies on the lists to seek permission to send the faxes. R. 68-6 at 46-47; R. 68-5 at 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Transmission logs showing precisely to whom faxes were successfully sent by ProFax at defendants' direction no longer exist. ProFax sends its clients transmission logs via email providing the date and time of each transmission and whether it was successful, but that data is deleted in less than six months unless a client requests that it be retained. R. 68-7 at 19-20. ProFax could not find any of the fax transmission logs for defendants' account.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendants' employee in charge of communicating with ProFax testified that he deleted the transmission logs soon after receiving them because they were \"heavy files.\" R. 68-6 at 31-36, 92.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Practice Management did obtain through discovery in this litigation 21 ProFax invoices associated with defendants' account that show the total number of faxes successfully sent by ProFax on certain dates (as well as the total number of faxes attempted that were not successful). R. 68-4; R. 68-7 at 12-13. The ProFax invoices correspond with 16 different ads for which plaintiffs obtained images during discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 68-3; R. 68-4; R. 68-10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Practice Management also obtained four fax target lists-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , excel spreadsheets showing names, addresses, fax numbers, and other data for fax targets. R. 68-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Practice Management's expert Robert Biggerstaff produced a report adding together the number of faxes shown as sent in the ProFax invoices for the 16 ads, calculating a total of 40,146 successfully sent faxes. R. 68-10 at 8-9. Biggerstaff also matched four of the ProFax invoices to the four fax target list excel spreadsheets. R. 68-10 at 8-9. He concluded that a spreadsheet titled \"cirRockford.xls\" corresponds with the invoice for \"Rockford Special Offer,\" a spreadsheet titled \"cirROCKFORD_school.xls\" corresponds with the invoice for \"Rockford Schools,\" a spreadsheet titled \"List_Chicago_Vaudeville _Faxblast_June 2009\" corresponds with the invoice for \"Chicago Group Fax,\" and a spreadsheet titled \"List_Colorado.xls\" corresponds with the invoice for \"Denver Group Fax.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A large percentage of the entries in three of these spreadsheets appear to be for Illinois businesses and residents.

Both arguments misconstrue the class definitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   With respect to the first argument, Practice Management did not limit its class definition in its complaint to fax broadcasts of the July 7, 2009 Vaudeville ad. Although the complaint pleaded that Practice Management received the July 7, 2009 Vaudeville ad, R. 1 at 3, the complaint's class definition included \"[a]ll persons\" who were sent ad faxes \"by or on behalf of Defendants\" any time \"on or after April 19, 2007\" that failed to comply with TCPA opt-out notice requirements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. The complaint further alleges that defendants sent \"the same\n   <em>\n    and similar\n   </em>\n   unsolicited facsimiles\" to the class, and that the class covered \"Exhibit A [the July 7, 2009 Vaudeville ad]\n   <em>\n    and other\n   </em>\n   unsolicited faxed advertisements.\" R. 1 at 4, 5 (emphasis added). Practice Management's revised class definition thus narrows rather than broadens the scope of the class to focus on specific ads-namely, ads for which Practice Management obtained the fax image and a corresponding ProFax invoice in discovery. And as defendants acknowledge (R. 125 at 6), these fax images and corresponding invoices were all produced during discovery as part of an earlier, related federal action (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6, 22; R. 125-1), so their inclusion cannot have come as a true surprise to defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendants' second argument is based on another misreading of the complaint's class definition. Defendants claim that the complaint's class definition was limited to \"people who received faxes advertising\n   <em>\n    Defendants'\n   </em>\n   goods and services.\" R. 125 at 12. In fact, the complaint definition included \"persons ...\n   <em>\n    sent\n   </em>\n   telephone facsimile messages of material advertising the commercial availability of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   property, goods, or services\n   <em>\n    by or on behalf of\n   </em>\n   Defendants.\" R. 1 at 4 (emphasis added). This definition did not limit the class to recipients of fax advertisements for \"\n   <em>\n    Defendants'\n   </em>\n   goods and services.\" Rather, it defined the class as recipients of fax advertisements for \"any\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   goods and services as long as they were \"sent ... by or on behalf of Defendants.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   As Practice Management explains, it based the definition in its complaint on the FCC regulation defining the \"sender\" of a fax advertisement as a \"person or entity on whose behalf a facsimile unsolicited advertisement is sent....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2064.1200\">\n    47 C.F.R. \u00a7 64.1200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1). Practice Management indicates that it changed \"by or on behalf of Defendants\" to \"from 'Cirque du Soleil' \" in its revised class definition to avoid a fail-safe problem created when a class definition is too closely tied to the statutory elements. As this Court has previously explained, \"[i]n cases ... under the TCPA, it can be tempting for a plaintiff to define its class in terms of the statutory elements that establish liability....

And, Practice Management says, its claim and the putative class members' claims are based on the same legal theory of unsolicited advertisements sent without compliant opt-out notices under the TCPA. As Practice Management explains, courts routinely hold that these facts make a named plaintiff's claim typical in a TCPA case.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Holtzman v.

The Eastern District of Missouri rejected a similar argument in a TCPA fax case where the defendant sent fax advertisements in ten different broadcasts over two years targeting physicians in five practice areas and the plaintiff received only the last broadcast.\n   <em>\n    St. Louis Heart Ctr., Inc. v.

Although the Court need not decide merits questions at this stage, it notes that this admission and evidence likely satisfies the standard for \"sender\" liability recently approved by the Seventh Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Paldo Sign\n   </em>\n   : a defendant is liable for faxes sent by a fax broadcaster on its behalf where the defendant \"caused by words or conduct the fax broadcaster ... to believe reasonably that [defendant] approved the sending of the fax broadcast transmission.\" 825 F.3d at 797. In any event, the question of whether contracting with and paying ProFax to send ads makes one or more defendants \"senders\" liable under the first, on-whose-behalf prong of the regulations is common among Practice Management and the rest of the putative class-it can be decided in a single stroke. That also means that Practice Management's legal theory with respect to the sender element of its TCPA claim is typical of the rest of the class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In sum, because Practice Management's claim is based on the same course of conduct (sending fax blasts through the same fax broadcaster, at the direction of the same employees, bearing the Cirque du Soleil trade name, and promoting Cirque shows during a discrete period of time) and legal theory (an opt out notice theory based on faxes sent on behalf of defendants) as the other class members it seeks to represent, the Court holds that typicality is satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

Both parties have, for instance, filed multiple oversized briefs in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 143 at 5. And with respect to the related, prior litigation, the multiple suits were in part putative class counsel's doing, but in part due to the array of corporate entities defendants have established (including Cirque du Soleil Burlesco, the entity discussed above), which resulted in the current defendants not being sued in the first federal action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 143 at 6; R. 140 at 5 (explaining that class counsel filed related state court action because federal judge denied plaintiff the ability to add other Cirque corporate entities who were more appropriate defendants).

This argument can be broken down into two parts. First, there are the questions of whether faxes were successfully sent (for purposes of TCPA liability), and if so, how many total (for purposes of calculating statutory damages).

[Defendant] contends that there is no \"definitive means of determining whether any of the numbers on the opt-out list received the subject fax without conducting an individualized inquiry,\" ... but that again conflates the issues of the adequacy of the class definition and the means of proving a claim.... And again, evidence of receipt may be supplemented by other evidence, such as retained copies of faxes received, affidavits of receipt, evidence relating to fax machine ownership, or other facts that are probative of whether or not an individual received a fax described in the class definition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The same reasoning applies here.

The California Supreme Court held that the lower court had specific personal jurisdiction over Bristol-Myers with respect to the nonresidents' claims because those claims could be aggregated with the California residents' claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1779. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that for purposes of specific (as opposed to general) personal jurisdiction, \"[t]he mere\n   fact that\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs were [harmed in] California-and allegedly suffered the same injury as nonresidents-does not allow the State to assert specific jurisdiction over the nonresidents' claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1781.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The Supreme Court explained that the \"primary focus of our personal jurisdiction inquiry is the defendant's relationship to the forum state.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1779. \"A court with general jurisdiction may hear\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   claim against that defendant, even if all the incidents underlying the claim occurred in a different state.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1780. But \"[s]pecific jurisdiction is very different.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For purposes of \"specific jurisdiction, the\n   <em>\n    suit\n   </em>\n   must aris[e] out of or relat[e] to the defendant's contacts with the\n   <em>\n    forum.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court found that defendants' rights under the Fourteenth Amendment due process clause, \"acting as an instrument of interstate federalism,\" would be violated through an exercise of personal jurisdiction over defendants with respect to nonresidents' claims based on injuries outside the forum.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1780-81. \"This remains true,\" the Court explained, \"even when third parties ... can bring claims similar to those brought by the nonresidents.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1781.

The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   explicitly distinguished\n   <em>\n    Shutts\n   </em>\n   , explaining that\n   <em>\n    Shutts\n   </em>\n   dealt with the due process rights of nonresident class members-not the due process rights of\n   <em>\n    defendants.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1782-83. \"Since\n   <em>\n    Shutts\n   </em>\n   concerned the due process rights of [nonresident]\n   <em>\n    plaintiffs\n   </em>\n   ,\" the Court explained, \"it has no bearing on the question presented.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1783.

The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   explained that a court could validly exercise personal jurisdiction over nonresidents' claims in situations where it possesses \"general jurisdiction\" over the defendant. 137 S.Ct. at 1783. But there is no basis for an assertion of general personal jurisdiction here. Practice Management has acknowledged in summary judgment responses filed previously in this litigation that defendant Cirque du Soleil, Inc. is incorporated in Quebec, Canada and has its registered office in Montreal. R. 55 \u00b6 5. It has also acknowledged that defendant Cirque du Soleil (US), Inc. is incorporated in Delaware and has its registered office in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. Therefore, this Court lacks general jurisdiction over either defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v.

Practice Management makes no argument to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   That means the only basis for this Court's exercise of personal jurisdiction over defendants is specific jurisdiction. Again, for an exercise of specific personal jurisdiction, \"the\n   <em>\n    suit\n   </em>\n   must aris[e] out of or relat[e] to the defendant's contacts with the\n   <em>\n    forum.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   , 137 S.Ct. at 1780. And under\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   , \"[t]he mere fact\" that Practice Management received a fax in Illinois \"does not allow\" for an exercise of \"specific jurisdiction over the nonresidents' claims\" with respect to faxes received outside of Illinois (and whose claims thus do not relate to defendants' contacts with Illinois).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1781. Because these nonresidents' claims do not relate to defendants' contacts with Illinois, exercising specific personal jurisdiction over defendants with respect to them would violate defendants' due process rights. Thus, as in\n   <em>\n    DeBernardis\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   , the Court finds it appropriate to dismiss the claims of the non-Illinois-resident class members.\n   <em>\n    DeBernardis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%20461228\">\n    2018 WL 461228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (granting motion to dismiss the claims of \"out-of-state plaintiff classes\");\n   <em>\n    McDonnell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204864910\">\n    2017 WL 4864910\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4-5 (dismissing claims of non-Illinois-resident class members);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Greene\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523327\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/289/870/#p874\">\n    289 F.Supp.3d at 876-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%207410565\">\n    2017 WL 7410565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (dismissing claims of a nonresident named plaintiff).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   This ruling does not change this Court's holdings with respect to the class certification elements. In particular, numerosity is easily established \"by a preponderance of the evidence\" (\n   <em>\n    Messner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722982\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/669/802/#p811\">\n    669 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   811 ) for a class of Illinois residents alone. The target list spreadsheets show \"PRIMARY_STATE=IL\" for many thousands of addresses to which ProFax sent the Rockford and Vaudeville advertisements. R. 68-10 at 7. And, at least at this juncture, the Court fails to see why the claims process could not proceed as outlined above, with the three target list spreadsheets showing primarily Illinois addresses as starting points and requiring claims affidavits to verify Illinois residency and receipt of the faxes in Illinois.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Because the impact of\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   arose by way of defendants' motion for leave to file supplemental authority, the parties did not have an opportunity to brief the issue of how the class should be defined if the Court were to rule, as it has, that it lacks personal jurisdiction over defendants with respect to class members who are not Illinois residents. Defendants suggest in their motion that the \"proposed class definition\" could be \"limited to persons or entities located in Illinois who received faxes in Illinois.\" R. 150 at 4. But they do not give focused treatment to this issue. And Practice Management, because its response argued that\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable, never addressed the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Because the Court \"must define the class\" in an order granting class certification ( Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(1)(B) ), the Court defines the class, for current purposes, as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   All persons who are residents of Illinois and all entities located in Illinois who were successfully sent a facsimile in Illinois containing the \"Cirque du Soleil\" trade name from January 29, 2009, through July 8, 2009, offering tickets for sale to the following performances: \"Saltimbanco\" at Rockford MetroCentre, Rockford, Illinois, opening February 25, 2009; and \"A New Twist on Vaudeville\" at Chicago Theatre, Chicago, Illinois, opening November 19, 2009.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The Court finds that it is unlikely, based on the current record, that any non-Illinois theatrical shows should be included within the class definition. The only available fax target list for a non-Illinois show-the target list corresponding with the \"Kooza\" show at Pepsi Center Grounds in Denver, Colorado, opening August 20, 2009-lists \"CO\" as the \"PRIMARY_STATE\" for all of the addresses included. R. 68-10 at 7. This means that the Colorado show almost certainly should not be included in the class definition, and further indicates that the other non-Illinois shows should not be included. The Court therefore believes its definition is proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   If the parties believe that any modifications should be made to the current class definition-which, again, is not an issue on which the parties have previously focused-they can raise that issue at the next status conference, and the Court may allow a limited period of time for the parties to file short position papers regarding the appropriate class definition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants Practice Management's motion for class certification in part (R. 68), appoints Practice Management as class representative, and appoints the law firms of Anderson + Wanca and the Margulis Law Group as class counsel. The Court also grants defendants' motions for leave to file supplemental authority (R. 140; R. 148; R. 150).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The Court finds that the Supreme Court's ruling in\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v.
