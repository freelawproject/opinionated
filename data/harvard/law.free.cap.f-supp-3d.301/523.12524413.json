BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (\"Liberty Mutual\"), initiated the above-captioned action by filing a complaint against Gemma on April 22, 2016. (Doc. No. 1.) In its first complaint, Liberty Mutual asserted ten counts against Gemma, which set forth claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty/duty of loyalty, conversion, misappropriation of trade secrets under the Pennsylvania Uniform Trade Secrets Act, a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , unjust enrichment, tortious interference with a contract, tortious interference with prospective economic advantage, and unfair competition, as well as a request for injunctive relief. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-29.) On the same date that it filed its complaint, Liberty Mutual also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction against Gemma. (Doc. No. 2.) On May 2, 2016, the Honorable Cathy Bissoon conducted a conference with the parties via telephone (Doc. No. 12), in which the court \"encouraged the parties to attempt to reach agreement on Plaintiff's requested injunctive relief\" (Doc. No. 16). Subsequently, the parties submitted a standstill agreement on May 10, 2016, under which Gemma agreed to adhere to certain restrictions pending an Order from the Court as to the status of Liberty Mutual's motion for injunctive relief. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Court approved the standstill agreement on May 10, 2016. (Doc. No. 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 16, 2016, Gemma filed an answer to Liberty Mutual's complaint. (Doc. No. 22.) The Court then issued an Order dated June 6, 2016, which mandated that all expedited discovery would be due by July 29, 2016. (Doc. No. 26.) On the same date, Gemma filed an amended answer to Liberty Mutual's complaint. (Doc. No. 27.) On June 28, 2016, Liberty Mutual moved for a protective order (Doc. No. 28), which the court granted, subject to certain revisions (Doc. No. 29). On December 15, 2016, Liberty Mutual filed an amended complaint against Gemma and the Everest Defendants, setting forth ten counts. (Doc. No. 37.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Subsequently, on March 30, 2017, Gemma and the Everest Defendants each filed the instant motions to dismiss the amended complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) (Doc. Nos. 46, 49.) Gemma submitted a brief in support of his\n   motion on March 30, 2017. (Doc. No. 47.) Liberty Mutual submitted a brief in opposition to Gemma's motion to dismiss on April 28, 2017. (Doc. No. 55.) Gemma did not submit a reply brief. As to their motion, the Everest Defendants submitted a brief in support on March 30, 2017. (Doc. No. 50.) Liberty Mutual submitted a brief in opposition to the Everest Defendants' motion to dismiss on April 28, 2017. (Doc. No. 54.) On May 5, 2017, the Everest Defendants filed a reply brief. (Doc. No. 56.) Accordingly, as they are either fully briefed, or the requisite time period for responsive briefing has expired, both motions are ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    Everest Consulting Group, L.P., is listed in the caption of this action as doing business as Northwood Realty Services.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-14\">\n    <strong>\n     B. Factual Background\n    </strong>\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    <strong>\n     1. Liberty Mutual's Sale of Insurance\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    The allegations in the amended complaint stem from events surrounding Gemma's former employment as a sales representative with Liberty Mutual, departure from Liberty Mutual, and subsequent professional involvement with the Everest Defendants. (Doc. No. 37.) Liberty Mutual \"offers a wide range of property-casualty insurance products and services to both individuals and businesses, including personal[,] automobile, homeowners, personality liability and life insurance.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 14.) Its customers \"are its policyholders,\" and both current and prospective policyholders \"seeking Liberty Mutual insurance provide sensitive and confidential information to Liberty Mutual in order to determine the extent of coverage.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 15.) Consequently, its revenues \"are based, in large part, on the premiums it receives from its policyholders.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 17.) To that end, Liberty Mutual employs sales associates to market its products to customers and \"develops group savings plus, affinity, marketing agreements or relationships with groups ... that assist Liberty Mutual in advertising, marketing and selling Liberty Mutual products to the group members and/or their clientele.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 18-19.) Specifically, Liberty Mutual, which has a sales office located in Wexford, Pennsylvania, \"had such relationships with Northwood, a residential real estate company serving the Greater Pittsburgh region.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    <strong>\n     2. Gemma's Employment with Liberty Mutual\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    Gemma began his employment with Liberty Mutual as a sales representative in 1998 and was \"assigned to and worked out of the Wexford office until his resignation on April 7, 2016.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 22.) After receiving multiple promotions over the course of his employment, at the time of his resignation, Gemma was an executive sales representative, \"the highest level of sales representative in the company.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) In this capacity, he worked extensively on Liberty Mutual's \"affinity/group savings and/or marketing programs, especially with Northwood,\" which is a \"full-service real estate firm, with offices throughout the Greater Pittsburgh area ... [that] provides services to its customers at all steps of the real estate process ... assisting customers with their insurance needs.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    In 2005, \"Liberty Mutual entered into affinity/group savings and marketing relationships with Northwood,\" through which \"Northwood markets Liberty Mutual by offering its customers the opportunity to receive quotes for insurance coverage underwritten by Liberty Mutual, and discounted affinity/group savings pricing.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 30.) Gemma played a central role in the beginning of this relationship between Liberty Mutual and Northwood, and served as \"the lead contact person who directed and managed Liberty Mutual's affinity/group savings and marketing programs\n    with Northwood.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 31.) In this regard, Gemma \"actively worked with Northwood on behalf of Liberty Mutual, frequently traveling to its offices and spending time there developing relationships and good will with Northwood personnel.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 36.) Liberty Mutual \"devoted significant resources\" to the development of its relationship with Northwood, citing as examples Gemma's roles on the board of the Northwood Charitable Foundation and as the former chair of Northwood's golf tournament on multiple occasions. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 37.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    As a result of its relationship with Northwood, Liberty Mutual \"received a significant number of customer leads and developed a significant number of policyholders.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 38.) In addition, \"Liberty Mutual offered, and Northwood accepted, substantial discounts off Liberty Mutual's insurance pricing for Northwood and its customers.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 41.) Gemma continued to act as Liberty Mutual's primary contact person with respect to Northwood (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 42), and from November 9, 2015 to April 7, 2016 (the date of Gemma's resignation), Gemma \"sold over 100 policies to customers of Northwood\" on behalf of Liberty Mutual (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 44).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    <strong>\n     3. Exchange of Confidential Information Related to Policyholders\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    In his capacity as a sales representative, Gemma gained access to information regarding Liberty Mutual's current and prospective policyholders, and \"[t]hose existing and prospective policyholder referral relationships are the lifeblood of Liberty Mutual's business.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 45-46.) Because of the nature of his position as a sales representative, Gemma communicated with current and prospective policyholders, \"determin[ed] the needs and preferences of policyholders/referral sources, solicit[ed] those policyholders/referral sources, [and] introduc[ed] product lines to those policyholders/referral sources ... all for Liberty Mutual.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 47.) Gemma was thus required to develop and gather information about policyholders, which \"is treated by Liberty Mutual as highly confidential and valuable,\" and he \"agreed expressly to ensure the confidentiality of that information.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 48-49.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    Further, \"[s]ince the beginning of his employment with Liberty Mutual,\" and as a condition of his employment and eligibility for compensation and various benefits, Gemma \"executed a series of agreements with Liberty Mutual containing confidentiality and restrictive covenant provisions.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 55.) According to Liberty Mutual, the most recent agreement of this type is the Gemma Agreement, which Gemma signed in relation to the Liberty Mutual 2016 US Executive Sales Representatives Compensation Plan (\"2016 Comp Plan\"), \"which provided Gemma the opportunity to earn substantial bonus compensation beyond\n    his base salary as well as bonus compensation beyond what he received in 2015.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 56.) His signing of the Gemma Agreement was required in order for him to receive any benefits under the 2016 Comp Plan, and in 2016, he was paid by Liberty Mutual according to the terms of the 2016 Comp Plan. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 57.) The agreement required,\n    <em>\n     inter\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     alia\n    </em>\n    , that Gemma \"maintain the confidentiality of Liberty Mutual's confidential information and ... abide by certain post-employment restrictive covenants.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 58.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    Specifically, Section 1 of the Gemma Agreement states: \"I also agree not to divulge to, share with, or permit access by any person, company or organization not currently employed by or affiliated with the [Liberty Mutual] to such [p]roperty both during and after my tenure as an employee of [Liberty Mutual].\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 60.) In addition, pursuant to Section 2 of the Gemma Agreement, Gemma agreed not to engage in certain activities \"for two years following the termination of his employment\" with Liberty Mutual. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 61.) Such activities include the following:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n    [S]ell or attempt to sell products or services of the type or kind offered by or through the Company to any person, company or organization to whom [he] previously provided any service or to whom [he] previously quoted or sold insurance products offered by or through the Company during the last twelve months of [his] employment with the Company.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n    [C]ontact, advise, induce or assist any policyholder or prospective policyholder of the Company, to whom insurance obtained from or through the Company was sold or quoted, be it a person, company or organization, to reduce, replace, lapse, surrender or cancel any insurance obtained from or through the Company.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n    [S]olicit or attempt to solicit the purchase of products or services of the type or kind offered by or through the Company by, or contact, any person, company or organization to whom [he] previously provided any service or to whom [he] previously quoted or sold insurance products offered by or through the Company during the last twelve months of [his] employment with the Company.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) (alterations in original) (citations omitted). Additionally, in regard to marketing/affinity accounts, including those associated with Northwood, Gemma agreed that during the two-year period following the termination of his employment with Liberty Mutual, he would not:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n    contact, solicit or attempt to solicit the purchase of products or services of the type or kind offered by or through the Company, or the establishment of any group discount program with any affinity account, group savings plus account, marketing or networking account (including but not limited to mortgage companies, auto dealers, and real estate companies) for whom [he] served as the Company contact during the last twelve months of [his] employment with the Company.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 62) (alterations in original).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    <strong>\n     4. Gemma's Relationship with the Everest Defendants\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    Prior to his resignation from Liberty Mutual in April of 2016, Gemma and the Everest Defendants \"secretly discussed and planned Gemma's departure from Liberty Mutual and the establishment of a competing insurance agency,\" and \"[a] centerpiece of their plan was Gemma's involvement in the planned solicitation of Northwood personnel for customers for the new insurance agency.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 66.) According\n    to Liberty Mutual, this collaboration among Defendants involved Northwood's Executive Vice President and Member of Everest Insurance, Wendy West, \"sen[ding] Gemma the contact information for the law firm that is representing Gemma\" in the above-captioned action because \"Everest was aware of the ... Gemma Agreement and understood that Gemma working with and joining Everest would implicate the Gemma Agreement ... and/or Gemma's common law obligations to Liberty Mutual.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 67.) In addition, approximately ten months before Gemma's resignation, \"Defendants reserved the 'Everest Insurance, LLC' name,\" and \"[a]t least as early as 2015, Defendants began working on behalf of Everest Insurance ... [with] Gemma performing such work during normal business hours when he was being paid by, and should have been working on behalf of, Liberty Mutual.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 69-70.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Liberty Mutual also alleges that prior to his resignation, Gemma \"actively encourag[ed] Everest to take actions that would negatively affect the Liberty Mutual-Northwood relationship, such as removing Liberty Mutual from the Northwood website and discontinuing the discount.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 73.) In addition, Gemma and Everest \"worked together to marginalize other Liberty Mutual sales representatives in Northwood offices so that when Gemma eventually resigned from Liberty Mutual, he would be in a position to steer future business to Everest,\" and due to \"misleading comments and representations\" from Defendants, \"Liberty Mutual assigned Gemma additional Northwood offices at the expense of other Liberty Mutual Sales representatives.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 74.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    In addition, Liberty Mutual asserts that \"[i]n competing with Liberty Mutual, Defendants also utilized confidential Liberty Mutual information,\" alleging that in October of 2015, Gemma \"emailed to his personal email account an Excel file entitled '10-07-15 book.xlsx,' \" which \"contained Liberty Mutual confidential information, such as premium amounts.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 77.) He then deleted the email from the \"sent\" folder of his Liberty Mutual email account and forwarded that email from his personal email account to an Everest employee on November 10, 2015, therefore also transmitting the Excel spreadsheet. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 78-79.) Liberty Mutual maintains that Defendants \"used and/or disclosed information contained in the Excel spreadsheet in connection with the planning and/or operation of Everest insurance.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) Along with this alleged correspondence, \"Gemma had numerous communications with numerous Northwood personnel concerning Defendants' new venture in competition with Liberty Mutual and Gemma attended a meeting of Northwood managers to discuss Everest Insurance and ... solicited them to direct potential insurance business away from Liberty Mutual and/or to Everest.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 82.) In addition, the Everest Insurance LLC Operating Agreement\n    \"was effective at least as of April 1, 2016 and ... Gemma was a Member and Manager\" of Everest Insurance LLC. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 81.) Accordingly, while still employed by Liberty Mutual, Gemma \"was a 25% owner of, and executive of, Everest, a direct competitor to Liberty Mutual,\" and he \"had a conflict of interest[,] which was known to Everest.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    )\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    In addition, Liberty Mutual alleges that in the two days prior to Gemma's resignation, Gemma \"sent at least 25 emails from his Liberty Mutual email account to his personal Gmail account.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 90.) According to Liberty Mutual, the emails \"included a total of 25 attachments containing Liberty Mutual's confidential, trade secret information concerning more than one thousand (1,000) Liberty Mutual policyholders, and dozens of Liberty Mutual referral sources.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 91.) More specifically, the first twenty-four emails each included an attached Excel document \"contain[ing] confidential, trade secret information concerning Liberty Mutual policyholders,\" and the twenty-fifth email included an Excel spreadsheet \"from the June 15, 2015 Northwood golf outing, containing contact information for dozens of Northwood personnel, and other actual or potential referral sources.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 92.) For purposes of reference, Liberty Mutual's amended complaint places the documents into three separate categories: \"(1) Category A-Property and Casualty Insurance; (b) Category B-Life Insurance; and (c) Category C-Marketing Account Personnel.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 93.) The documents in Category A include \"Excel documents listing policyholder information related to insurance sales that Gemma made from 2001 through 2003, and 2005 through 2016,\" and those in Category B include similar information.\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 94, 103.) Additionally, Category C consists of an Excel document that \"includes the phone numbers and email addresses for dozens of individuals, along with their company affiliation, including at least 56 Northwood agents,\" and those listed in the spreadsheet \"were participants in the June 15, 2015 golf tournament by Northwood.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 105-06.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    <strong>\n     5. Gemma's Resignation from Liberty Mutual\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Gemma resigned from his position with Liberty Mutual on April 7, 2016, one day \"after he emailed massive amounts of Liberty Mutual confidential, trade secret information to his personal Gmail account.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 110.) Subsequently, Liberty Mutual's area manager reviewed the Gemma Agreement with Gemma and \"remind[ed] him of its restrictions with respect to existing or prospective policyholders and affinity and marketing accounts, as well as its confidentiality and return of information provisions.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 111.) The area manager specifically stated that the restrictions \"would apply to Northwood relationships, and also stated that, if Gemma had kept any policyholder information, it must be returned.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n    (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) During this meeting, Gemma responded by stating that he did not have any policyholder information, and also referred\n    to \"relationships at Northwood [as] being 'fair game,' or words to that effect.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 113.) Lastly, after resigning from Liberty Mutual, Gemma remained involved with Northwood personnel by, for example, teaching insurance-related classes to Northwood personnel and \"with Defendants' assistance, [ ] actively prospecting Northwood personnel for business.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 115.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    <strong>\n     II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes a defendant to move to dismiss a complaint for \"failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). The legal standards governing pleading practice in federal court have shifted to a \"more heightened form of pleading, requiring a plaintiff to plead more than the possibility of relief to survive a motion to dismiss.\"\n    <em>\n     Fowler v.

Claims Against Gemma\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    <strong>\n     1. Breach of Contract (Count I)\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Liberty Mutual states that the basis for this claim is that the Gemma Agreement \"constitutes a binding and enforceable contract between Gemma and Liberty Mutual, which contains confidentiality provisions and reasonable restrictive covenants that are necessary to protect Liberty Mutual's legitimate business interests.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 118.) Liberty Mutual's breach of contract claim against Gemma is that Gemma's actions constituted a breach of certain portions of the Gemma Agreement. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) In support of his motion to dismiss, Gemma maintains that Liberty Mutual has failed to state a claim for breach of contract because (1) the complaint does not allege that the non-competition portion of the Gemma Agreement was supported by valuable consideration, and (2) the complaint does not state a breach of the non-competition portion of the Gemma Agreement because it fails to define certain terms within the scope of the Agreement. (Doc. No. 47 at 4-6.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    <strong>\n     a. Adequate Consideration\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    According to Gemma, because he was already an employee of Liberty Mutual when he signed the Gemma Agreement and was therefore an at will employee, there was no modification of the employment relationship that would amount to adequate consideration, and as a result, \"[t]he [c]omplaint is deficient in that there is no allegation that Gemma received new or valuable consideration to support the restrictive covenants in the [Gemma] Agreement[,] nor does the [c]omplaint identify such consideration.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 5.) In opposition, Liberty Mutual argues that the Gemma Agreement was supported by valuable consideration on the basis of Gemma's participation in the 2016 Comp Plan, as \"Gemma was expressly told that his participation in the 2016 Comp Plan was contingent on his execution of the Gemma Agreement,\" and he \"received bonus compensation per the terms of the 2016 Comp Plan.\" (Doc. No. 55 at 8-9.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has articulated the requirements for enforceable restrictive covenants as follows:\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n    Restrictive covenants are enforceable only if they are: (1) ancillary to an employment relationship between an employee and an employer, (2) supported by adequate consideration; (3) the restrictions are reasonably limited in duration and geographic extent; and (4) the restrictions are designed to protect the legitimate interests of the employer.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    <em>\n     Socko v.

In addition, Pennsylvania law mandates that:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n    [w]hen a non-competition clause is required after an employee has commenced his or her employment, it is enforceable only if the employee receives \"new\" and valuable consideration-that is, some corresponding benefit or a favorable change in employment\n    status.

Liberty Mutual maintains that Gemma signed the Gemma Agreement in 2016 \"in connection with, and as a condition to be eligible for\" the 2016 Comp Plan, which afforded him \"the opportunity to earn substantial bonus compensation beyond his base salary as well as bonus compensation beyond what he received in 2015.\" (Doc. No. 37 \u00b6 56.) The compensation-related benefits entailed by the 2016 Comp Plan fit within the various types of benefits, as described\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , which have been held to constitute new and valuable consideration for purposes of enforcing a restrictive covenant.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Socko\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280653,12280662,12280671\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/126/1266/\">\n     126 A.3d at 1275\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In addition, as Liberty Mutual notes in opposition to Gemma's motion (Doc. No. 55 at 8), the Third Circuit has held that participation in this type of plan constitutes adequate consideration in the context of a restrictive covenant.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     L.B. Foster Co. v. Barnhart\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=615%20Fed.%20Appx.%2063\">\n     615 Fed.Appx. 63\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 64 (3d Cir. 2015) (concluding that employee's participation in incentive plan was adequate consideration to support restrictive covenant because employer did not have legal obligation to offer incentive plan to employee and employee received benefit from plan in exchange for signing non-competition agreement). Therefore, the Gemma Agreement was supported by adequate consideration on the basis of Gemma's participation in the 2016 Comp Plan.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    <strong>\n     b. Sufficiency of Allegations in the Amended Complaint\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Gemma also argues that Liberty Mutual's amended complaint is insufficient to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion because it \"fails to state in what way Gemma violated the terms of the non-compete provision of the [Gemma Agreement].\" (Doc. No. 47 at 6.) Section 2(c) of the Gemma Agreement, which includes the non-competition provision at issue, states that regarding the marketing/affinity accounts held by Liberty Mutual, which included those related to Northwood, Gemma agreed not to:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n    contact, solicit or attempt to solicit the purchase of products or services of the type or kind offered by or through the Company, or the establishment of any group discount program with any affinity account, group savings plus account, marketing or networking account (including but not limited to mortgage companies, auto dealers, and real estate companies) for whom [he] served as the Company contact during the last twelve months of [his] employment with the Company.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    (Doc. No. 37 \u00b6 62) (citing Doc. No. 37-2).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    The Court concludes that the amended complaint sets forth sufficient factual allegations in support of Liberty Mutual's claim that Gemma breached the non-competition provision in the Gemma Agreement. As Liberty Mutual notes, the amended complaint alleges that Gemma engaged in extensive communication with Northwood about conducting business with Everest while he was employed by Liberty Mutual, and that these communications concerned accounts that were covered by the non-competition agreement. (Doc. Nos. 37 \u00b6\u00b6 31, 82-83, 115, 117-21, 55 at 10-11.) Accordingly, the Court finds that Liberty Mutual's amended complaint sets forth a valid claim for breach of contract, and Gemma's motion to dismiss (Doc. No. 46),\n    is denied as to Count I of Liberty Mutual's amended complaint.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    <strong>\n     2. Breach of Fiduciary Duty/Duty of Loyalty (Count II)\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Gemma argues that the amended complaint does not allege facts that would constitute any breach of a duty toward Liberty Mutual, and that even if the complaint alleged such facts, Gemma \"was permitted\" to engage in such conduct. (Doc. No. 47 at 7-8.) Gemma states that Liberty Mutual \"makes broad unsupported allegations but does not identify what confidential information was misappropriated by Gemma, what confidential information was disclosed by Gemma, or for what purposes it was used,\" and that any conduct by him with regard to Northwood or the Everest Defendants did not constitute a breach of fiduciary duty because Gemma was an at-will employee who only made \"preparations to compete\" upon the termination of his employment with Liberty Mutual. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 7-8) (citing\n    <em>\n     Synthes, Inc. v.

Pa. 2014) ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Conversely, Liberty Mutual asserts that Gemma's conduct prior to his termination in April of 2016 amounts to a breach of the fiduciary duty and duty of loyalty owed to Liberty Mutual, as his conduct contradicted notions of undivided loyalty toward his employer and avoiding conflicts of interest. (Doc. No. 55 at 12) (citing\n    <em>\n     Maritrans v. Pepper Hamilton &amp; Scheetz\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1831214\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/529/241/\">\n     529 Pa. 241\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1831214\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/529/241/\">\n     602 A.2d 1277\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1283 (1992) ). In addition, Liberty Mutual argues that Gemma's conduct constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty because courts have permitted such claims when employees are alleged to have used their \"employer's time or any trade secrets in making preparations to leave, or otherwise engage in conduct directly damaging [their] employer during the period of employment.

(Doc. No. 37 \u00b6\u00b6 66, 70-80.) Consequently, Liberty Mutual has alleged that prior to his resignation, Gemma acted in a way that undermined the interests of Liberty Mutual.

Additionally, \"[b]oth Gemma and Everest were acutely aware of Gemma's obligations to and covenants with Liberty Mutual,\" as demonstrated by Northwood's Executive Vice President providing Gemma with contact information for legal counsel to represent him in the instant litigation, which allegedly occurred \"because Everest was aware of the predecessor agreement to the Gemma Agreement\" and understood that Gemma would implicate his contractual obligations to Liberty Mutual by working with Everest. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 67.)

Under the standard described\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , the amended complaint adequately alleges that Gemma acquired possession of Liberty Mutual's property in a way that was adverse to Liberty Mutual's interests, transferred the property by sending it to himself when he \"was already a 25% owner of Everest Insurance,\" and withheld the property from Liberty Mutual, who did not intend for Gemma to send the documents to himself or use them to benefit Everest Insurance.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Prudential\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"214087\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/994/318/#p323\">\n     994 F.Supp. at 323\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    In addition, the Court rejects Gemma's argument that Liberty Mutual's conversion claim is preempted by the Pennsylvania Uniform Trade Secrets Act (\"PUTSA\").

No. 46) is denied as to Count IV of the amended complaint.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    The Court concludes that the amended complaint sets forth sufficient facts in support of a claim for conversion against the Everest Defendants. Liberty Mutual has alleged that the Everest Defendants used Liberty Mutual's proprietary information that it received via email from Gemma to compete against Liberty Mutual. (Doc.

In addition, the amended complaint avers that the Everest Defendants also acquired such information as a result of Gemma forwarding \"Liberty Mutual information, including underwriting information, to his personal email address\" prior to resigning from his position with Liberty Mutual and after his resignation,\n    \"forward[ing] the information to his Everest insurance email.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 80.)

No. 37 \u00b6 143.) Liberty Mutual also alleges that \"Defendants obtained [its] trade secrets by improper means and used them in breach of obligations to Liberty Mutual including, among other things, fiduciary duties and contractual obligations,\" and that in doing so, Defendants have engaged in misappropriation under PUTSA. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 146-47.) Both Gemma and the Everest Defendants argue that Liberty Mutual's PUTSA claim is insufficient because the amended complaint neither describes the alleged trade secrets involved with sufficient specificity (Doc. No. 47 at 11-2), nor \"explain[s] how an Everest Defendant obtained the trade secrets or used the trade secrets, which trade secrets were used, or when that use occurred\" (Doc. No. 50 at 10-11).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    A PUTSA violation consists of the following elements: \"(1) the existence of a trade secret; (2) communication of the trade secret pursuant to a confidential relationship; (3) use of the trade secret, in violation of that confidence; and (4) harm to the plaintiff.\"\n    <em>\n     Moore v.

Under this standard, the amended complaint is sufficient, as Liberty Mutual alleges that Gemma misappropriated various documents, including customer lists and other customer information, which have been held to constitute trade secrets.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Latuszewski\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%204462739\">\n     2007 WL 4462739\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *16-17 (concluding that \"customer information\" taken by employees \"qualifies as trade secrets\" and that \"[s]uch information includes customer lists, account balances, [and] account activity\"). In addition, the facts pled support the existence of a confidential relationship between Liberty Mutual and Gemma under which Gemma gained access to the documents. (Doc. No. 37 \u00b6\u00b6 49-52.) Further, the amended complaint states that Defendants used the trade secrets in such a way that violated that confidence, as Liberty Mutual avers that the Everest Defendants used the information from Gemma and acquired it via improper means. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 77-82, 90-108.) Lastly, Liberty Mutual has alleged that it was harmed by the misappropriation on the part of Defendants. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 115-16.) Such factual allegations are thus sufficient to satisfy the required elements for a PUTSA claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    In addition, while Defendants state that the amended complaint lacks the requisite specificity to survive a 12(b)(6) motion and does not identify the misappropriated trade secrets with \"reasonable particularity\" (Doc.

(Doc. No. 37 \u00b6\u00b6 93-106.)

Sept. 18, 2007) ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    The Court concludes that under the above standard, Liberty Mutual has pled sufficient facts to support a claim of unjust enrichment against all Defendants. Initially, the Court rejects Gemma's argument that Liberty Mutual is barred from asserting an unjust enrichment claim against him because it has also set forth a breach of contract claim, as dismissal of an unjust enrichment claim is improper in instances, such as the instant case, where the parties dispute the enforceability of the contractual provisions at issue.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Brown &amp; Brown, Inc. v.

Pa. 2010) (summarizing applicable case law and stating that \"[g]iven that the parties have not fully admitted that [the defendants] are subject to the terms of a valid enforceable [e]mployment [a]greement, it is premature at this juncture to dismiss the unjust enrichment claim\");\n    <em>\n     Alpart v.

Pa. 2008) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a) ) (\"Because the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure enable the plaintiffs to plead in the alternative, a claim for breach of contract and unjust enrichment can coexist at this early stage of litigation.\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    In addition, Liberty Mutual has adequately pled facts that establish a claim for unjust enrichment against Gemma, as the amended complaint alleges that Gemma received a benefit from Liberty Mutual in that he came into possession of several documents containing valuable policyholder information (Doc. No. 37 \u00b6\u00b6 45-54), Gemma appreciated the benefit of possessing such information by forwarding it to himself and others, allegedly for use in competing against Liberty Mutual (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 77-80, 90-104), and Gemma retained this information and its accompanying value in such a fashion that Liberty Mutual alleges is unjust (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 109-16). Accordingly, Gemma's motion to dismiss (Doc. No. 46), is denied as to Count VII of the amended complaint.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Further, the Court also concludes that Liberty Mutual's amended complaint sets forth a sufficient factual basis for an unjust enrichment claim against the Everest Defendants. The amended complaint asserts that, \"Liberty Mutual and Northwood enjoyed an affinity/group savings relationship and a marketing relationship for years,\" and that as a result of these relationships, \"Liberty Mutual offered, and Northwood accepted, substantial discounts off Liberty Mutual's insurance pricing for Northwood and its customers.\" (Doc. Nos. 54 at 18, Doc. No. 37 \u00b6\u00b6 30, 41.) The Court also agrees that, given Liberty Mutual's allegations as to the valuable nature of its policyholder information, Liberty Mutual has pled sufficient facts demonstrating that it would be \"inequitable for the Everest Defendants to retain [such] benefits.\" (Doc. No. 54 at 18.) The Everest Defendants' motion to dismiss (Doc. No. 49), is therefore denied as to Count VII of the amended complaint.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    <strong>\n     4. Tortious Interference (Count VIII)\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    In arguing that Liberty Mutual has failed to state a claim for tortious interference, Gemma maintains that the amended complaint is insufficient in that the complaint: \"fails to identity a single contractual relationship other than with [Liberty Mutual's] policyholders\"; Liberty Mutual's contract with Northwood ended in November of 2015; \"[t]here is no allegation that Gemma's actions were specifically designed to harm\" Liberty Mutual; no \"improper conduct\" on the part of Gemma has\n    been identified; the amended complaint does not specifically state a claim for damages; and Liberty Mutual \"fails to posit a theory as to why there is a reasonable likelihood that it would have been able to sell insurance to Northwood's future home-buying customers but for Gemma's interference.\" (Doc. No. 47 at 14-15.) Similarly, the Everest Defendants maintain that the amended complaint: lacks allegations that identify the specific contractual relationships with which they allegedly interfered; the facts alleged do not indicate that the Everest Defendants acted without privilege or justification; Liberty Mutual has not pled that any existing or prospective contractual relationships were harmed by the alleged interference; and the amended complaint does not provide sufficiently specific allegations regarding damages. (Doc. No. 50 at 13-15.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    In opposition, Liberty Mutual states that it has alleged relationships with which the Defendants tortuously interfered, pointing to its \"affinity/group savings and marketing contractual relationships\" and its \"contractual and economic relationships with existing and prospective Liberty Mutual policyholders.\" (Doc. Nos. 54 at 19, 55 at 22.) Further, it states that its amended complaint provides numerous allegations the Defendants intended to harm and harmed its contractual relationships while acting without privilege or justification (Doc. Nos. 54 at 23, 55 at 20), and that Liberty Mutual has alleged that it suffered harm as a result of such interference (Doc. Nos. 54 at 21, 55 at 24). Finally, it argues that the fifth element of a tortious interference claim applies only to its \"prospective relationships with prospective Liberty Mutual policyholders and, as to those relationships, the [amended] [c]omplaint sufficiently alleges that there was a reasonable likelihood that those relationships would have occurred but for Gemma's tortious interference.\" (Doc. No. 55 at 24.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    In Pennsylvania, a claim for tortious interference with existing or prospective contractual relationships consists of the following elements:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n    (1) the existence of a contractual or prospective contractual or economic relationship between the plaintiff and a third party; (2) purposeful action by the defendant, specifically intended to harm an existing relationship or intended to prevent a prospective relation from occurring; (3) the absence of privilege or justification on the part of the defendant; (4) legal damage to the plaintiff as a result of the defendant's conduct; and (5) for prospective contracts, a reasonable likelihood that the relationship would have occurred but for the defendant's interference.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    <em>\n     Acumed LLC v.

First, the Court agrees with Liberty Mutual that the amended complaint sufficiently alleges the relationships with which Defendants interfered, including its \"affinity/group savings and marketing contractual relationships\" involving Northwood, as well as its relationships with \"existing and prospective Liberty Mutual policyholders.\" (Doc. Nos. 55 at 22, 37 at \u00b6\u00b6 30, 42, 163-64, 82-89.) As to alleged interference with its current contractual relationships, the amended complaint states that \"[a]lthough one contractual aspect of the relationship between Liberty Mutual and Northwood ended in 2015, Gemma continued to be Liberty Mutual's lead contact person for Northwood.\" (Doc. No. 37 \u00b6 42.) Consequently, Liberty Mutual has put forth sufficient allegations\n    with respect to its actual contractual relations.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Advanced Fluid Sys., Inc. v. Huber\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4318260\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/28/306/#p336\">\n     28 F.Supp.3d 306\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 336 (M.D. Pa. 2014). Further, with regard to prospective contractual relations, the amended complaint alleges facts establishing Liberty Mutual's relationships with prospective customers. (Doc. No. 37 \u00b6\u00b6 45-47, 61, 108, 111.) Given Gemma's allegedly extensive involvement with developing Liberty Mutual's customer relationships, as set forth in the amended complaint, Liberty Mutual \"sufficiently alleges a reasonable expectation of realizing these prospective contracts.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Advanced Fluid Sys.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4318260\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/28/306/#p336\">\n     28 F.Supp.3d at 337\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    The amended complaint alleges sufficient facts to support the remaining elements of a claim for tortious interference as well. With respect to the second element-that the defendant acted purposefully and with a specific intent to harm the contractual relationships at issue and without privilege or justification-the amended complaint contains numerous allegations that all Defendants acted improperly through concerted action that was intended to favor a competing insurance agency at the expense of Liberty Mutual. (Doc. No. 37 \u00b6\u00b6 66, 73-74, 77-80, 82-89, 165-70.) Such allegations are sufficiently removed from \"socially acceptable\" standards in business relationships so as to satisfy this second element.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Empire Trucking Co., Inc. v. Reading Anthracite Coal Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7307317\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/71/923/#p936\">\n     71 A.3d 923\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 936 (Pa. Super. Ct. 2013) (affirming denial of request for judgment notwithstanding the verdict against defendant-appellant in action for breach of contract and tortious interference). In addition, as indicated\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , the amended complaint has sufficiently alleged the absence of privilege or justification on the part of Defendants, as Liberty Mutual avers that the Defendants worked with each other to benefit from Gemma's unauthorized transmittal of Liberty Mutual's proprietary customer information for the purpose of acting against Liberty Mutual's interest by forming a competing insurance company.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Advanced Fluid Sys.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4318260\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/28/306/#p336\">\n     28 F.Supp.3d at 338-39\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (denying in part motion to dismiss and acknowledging that defendants acted wrongly in that they \"foiled [the plaintiff's] chances at receiving certain contracts\"). Further, the amended complaint describes the ways in which Defendants' alleged conduct harmed Liberty Mutual by causing it to lose customers and referrals from Northwood (Doc. No. 37 \u00b6\u00b6 42, 116, 89, 171), as well as facts that demonstrate a reasonable likelihood that Liberty Mutual would have had certain prospective contractual relationships with policyholders, were it not for the Defendants' actions.\n    <footnotemark>\n     17\n    </footnotemark>\n    Because the Court concludes that Liberty Mutual has alleged sufficient facts to state a claim for tortious interference as to all Defendants, both motions to dismiss (Doc.
