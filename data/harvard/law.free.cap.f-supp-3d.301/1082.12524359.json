(Doc. 36). In lockstep with his prosecution of this case, Defendant/Counterclaim Plaintiff Calvin D. Wells, Jr., (\"Wells\") tendered an untimely and brief argument and a request for an extension of time to respond more fully to the summary judgment motion, followed by even more sparse filings that the undersigned will discuss. (Doc. 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Based upon the following discussion, the court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   National Fire's Motion to Strike,\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Wells's request for more time to respond to National Fire's Motion for Summary Judgment,\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   National Fire's request for the court to strike Wells's untimely response to National Fire's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. 29), and\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   National Fire's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The undersigned sets forth the following facts for the summary judgment determination, drawn from the evidence taken in the light most favorable to Wells.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant/Counterclaim Plaintiff Calvin D. Wells, Jr. d/b/a Wells Poultry Farm (\"Wells\") owns and operates eleven (11) poultry houses in Cullman County, Alabama. Wells purchased the houses from his father, C.D. Wells, in 2007. On or about July 6, 2014, Wells purchased a Commercial Lines Policy of Insurance (\"Policy\") from Plaintiff/Counterclaim Defendant National Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Company (\"National Fire\"). Defendant timely paid premiums on the Policy, and the Policy remained in effect until July 6, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On or about March 3, 2015, Wells filed a claim with National Fire alleging that ice and snow from a February 25, 2015, snowstorm damaged his poultry houses. Wells stated that the storm's effects caused the buildings to lean, which purportedly constituted a covered casualty loss under his Policy with National Fire. Upon receiving Wells's claim, National Fire retained Rimkus Consulting Group, Inc. (\"Rimkus\") to inspect Wells's poultry houses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 12, 2015, engineer Kyle E. Parker, P.E. performed the inspection on\n   Wells's property. During his inspection, Parker also interviewed Wells, reviewed County Property Appraiser records, reviewed applicable portions of the 1999 Accepted Practices for Post-Frame Building Construction, reviewed historical weather data from the National Weather Service and Weather Underground at their respective websites, and reviewed aerial photographs of the poultry houses dated March 5, 1997.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 26, 2015, Parker issued his findings in a report for National Fire. (Doc. 21-4). His report concluded that: (1) the poultry houses leaned up to approximately 1.75 inches in 4 feet; (2) there existed no evidence that the leaning condition of the chicken houses occurred recently; (3) he did not determine the degree that the weight of snow and ice accumulation on February 26, 2015, exacerbated the pre-existing leaning condition of the chicken houses; (4) no evidence indicated that wind forces on February 26, 2015, caused or contributed to the leaning condition of the chicken houses; (5) the lack of a foundation and inadequate anchoring of the posts into the ground contributed to the lean; and (6) there existed prior, wind-related lifting of purlins from the roof trusses along the eaves of the poultry houses. (Doc. 21-4 at 14). The Policy specifically excludes damage caused by or resulting from \"earth shifting including soil conditions which cause settlings, cracking or other disarrangement of foundations or other parts of reality.\" (Doc. 21-6 at 3). The Policy also excluded damage caused by or resulting from wear and tear, deterioration, decay or hidden or latent defect or any quality in property that causes it to damage or destroy itself. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Utilizing Mr. Parker's report, along with its own investigative findings, National Fire denied Wells's claim on May 1, 2015. (Doc. 1-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As additional bases for the denial, National Fire determined that the poultry houses were constructed as of March 5, 1997, as verified by a satellite photo from the U.S. Geological Survey. National Fire informed Wells that its policy excludes loss or damage caused by, or resulting from, the weight of snow, ice, or sleet for buildings whose age exceeds fifteen (15) years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After Wells requested a review of the decision, National Fire reopened the investigation on July 15, 2015. On July 22, 2015, Parker revisited Wells's property to inspect the poultry houses. Parker utilized the same resources when inspecting the property, and he reached the same conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Pursuant to the Policy's terms and conditions, National Fire conducted an examination under oath of Wells on October 14, 2015. During the examination, Wells clarified that his claim only involved five of the poultry houses (\"5B houses\") and provided documentation of the deed to the houses, the property taxes he filed on the houses, and an estimate from Addison Agri Builders regarding the replacement costs of the houses. National Fire requested in the notice scheduling the examination provision of any documents regarding the original construction of the poultry houses, as well as any repairs, remodeling, additions, or changes to any of the poultry houses, yet Wells failed to provide any documentation. In addition, Wells contested Parker's analysis regarding the installation of the posts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On March 18, 2016, National Fire filed a complaint for declaratory judgment against Wells, requesting that the court find no coverage exists for Wells's claims under the insurance policy. (Doc. 1). On April 14, 2016, Wells filed an Answer and a Counterclaim, alleging that National Fire wrongfully denied his claims, and thus, breached the insurance contract. (Doc. 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After the parties convened a Rule 26(f) Planning Meeting, they released a report to the court on May 31, 2016. (Doc. 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The court issued a Rule 16 Scheduling Order on June 8, 2016. (Doc. 12). The scheduling order contained crucial deadlines that the parties stipulated, including:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 Unless modified by stipulation of the parties, disclosure of expert witnesses-including a complete report under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(a)(2)(B) from any expert-are due: (1) from plaintiff by\n   <strong>\n    February 28, 2017\n   </strong>\n   , and made available for deposition by\n   <strong>\n    April 14, 2017\n   </strong>\n   ; (2) from defendant by\n   <strong>\n    December 15, 2016,\n   </strong>\n   and made available for deposition by\n   <strong>\n    January 30, 2017\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 Unless modified by court order for good cause shown, all discovery must be commenced in time to be completed by\n   <strong>\n    May 31, 2017.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 All potentially dispositive motions must be filed by\n   <strong>\n    June 30, 2017.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 Unless modified by stipulation of the parties, responses to Requests for Production and Requests for Admission are due\n   <strong>\n    30 days after service.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 Unless modified by court order for good cause shown, supplementation of disclosures and discovery under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(e) are due within\n   <strong>\n    30 days of party having obtained knowledge of the discoverable information,\n   </strong>\n   but not later than 30 days prior to close of discovery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (emphasis added). Furthermore, the parties agreed to exchange initial disclosures, as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(1)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   , by June 30, 2016, and in its efforts to prosecute its claims and defenses, National Fire served Requests for Production of Documents on October 31, 2016. (Doc. 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Importantly, National Fire served Requests for Admission on April 28, 2017. (Doc. 16). The discovery consisted of the following requests:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   1. Admit that damage, if any, to any of the 5B poultry houses was not caused by direct physical loss or damage occurring during the National Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Company policy period of July 6, 2014 through July 6, 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   2. Admit that to the extent there is any damage to any of the 5B poultry houses, said damage is a result of wear and tear, deterioration, settling, cracking, shrinking, lack of a proper foundation or inadequate anchoring.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   3. Admit that all of the 5B poultry houses were built prior to March 5, 1997.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   4. Admit that Calvin Wells has no evidence any of the 5B poultry houses were built after March 5, 1997.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   5. Admit that there was snow in the area of the 5B poultry houses on February 25, 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   6. Admit that Calvin Wells has no evidence to rebut the fact that all of the 5B poultry houses were in existence and referenced in the property appraisal performed by Ray Brannum on November 3, 2000, referenced in the Initial Disclosures served by National Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Company in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   7. Admit that the 5B poultry houses are still in use as of the date of service of this document upon Calvin Wells's attorney.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On June 30, 2017, National Fire filed its Motion for Summary Judgment. In its motion, National Fire stated that Wells had not (1) filed initial disclosures, (2) produced responses to its Requests for Production, (3) disclosed expert witnesses, and (4) objected and/or responded to the Requests for Admission. On August 4, 2017, National Fire filed a reply, arguing the court should grant its summary judgment motion because Wells failed to file a response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On August 7, 2017, Wells filed an untimely response to National Fire's summary judgment motion, stating that Wells's counsel had only \"in the last days\" received the motion, and, counsel did not see the motion on his computer. (Doc. 26). In addition to a \"request\" to more fully respond to the motion, Wells submitted: (1) the transcript and additional exhibits from the examination under oath that National Fire took of Wells (National Fire already submitted most of the material as \"Exhibit A\" to its summary judgment motion); and (2) a depreciation detail listing of CD Wells's 2003 tax return. In his response, Wells further alleges that aerial photographs and his testimony reveal that the poultry houses were rebuilt in approximately 2002, as the depreciation detail allegedly portrays an update and equipment expenses for 2003. Wells also argues that he installed cement around the posts in his poultry houses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On August 9, 2017, National Fire filed a reply in opposition to Wells's response. (Doc. 29). In its reply, National Fire argues that Wells failed to altogether provide any initial disclosures. In addition, Wells never provided C.D. Wells's 2003 depreciation record during his examination under oath, in initial disclosures, or in responses to the Requests for Production.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Furthermore, National Fire highlights that Wells failed to meet all discovery deadlines set forth in the parties' Rule 16 Scheduling Order. At the time National Fire filed this reply, Wells had provided no expert report, no written discovery, no requests for depositions, no responses to National Fire's Requests for Production, and no responses to National Fire's Requests for Admissions. National Fire concluded that the court should deny Wells's \"request\" for an extension of time to respond to the summary judgment motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On October 2, 2017, Wells filed responses to National Fire's April 28, 2017, Requests for Admission. (Doc. 30). In his responses, Wells stated a general objection to the Requests for Admission on the grounds that the requests were \"vague, ambiguous, overly broad, unduly burdensome or oppressive\" and that they were not sufficiently descriptive so as to allow Wells the opportunity to lodge a meaningful response. Furthermore, Wells included this additional paragraph in his response:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   1-7. Wells objects to these requests in that they are not sufficiently descriptive so as to allow Wells to make a meaningful response. Without waiving said objection, Wells denies paragraphs 1 through 7, that is all of the Request for Admissions. Wells has testified and\n   states that the poultry houses were rebuilt after 1997 and even logic would state that the houses did not deteriorate at the same time and lean in the same direction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On October 20, 2017, Wells filed a supplemental response to National Fire's motion for summary judgment. (Doc. 31). The response consisted of an affidavit from Barry Willingham, the Revenue Commissioner for Cullman County, and an affidavit from Faye Cobbs, a purported IRS Enrolled Agent who also served as C.D. Wells's tax preparer. (Docs. 32-1 and 32-2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On November 1, 2017, National Fire filed a Motion to Strike Wells's untimely responses to the Requests for Admission and his untimely filed supplemental response with affidavits. (Doc. 36). On November 2, 2017, the court issued a briefing schedule for National Fire's Motion to Strike, ordering Wells to file a response within fourteen days and National Fire to file any reply within seven days thereafter. (Doc. 36). Wells never filed a response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    A. National Fire's Motion to Strike\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Before adjudicating the Motion for Summary Judgment, the court addresses National Fire's Motion to Strike to determine whether Wells may rely upon specific evidence presented in his filings opposing summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Specifically, National Fire argues that the court should strike (1) Wells's untimely responses to Plaintiff's Requests for Admission and (2) Wells's untimely filed supplemental response with affidavits. Based upon the following discussion, the court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   National Fire's motion on both grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The Court Deems National Fire's Requests for Admission as Admissions by Wells Dues to Wells Failure to Timely Respond to Them.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 36(a) enables any party to \"serve on any other party a written request to admit, for purposes of the pending action only, the truth of any matters within the scope of Rule 26(b)(1) relating to: (A) facts, the application of law to fact, or opinions about either; and (B) the genuineness of any described documents.\" The Rule automatically deems unanswered or belatedly-answered responses to Rule 36 requests as admissions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   A matter [of which an admission is requested] is admitted unless, within 30 days after being served, the party to whom the request is directed serves on the requesting party a written answer or objection addressed to the matter and signed by the party or its attorney. A shorter or longer time for responding may be stipulated to under Rule 29 or be ordered by the court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(a)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Courts in this circuit routinely treat unanswered or belatedly-answered requests as legally-conclusive admissions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Garmley v. Cochran,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=651%20Fed.%20Appx.%20933\">\n    651 Fed.Appx. 933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 936 (11th Cir. 2016) (citing\n   <em>\n    Perez v. Miami-Dade Cnty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11453504\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/297/1255/#p1263\">\n    297 F.3d 1255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1263 (11th Cir. 2002) ). Because Wells failed to respond to National Fire's requests for admission within 30 days (indeed, more than five months after service of the requests), and did so without permission from the court or stipulations by National Fire, Rule 36(a)(3) automatically deems National Fire's requests as admissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Rule 36(b) provides that \"[a] matter admitted under this rule is conclusively established unless the court, on motion, permits the admission to be withdrawn or amended.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(b). The court\n   allows withdrawal or amendment \"if it would promote the presentation of the merits of the action and if the court is not persuaded that it would prejudice the requesting party in maintaining or defending the action on the merits.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

Here, Wells filed no motion to withdraw or to amend his automatically deemed admissions, but instead filed his responses months after the deadline set in the parties' Scheduling Order. Furthermore, Wells has not addressed the issue in any of his responses and even failed to respond, pursuant to the court's order, to National Fire's Motion to Strike. As Rule 36(b) expressly provides for withdrawal only \"on motion,\" the court cannot\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   withdraw Wells's admissions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jacobs v.

Significantly, Wells served his responses after the end of the discovery period on May 31, 2017, and after National Fire filed a motion for summary judgment on June 30, 2017, utilizing Wells's deemed admissions. Not only did Wells fail to file any type of motion to withdraw these deemed admissions, but he also has offered no defense, reason, or excuse for the late submission of his responses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Wells's conduct has also caused uncertainty and delay for National Fire. In his examination under oath, Wells refused to answer certain questions pertaining to the matters at issue in this case. He served no initial disclosures or responses to National Fire's Request for Production of Documents, essentially prejudicing National Fire as to disclosure of Wells's witnesses and potential trial exhibits. Over five months after its due date, Wells simply files his responses to National Fire's Requests for Admission with no explanation for the untimeliness and delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Applying the reasoning that the Middle District of Alabama elaborated in\n   <em>\n    ADM Agri-Industries v. Harvey\n   </em>\n   , \"had [Wells provided] any plausible explanation for his past discovery noncompliance and any reason to think that his uncooperativeness has now come to an end, the court might be more inclined to find that [National Fire] has not carried its burden to show prejudice from the withdrawal or amendment of the admissions.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1273719\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/200/467/#p471\">\n    200 F.R.D. at 472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However,\n   because Wells never gave the court a viable explanation for his past discovery noncompliance, and because Wells failed to respond to a court order that directed him to respond to National Fire's Motion to Strike, the court sees no reason to grant Wells the benefit of the doubt regarding his late discovery response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   National Fire would suffer undue prejudice without the admissions; without their deterrent value, National Fire would have to inefficiently retrace its steps and re-litigate its summary judgment argument. Therefore, the court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   National Fire's Motion to Strike regarding Wells's untimely responses to National Fire's Request for Admissions and\n   <strong>\n    STRIKES\n   </strong>\n   Wells's responses from the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Wells's Untimely Filing of Barry Willingham and Faye Cobbs's Affidavits was not Substantially Justified or Harmless.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   As discussed previously, Rule 26(a)'s mandatory, initial disclosures provision requires parties to disclose the witnesses and documents they intend to use at trial in support of their contentions. If a party fails to discharge its discovery obligations, it may not \"use [undisclosed] information or witness[es] to supply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at trial, unless the failure was\n   <strong>\n    substantially justified or is harmless\n   </strong>\n   .\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c) (emphasis added). The court considers four factors under Rule 37(c) to determine whether failure to disclose evidence is harmless or justified: \"(1) the unfair prejudice or surprise of the opposing party; (2) the opposing party's ability to cure the surprise; (3) the likelihood and extent of disruption to the trial; and (4) the offering party's explanation for its failure to timely disclose the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    King v.

As the non-disclosing party, Wells must establish that his failure to disclose both Willingham and Cobbs's affidavits was substantially justified or harmless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Edwards v.

Ala. 2013). In this case, Wells fails his burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Wells has not complied with Rule 26(a)'s requirement for mandatory, initial disclosures, and he failed to provide responses to National Fire's document requests. Similar to the filing of his responses to National Fire's Requests for Admission, Wells provided no explanation for his tardiness in submitting the Willingham and Cobb affidavits months after the discovery deadline expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Furthermore, this court cannot classify Wells's failure to timely file these affidavits as harmless. Cobbs's affidavit purportedly contained important information regarding Wells's father's tax filings for the eleven poultry houses. Willingham's affidavit purportedly contained relevant opinion evidence regarding the overhead photos of Wells's poultry houses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Had National Fire known about this information in a timely manner, it would have possessed the opportunity to depose both individuals. Both affidavits are dated October 17, 2017, well after the deadline for discovery and nearly four months after National Fire filed its motion for summary judgment without any knowledge of Willingham or Cobbs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   National Fire properly filed a motion to strike these affidavits, and Wells chose to not respond to National Fire's motion. Wells offers no substantial justification for his untimely filings, and this court finds none in the record. Accordingly, the court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   National Fire's Motion to Strike\n   the affidavits of Barry Willingham and Faye Cobbs and\n   <strong>\n    STRIKES\n   </strong>\n   the affidavits and accompanying exhibits from the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Court Grants National's Fire's Motion to Strike Wells's Summary Judgment Response\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The court must also determine whether it should grant Wells's \"request\" to permit an untimely response to the summary judgment motion (Doc. 26), or deny Wells's \"request\" by granting National Fire's motion to strike Wells's late response (Doc. 29). As an initial matter, the court notes that Wells not only filed an initial untimely response containing its \"request\" (Doc. 26), it did not await any adjudication by the court as to the \"request\" and filed another response containing the affidavits the court struck in the previous section (Doc. 31). Therefore, the court discerns the parties' entreaties as whether it should permit or strike Wells's responses, even though the later response constitutes a nullity because the court struck the affidavits at its heart. In any event, the court cannot excuse Wells's abject failure to prosecute this action, and thus, strikes its summary judgment responses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(b) governs extensions of time in which to file motions and responsive documents. Under Rule 6(b)(1)(B), when an act is required or allowed to be done within a specific time period, the Court \"may, for good cause, extend the time ... on motion made after the time has expired if the party failed to act because of excusable neglect.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(b)(1)(B) ;\n   <em>\n    Fisher v.

For example, in\n   <em>\n    Revere v.

The district court denied Revere's Rule 60(b)(1) motion for relief from judgment, and Revere appealed. On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion. Citing\n   <em>\n    Solaroll Shade and Shutter Corp. v.

The circumstances in this case tilt the merits against Wells. National Fire heavily relied on Wells's deemed admissions in its summary judgment motion. It submitted this motion fifteen months after filing the complaint and a year after the court released the Rule 16 Scheduling Order. At the time of the filing, Wells had provided no disclosures or responses required by the Scheduling Order and procedural rules. National Fire would suffer unfair prejudice if the court sustains Wells's responses to the summary judgment motion, although the court notes again the sparse, probative value of the responses. Notwithstanding the lack of probative value, the risk of prejudice for National Fire weighs in its favor on this factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   As for the second factor regarding the delay's duration and its potential impact on efficient judicial administration, if Wells had timely opposed National Fire's Motion for Summary Judgment on June 30, 2017, he would have completed that filing on or before July 21, 2017. Instead, Wells filed his response on August 7, 2017, three days after National Fire timely filed a reply indicating that Wells had not filed a response and missed the deadline. Although this lapse in time between the due date of Wells's opposition to National Fire's motion for summary judgment and the filing date of Wells's truncated response only spans two weeks, Wells merely asked for the court to grant \"an extension of time to more fully respond to the Motion for Summary Judgment.\" (Doc. 26 at 1). This lack of proactive conduct on the part of Wells and continued delay tilts the second factor in favor of denying Wells's \"request.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Most importantly, the reason for the delay and lack of good faith weigh heavily against Wells. The reason for delay remains critical to the inquiry regarding whether an attorney's failures constitute excusable neglect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Travelers Cas. and Sur.

(Doc. 26 at 1). He presents no evidence substantiating these reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Further, Wells missed every single discovery deadline at the time National Fire filed its Motion for Summary Judgment. Combined with the fact Wells later submitted affidavits from two witnesses three months after the deadline for his response, these actions demonstrate a lack of good faith. This is not a case where an \"innocent oversight\" or \"slight mistake\" caused the failure to respond.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cheney v.

Therefore, the court must enforce the exclusion as written, and exclude coverage if National Fire demonstrates that there is no genuine issue of material fact that its policy exclusions cover any alleged damage to Wells's 5B houses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   National Fire successfully meets this burden. National Fire refers to Parker's report, where he concludes that the \"lack of a proper foundation, inadequate anchoring, and age-related factors would be a cause of any leaning condition of the poultry houses.\" (Doc. 21-4 at 5). These findings comport with the court's reading of this exclusion, as these faults correspond to \"wear and tear\" of the structures and \"faulty or inadequate construction.\" Wells's sole rejoinder to the policy-exclusion manifests as an assertion there existed cement around the posts of his 5B houses, a finding contrary to Parker's report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   In any event, National Fire's second Request for Admission conclusively established that the exclusion bars Wells's claim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   2.

In particular, this endorsement explicitly provides no coverage for loss or damage caused by weight of snow, ice, or sleet for animal confinement buildings that are aged more than fifteen (15) years. (Doc. 13 at 79). In Parker's report and in National Fire's denial letter to Wells, National Fire states that the aerial photos they reviewed from March 5, 1997, shows that the 5B houses existed on that particular date.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even if the court reviewed the affidavits from Willingham and Cobbs on their merits, they raise no genuine issue of material fact.
