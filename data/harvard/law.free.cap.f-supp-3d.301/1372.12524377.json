I &amp; D Mem. cmt. 1. Three specific reasons gave rise to the FA conclusion: Plaintiffs 1) withheld the Export Service Agreements, 2) organized their business arrangement in such a manner so as to impede the investigation, and 3) provided inconsistent information.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2051%2C548\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Withholding the Export Service Agreements and not revealing the business arrangement were particularly relevant because, in Commerce's view, those details \"could have an effect on U.S. prices\" and the information that was provided was \"artificially constructed and [did] not provide a reliable basis upon which to calculate a dumping rate.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2051%2C548\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Additionally, Commerce determined that,\n   at a minimum, \"submit[ting] misleading information\" and continuing to be \"not forthcoming with key aspects\" of the business relationship both were indicators that Plaintiffs had not acted to the best of their abilities, thus justifying the imposition of AFA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2051%2C548\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Ultimately, even though Plaintiffs were otherwise entitled to a separate rate,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2051%2C548\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   cmt. 3, Commerce imposed the China-wide rate of 154.07% to Plaintiffs, \"the highest dumping margin alleged in the petition,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2051%2C548\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , as a result of the Department's AFA determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final Results at 11,429 -30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201581\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) and will sustain Commerce's determinations unless they are \"unsupported by substantial evidence on the record, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1516a(b)(1)(B)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In enacting 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e, Congress set out a two-step process with which Commerce must comply if it is to invoke AFA. First, the Department must identify a justification for the application of FA and, only then, if there is a determination that a party has not acted to \"the best of its ability,\" may Commerce apply AFA. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b)(1). Here, Commerce permissibly imposed an AFA rate of 154.07% and, as such, the Department's Final Results are sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    a. Adverse Facts Available\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Commerce has the ability to \"use [ ] facts otherwise available\" when a party to a proceeding: A) withholds information requested by the Department, B) fails to provide requested information by a specified deadline or in a specified form, C) \"significantly impedes a proceeding,\" or D) provides information that cannot be verified.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a)(2). This statute provides Commerce with the ability to fill in \"informational gaps\" with FA when those gaps arise out of one of the four circumstances described in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a)(2).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    \u00d6zdemir Boru San. ve Tic.

Cir. 2003) ). Only once one of these conditions has been met and the Department has deemed FA appropriate may Commence evaluate whether or not to impose AFA. If the Department determines that \"an interested party has failed to cooperate by not acting to the best of its ability to comply with a request for information,\" Commerce may:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [U]se an inference that is adverse to the interests of that party in selecting from among the facts otherwise available; and [ ] is not required to determine, or make any adjustments to, a countervailable subsidy rate or weighted average dumping margin based on any assumptions about information the interested party would have provided if the interested party had complied with the request for information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b)(1).

I &amp; D Mem. cmt. 1. Then, because Commerce also determined that Plaintiffs had failed to act to the best of their ability to produce the Export Service Agreements, Commerce imposed an AFA rate of 154.07%. Final Results at 11,429.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Substantial evidence supports Commerce's conclusion that Plaintiffs withheld requested information under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a)(2)(A). \"The mere failure of a respondent to furnish requested information-for any reason-requires Commerce to resort to other sources of information to complete the factual record....\"\n   <em>\n    Nippon Steel Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9109445\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/337/1373/#p1381\">\n    337 F.3d at 1381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As an initial matter, the Export Service Agreements were clearly requested. As the Export Service Agreements laid out an \"agreement for sales in the United States,\" the documents should have been produced in response to Commerce's original questionnaire.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Next, the information contained within the Export Service Agreements was withheld. Although Plaintiffs generally described their arrangement, Commerce requested-but was not furnished with-documentation regarding that arrangement. Commerce found that, \"[c]ontrary to Deosen's claims, the [Export Service Agreements] [did] not merely confirm the explanations of the relationship given in the questionnaire response but provide[d] the Department with specific details regarding the arrangement between AHA and Deosen which clearly show just how limited AHA's role was in the sales that Deosen reported as AHA's.\" I &amp; D Mem. cmt. 1. As there were discrepancies between the previous representations and the details found within the Export Service Agreements, Commerce's finding that Plaintiffs withheld requested information under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a)(2)(A) is supported by substantial evidence. Once it became clear that those sales agreements had been withheld, Commerce was entitled to apply FA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Commerce's second justification for applying FA, impeding an investigation under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a)(2)(C), is likewise supported by substantial evidence. Commerce's application of FA under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a)(2)(A) serves as a distinct ground for applying FA so as to make this separate finding, to an extent, moot. In any event, as this court has previously stated, the parties' arranging a principal-agent relationship for the purposes of obtaining a lower rate may act as an impediment to a proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tianjin Machinery Import &amp; Export Corp. v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20CIT%201416\">\n    31 CIT 1416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1422-24,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%202701368\">\n    2007 WL 2701368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5-6 (2007). As in\n   <em>\n    Tianjin\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs only fully revealed their agency scheme designed to obtain the lower cash deposit rate after the fact. Whereas Plaintiffs at one point described \"Deosen's U.S. sales of subject merchandise [as] AHA's sales,\" the Export Service Agreements revealed \"that these were actually sales made and controlled by Deosen.\" I &amp; D Mem. cmt. 1. As a result, substantial evidence supports Commerce's determination that Plaintiffs impeded the Department's investigation by concealing the true nature\n   of Plaintiffs' relationship with one another. Plaintiffs' arguments to the contrary are unavailing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The court now turns to Commerce's imposition of AFA and whether the Department's determination that Plaintiffs had \"failed to cooperate by not acting to the best of [their] ability to comply with a request for information,\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(b)(1), was in accordance with law. \"Compliance with the 'best of its ability' standard is determined by assessing whether respondent has put forth its maximum effort to provide Commerce with full and complete answers to all inquiries in an investigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Nippon Steel Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9109445\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/337/1373/#p1381\">\n    337 F.3d at 1382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Commerce asked for sales agreements four times across two administrative reviews; each time, Plaintiffs withheld key responsive documents.
