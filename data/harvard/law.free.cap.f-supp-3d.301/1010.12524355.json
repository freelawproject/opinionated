The Court held a hearing on January 26, 2017. The primary issues are: (i) whether the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, Pub. L. No. 91-190,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Stat.%20852\">\n    83 Stat. 852\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [ ] (\"NEPA\") requires the Defendant United States Forest Service (\"the Forest Service\") to consider the social and economic impacts of a proposed action-reducing grazing permits for the Alamosa and Jarita Mesa Grazing Allotments-before deciding to take it; and (ii) whether Defendant Diana Trujillo, former El Rito District Ranger,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   decided to reduce grazing permits for the Alamosa and Jarita Mesa Grazing Districts before considering the Environmental Assessment for Jarita Mesa and Alamosa Grazing Allotments (dated September, 2010)(AR 011351-487)(\"EA\"). The Court concludes that NEPA requires agencies to consider the environmental impacts of agency action, which may-depending on a particular case's circumstances-extend to secondary social and economic effects that flow from an action's impact on the physical environment. NEPA does not, however, require agencies to consider social and economic impacts that flow directly from an action and not from the action's effect on the physical environment. Because the Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants failed to consider an agency action's direct social and economic impacts, the Court concludes that the Plaintiffs' allegations do not amount to a NEPA violation. After examining the Administrative Record (\"AR\"), the Court also concludes that Trujillo did not violate NEPA by deciding to take a particular agency action before considering the EA's findings. Accordingly, the Court will affirm the administrative appeal's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The historical background surrounding this case predates both the parties before the Court and the Court itself.

The Plaintiffs are the heirs to a \"Hispano ranching tradition\" that dates back to the colonization of New Mexico by the Spanish in 1598, Carol Raish &amp; Alice M. McSweeney, United States Department of Agriculture,\n   <em>\n    Economic, Social, and Cultural Aspects of Livestock Ranching on the Espa\u00f1ola and Canjilon Ranger Districts of the Santa Fe and Carson National Forests: A Pilot Study\n   </em>\n   3 (RMRS-GTR-133, 2003),\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   http://doi.org/10.2737/RMRS-GTR-113. The Spanish colonists brought their domesticated plants and animals-including cattle, horses, sheep, and goats-with them and introduced intensive irrigation agriculture, whereas indigenous farming practices relied on \"extensive floodwater farming and soil retention techniques.\" Raish &amp; McSweeney at 3. The Spanish were forced out of northern New Mexico by the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, but Don Diego de Vargas reconquered the area twelve years later.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Raish &amp; McSweeney at 3-4. After the reconquest, the new generation of Spanish colonists \"generally worked their own land and maintained relatively cordial relations with the Pueblo Indian groups as both used the land in similar ways.\" Raish &amp; McSweeney at 4. The modern-day Hispanic villagers and farmers of northern New Mexico are descended from those farmers and ranchers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Raish &amp; McSweeney at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Spanish Crown-between 1598 and 1821-and then the Mexican government-between 1821 and 1848-confirmed the settlers' use and ownership of the land by issuing land grants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Raish &amp; McSweeney at 4. One particular kind of land grant, the community grant, generated a land-ownership that persists even today.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Raish &amp; McSweeney at 4. Community grants gave individual settlers ownership over a building site-for a homestead-as well as a small-five to ten acres-plot of land for farming.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Raish &amp; McSweeney at 4. The lion's share of the land bestowed by a community grant, however, belonged not to any individual settler but, instead, to the settlers as a group, which permitted individuals to \"use[ ] the village grazing lands, timberlands, and community pastures as common lands.\" Raish &amp; McSweeney at 4. That allocation\n   of land supported a small population of subsistence farmers and their animals for centuries with only scattered areas of land overuse near villages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Raish &amp; McSweeney at 4. Commercial sheep production increased while Mexico controlled the area, which in turn increased the amount of land overuse, but\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [t]hroughout the 1800s, local Hispanic and Pueblo residents of the nearby valleys used the plateau as common property, bringing their small herds to the plateau for summer grazing. They also harvested from the abundant timber resources for personal use and small-scale business ventures and planted some summer crops. The small size and noncommercial nature of these operations ensured that sufficient grass and forest resources remained for all who needed them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Raish &amp; McSweeney at 4. \"By the time of the United States occupation of New Mexico, over sixty such community grants were in existence.\" Christine A.

The devil was, of course, in the details, because the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo did not provide a mechanism for the residents of New Mexico to prove and assert their property rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Congress acted to provide such a mechanism when, in 1854, it established the office of Surveyor-General for New Mexico.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Act of July 22, 1854, ch. 103, \u00a7 1,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20Stat.%20308\">\n    10 Stat. 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Surveyor-General was charged with \"ascertain[ing] the origin, nature, character, and extent of all claims to lands under the laws, usages, and customs of Spain and Mexico,\" as well as with \"mak[ing] a full report on all such claims as originated before the cession of the territory to the United States by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ... with his decision as to the validity or invalidity of the same.\" Act of July 22, 1854 \u00a7 8, 10 Stat. at 309.

L. Rev. at 225. \"The time and finances of the surveyor general, for instance, were vastly inadequate,\" and \"congressional action upon the surveyor general's recommendations was notoriously slow.\" Klein, 26 N.M. L. Rev. at 225. Congress was hesitant to act on the Surveyor-General's recommendations,\n   because those recommendations raised complex legal issues and dealt with large amounts of land; moreover, there was \"a pervasive feeling that many unsettled land claims were fraudulent.\" Klein, 26 N.M. L. Rev. at 225 n.186.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   To address the problems associated with the Surveyor-General system, Congress established the Court of Private Land Claims in 1891.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Act of March 8, 1891, ch. 539,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20Stat.%20854\">\n    26 Stat. 854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"1891 Act\"). Those who claimed-under a Spanish or Mexican grant-land within the New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah territories, or within the States of Nevada, Colorado, and Wyoming, needed to petition the Court of Private Land Claims to confirm their claim unless their title \"was already complete and perfect.\" 1891 Act \u00a7 6, 26 Stat. at 856. If a claimant did not petition the Court of Private Land Claims as \u00a7 6 required within \"two years from the taking effect of this act [of March 8, 1891],\" then their claim was \"deemed and taken, in all courts and elsewhere to be abandoned and shall be forever barred.\" 1891 Act \u00a7 12, 26 Stat. at 859. Claimants whose title \"derived from the Spanish or Mexican Government,\" and was \"already complete and perfect\" when Mexico ceded its territory to the United States were permitted but not required to petition the Court of Private Land Claims to confirm their claim. 1891 Act \u00a7 8, 26 Stat. at 857.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Klein, 26 N.M.

Opening Brief at 59. The Plaintiffs argue that the Defendants were obliged to consider the Plaintiffs' social and historical context when determining the amount of grazing to permit on the Alamosa and Jarita Mesa Allotments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opening Brief at 44. The Plaintiffs observe that \"their families and communities are typical of the small, poor land-based communities in northern New Mexico who historically had rights and access to, and always have depended on, the common property of their land grants that now comprises these two allotments for the pasturage and grazing of their livestock.\" Opening Brief at 44-45. The Plaintiffs contend that, to take a hard look at social, cultural, and economic effects of their decision to reduce grazing, the Defendants should have employed research methods much like those employed in the 2003 pilot study conducted by Carol Raish Alicia M. McSweeney.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opening Brief at 45-46 (citing Raish &amp; McSweeney at 3, 34-44). According to the Plaintiffs, that study and its research methodology offer \"both analogous data and a template for how the Forest Service readily could have obtained the kind of information necessary to meaningfully consider the [Defendants' decision's] social, cultural, and economic effects.\" Opening Brief at 46. The Plaintiffs state that, instead of conducting that inquiry, the Defendants \"summarily declare[d] that reduction of permittees permitted grazing by nearly a fifth would have no significant effect on the Plaintiffs.\" Opening Brief at 46. The Plaintiffs admit, however, that \"the Defendants were not required to replicate the entire process followed by Raish and McSweeny,\" but the Plaintiffs maintain that the Defendants should have \"engage[d] in at least a somewhat genuinely informed and robust evaluation ... which necessarily would have entailed gathering additional data from the affected permittees and communities.\" Opening Brief at 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Plaintiffs take particular issue with the EA's economic analysis' reliance on \"a minimal, cursory, look at cattle commodity prices.\" Opening Brief at 47. According to the Plaintiffs,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   the Defendants' simplistic subtraction of a small percentage of the overall value of the pre-decision number of cattle permitted to graze on these allotments failed to recognize both: (1) the fact that the elimination of access to these allotments for part of the year would cause the permittees to lose the entire value of the number of cattle no longer permitted because they do not have access to alternative private pasturage for those cattle;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   and (2) the fact that the loss of those cows would result in significant secondary losses in calf production.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Opening Brief at 47. The Plaintiffs identify another reason why the EA oversimplified its economic analysis by looking solely at commodity prices:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [T]he beef from the cattle they raise is not simply sold as a commodity at auction. It also is shared by Plaintiffs and other permittees with members of their extended families, providing that larger population of local residents with healthy and inexpensive meat on which they depend for a vital part of their diet.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Opening Brief at 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In support of their contention that Trujillo \"failed to examine the analysis and findings of the EA prior to making her decision to reduce grazing by 18%,\" Opening Brief at 54, the Plaintiffs observe that, for all their criticism of the EA, it \"adopt[ed] Alternative 2 [maintaining pre-2011 grazing levels] as the Proposed Action,\" Opening Brief at 52. The Plaintiffs contend that, by reducing grazing levels, Trujillo thus \"disregarded the analysis contained in the EA\" and \"ma[de] good on her predetermined decision.\" Opening Brief at 28. As evidence that Trujillo predetermined her decision, the Plaintiffs point to Trujillo's comments at a January 11, 2010 meeting of the Jarita Mesa Grazing Association, which \"suggest[ ] that regardless of what the EA recommended after two years of study [with Alternative 2] as the proposed action, she would see that Alternative 3, which mandated an 18% reduction in permits, was chosen.\" Opening Brief at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     The Response\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On November 11, 2016, the Defendants filed the Federal Defendants' Response Brief on the Merits, filed November 11, 2016 (Doc. 184)(\"Response\"). The Defendants begin by asserting that they did not violate NEPA by failing to take a hard look at reducing grazing's social and economic impacts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 26. The Defendants justify that conclusion with two alternative rationales.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 26-28; 30-32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   First, the Defendants argue that NEPA requires agencies to assess their actions' environmental impacts only, and that the economic and social impacts identified by the Plaintiffs are not environmental impacts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 26-28. According to the Defendants, economic and social impacts that are caused by an action's effect on the physical environment, \" 'the world around us, so to speak,' \" qualify as environmental impacts, but economic and social impacts that flow directly from agency action are not. Response at 27-28 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Metropolitan Edison Co. v. People Against Nuclear Energy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200306\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/766/#p772\">\n    460 U.S. 766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 772,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200306\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/766/#p772\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200306\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/766/#p772\">\n    75 L.Ed.2d 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983) (Rehnquist, J.) ). The Defendants say that the \"Plaintiffs' alleged economic and social impacts are not caused by any impact to the physical environment. Instead those alleged impacts flow directly from the 18-percent reduction in livestock numbers proposed in Alternative 3.\" Response at 28. Consequently, the Defendants argue, NEPA did not require the Defendants to consider those alleged impacts, nor was the EA required to study them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 28. That conclusion makes sense, according to the Defendants, because \"it is well-settled that the purpose of an EA is to determine whether a proposed agency action will have significant\n   <em>\n    environmental\n   </em>\n   impacts which would trigger the requirement for a detailed [Environmental Impact Statement].\" Response at 28 (emphasis in original). The Defendants also observe that CEQ regulations regarding NEPA's implementation state that \" 'economic or social effects are not intended by themselves to require preparation of an environmental\n   impact statement.' \" Response at 30 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201508.14\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Second, the Defendants argue that, even if NEPA requires analysis of socioeconomic impacts, they satisfied that requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 32. The Defendants contend that-contrary to the Plaintiffs' suggestion-the Forest Service \"did, in fact, consider, assess, and give great weight to the economic and social aspects of the decision to reauthorize livestock grazing on the Alamosa and Jarita Mesa Allotments.\" Response at 32. The Defendants highlight Trujillo's conclusion in the DN/FONSI that reducing the amount of grazing \"would have more socioeconomic benefits\" than maintaining the status quo, because,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [w]hile on the surface, a cancellation of the temporary increase appears to be a negative effect on the permittees, the expected result of improved conditions that support a reliable grazing operation that would be more resilient to changing weather conditions would be beneficial to maintaining into the future the opportunity to continue grazing cattle, as has been so important to the local communities for many generations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Response at 47 (quoting DN/FONSI at-(AR 011493) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Defendants next assert that Trujillo did not predetermine the NEPA process' outcome.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 48-50. The Defendants argue that predetermination \" 'occurs only when an agency\n   <em>\n    irreversibly and irretrievably\n   </em>\n   commits itself to a plan of action that is dependent upon the NEPA environmental analysis producing a certain outcome,\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the agency has completed that environmental analysis,' \" and that the record contains \"no evidence to support such a finding by the Court.\" Response at 45 (emphasis in original)(quoting\n   <em>\n    Forest Guardians v.

The Defendants contend that, contrary to the Plaintiffs' suggestion, Trujillo's comments at a January 11, 2010 meeting of the Jarita Mesa Grazing Association do not indicate that Trujillo made a decision before the EA was completed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 48 (citing Opening Brief at 22). The Defendants support that contention by quoting the meeting notes: \" '[S]he has put the decision on hold while waiting for the NEPA report to be completed,' although '[i]t is\n   <em>\n    looking like\n   </em>\n   the 18% temporary increase of 30 years ago will be rescinded.' \" Response at 48 (emphasis added by Defendants)(quoting Jarita Mesa Allotment Meeting Minutes (dated January 11, 2010)(AR 010909-10) ). The Defendants argue that Trujillo, thus, \"expressly conveys that she had\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   made a decision because she was waiting for the EA to be completed.\" Response at 48-49 (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Defendants also assert that the Plaintiffs erroneously suggest that Trujillo disregarded the EA when she decided to decrease grazing, because \" 'the EA adopted Alternative 2' (existing livestock numbers) as the 'Proposed Action.' \" Response at 51 (quoting Opening Brief at 52). The Defendants explain:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiffs misapprehend how the NEPA process is supposed to work, and how it worked here. The Administrative Record demonstrates that the proposed action was developed and identified long before the EA was prepared, and that the EA did not \"adopt\" or identify Alternative 2 as the preferred or even an acceptable alternative. These same Administrative Record documents also demonstrate that it was District Ranger Trujillo who first designated the proposed action as maintaining existing livestock numbers, that she continued to consider this alternative as the proposed action throughout the NEPA process, and she did not select Alternative 3 until the Decision Notice. The District Ranger thus complied with the requirement\n   that she \"[c]onsider[ ] the alternatives analyzed in environmental document(s) before rendering a decision on the proposal.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20220.4\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 220.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(4).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Response at 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     The Reply\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Plaintiffs filed their reply brief on December 16, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' Reply Brief, filed December 16, 2016 (Doc. 187)(\"Reply\").

The Plaintiffs contend that, \"[a]s a consequence\" of those minimal and conclusory statements, \"there simply is not sufficient evidence in the record for a decision-maker to have reached an informed, reasoned determination as to what the social, cultural, and economic effects of challenged management decision were likely to be, or what their level of significance might be.\" Reply at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Plaintiffs assert that, in their Opening Brief, they \"cited a variety of record evidence that is probative of predetermination.\" Reply at 22.

The Plaintiffs replied that, while they believe that the Forest Service \"failed to meet the standard of a hard look,\" they would go further than the Court's characterization of their argument, because \"[t]here is nothing material that shows any consideration of the actual facts or details of the kinds of social, economic, cultural, effects or spiritual effects.\" Tr. at 6:13-22 (Herskovits).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Court asked the Plaintiffs how they would write the statement \"so that the social and economic effects on the plaintiffs of this EA are tied to the physical environment effects of [the Forest Service's] decision ... so that the Government can't complain that ... they have no obligation under NEPA to address just social and cultural [effects].\" Tr. at 19:21-20:1 (Court). The Plaintiffs provided a formulation: \"[I]mpos[ing] a grazing reduction ... while permitting existing and overtime increased elk and wild horse grazing on the same allotments has caused social[,] ... cultural[,] and economic impacts, ... which under NEPA [means] that the Defendants [must] take a hard look....\" Tr. at 21:10-17 (Herskovits).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Court then refocused the discussion on the Plaintiffs' argument that Trujillo \"already made [her] determination before she wrote the EA or [the] EA was prepared.\" Tr. at 30:11-15 (Court). The Court asked the Plaintiffs whether, if the Court agrees with the Plaintiffs' argument, \"that's a home run for you, that you can't do it that way, that's the reason it's there, is that correct.\" Tr. at 30:15-17 (Court). The Plaintiffs answered that, while they \"would never use the term 'home run,' \" they believe that, if they prevail on either Count 2 or Count 5, \"then, obviously, there has been a violation of NEPA.\" Tr. at 30:19-23 (Herskovits). Turning to the substance of their predetermination argument, the Plaintiffs then stated that the Defendants apply an incorrect legal standard when they \"argue that nothing short of an express declaration ... that they were definitively committing resources ... in an irrevocable fashion to make a certain decision before engaging in a NEPA review process ... allow[s] a court to conclude that an improper predetermination ha[s] been made.\" Tr. at 38:24-39:8 (Herskovits). The Plaintiffs argue that, instead, courts can \"look at inconsistencies ... between the record and the purported justification for a decision ... and find on that basis alone that there is a sufficient evidentiary foundation for finding that the agency improperly predetermined its decision.\" Tr. at 39:21-40:2 (Herskovits).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Defendants then took to the podium and began by explaining that the Court's statements in its Administrative Exhaustion MOO addressed whether the Plaintiffs \"ha[d] standing for a NEPA claim[, which] is actually lower than the bar for ... showing [that] a particular effect must be considered in a NEPA process.\" Tr. at 46:21-24 (Smith). The Court asked the Defendants to confirm that they were not asking the Court to reconsider anything in its Administrative Exhaustion MOO,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 47:6-8 (Court), and the Defendants obliged by stating that, in the briefing on\n   the Administrative Exhaustion MOO, \"[w]e didn't r[a]ise the merits of the NEPA claim in any respect,\" Tr. at 47:12-13 (Smith).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Defendants argued that the Forest Service did not need to look at its decision to reduce grazing's \"socioeconomic impact,\" because the \"socioeconomic impacts aren't cause[d] by a change in the physical environment caused by the proposed action. [The Plaintiffs'] socioeconomic impacts are caused by the income loss or the loss of the livestock ... that they would like to continue grazing.\" Tr. at 75:16-23 (Smith). The Defendants elaborated that, under NEPA, an agency needs to consider an action's socioeconomic impacts when there is a causal relationship between the action's impact on the physical environment and resultant socioeconomic impact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 80:5-14 (Smith).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Plaintiffs then began their rebuttal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 101:11-14 (Herskovits). The Plaintiffs conceded that \"there needs to be a causal relationship. There needs to be a relatively close one between the type of social or economic effect that's at issue and the environmental effect or change to the environment.... There is no dispute about that.\" Tr. at 107:14-20 (Herskovits). The Plaintiffs argued, however, that one effect of the Forest Service's decision on the physical environment is that it reduced the number of livestock grazing on the Alamosa and Jarita Mesa Allotments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 110:5-8 (Herskovits). The Plaintiffs then said that this impact on the physical environment \"clearly leads directly or relatively directly to economic harms and social harms that have been described in our briefing and in the complaint.\" Tr. at 111:14-17 (Herskovits).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STATUTORY AND REGULATORY BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   NEPA requires federal agencies to\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   include in every recommendation or report on proposals for legislation and other major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, a detailed statement by the responsible official on-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   (i) the environmental impact of the proposed action,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   (ii) any adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided should the proposal be implemented,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   (iii) alternatives to the proposed action,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   (iv) the relationship between local short-term uses of man's environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   (v) any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources which would be involved in the proposed action should it be implemented.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204332\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C). \"Although labeled an 'environmental' statute, NEPA is in essence a\n   <em>\n    procedural\n   </em>\n   statute; it does 'not require agencies to elevate environmental concerns over other appropriate considerations.' \"\n   <em>\n    Park Cty.

EA at-(AR 011368).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The Plaintiffs identify socioeconomic impacts that the Defendants' action directly causes and not impacts which changes in the physical environment that the action brings. The Plaintiffs-along with their families and communities-have long depended on access to \"the common property of their land grants that now comprises these two allotments for the pasturage and grazing of their livestock.\" Opening Brief at 44. The Plaintiffs have decreased access to grazing and pasturage on the Alamosa and Jarita Mesa Allotments, because the Forest Service has issued fewer grazing permits and not because the decreased number of permits has caused some change to the land that makes up those Allotments. Even if the EA was incorrect and, surprisingly enough, decreasing the number of grazing permits did not change the Alamosa and Jarita Mesa Allotments in any way, the Plaintiffs would still have decreased access to grazing and pasturage. Because that access decrease would occur even if there were no changes to the physical environment, it follows that the access decrease is not caused-even in a \"but for\" sense-by any changes to the physical environment that the Forest Service's action actually produces. Consequently, the Plaintiffs' decreased access to grazing and pasturage-and all of the social, economic, and environmental justice effects that flow from it-do not constitute environmental impacts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   In other circumstances, however, decreased access to the Alamosa and Jarita Mesa Allotments for grazing and pasturage would constitute an environmental impact. For example, Forest Service action-\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , introducing an insect or disease that kills grassy plants-could make the Alamosa and Jarita Mesa Allotments unsuitable for cattle grazing. In that case, a change to the land itself-and not just a change in Forest Services regulations regarding the use of the land-would cause the Plaintiffs to be unable to graze their cattle. The resulting socioeconomic impacts would be, consequently, environmental impacts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Because the socioeconomic impacts identified by the Plaintiffs are not environmental impacts, the Defendants could not violate NEPA by failing to consider them. The Court, accordingly, dismisses Count Two of the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    C. THE COURT'S CONCLUSION THAT NO NEPA VIOLATION OCCURRED IS CONSISTENT WITH ITS EARLIER DETERMINATION THAT THE PLAINTIFFS HAVE STANDING UNDER NEPA.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   In its Administrative Exhaustion MOO, the Court concluded that the Plaintiffs alleged NEPA violations that increased the risk of environmental harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Administrative Exhaustion MOO at 56-57. The Court also concluded that the increased risk of environmental harm qualified as a particularized harm-vis-\u00e0-vis the Plaintiffs-because the Plaintiffs' centuries-old cultural ties to the land that now makes up the Alamosa and Jarita Mesa Allotments mean that the Plaintiffs have a personal interest in the health of that land.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Administrative Exhaustion MOO at 57-58.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 73 (\"The Plaintiffs depend on the Allotments' land and resources, and therefore seek to preserve its environmental integrity.\"). The Court, accordingly, determined that Plaintiffs had standing to assert the NEPA violations alleged in their Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Administrative Exhaustion MOO at 53. The Court also determined that the Plaintiffs fell within the zone of interests that NEPA protects, because \"they assert that, by failing to follow the NEPA's procedures, the\n   Defendants created an increased risk of environmental harm to the Allotments' environmental resources, which thereby harms them socially, culturally, recreationally, aesthetically, economically, and environmentally.\" Administrative Exhaustion MOO at 72.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   In essence, the Court concluded that the Plaintiffs' cultural, social, and economic ties are such that the Plaintiffs have an interest in making sure that the Defendants comply with NEPA. Whether the Defendants actually complied with NEPA is a separate issue. Similarly, that an environmental harm to the land \"thereby harms [the Plaintiffs] socially, culturally, ... [and] economically,\" Administrative Exhaustion MOO at 72, does not mean that environmental harms to the land cause all the Plaintiffs' social, cultural, and economic harms. The Court's determination that the socioeconomic impacts identified by the Plaintiffs are not environmental impacts is thus consistent with its earlier determinations in the Administrative Exhaustion MOO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    D. THE DEFENDANTS DID NOT VIOLATE NEPA EVEN IF THE SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACTS IDENTIFIED BY THE PLAINTIFFS ARE ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   So long as an agency makes a \"reasoned evaluation of the available information and its method [of analysis] was not arbitrary or capricious,\" an EA satisfies NEPA's \"hard look\" requirement.\n   <em>\n    Utah Shared Access All. v.

Those discussions acknowledge the Plaintiffs' historical, social, and cultural context. For example, the EA states, with respect to environmental justice\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   Native Americans have been present in the area for at least the past 1,000 years and Spanish settlers arrived in the area about 400 years ago. Many families in the study area trace their ancestry back to these original inhabitants. As such, there are strong ties to the land and a reliance on the natural resources of the forest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   All the communities within the El Rito area would fall under the minority and/or low-income populations identified in the Environmental Justice Executive Order 12898. Generally, environmental justice is concerned with identifying these communities and ensuring that they are involved in and understand the potential effects of the proposed action. The people in the study area communities are interested in maintaining their historic and subsistence lifestyle, using the surrounding area to gather resources needed. Elimination of livestock grazing on national forest system lands would negatively affect this lifestyle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   EA at-(AR 011468). Similarly, the EA's discussion of social effects observes that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   Small-scale producers stress the importance of the quality of life that ranching provides them and their families. Owning livestock is an important way of reaffirming ties to their ancestral lands and heritage. Preserving this working relationship with the land so it can be passed on to their children along with a feeling of self-sufficiency is a cornersto\n   ne of their values. Generally speaking, the more rural and remote the community, ranching becomes more important.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   EA at-(AR 011467). The EA's discussion of economics acknowledges that the EA's economic analysis is based on \"a very general estimate of income, not profit, and doesn't include the various expenses that normal livestock operations require,\" but the EA contends that \"[i]t gives a general idea of income being generated from the livestock operation on the analysis area and is a basis for comparison of alternatives.\" EA at-(AR 011466). The EA thus compares economic impacts in a rational way even though that comparison is not as comprehensive as the Plaintiffs desire.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opening Brief at 32-33. The EA, thus, makes a reasoned evaluation of the available information regarding social, economic, and environmental justice effects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   That the EA did not conduct a full-scale sociological study akin to the 2003 pilot study that Carol Raish and Alicia M. McSweeney conducted-and that the Plaintiffs laud,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Opening Brief at 45-46-does not mean that the EA violated NEPA.

First, the Plaintiffs contend that Trujillo's comments at the January 11, 2010 meeting of the Jarita Mesa Grazing Association indicate that she had decided to reduce the number of grazing permits months before the EA's completion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opening Brief at 22. The Administrative Record, however, indicates that Trujillo only stated that \"[i]t is looking like the 18% temporary increase of 30 years ago will be rescinded.\" Jarita Mesa Allotment Meeting Minutes at-(AR 010910), (dated January 11, 2010)(AR 010909-10). Second, the Plaintiffs state that Trujillo disregarded the EA's designation of Alternative 2, which would have maintained the existing number of grazing permits as the proposed action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opening Brief at 52. The Defendants, however, correctly observe that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   [the] Plaintiffs misapprehend how the NEPA process is supposed to work, and how it worked here. The Administrative Record demonstrates that the proposed action was developed and identified long before the EA was prepared, and that the EA did not \"adopt\" or identify Alternative 2 as the preferred or even an acceptable alternative. These same Administrative Record documents also demonstrate that it was District Ranger Trujillo who first designated the proposed action as maintaining existing livestock numbers, that she continued to consider this alternative as the proposed action throughout the NEPA process, and she did not select Alternative 3 until the Decision Notice. The District Ranger thus complied with the requirement that she \"[c]onsider[ ] the alternatives analyzed in environmental document(s) before rendering a decision on the proposal.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20220.4\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 220.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(4).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Response at 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Third, the Plaintiffs contend that the EA contradicts the rationale which the DN/FONSI states.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opening Brief at 53. The EA states that, under Alternative 2, range condition is likely to continue in a stable trend and remain in poor to fair condition whereas, under Alternative 3, range condition will likely improve to fair or better condition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EA at-(AR 011368). The DN/FONSI states that \"[t]he effects of the 18% increase in permitted livestock have now been evaluated and determined to be unsustainable.\" DN/FONSI at-(AR 011492). The DN/FONSI also indicates that Trujillo \"chose[ ] not to permit a higher number of livestock than the scientific data indicates that the analysis area is capable of supporting.\" DN/FONSI at-(AR 011492). Contrary to the Plaintiffs' suggestion,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Opening Brief at 53, those statements are not inconsistent. That the range capacity would not further deteriorate under Alternative 2 does not mean that poor to fair range capacity is a sustainable state of affairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   The three pieces of record evidence that the Plaintiffs identify do not, either individually or collectively, indicate that the Defendants irreversibly and irretrievably committed themselves to a plan of action before the NEPA process was complete.

Grazing by livestock may impact vegetation by changing the mix of species in the plant communities being grazed; the density and frequency of perennial forage plants; and the vigor of the grazed plants. These effects are reflected by the following range condition classes: excellent, good, fair, poor, and very poor.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-160\">\n    EA at-(AR 011388).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    \"Rangeland grazing capacity refers to the average number of livestock and wildlife which may be sustained on an allotment compatible with objectives for that allotment.\" EA at-(AR 011406).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
