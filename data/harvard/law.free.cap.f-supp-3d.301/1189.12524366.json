Forty-eight hours after receiving the demand letter, Salty Dawg Expedition, Inc., and David Bock, who owns Salty Dawg Expedition, Inc., sued (Doc. 1) for a declaratory judgment that Salty Dawg and Bock owe no maintenance and cure because Borland fails to qualify as a \"seaman\" under the Jones Act, which permits a \"seaman injured in the course of employment\" to sue an employer for negligence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even though the Jones Act unambiguously protects the right to a jury trial,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bock and Salty Dawg argue that their expedient exploitation of a procedural quirk (that is, the request for a declaratory judgment and the consequent invocation of Rule 9(h), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure ) extinguished Borland's statutory and constitutional right to a jury trial. Borland opposes (Doc. 34) Bock and Salty Dawg's motion (Doc. 31) to strike Borland's request for a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

The complaint alleges both admiralty and diversity jurisdiction. (Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 7-8) Omitting from the complaint a request for a jury trial, Bock and Salty Dawg inserted the phrase \"In Admiralty\" prominently on the first page of the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the answer, Borland admitted admiralty jurisdiction but \"reserve[d] his right to a jury trial under the Jones Act.\" (Doc. 9 at \u00b6 7) Also, Borland admitted that the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000 and that the adverse parties share no citizenship. (Doc. 9 at \u00b6 8) Additionally, Borland counter-claimed against Salty Dawg and Bock for negligence under the Jones Act, for unseaworthiness under maritime law, for maintenance and cure under maritime law, and for negligence under maritime law. (Doc. 9 at 7-14) Finally, Borland demanded a jury trial. (Doc. 9 at 15) Borland asserted no\n   <em>\n    in-rem\n   </em>\n   claim against the\n   <em>\n    M/V Salty Dawg\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Right to a jury trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   If Borland sued first, at least two sources would guarantee Borland's right to a jury trial. First, Congress provided in Section 30104 of the Jones Act that a \"seaman injured in the course of employment...may elect to bring a civil action at law, with the right of trial by jury.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although Section 30104 provides a jury trial\n   only on a Jones Act claim,\n   <em>\n    Fitzgerald v.

If a seaman injured aboard a vessel invokes diversity or federal-question jurisdiction, the action constitutes an action \"at law,\" and the Seventh Amendment preserves the right to a jury trial.

Borland counterclaims \"at law\" against Salty Dawg Expedition, Inc., and Bock. The counter-claims include no admiralty designation under Rule 9(h), and Borland asserts no\n   <em>\n    in-rem\n   </em>\n   claim against the\n   <em>\n    M/V Salty Dawg\n   </em>\n   , which would necessarily invoke admiralty jurisdiction. Under the Jones Act and the saving-to-suitors clause, Borland's preference to proceed at law rather than in\n   admiralty would afford Borland a jury trial on all the claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Procedural posturing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Despite the apparent availability of a jury trial, Salty Dawg and Bock argue that the declaratory-judgment request, which invokes Rule 9(h), extinguishes Borland's right to a jury trial. In a typical action at law, Rule 38(a) preserves \"inviolate\" the right to a jury trial \"as declared by the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution-or as provided by a federal statute.\" But if a claim \"is within\" both admiralty jurisdiction and another jurisdiction, Rule 9(h) permits designating the claim as an admiralty claim \"for purposes of...Rule 38(e),\" which withdraws \"on issues in a claim that is an admiralty or maritime claim\" the protection in Rule 38(a) of the right to a jury trial. In short, a Rule 9(h) designation ordinarily precludes a jury trial on an admiralty claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   For three reasons, Bock and Salty Dawg Expedition's Rule 9(h) designation cannot extinguish Borland's statutory and constitutional right to a jury trial. First, Bock and Salty Dawg's complaint asserts no maritime \"claim.\" The request for a declaratory judgment, which duplicates several of Bock and Salty Dawg's affirmative defenses (Doc. 10), merely denies liability based on Borland's alleged failure to qualify as a seaman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Second, even if the declaratory-judgment request asserts a \"claim,\" Rule 38(e) precludes a jury trial on \"issues in a claim that is an admiralty or maritime claim.\" Bock and Salty Dawg Expedition's complaint requests a declaratory judgment on two \"issues\": Borland's \"status as a seaman\" (Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 25-49) and the amount of maintenance and cure (Doc. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 50-52). The complaint requests no declaratory judgment about Bock and Salty Dawg's purported negligence. In fact, the word \"negligence\" appears nowhere in Bock and Salty Dawg's request for a declaratory judgment. Although Borland's \"status\" as a seaman affects the Jones Act claim, the maintenance-and-cure claim, and the unseaworthiness claim, Borland's negligence claim can succeed regardless of Borland's \"seaman status.\" Because no party invokes Rule 9(h) to exclude under Rule 38(e) the prospect of a jury trial on the negligence claim-which, as explained above, Borland can try \"at law\" under diversity jurisdiction-Rule 38(a) protects \"inviolate\" Borland's right to a jury trial on that claim. And, as\n   <em>\n    Fitzgerald\n   </em>\n   explains, a single trial preserves the parties' and the judiciary's resources and promotes a \"fair\" outcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Third, the invocation of the Declaratory Judgment Act in an apparent attempt to prevent Borland's exercise of his statutory and constitutional right to a jury trial contravenes the Supreme Court's repeated instruction that the Declaratory Judgment Act \"leave[s] substantive rights unchanged.\"\n   <em>\n    Medtronic, Inc. v.

In\n   <em>\n    Romero\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff mentioned in his complaint both admiralty and diversity jurisdiction and cited Rule 9(h). The defendants and the district court interpreted the plaintiff's Rule 9(h) designation as a waiver of the right to a jury trial. A pre-trial order permitted the plaintiff a final opportunity to amend the complaint and omit the mention of Rule 9(h), but the plaintiff declined to amend the complaint.

Seatrain Lines, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"257695\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/469/666/\">\n    469 F.2d 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 1972) (Goodwin, J.), because the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Harrison\n   </em>\n   \"has not alleged diversity as an alternative basis of jurisdiction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"879587\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/577/968/\">\n    577 F.2d at 978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    McCrary\n   </em>\n   , a longshoreman sued a vessel's owner and alleged both admiralty and diversity jurisdiction. The vessel's owner impleaded the stevedore, which demanded a jury trial on the vessel owner's indemnity claim against the stevedore. After the longshoreman settled the action against the vessel's owner, the district court denied the stevedore's request for a jury trial on the claim between the stevedore and the vessel owner. Because the longshoreman's complaint alleged both admiralty and diversity jurisdiction,\n   <em>\n    McCrary\n   </em>\n   states that the district court erred in denying the stevedore's request for a jury trial. Like\n   <em>\n    McCrary\n   </em>\n   but not\n   <em>\n    Harrison\n   </em>\n   , Bock and Salty Dawg allege diversity jurisdiction. (Doc. 1 at \u00b6 8) Second,\n   <em>\n    Harrison\n   </em>\n   distinguishes\n   <em>\n    Fitzgerald\n   </em>\n   because the seaman in\n   <em>\n    Harrison\n   </em>\n   , unlike in\n   <em>\n    Fitzgerald\n   </em>\n   , preferred a bench trial. Again,\n   <em>\n    Harrison\n   </em>\n   involves no request for a declaratory judgment. As explained above, a long line of Supreme Court decisions holds that the Declaratory Judgment Act, which allows the party who would ordinarily defend an action to initiate the litigation, cannot alter a party's \"substantive rights.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Skelly\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Beacon\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Medtronic\n   </em>\n   . In both\n   <em>\n    Fitzgerald\n   </em>\n   and this action and unlike in\n   <em>\n    Harrison\n   </em>\n   , the injured seaman prefers to exercise the substantive right to a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Finally, although\n   <em>\n    Lago Canyon\n   </em>\n   involves a declaratory judgment, at least two pertinent facts distinguish this action. First, the Jones Act expressly provides Borland the right to a jury trial on the Jones Act claim, and\n   <em>\n    Fitzgerald\n   </em>\n   extends the jury-trial right to Borland's maritime-law claims. Second, the declaratory-judgment request and the counter-claim in\n   <em>\n    Lago Canyon\n   </em>\n   involved the same \"issue\": whether an insurance policy covered a yacht's sinking.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3480134\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/561/1181/\">\n    561 F.3d at 1185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Lago Canyon's counterclaim is the flip side of St. Paul's own claim.\"). In this action, Borland asserts claims not covered by narrow declaratory-judgment request. Because Rule 38(e) precludes a jury trial only on \"issues in a claim that is an admiralty claim,\" Rule 38(a) preserves Borland's right under the saving-to-suitors clause and the Jones Act to a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Request to bifurcate trials\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Additionally, Bock and Salty Dawg request a \"separate bench trial on the issue of seaman status to avoid prejudice and to promote judicial economy.\" (Doc. 31 at 6) The request warrants denial for at least two reasons. First, the Jones Act and the saving-to-suitors clause entitle Borland to a jury trial. Second, two trials in this action wastes the parties' and judiciary's resources. A trial to determine Borland's status as a seaman will likely require several witnesses (including Borland) to travel to Tampa from Oregon. Even if the finder of fact in the first trial concludes that Borland is not a seaman, the negligence claim might require the parties and the witnesses to assemble a second time in Tampa. And the parties will waste the second jury's valuable time by presenting evidence already presented to the first jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Bock and Salty Dawg argue that a preliminary trial on Borland's status will \"streamline\" this litigation and \"maximize efficiency.\" (Doc. 31 at 7) In fact, experience (strongly) suggests that the prospect of two trials about the same incident and in the same action achieves the opposite result. The motion (Doc. 31) to strike Borland's demand for a jury trial or to bifurcate the issue of Borland's seaman status is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   ORDERED in Tampa, Florida, on October 19, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    A June 30, 2017 order (Doc. 28) denies summary judgment on the issue of Borland's \"seaman status.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    \"A seaman injured in the course of employment...may elect to bring a civil action at law, with the right of trial by jury.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030104\">\n     46 U.S.C. \u00a7 30104\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    The seaman elects between an action at law and an admiralty action, which carries no right to a jury trial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Bock and Salty Dawg's implausible argument that a single trial of all the claims would prejudice Bock and Salty Dawg lacks merit.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
