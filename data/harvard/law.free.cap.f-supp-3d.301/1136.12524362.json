Sept. 14, 2015). The Eleventh Circuit does not appear to have addressed such a challenge in recent years. That may soon change, as a challenge to a Georgia city's bond system,\n   <em>\n    Walker v. City of Calhoun\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-13139 (11th Cir. docketed July 13, 2017), is currently pending before the Eleventh Circuit. The court will not stay this action pending the Eleventh Circuit's resolution of\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   , as contemplated in the December 5th, 2017 show cause order (Doc. # 82), although the court will continue to monitor\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At issue here is the bond system in effect in Randolph County, Alabama. Plaintiff Kandace Kay Edwards, on her own behalf and on behalf of a putative class of similarly situated individuals (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 5), brought this\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   action against the district court judge (Judge Clay Tinney), the magistrate (Jill Puckett), the circuit court clerk (Christopher May), and the sheriff (David Cofield) responsible for promulgating and carrying out that bond system. (Doc. # 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As a result of some legal maneuvering after this action was filed, Defendants revised Randolph County's bond procedures. (Doc. # 67-1.) The gist of the revisions is that every person arrested in Randolph County who cannot afford to pay the secured bond amount in the bond schedule established by the Alabama Supreme Court is entitled to a bond hearing within seventy-two hours of arrest. Defendants argue that those revisions moot this case and thus deprive the court of subject-matter jurisdiction. But Plaintiff contends that the new system is still constitutionally infirm-both because the procedural protections at that hearing are insufficient and because seventy-two hours is still too long to detain arrestees unable to post secured money bond before a bond hearing (Doc. # 75).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before the court is Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Doc. # 3) and Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction (Doc. # 67). Because the mid-litigation revision of Randolph County's bond procedures has not mooted this case, Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction (Doc. # 67) is due to be denied. But because the new procedures arguably provide the same result as the injunction Plaintiff seeks, Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Doc. # 3) is also due to be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , although the question whether this action is moot will be addressed below. The parties do not contest personal jurisdiction or venue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff, who is indigent, brought this action after she was subjected to pretrial detention without a hearing due to her inability to post a secured money bond. This court granted her motion for a temporary restraining order (Doc. # 9), and Plaintiff was released. Plaintiff's release did not moot this case (Doc. # 49) because she brought it on behalf of a putative class \"consisting of all arrestees who are or who will be jailed in Randolph County who are unable to pay the secured money bail amount required for their release\" (Doc. # 5, at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Apparently after the court denied Defendants' motions to dismiss (Doc. # 49), Judge Tinney, Mr. May, and Ms. Puckett began \"working to develop bail procedures that, if adopted for Randolph County, would obviate the need for a preliminary injunction.\" (Doc. # 53, at 1.) That work involved negotiations with Plaintiff's counsel. (Doc. # 59, at 2.) Those negotiations eventually broke down (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 65, at 1-2), but they were not entirely without fruit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The same day Judge Tinney, Mr. May, and Ms. Puckett filed their response to Plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction (Doc. # 67), Judge Tinney issued a new standing bond order (Doc. # 67-1, at 10-16). Under the new standing bond order, arrestees who are unable to post bond in the amount set according to a bond schedule (Doc. # 67-1, at 18-21) \"shall be entitled to a judicial determination of the conditions of their release promptly after arrest, but in any event no later than 72 hours after arrest.\" (Doc. # 67-1, at 12.) Before that hearing, arrestees \"shall complete an affidavit of substantial hardship\" (Doc. # 67-1, at 12), the same form used to obtain appointed counsel (Doc. # 67-1, at 23-24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At the hearing, the court \"may take into account\" the factors listed in Rule 7.2(a) of the Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure. (Doc. # 67-1, at 12-14.) The court is required to \"consider a defendant's ability to post a bond in determining the defendant's conditions of release\" and \"the defendant's affidavit of substantial hardship.\" (Doc. # 67-1, at 14.) The court may also \"elicit testimony about the defendant's financial condition.\" (Doc. # 67-1, at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   After considering the defendant's ability to post a bond, as well as the other factors set out in Rule 7.2(a), the Court may release a defendant on his or her own recognize [sic], require the defendant to post an unsecured appearance bond, or require the posting of a secured appearance bond if that is the least onerous condition that will reasonably assure the defendant's appearance or that will eliminate or minimize the risk of harm to others or to the public at large. The Court will not require a defendant to post a secure appearance bond that the defendant cannot afford to post, or a secure appearance bond in an amount less than that contained in the bond schedule that the defendant can afford to post, if there is a less onerous condition that would assure the defendant's appearance or minimize risk to the public. However, if the Court determines that there is no less onerous condition for securing the defendant's appearance or protecting the public, the Court may require a secure appearance bond in an amount less than, equal to, or greater than that contained in the bond schedule. The Court will make written finding [sic] as to why the posting of a bond is reasonably necessary to assure the defendant's presence at trial in such a case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (Doc. # 67-1, at 14 (citations omitted).) If the hearing does not take place within seventy-two hours of arrest, the arrestee \"will be released on an unsecured appearance bond ... at the expiration of the 72-hour period.\" (Doc. # 67-1, at 14-15.) Those procedures apply both to individuals arrested pursuant to a warrant (Doc. # 67-1, at 16-17) and to those arrested without a warrant (Doc. # 67-1, at 12-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendants argue that the new standing bond order moots this case (Doc. # 67), but Plaintiff argues that it does not provide sufficient procedural safeguards. Plaintiff thus continues to seek a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff's requested preliminary injunction includes four components. The injunction\n   would (1) require Defendants to hold \"an individualized hearing with adequate procedural safeguards\" for arrestees unable to pay secured money bail. (Doc. # 3, at 1.) Such a hearing would include: (2) \"an inquiry into and findings concerning [the arrestee's] ability to pay\" (Doc. # 3, at 1); (3) \"an inquiry into and findings concerning ... the suitability of alternative non-financial conditions of release\" (Doc. # 3, at 1); and (4) \"a finding on the record that any conditions of release are the least restrictive conditions necessary to achieve public safety and court appearance.\" (Doc. # 3, at 1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The new standing bond order appears to cover each of the four components of Plaintiff's proposed injunction to at least some degree. Under the new standing bond order, (1) every arrestee unable to pay secured money bail is entitled to an individualized bond hearing within seventy-two hours of arrest. (Doc. # 67-1, at 12, 15-16.) At that hearing, the court will consider (2) the arrestee's financial condition and ability to post a bond, as well as (3) the possibility of alternative conditions of release (including personal recognizance bond and an unsecured appearance bond) and each of the factors listed in Rule 7.2(a) of the Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure. (Doc. # 67-1, at 12-15, 15-16.) And in the event the court imposes a secured bond that the arrestee cannot pay, (4) the court will make written findings explaining why a secured bond is the least onerous condition required to achieve public safety and assure the arrestee will appear for later court proceedings. (Doc. # 67-1, at 14, 15-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Because the new standing bond order arguably gives Plaintiff the relief she seeks, Defendants argue that this case is moot. (Doc. # 67, at 30-34.) Unsurprisingly, Plaintiff disagrees. She argues both that the new standing bond order's procedures are still constitutionally infirm (Doc. # 75, at 8-20) and that the new standing bond order does not moot this case even if the new procedures pass constitutional muster (Doc. # 75, at 28-31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Because mootness is a jurisdictional issue, the court will address Defendants' motion to dismiss on that basis before addressing Plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction. Both motions are due to be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The new standing bond order does not moot this case.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   If Plaintiff is correct that Randolph County's bond procedures under the new standing bond order run afoul of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, then the new standing bond order clearly does not moot the case. While there is not enough to find a likelihood that Plaintiff will succeed on those arguments,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   at pp. ---- - ----, neither is there enough to dismiss them out of hand. Most importantly, Plaintiff strongly disputes that seventy-two hours is the appropriate window for resolution of financial and criminological issues in the bond determination. She instead argues for a window of no longer than a few hours. Defendants have settled on seventy-two hours, but their reasoning has not been tested factually or legally. Plaintiff also argues for additional procedural safeguards, including court-appointed counsel; an opportunity to testify, present evidence, and cross examine witnesses; notice of the purpose of the bond hearing; and a clear-and-convincing evidentiary standard. In short, there is more to be done on remedial issues, so this case is not moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   But the new standing bond order does not moot this case even if the new procedures are constitutionally sufficient.

Specifically, she argues that arrestees unable to pay a secured money bond are entitled to appointed counsel (Doc. # 75, at 16-17); \"notice about the purpose of the\" bond hearing (Doc. # 75, at 18); and \"an opportunity\n   to be heard[,] ... to present evidence\" (Doc. # 75, at 19 (quoting\n   <em>\n    ODonnell I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274278\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/251/1052/\">\n    251 F.Supp.3d 1052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1145 (S.D.

She further argues that the court must use a clear-and-convincing evidentiary standard when determining whether pretrial detention is necessary. (Doc. # 75, at 15-16.) Plaintiff also argues that seventy-two hours is too long to make arrestees wait for a bond hearing, although she has not clearly suggested an alternative time frame.

Once again, neither\n   <em>\n    ODonnell I\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    ODonnell II\n   </em>\n   offers a persuasive explanation for imposing such a requirement.

Clear-and-Convincing-Evidence Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Plaintiff's argument in support of requiring a clear-and-convincing-evidence standard fares no better. She asserts that \"\n   <em>\n    Salerno\n   </em>\n   and the due process principles upon which it relies require a clear and convincing evidentiary standard prior to detention for any reason.\" (Doc. # 75, at 15.) That is not the case, as discussed above. She also selectively quotes phrases from\n   <em>\n    Salerno\n   </em>\n   out of context (Doc. # 75, at 15) and mischaracterizes Defendants' arguments in response to her motion for a preliminary injunction (Doc. # 75, at 14-15 (citing Doc. # 67, at 19-20) ), two less-than-persuasive tactics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Plaintiff has also cited\n   <em>\n    In re Humphrey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514182\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/228/513/\">\n    19 Cal.App.5th 1006\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12514182\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-rptr-3d/228/513/\">\n    228 Cal.Rptr.3d 513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018), a recent California intermediate appellate court decision requiring a clear-and-convincing-evidence\n   standard for bail hearings.

A Maximum Delay of Less than Seventy-Two Hours\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   That leaves Plaintiff's argument that a maximum delay of seventy-two hours before a bond hearing is still too long. It is unclear exactly what time frame Plaintiff seeks. She says she \"does not contest that due process can tolerate some period of detention\" (Doc. # 75, at 12) and concedes that a \"\n   <em>\n    de minimus\n   </em>\n   period\" of detention-meaning no \"longer than a few hours\"-would be permissible (Doc. # 75, at 16 n.10). But if that is truly the case, her argument proves too much. Indeed, she describes \"the constitutional prohibition\" she asserts as \"categorical\" and argues that \"[s]hortening the constitutional injury does not end it.\" (Doc. # 75, at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In any event, Plaintiff has not shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of her claim that a maximum delay of seventy-two hours before a bond hearing is unconstitutional. Indeed, the Bail Reform Act of 1984-which, according to Plaintiff's arguments based on\n   <em>\n    Salerno\n   </em>\n   , provides only the bare minimum safeguards required by the Constitution-allows for at least a seventy-two-hour delay before a bail hearing.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f). And with respect to enforcing that requirement, the Bail Reform Act of 1984 provides less protection for arrestees than the new standing bond order: The former does not require an arrestee to be released if a bail hearing is not held within the time limits it imposes,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Montalvo-Murillo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634320\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/711/#p717\">\n    495 U.S. 711\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 717,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634320\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/711/#p717\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2072\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634320\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/711/#p717\">\n    109 L.Ed.2d 720\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990), but the latter does (Doc. # 67-1, at 14-15). It is thus at least possible that the timing provisions of the new standing bond order provide greater protections than the Fourteenth Amendment actually requires.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The new standing bond order arguably provides all of the relief Plaintiff seeks in her motion for a preliminary injunction. The devil may be in the details, but Plaintiff has not made the requisite showings to establish a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of her claims that the Fourteenth Amendment requires procedural safeguards beyond those provided by the new standing bond order. Her motion for a preliminary injunction is therefore due to be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Accordingly, it is ORDERED as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   1. Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction (Doc. # 67) is DENIED; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   2. Plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction (Doc. # 3) is DENIED.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   DONE this 21st day of March, 2018.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
