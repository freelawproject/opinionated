Kanney (\"Kanney\"). Compl. \u00b6 5. On April 18, 2014, Kanney was arrested in Ephrata, Lancaster County for theft, loitering, and prowling.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. Kanney could not post bail and was taken to Lancaster County Prison (\"LCP\") to be held as a pretrial detainee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. Upon being committed to LCP, Kanney underwent intake screenings and health assessments. LCP Correctional Officer Joshua Zielinski (\"Officer Zielinski\") performed the initial intake screening of Kanney. Dkt. 58, Ex. F, Zielinski Dep., pp. 13-16. During the intake screening, Kanney disclosed to Officer Zielinski that he was \"dope sick\" and used a bundle a day for three months straight.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-22. Officer Zielinski also performed a strip search of Kanney, which was documented by Officer Carl Koltz.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40-42; Dkt. 58, Ex. G, Koltz Dep., pp. 14-18. A copy of the intake forms were given to the medical department, PrimeCare. Dkt. 58, Ex. G, Koltz Dep., p. 31. Jade Fritsch, MA, a PrimeCare employee, conducted a \"rapid screen\" of Kanney prior to his full medical intake. Dkt. 58, Ex. K, Fritsch Dep., pp. 23-29. The \"rapid screen\" indicated that Kanney brought two medications into the prison with him, that his pulse was elevated, and that he would be withdrawing from heroin and Xanax, and that he had last used 5 bags of heroin that morning.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30-36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Shortly thereafter, Jaycees Candelario electronically completed several forms including a Mental Health Screen for Men, a Receiving Screening and Health Assessment Form, and an Intake Suicide Screen. Dkt. 58, Ex. H, Candelario Dep., pp. 17-19. The Intake Suicide Screening page stated that \"[i]f the patient scores 8 or more, a Suicide Watch will be initiated.\" Dkt. 58, Ex. Y, p. 1. Kanney answered yes to five questions and a Suicide Watch was not automatically initiated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2. On the Receiving Screening and Health Assessment Form, Kanney indicated that he was addicted to heroin and Xanax and used both the day before entering LCP.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Kanney also indicated that he had not previously tried to commit suicide and that he was not presently suicidal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. On the Mental Health Screen for Men, Kanney answered \"yes\" to nine of twelve questions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. According to the Mental Health Screen for Men, if a detainee answered \"yes\" to 6 or more questions, then the detainee should be referred for further mental health evaluation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In the comments section of Kanney's Mental Health Screen for Men, Ms. Candelario indicated that Kanney should be \"re evaluate[d].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Initially, Kristen Zablocki, RN, a PrimeCare employee, issued DOJ Orders for Kanney and placed him on 30 Minute Detox Watch. Dkt. 58, Ex. Z, DOJ Orders, p.1. DOJ Orders refer to medical restrictions on which inmates are placed. Dkt. 57, Ex. G, Kotz Dep., p. 46. Kanney was also placed on work, gym, and yard restrictions and corrections staff were told to assign him a low bunk.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Shortly thereafter, and following her exam of Kanney on April 19, 2014, Ms. Candelario updated his DOJ Orders to indicate that the restrictions were to remain in place until a Doctor or Physician Assistant cleared Kanney.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Katherine (\"Katie\") Neimer reviewed the intake forms completed by Ms. Candelario. Dkt. 75, Ex. J, Neimer Dep., p. 19. She agreed with Ms. Candelario's completion of the forms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ms. Neimer called for orders of Kanney's medicines, including\n   Vistaril and Wellbutrin.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At the time of her deposition, Ms. Neimer did not recall noticing any inconsistencies between the responses given by Kanney and recorded by Ms. Candelario.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28. She relied on the information that Ms. Candelario completed to be accurate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On April 21, 2014, PrimeCare Medical Staff received a Sick Call Request from Kanney. Dkt. 58, Ex. EE, p.1. On the handwritten form, Kanney indicated that he was hearing strange voices and was overly stressed out.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In response to his Sick Call Request, Bonnie Bair, a PrimeCare Mental Health Caseworker, conducted an assessment of Kanney that morning. Dkt. 58, Ex. I, Bair Dep., pp. 22-27. Ms. Bair asked Kanney numerous questions about his symptoms and mental health history.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41-53. Following her examination, Ms. Bair recommended that sick call requests should be completed as needed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at. 53-54. Ms. Bair indicated that Kanney's mood was neutral and that he denied suicidal ideation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56-58. Ms. Bair also recommended that Kanney should be evaluated by a psychiatrist in one week.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58-59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On April 21, 2014, Officer William Miller was asked to work a mandatory overtime shift. Dkt. 58, Ex. A, Miller Dep., pp. 28-30. Officer Miller asked to be assigned to the medical unit for this overtime shift.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32-33. Officer Miller was given a list of approximately eleven inmates, including Kanney, to pick up and bring back to the medical unit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at. 40-41; Dkt. 50, Ex. MP5. Upon returning to the medical unit, the inmates took seats in the waiting area and Officer Miller positioned himself at the front desk.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43-44; Dkt. 50, Ex. MP5. Officer Miller did not have any interaction with Kanney prior to April 21, 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43. Several minutes after arriving in the medical unit, Kanney got up to use the restroom for the first time. Dkt. 50, Ex. MP5. Officer Miller heard Kanney state that his stomach was hurting and that he needed to relieve himself. Dkt. 58, Ex. A, Miller Dep., pp. 50-51. After approximately five minutes, Kanney exited the restroom, adjusted his pants, and returned to his seat. Dkt. 50, Ex. MP5. Two minutes later, Kanney stood up and entered the restroom for the second time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After Kanney had been in the restroom for ten minutes, Officer Miller knocked on the restroom door and then returned to the desk after hearing what he believed to be feet shuffling.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Dkt. 58, Ex. A, Miller Dep., pp.58-59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Shortly thereafter, Officer Tyler Phillips walked to the front of the medical unit and spoke to Officer Miller. Dkt. 50, Ex. MP5; Dkt. 58, Ex. B, Phillips Dep., pp. 31-32. Then, Officer Phillips walked over to the restroom and listened through the door; he did not hear anything.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Dkt. 58, Phillips Dep., pp. 38-39. Three minutes later, Officer Phillips headed to the back of the medical unit and Officer Miller knocked on the restroom door for a second time and remained there for roughly twenty seconds before he returned to the front desk.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Officer Miller did not hear anything from inside the restroom. Dkt. 58, Ex. A, Miller Dep., pp. 62-63. Officer Phillips returned to the front desk and spoke briefly with Officer Miller before heading to the back of the unit again. Dkt. 58, Ex. B, Phillips Dep., pp. 40-41. Officer Miller called for his supervisor, Sergeant John Maldonado, to come to the medical unit and unlock the restroom door. Dkt. 50, Ex. MP5; Dkt. 58, Ex. A, Miller Dep., p. 63; Dkt. 58, Ex. C, Maldonado Dep., pp. 43-45. Approximately one minute later, Officer Phillips instructed the other inmates sitting near the door to move away. Dkt. 50, Ex. MP5. Officer Miller knocked on the restroom door a third time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Sergeant Maldonado entered the medical unit, knocked on the restroom door, waited a few seconds, and then unlocked it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Dkt. 58, Ex. A, Miller\n   Dep., pp. 65-66; Dkt. 58, Ex. C, Maldonado Dep., p.47.

A, Miller Dep., pp. 65-67; Dkt. 58, Ex. C, Maldonado Dep., pp. 52-54. Approximately eighteen minutes elapsed from the moment Kanney entered the restroom for the second time and the moment that Sergeant Maldonado unlocked the restroom door. Dkt. 50, Ex. MP5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Various medical personnel rendered aid to Kanney until the paramedics and emergency medical technicians arrived on scene.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Dkt. 58, Ex. C, Maldonado Dep. p. 55; Dkt. 58, Ex. O, p. 3. Kanney was transported to Lancaster General Hospital, where he was resuscitated. Dkt. 58, Ex. O, p. 4; Dkt. 58, Ex. W, Postmortem Rep., p. 1.

Thus, Plaintiffs cannot use Kanney's drug withdrawal to support their claim for deliberate indifference on the part of the remaining PrimeCare Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   PrimeCare argues that Kanney did not have a particular vulnerability to suicide. They argue generally that \"the undisputed medical records\" show that Kanney repeatedly reported that he did not feel suicidal and reported that he never tried to commit suicide. Dkt. 51, PrimeCare Mot., p. 8. They note that none of the medical staff recalled seeing scarring on Kanney's wrists. Dkt. 75, Pls.' Br., Ex. H, Candelario Dep., p. 28; Ex. F, Zielinski Dep., p. 17; Ex. K, Fritsch Dep., p. 42; Ex. I, Bair Dep., p. 17; Ex. JJ, Smith Dep., p. 22. Plaintiffs respond that PrimeCare ignores the fact that but for \"a grossly inept Suicide Intake by Candelario, by PrimeCare's own standards, Kanney should have been put on suicide watch.\" Dkt. 77, Pls.' Br., p 5. Other factors cited by Plaintiffs to support their argument that Kanney had a particular vulnerability to suicide are also based upon the intake forms completed by Candelario which showed that Kanney had been the victim of a sexual offense, lacked close friends or family in the community, had recently experienced a significant loss, was worried about major problems, had a history of mental health treatment and was overly anxious, panicked, afraid or angry.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10525731\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/946/1017/#p1023\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10525731\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/946/1017/#p1023\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Pls.'

Plaintiffs also contend that Kanney's particular vulnerability to suicide was evident from a scar on his left wrist from a 2013 apparent suicide attempt with scissors which required sutures to close the wound. The coroner noted in his PostMortem Report that \"[a] well healed, linear, horizontally oriented incision is appreciated across the left wrist. Suture marks are appreciated around the same.\" Dkt. 75, Pls.' Resp., Ex. W, p. 3. Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, we conclude that Plaintiffs have amassed enough facts to warrant sending the case to a jury to\n   decide whether there was a strong likelihood that \"self-inflicted harm would occur.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Under the second and third prongs required to establish liability under \u00a7 1983 in prison suicide cases, that custodial officer or officers knew or should have known of the vulnerability to suicide, and that those officers \"acted with reckless indifference\" to the detainee's particular vulnerability, Plaintiffs must point to evidence establishing that each Defendant knew or should have known of Kanney's particular vulnerability to suicide and acted with deliberate indifference to the vulnerability. According to the Third Circuit, an official \"knew\" of a vulnerability if they \"have had actual knowledge of an obvious suicide threat, a history of suicide attempts, or a psychiatric diagnosis identifying suicidal propensities.\"\n   <em>\n    Keohane v.

We analyze these standards with respect to the four remaining Defendants who were involved with Kanney's intake and treatment, Jade Fritsch, Jaycees Candelario, Katie Neimer and Bonnie Bair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <em>\n    a. Jade Fritsch\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Medical Assistant Jade Fritsch performed a rapid medical screening of Kanney following his initial screening by LCP staff. The \"rapid screen\" indicated that Kanney brought two medications into the prison with him, that his pulse was elevated, that he would be withdrawing from heroin and Xanax, and that he had last used 5 bags of heroin that morning. Dkt. 58, Ex. K, Fritsch Dep., pp. 23-29, 30-36. Ms. Fritsch estimated that the overall time she spent with Kanney that afternoon was no longer than 5 minutes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 21. She took his vital signs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23. After an intern took Kanney's pulse rate of 128, Ms. Fritsch took his pulse again and determined it to be 100.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-35, 41-42. She recalled manually checking Kanney's pulse, but could not remember any scarring on his wrist.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42. She testified that if she had seen scarring on his wrist, she would have thought of a prior suicide and she \"definitely would have questioned it...and probably would have had a mental health [employee] talk to him...anyone that was available [in mental health].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42-3. The extent of Plaintiffs' argument against Ms. Fritsch is that she knew that Kanney was withdrawing from heroin and Xanax and should have put him automatically on suicide watch instead of detox watch. As stated above, Plaintiffs cannot use Kanney's drug withdrawal as a basis for any deliberate indifference claim, therefore the \u00a7 1983 claim for deliberate indifference against Ms. Fritsch lacks merit and summary judgment will be entered in her favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    b. Jaycees Candelario, Katie Neimer and Bonnie Bair\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Medical Assistant Jaycees Candelario electronically completed several forms including a Mental Health Screen for Men, a Receiving Screening and Health Assessment Form, and an Intake Suicide Screen. Dkt. 58, Ex. H, Candelario Dep., pp. 17-19. The Intake Suicide Screening page stated that \"[i]f the patient scores 8 or more, a Suicide Watch will be initiated.\" Dkt. 58, Ex. Y, p. 1. Kanney answered yes to five questions and a Suicide Watch was not automatically initiated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2. On the Receiving Screening and Health Assessment Form, Kanney indicated that he was addicted to heroin and Xanax and used both drugs the day before entering LCP.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Kanney also indicated that he had not previously tried to commit suicide and that he was not presently suicidal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. On the Mental Health Screen for Men, Kanney answered \"yes\" to nine of twelve questions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. According to the Mental Health Screen for Men, if a detainee\n   answered \"yes\" to 6 or more questions, then the detainee should be referred for further mental health evaluation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In the comments section of Kanney's Mental Health Screen for Men, Ms. Candelario indicated that Kanney should be \"re evaluate[d].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   On the Intake Suicide Screen form, Question 17 asks a two part question, whether Kanney appeared under the influence of drugs and whether Kanney was showing signs of withdrawal. Ms. Candelario marked the first part of Question 17 as \"no.\" A \"yes\" answer to the second part of the question is worth 8 points, and one of the PrimeCare employees testified that 8 points automatically places someone on suicide watch. Dkt. 75, Ex. II, Carvajal Dep., p. 24. Ms. Candelario admitted that based on Kanney's response to questions regarding his use of and addiction to heroin, she should have done another visual assessment of Kanney to determine whether her answer to Question 17 was correct, but she failed to do so. Dkt. 75, Ex. H, Candelario Dep., p. 42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Question 10 on the Intake Suicide Screen form asked whether Kanney had \"attempted suicide previously.\" Following the question, there is a parenthetical stating \"( [c]heck wrist and note method).\" Dkt. 75, Ex. H, Candelario Dep., p. 28. Ms. Candelario testified that only if the detainee affirmatively answered that they had previously attempted suicide, she would \"check the [wrist].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Adding, \"I would check any other parts if given permission to. I would contact my charge nurses and state, you know, patient has some markings on their bodies. Can you re-evaluate them, check them just to make sure they're going to be all right.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Kanney responded to Question 10 that he had not previously attempted suicide and Ms. Candelario did not remember looking at Kanney's wrists and does not know if he had any scarring on his wrists.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ms. Candelario's action in not checking an inmate's wrist unless he acknowledged a previous suicide attempt contrasts with the testimony of both Erica Carvajal, who stated that if an inmate denied suicide attempts, she would check their wrists because that directive \"was on the form,\" and also Nicole Smith, who would also check the inmate's wrist \"for marks of cutting or any attempts of trying to harm themselves\" regardless of whether they denied prior suicide attempts. Dkt. 75, Ex. II, Carvajal Dep., p. 22; Ex. JJ, Smith Dep., p. 25. Ms. Smith checked Kanney's TB test on his forearm on April 21, 2014, and did not recall seeing any scarring on Kanney's wrist. Dkt. 75, Ex. JJ, Smith Dep., p. 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   On the Receiving Screening and Health Assessment Form, question one under the subsection for Psychiatric Problems asks \"[d]oes the patient's behavior, history or physical appearance suggest the risk of suicide, assault or psychiatric condition.\" Dkt. 58, Ex. Y, p. 6. Ms. Candelario answered \"no.\"\n   <em>\n    Id;\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 75, Ex. H, Candelario Dep., p. 44. Four questions later on the same form, asks \"Have you ever been a victim from a criminal act? If yes What?\" Ms. Candelario indicated \"yes\" and in the comments wrote \"Patient states being assaulted and robbed, molested as a child.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7; Dkt. 75, Ex. H, Candelario Dep., p. 46. In the next section of the form, under \"Special Needs/PREA,\" a question is asked \"Have you ever been a victim of a sexual and/or violent crime? If yes; what?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ms. Candelario checked the box \"no.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.;\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 75, Ex. H, Candelario Dep., p. 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Katherine (\"Katie\") Neimer, a Registered Nurse, reviewed the intake forms completed by Ms. Candelario. Dkt. 75, Ex. J, Neimer Dep., p. 19. She agreed with Ms. Candelario's completion of the forms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She called for orders of Kanney's medicines, including Vistaril and Wellbutrin.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At the time of her deposition, she did not\n   recall noticing any inconsistencies between the responses given by Kanney and recorded by Ms. Candelario.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28. She relied on the information that Ms. Candelario provided to be accurate and agreed that if Ms. Candelario did not check Kanney's wrists that his suicide risk score could be lowered.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   On April 21, 2014, PrimeCare Medical Staff received a Sick Call Request from Kanney. Dkt. 58, Ex. EE, p.1. On the handwritten form, Kanney indicated that he was hearing strange voices and was overly stressed out.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In response to his Sick Call Request, Bonnie Bair, a PrimeCare Mental Health Caseworker, conducted an assessment of Kanney that morning. Dkt. 58, Ex. I, Bair Dep., pp. 22-27. Ms. Bair would have reviewed Ms. Candelario's notes from April 19, 2014 on April 21, 2014, the day that she saw Kanney and would have taken note of any inconsistencies between the Inmate Screening Form and the Mental Health Screen for Men. Dkt. 75, Ex. I, Bair Dep., pp. 18, 19, 47. At her deposition, Ms. Bair did not recall reading any information about Kanney being molested as a child, but stated that she \"would assess for suicidality after reading that. I'm not saying it makes them a higher risk.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20. Ms. Bair did not recall seeing any scarring on Kanney's wrists. Id. at 17. Ms. Bair asked Kanney numerous questions about his symptoms and mental health history.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41-53. Kanney complained of hearing voices and seeing little people.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43. It did not appear to Ms. Bair that Kanney was actually hearing voices or seeing things because someone who was actually hearing and seeing things would present as distracted due to listening to voices and have moods.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43, 68. Kanney did not know what the voices were saying.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64. Ms. Bair stated that seeing little people could possibly be a sign of hallucinating which could be a symptom of a mental health disorder or withdrawal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43. Ms. Bair completed a Mental Health Assessment Form based upon questions she posed to Kanney.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Ms. Bair stated that she did not recall specifically asking Kanney if he ever tried to hurt himself, if he felt like hurting himself at that time, or if he had a history of any kind of cutting mutilation, but it was her routine to ask those three questions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50. If Kanney's response was affirmative, Ms. Bair would have checked a \"yes\" box on the Mental Health Assessment Form, but she did not do so, which indicates that Kanney denied all three questions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Following her examination, Ms. Bair recommended that sick call requests should be completed as needed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at. 53-54. Ms. Bair indicated that Kanney's mood was neutral and that he denied suicidal ideation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56-58. Ms. Bair also recommended that Kanney should be evaluated by a psychiatrist in one week due to his medications and his status as detoxing, and she informed Kanney that if he wanted to see anyone from Mental Health to discuss issues or problems or talk, all he had to do was submit a Sick Call request.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58-59, 61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   We find that issues of material fact exist as to whether it was obvious that Ms. Candelario should have known that Kanney had a particular vulnerability to suicide based on her intake of Kanney including whether she was required to check Kanney's wrists for scars after he indicated that he had never previously attempted suicide and whether the contradictory responses contained in the intake forms should have alerted her to place Kanney on suicide watch. It is also disputed whether Ms. Candelario was aware of Kanney's other suicide risk factors but still completed the intake forms improperly and ignored those risks and also whether all of these actions by Ms. Candelario could enable a jury to find that she acted\n   with reckless indifference. Based on these issues of fact and Ms. Neimer's and Ms. Bair's actions in reviewing the intake forms completed by Ms. Candelario, there are also material questions of fact as to whether Ms. Neimer and Ms. Bair acted with reckless indifference. A jury might conclude that Ms. Neimer and Ms. Bair did not conduct a thorough review of the intake forms and the various inconsistencies contained therein which may have thwarted Kanney's placement on suicide watch. Accordingly, Plaintiffs \u00a7 1983 claims against PrimeCare, Ms. Candelario, Ms. Neimer, and Ms. Bair survive summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

However, even assuming that Warden Molyneaux was the final policy making official, Plaintiffs have not presented evidence that he had knowledge of the alleged breaches of the suicide screening and monitoring procedures either in the case of Kanney or at any point prior to Kanney's suicide. Nor have Plaintiffs presented sufficient evidence that Lancaster County's policy making officials had constructive notice of the alleged breaches.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Plaintiffs have not cited to any evidence regarding how many suicide screening forms were improperly filled out or how many inmates previously locked themselves in restrooms for a lengthy period. While Plaintiffs have produced some evidence concerning the overall number of suicides that occurred at LCP between 1998 and Kanney's suicide, a close examination of the documents reveals that the circumstances surrounding these suicides vary greatly. Dkt. 63, Ex. KK; Dkt. 63, Ex. U. Of the seven Mortality Reviews provided by Plaintiff, none involve a situation where an inmate committed suicide in a locked restroom and two involve a situation where an inmate jumped to his death. Dkt. 63, Ex. KK.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Two of the records produced by Plaintiff require more thorough explanation and review. The Mortality Review of a 2011 suicide reveals that two medical providers, who were not involved with Kanney's screening, failed to properly and consistently fill out his suicide screening forms. Dkt. 63, Ex. KK. This 2011 Mortality Review recommended that the intake screening procedures be reviewed and that medical personnel review the screening forms completed by officers. Dkt. 63, Ex. KK. Following this isolated incident, over eighteen months passed without a suicide. The Mortality Review of a 2013 suicide, the last before Kanney's, reveals that the intake screenings were conducted in public and that the Mental Health Assessment and Mental Status Exam were not conducted at the appropriate time by Bonnie Bair, a defendant in this action. Dkt. 63, Ex. KK. The 2013 Mortality Review recommended that intakes be conducted in a private area and that mental health staff review how to conduct mental health assessments. Dkt. 63, Ex. KK. Nearly one year lapsed between the 2013 suicide and Kanney's suicide in April 2014.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    The Court finds that although Plaintiffs have produced evidence of two prior instances\n    where suicide screening processes may have been improperly followed, this evidence is insufficient to demonstrate that there was a pattern or custom of individuals improperly filling out the paperwork because of the temporal isolation of the incidents. The Court specifically notes that following both of these suicides, recommendations were made for corrective action, and LCP operated without incident for months. The 2011 suicide occurred prior to Warden Molyneaux's tenure as Warden and involved medical personnel not involved in the instant action. Plaintiffs have not presented evidence that Warden Molyneaux had knowledge of the alleged breaches by the medical personnel involved in the 2011 suicide. Plaintiffs have also not presented evidence that the medical personnel involved in the 2011 suicide made repeated errors when completing the suicide screening forms or that Lancaster County was aware of any repeated errors. While the 2013 suicide occurred during Warden Molyneaux's tenure as Warden, the screening issue in that case concerned the time and manner in which the mental health screening forms were completed, not inconsistencies with the answers given on the forms. The 2013 Mortality Review recommended that \"burst\" training in suicide prevention be given to staff, that more privacy be afforded during the intake screening, and that mental health personnel review the proper way to conduct assessments. Dkt. 63, Ex. KK. Plaintiffs have not produced any evidence to suggest that these corrective actions were not undertaken by Lancaster County.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Further, Plaintiffs have not produced a record of the frequency of alleged breaches sufficient to show that Warden Molyneaux or Lancaster County had actual or constructive knowledge, and acquiesced in the alleged violations of suicide screening and monitoring procedures. Two isolated incidents do not constitute a pattern, policy, or custom of failing to properly train LCP personnel.

Here, at best Plaintiffs may have provided evidence that a few LCP staff did not follow applicable procedures, but Plaintiffs have failed to establish that policymakers knew of or acquiesced in their behavior and made a deliberate decision not to provide training.

Plaintiffs have not produced any evidence to suggest that it is common practice for inmates to lock themselves in restrooms at LCP or that it is common for suicidal inmates, generally, to lock themselves in restrooms for extended periods of time.

Plaintiffs have failed to produce any evidence that other inmates at LCP have previously locked themselves in restrooms or committed suicide by hanging themselves from a clothing hook in a restroom. While the evidence produced by Plaintiffs does establish that the manner of death in some of the prior suicides at LCP was hanging, those inmates hung themselves in their cells. Dkt. 63, Ex. KK. Plaintiffs have produced no evidence that any prior suicide at LCP occurred when an inmate hung himself from a clothing hook located in a restroom or in any other area of the facility. Said\n    another way, Plaintiffs have produced no evidence to show that Lancaster County or Warden Molyneaux were on notice that permitting an inmate who repeatedly denied suicidal ideation to use a locking restroom in the medical unit would likely result in that inmate committing suicide by hanging himself from a clothing hook located in that restroom.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    Accordingly, Lancaster County and Warden Molyneaux are entitled to summary judgment on the \u00a7 1983\n    <em>\n     Monell\n    </em>\n    claims against them in Count II of the Amended Complaint because Plaintiffs have failed to produce evidence sufficient to establish\n    <em>\n     prima facie\n    </em>\n    that Lancaster County or Warden Molyneaux had actual or constructive knowledge, and acquiesced in any alleged violations of suicide screening and monitoring procedures or that he failed to enact needed policies.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    2.\n    <em>\n     PrimeCare\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Plaintiffs assert failure to train and policy or custom\n    <em>\n     Monell\n    </em>\n    claims against PrimeCare at paragraphs 65, 66, 67 and 71 of the Amended Complaint. Plaintiffs specifically claim that PrimeCare: (1) has a policy, custom or practice of failing to provide adequate policies and procedures for identifying and treating persons who are high suicide risks in an effort to save money (Dkt. 21 Am.

Compl., \u00b6 67. Plaintiffs argue that the National Commission on Correctional Health Care (\"NCCHC\") guidelines require that intake suicide screening must be conducted by a qualified mental health professional, citing\n    <em>\n     Barkes v.

PrimeCare notes that the alleged qualified mental health professional requirement is, in fact, not mandated but is merely an allegation by the\n    <em>\n     Barkes\n    </em>\n    plaintiffs in that case. Plaintiffs cannot point to any record evidence supporting the tenet that a qualified mental health professional must conduct intake suicide screening. In fact, the Supreme\n    Court stated in dicta in\n    <em>\n     Taylor v Barkes\n    </em>\n    that \"[n]o decision of this Court establishes a right to the proper implementation of adequate suicide prevention protocols.

Dkt. 75, Ex. Y, Candelario Dep., pp. 8, 9, 10, 11, 14. Plaintiffs may have pointed to sufficient evidence that Ms. Candelario failed to properly administer the screening intake forms and that Ms. Neimer and Ms. Bair did not properly review those forms. However, individual violations of PrimeCare procedures do not constitute \"policy\" and may only constitute \"custom\" when such procedures are violated with such widespread frequency that policy making officials have either actual or constructive notice and acquiesced in the \"custom.\"\n    <em>\n     Berg\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11192474\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/219/261/#p276\">\n     219 F.3d at 276\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Plaintiffs have not cited to any evidence regarding how many suicide screening forms were improperly filled out or how many inmates previously locked themselves in restrooms for a lengthy period. Moreover, as previously stated, while Plaintiffs have produced some evidence concerning the overall number of suicides that occurred at LCP between 1998 and Kanney's suicide, a close examination of the documents reveals that the circumstances surrounding these suicides vary greatly. Dkt. 63, Ex. KK; Dkt. 63, Ex. U. Of the seven Mortality Reviews provided by Plaintiff, none involve a situation where an inmate committed suicide in a locked restroom and two involve a situation where an inmate jumped to his death. Dkt. 63, Ex. KK.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Two of the records produced by Plaintiff require more thorough explanation and review. The Mortality Review of Mr. Snyder's 2011 suicide reveals that two medical providers, who were not involved with Kanney's screening, failed to properly and consistently fill out his suicide screening forms. Dkt. 63, Ex. KK. This 2011 Mortality Review recommended that the intake screening procedures be reviewed and that medical personnel review the screening forms completed by officers. Dkt. 63, Ex. KK. Following this isolated incident, over eighteen months passed without a suicide. The Mortality Review of Mr. Wisniewski's 2013 suicide, the last before Kanney's, reveals that the intake screenings were conducted in public and that the Mental Health Assessment and Mental Status Exam were not conducted at the appropriate time by Bonnie Bair, a defendant in this action. Dkt. 63, Ex. KK. The 2013 Mortality Review recommended that intakes be conducted in a private area and that mental health staff review how to conduct mental health assessments. Dkt. 63, Ex. KK. Nearly one year lapsed between the 2013 suicide and Kanney's suicide in April 2014.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    The Court finds that although Plaintiffs have produced evidence of two prior instances where suicide screening processes may have been improperly followed, this evidence is insufficient to demonstrate that there was a pattern or custom of individuals improperly filling out the paperwork because of the temporal isolation of the incidents. The Court specifically notes that following both of these suicides, recommendations were made for corrective action, and LCP operated without incident for months. The 2011 suicide involved medical personnel not involved in the instant action. Plaintiffs have not presented evidence\n    that the medical personnel involved in the 2011 suicide made repeated errors when completing the suicide screening forms. The screening issue in the 2013 suicide concerned the time and manner in which the mental health screening forms were completed, but not inconsistencies with the answers given on the forms. The 2013 Mortality Review recommended that \"burst\" training in suicide prevention be given to staff, that more privacy be afforded during the intake screening, and that mental health personnel review the proper way to conduct assessments. Dkt. 63, Ex. KK. Plaintiffs have not produced any evidence to suggest that these corrective actions were not undertaken by either Lancaster County or PrimeCare.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Two isolated incidents do not constitute a pattern, policy, or custom of failing to properly train PrimeCare personnel.

Here, at best Plaintiffs may have provided evidence that a few PrimeCare staff did not follow applicable procedures, but Plaintiffs have failed to establish that policymakers knew of or acquiesced in their behavior and made a deliberate decision not to provide training. To the contrary, the evidence suggests that LCP and PrimeCare engaged in a process of policy evaluation and corrective action, contacted an outside consultant to evaluate procedures, and provided suicide training to all staff.

White, Ph.D. Further, PrimeCare contends that \"the treatment protocol set forth in the PrimeCare suicide prevention policy did not apply to Kanney because he was assessed as non-suicidal based upon his statements of non-suicidality and non-suicidal behavior.\" Dkt. 51, PrimeCare Br., p. 17.

Accordingly, to the extent Plaintiffs' wrongful death and survival action claims in Counts IV and V of the Amended Complaint are based on \u00a7 1983 violations, Defendants Lancaster County, Warden Molyneaux, Sergeant Maldonado, Officer Miller, and Officer Phillips are entitled to summary judgment on those claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    As previously noted, Plaintiffs' also assert wrongful death and survival actions based on Pennsylvania state law against Defendants Lancaster County, Warden\n    Molyneaux, Sergeant Maldonado, Officer Miller, and Officer Phillips. Dkt. 21, Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 75-78. The general provision with respect to governmental immunity dictates that:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n    Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, no local agency shall be liable for any damage on account of any injury to a person or property caused by any act of the local agency or any employee thereof or any other person.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 8541. In order for a claim to be maintained against a local agency, two conditions must first be met. First, the damages sought in the present suit must be recoverable under the common law, or a statute creating a cause of action absent the defenses provided in the act; and second, that Plaintiff's injury \"was caused by the negligent acts of the local agency or employee thereof acting within the scope of his office or duties with respect to one of the categories listed in subsection (d).\" 42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 8542(a).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    Section 8542(b) provides that a local governmental agency is immune from any suit based upon the negligent acts of the agency or employee, unless the cause of action relates to one of eight categories. The eight enumerated exceptions to immunity are: (1) vehicle liability; (2) the care, custody or control of personal property; (3) the care, custody or control of real property; (4) trees, traffic controls and street lighting; (5) utility service facilities; (6) streets; (7) sidewalks; or (8) the care, custody or control of animals. 42 Pa.

Defendants Lancaster County, Warden Molyneaux, and Sergeant Maldonado contend that none of the exceptions apply in the present case and that Plaintiffs' claims against Lancaster County are barred. Dkt. 54, p. 17-18. Moreover, Defendants contend that because \"the liability of local agency employees cannot exceed the liability of their employing agency,\" then Warden Molyneaux and Sergeant Maldonado also cannot be liable.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 8545.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    Because none of narrowly construed exceptions to the PTSCA apply in this case, Plaintiffs' wrongful death and survival actions based on Pennsylvania state law are barred against Lancaster County, Warden Molyneaux, and Sergeant Maldonado. Although Officers Miller and Phillips did not move for summary judgment of these Pennsylvania wrongful death and survival actions, perhaps because they argued that they are qualifiedly immune from suit in this case, the claims against both Officer Miller and Officer Phillips are also barred by the PSTCA because they were also Lancaster County employees. Dkt. 54, p. 9 n.1. Thus, Defendants Lancaster County, Warden Molyneaux, Sergeant Maldonado, Officer Miller, and Officer Phillips are entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiffs' Pennsylvania state law wrongful death and survival action claims in Counts IV and V of the Amended Complaint.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    <strong>\n     E.
