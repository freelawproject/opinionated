TITUS, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This is a case about a bank behaving badly. Virginia Commerce Bank (\"VCB\"), later merged into Plaintiff United Bank (\"United Bank\"), made substantial loans to Defendants' father, John D. Buckingham, Sr. (\"John\") and John's company, Sun Control Systems, Inc. (\"SCS\"). In May of 2009, after the borrowers defaulted, VCB entered into a Forbearance Agreement with John and others that ultimately did not help. During that time, John was diagnosed with dementia and became incompetent. VCB knew of John's incapacity, and its lawyer even advised it to avoid dealings with John because of his incapacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Nevertheless, in a desperate effort to recover the millions of dollars that otherwise might be lost, VCB \"negotiated\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   a Second Amended Forbearance Agreement (\"Second Amendment\"), which assigned to VCB as additional collateral a security interest in certain life insurance policies. VCB had Thomas Buckingham (\"Thomas\"), one of John's sons and the then-acting president of SCS, obtain John's signature to the Second Amendment and to the assignment of the life insurance policies to VCB. Thomas did so, but forged some of John's signatures to complete the transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In state court litigation related to this case, Judge Joseph A. Dugan, of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Maryland, found the Second Amendment void because of VCB's misconduct in negotiating with a man it knew to lack capacity and in acquiring forged signatures. Judge Dugan's findings prevented VCB from directly obtaining the money it had attempted to recover through the purported assignments in the Second Amendment. Now, United Bank, VCB's successor by merger, attempts to recover that same money through the legal gymnastics of this lawsuit. The laws of equity, however, prevent United Bank from collecting money with hands made unclean by the grossly inequitable conduct of its predecessor. For that reason, as well as for reasons under applicable law, the Court will grant Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment and deny United Bank's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This opinion brings to an end an almost six-year dispute over the rights to the proceeds of eight life insurance policies covering John's life. Having been rebuffed\n   by the Circuit Court for Montgomery County in its wrongful efforts to reach the policies through a transaction with a borrower known to be incompetent, United Bank now seeks to obtain the same result by challenging certain transactions executed by Defendant David T. Buckingham (\"David\"), one of John's sons, in his capacity as John's guardian.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    The Insurance Policies\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The insurance policies can be categorized into three groups. The first group contains two policies that John purchased from Northwestern Mutual and for which he paid the premiums directly (collectively, the \"JDB policies\"). ECF No. 120-1 at 5. The second group contains four policies that SCS purchased from Northwestern Mutual as an employment benefit for John.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5. As the owner of these policies, and pursuant to an Ownership Agreement between John, SCS, and Northwestern Mutual, SCS paid the policy premiums, but John designated the beneficiaries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5; ECF No. 120-5. When John died, SCS would recover up to the amount of premiums paid, and John's designated beneficiary would receive the rest (collectively, the \"split dollar policies\"). ECF No. 120-5. The third group contains two policies that SCS purchased from John Hancock Life Insurance Company, also as an employee benefit for John and for which it paid the policy premiums on John's behalf. ECF No. 120-1 at 5. Pursuant to an agreement between SCS and John, SCS would recover the premiums that it paid from the policies' death benefits, and the beneficiary designated by John would recover the remaining balance (collectively, the \"John Hancock policies\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; ECF No. 120-15 at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    John's Dementia and SCS's Decline\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   John's initial diagnosis of dementia came in 2008, which was confirmed as frontotemporal dementia in 2009. ECF No. 120-1 at 5; ECF No. 120-11 at 18. Despite his diagnosis, John was never removed or replaced on the board of SCS. ECF No. 120-1 at 5. While John battled dementia, SCS's business struggled.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. By 2009, SCS was in default on debts it owed to VCB.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   VCB had loaned SCS money, sometimes requiring John and Elizabeth Buckingham (\"Betty\"), John's wife, to guarantee the loans.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   VCB had also loaned John and Betty money in their personal capacities through a home equity line of credit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In May 2009, SCS and VCB entered into a Forbearance Agreement pursuant to which VCB agreed not to enforce certain security interests and to loan SCS additional money if SCS met a specified schedule of payments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7; ECF No. 120-18 at 3. John, Betty, and Thomas, who was SCS's acting president, were also parties to the Forbearance Agreement. ECF No. 120-1 at 7. SCS's economic condition did not improve, and by early 2010, it had defaulted on the Forbearance Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; ECF No. 120-18 at 4; ECF No. 141-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    The Second Amended Forbearance Agreement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In June 2010, while John was battling dementia, VCB prepared a Second Amended Forbearance Agreement with SCS. ECF No. 120-1 at 7; ECF No. 120-17 (Second Amendment to Forbearance Agreement). By that time, VCB had lost more than $5 million in just principal on the loans provided to SCS and John, making its current loss over $8 million including accrued interest, cost, and fees. Hr'g Tr. 3:13:00-13:35 (Nov. 27, 2017). When the company finally effectively went out of business, the only potential assets that were of any value were the disputed life insurance policies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   3:13:50-14:13. As stated by United Bank at the summary judgment hearing, the policies collectively had a \"value of several million dollars\" upon John's death.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   3:14:15-14:25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Second Amendment assigned a security interest in the JDB and split dollar\n   policies, including the death benefits under those policies, to VCB. ECF No. 120-1 at 8; ECF No. 120-17 at 9. When it was executed, however, VCB knew of John's dementia. ECF No. 120-11 at 28-41. VCB had been told by David and Thomas, as well as through medical reports shared with VCB, that John was suffering from very serious dementia and had only months to live.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, VCB's own experience with John's diminished capacity had led it to refuse to communicate with John.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   VCB's outside counsel even recommended that it ask for John to undergo a medical evaluation to determine his competency.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, VCB elected not to follow this advice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When the Second Amendment was executed, VCB's counsel did not communicate with John and Betty regarding the transaction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. Instead, VCB asked Thomas to collect the necessary signatures, which he did.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Some of those signatures for John, however, were found by Judge Dugan to have been forged.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Petition for Guardianship of John\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In August 2010, two months after the Second Amendment was executed, Betty filed a petition for guardianship of her husband. ECF No. 120-1 at 6. In October 2010, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County appointed David guardian of his father's property and co-guardian, with Betty, of his father's person. ECF No. 120-2. In December 2010, the order was amended to make Betty the temporary guardian of John's person and David the temporary guardian of his father's property. ECF No. 120-3. In January 2011, the court issued a final order appointing David guardian of his father's property and co-guardian, with Betty, of his father's person. ECF No. 120-4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   David did not learn of the Second Amendment until February 2011. ECF No. 120-1 at 6. In March 2011, David changed the beneficiary designations of the eight life insurance policies from Betty, or his father's estate in one instance and a prospective testamentary trust in another, to a newly created John D. Buckingham Life Insurance Trust (\"JDB Life Insurance Trust\") for the purpose of funding the support and care of John and Betty.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9; ECF No. 141-12. Betty was the primary beneficiary of the JDB Life Insurance Trust, and the Buckingham children were made contingent beneficiaries who would receive the remaining balance of the trust after the death of both parents. ECF No. 120-1 at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   United Bank claims that SCS retained the power to change the policy beneficiaries, despite the status of the John Hancock policies as split dollar policies, and that John's designation of his wife, Betty, as the secondary beneficiary was done in John's capacity as president of SCS. ECF No. 141-1 at 4. As such, United Bank argues that SCS was the alternate beneficiary of the split dollar and John Hancock policies and John's estate was the alternate beneficiary of the JDB policies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4. Therefore, it contends, but for David's actions changing the beneficiary designations, SCS and John's estate would have been the beneficiaries of the policies at John's death, and thus the proceeds were diverted away from SCS's and John's creditors. Hr'g Tr. 4:14:25-4:15:10 (Nov. 27, 2017);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 141-1 at 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    The John Hancock Policies and the Osprey Trust\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As the cost of managing John's illness increased, David prepared an application\n   for accelerated death benefits on the John Hancock policies, \"to provide funds for his mother's support and meet the extraordinary cost of John's care.\" ECF No. 120-1 at 9. Eventually, an agreement was made between SCS (which had stopped paying the premiums on the John Hancock policies) and David to sell the policies to John, through David as guardian.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10. In November 2011, David created the Osprey Trust, which was empowered to seek accelerated death benefits on the John Hancock policies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. The directors of SCS-John, acting through David as his guardian, Betty, and Thomas-voted to sell the John Hancock policies to the Osprey Trust for $110,000, the value determined by John Hancock pursuant to an IRS formula.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; ECF No. 120-7. When the sale was complete, David paid the overdue premiums to reinstate the policies and restore the death benefits. ECF No. 120-1 at 10. David then, as John's guardian and trustee of the Osprey Trust, requested accelerated death benefits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He continued, in his role as Osprey Trust trustee, to pay the policy premiums as they became due for the remainder of John's life.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    The JDB and Split Dollar Policies and the Blue Heron Trust\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On December 7, 2011, Betty unexpectedly died before John.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Because the JDB Life Insurance Trust had been established to provide funds for Betty's support in the expectation that John would predecease her, David, acting as John's guardian, changed the beneficiary of the JDB and split dollar policies from the now-outdated JDB Life Insurance Trust to the newly-created Blue Heron Trust.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; ECF No. 141-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    The Montgomery County Litigation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   During 2011, after finding out about the Second Amendment, David decided to challenge the validity of the assignments of the JDB and the split dollar policies based on John's mental incompetency. ECF No. 120-1 at 11. In May 2012, David, as John's guardian, filed suit against VCB in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County seeking a declaratory judgment voiding the Second Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A five-day bench trial took place in November 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Ultimately Judge Dugan found that (1) VCB had been told in early 2010 that John was suffering from advanced dementia, (2) VCB's counsel had suggested that VCB ask John to undergo a medical examination before signing any legal documents, and (3) VCB ignored its counsel's advice and obtained John's signature on the Second Amendment. ECF No. 120-11 at 38-41; ECF No. 120-12. Based on this evidence and expert testimony from physicians who examined John in 2009 and 2010, Judge Dugan held that by May 2010 John was not able to understand legal documents, was not mentally or legally competent, and that VCB had been aware of John's incapacity in advance of the Second Amendment transaction. ECF No. 120-11 at 38-41; ECF No. 120-12 at 3-5. Judge Dugan also found, and VCB did not dispute, that some of John's signatures had been forged on the Second Amendment. ECF No. 120-11 at 42; ECF No. 120-12 at 3-4. Accordingly, Judge Dugan declared the Second Amended Forbearance Agreement void. ECF No. 120-11 at 41; ECF No. 120-12 at 3-5. As such, the assignments of the JDB and split dollar policies to VCB were void.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 120-12 at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Payment of the Death Benefits Under the Policies\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On October 17, 2012, John died. ECF No. 120-1 at 12. Northwestern Mutual paid the death benefits on the split dollar policies to the Blue Heron Trust, in accordance with the Ownership Agreements, and paid the death benefits of the JDB policies, totaling $1,036,453.14, into the registry of the Circuit Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; ECF No. 120-14. Amounts received as accelerated death benefits on the two John Hancock policies were repaid by deduction from the death benefits in accordance with the policy terms. ECF No. 120-1 at 12. All amounts borrowed against the cash value of the split dollar policies by SCS were repaid by deduction from the death benefits in accordance with the ownership agreements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; ECF No. 120-14. Because SCS had borrowed more on the split dollar policies than it had paid in premiums, there were no proceeds to be paid to VCB from SCS's ownership of the split dollar policies. ECF No. 120-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On October 30, 2013, VCB filed the original Complaint in this case against David, individually and in his capacity as trustee of the Osprey Trust and the Blue Heron Trust, Susan Buckingham (\"Susan\"), David's sister, individually and as personal representative of John's estate, and Richard Buckingham, David's brother, individually and as personal representative of John's estate (collectively, the \"Defendants\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECF No. 1. On August 18, 2017, United Bank, as VCB's successor by merger, filed a Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\"). ECF No. 126. The SAC contains eight counts: (1) Count I alleges a violation of the Maryland Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act (\"MUFCA\"), Md. Code Ann., Com. Law, \u00a7\u00a7 15-201\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , for the transfer of ownership and beneficiary interest in the John Hancock policies; (2) Counts II-V allege violations of the MUFCA for changes in the beneficiary designations of all of the policies; (3) Count VI alleges self-dealing by David regarding all of the policies; and (4) Counts VII and VIII seek declaratory judgment that David's creation of the Osprey Trust and Blue Heron Trust was invalid and the transfers of the policy interests to those trusts were void\n   <em>\n    ab initio.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On July 31, 2017 and September 8, 2017, David and Susan filed Motions for Summary Judgment (ECF Nos. 120, 121, 137) that are now before this Court for decision. On September 29, 2017, United Bank filed its Response to Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment and its own Motion for Summary Judgment. ECF No. 141. Defendants filed their Response to United Bank's Motion for Summary Judgment and their Reply to United Bank's Response to their Motions for Summary Judgment on October 13, 2017. ECF No. 144. United Bank filed its Reply to Defendants' Opposition to its Motion for Summary Judgment on October 27, 2017. ECF No. 146.

Here, the nexus between the misconduct and the transaction is that they both concern the proceeds of the disputed life insurance policies. In\n   <em>\n    Mona\n   </em>\n   , as here, the plaintiffs tried to collect the disputed money through inequitable conduct. The fact that United Bank is now asserting its claim to the money as an unsecured creditor (and is thus not using the rights the Second Amendment would have provided to it had it not been invalidated) does not alter the analysis. There is no material dispute of fact that the subject matter and the result desired are the same now as they were in 2011. The very reason United Bank initiated this lawsuit is because the Second Amendment was deemed void by the Circuit Court, and thus VCB could not reach the disputed insurance policies. This Court cannot ignore VCB's previous inequitable conduct in its effort to reach the same insurance proceeds and now allow its successor by merger, United Bank, to recover as to the same subject matter in the\n   wake of that misconduct. By way of protecting its judicial integrity, the Court will therefore apply the unclean hands doctrine to bar United Bank's recovery in this case. Accordingly, the Court will grant summary judgment for Defendants on all counts. However, even if the unclean hands doctrine did not apply in this case, Defendants would still prevail under applicable law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    5.

ECF No. 120-15. Accordingly, at the time before the policies were sold in October 2011, United Bank would have been entitled to $280,000-presumably the amount SCS paid in premiums, although that amount alleged in the SAC is not substantiated by evidence in the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 126, \u00b6 42.

Yet, as David points out, the Consent Order says nothing about paying insurance premiums and, regardless, the Consent Order was set to expire no later than March 2011.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20Com.%20Law%20%C2%A7%2015-204\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 141-30, \u00b6 11. Furthermore, documents from John Hancock show that SCS had stopped paying the policy premiums before December 2010 and that both policies had a $0.00 surrender value as of March 2010. ECF No. 141-11. Additionally, David argues, because it was difficult for all the parties to determine the policies' fair market value, it was reasonable to adopt the calculation done by John Hancock, a neutral\n   third party, based on an IRS-approved formula that was used to determine the valuation of the policies as they would be valued as a gift or estate tax. ECF No. 144 at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   United Bank asserts that because the Osprey Trust, upon obtaining ownership of the policies, received in return for the $110,000 \"the right to draw down immediately in cash one half of each policy's total death benefit, which totaled $750,000,\" the fair market value for the policies was significantly closer to $750,000. ECF No. 141-1 at 28. In support it provides a letter to David from John Hancock explaining the amount of reduced death benefits of the two policies, which comes out to be about $709,000. ECF No. 141-24. United Bank also cites to a Tax Court case for support that \"[t]he nearer the insured approaches death, which is the event of collectability, the nearer its value approaches the face amount for which [the policy] was issued.\"\n   <em>\n    Pritchard v.

Therefore, under the circumstances here-SCS had not been paying the policies' premiums, SCS was insolvent, and the policies had a cash surrender value of $0.00-the Court agrees with Defendants' analysis and finds that the $110,000 was a \"fair equivalent\" for the John Hancock policies. Accordingly, even if the unclean hands doctrine does not apply in this case, the Court will grant summary judgment for Defendants as to Count I because the transfer of ownership of the John Hancock policies did not violate the MUFCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

ECF No. 126, \u00b6\u00b6 49-74. The Court, however, need not examine each of the transactions to determine if they were indeed fraudulent under the statute because a change of the designated beneficiary of a life insurance policy does not constitute a \"conveyance\" under the MUFCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Under the MUFCA, a \"conveyance\" is defined as \"includ[ing] every payment of money, assignment, release, transfer, lease, mortgage, or pledge of tangible or intangible property, and also the creation of any lien or incumbrance.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20Com.%20Law%20%C2%A7%2015-201\">\n    Md.

Accordingly, even if the unclean hands doctrine does not\n   apply in this case, the Court will grant summary judgment in favor of Defendants as to Counts II-V because it concludes that a change in a life insurance beneficiary designation is not a \"conveyance\" under the MUFCA, and thus the statute is not applicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    6.

If a corporate director breaches a duty under those circumstances, United Bank asserts that creditors may sue so long as the creditors \"allege and show that they have suffered loss by reason of the wrongs complained of, and that the corporation or receiver has failed or refused to take the proper steps for the redress of the wrong.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30-31 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Pritchard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=197%20A.%20620\">\n    197 A. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   626 ). Given this, United Bank argues that it is at least a dispute of a material fact whether, given SCS's poor economic position at the time of the transfers, David, while acting as a corporate director in his capacity as John's guardian, owed a fiduciary duty to VCB. ECF No. 141-1 at 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    Pritchard\n   </em>\n   's applicability, however, is much narrower than suggested by United Bank.

Although SCS did go through bankruptcy, the analogy fails because the creditors here cannot show that at the time of insolvency \"the corporation or receiver ha[d] failed or refused to take the proper steps for the redress of the wrong,\" which would be a necessary showing for the case to move forward, even assuming a cause of action\n   by a creditor exists. Accordingly, United Bank cannot challenge David's conduct in his role as John's guardian as a violation of a fiduciary duty owed to VCB. As such, the Court will grant summary judgment in favor of Defendants as to Count VI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    7.
