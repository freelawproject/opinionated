Pls.' Mem. Law. Supp. Mot. Class Certification (\"Class Cert. Mot.\") at 4. Plaintiffs later filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, and the Court set a parallel briefing schedule for both that motion and the motion for class certification. Following a period of limited discovery related to issues raised in the motion for a preliminary injunction, the parties completed briefing on both motions. The Court held a hearing on both motions on March 19, 2018. It will now resolve Plaintiffs' pending motion for class certification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) establishes four requirements for certification of a class: (1) numerosity, that \"the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable\"; (2) commonality, that \"there are questions of law or fact common to the class\"; (3) typicality, that \"the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class\"; and (4) adequacy, that \"the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). In addition to meeting these four requirements under Rule 23(a), a putative class must also meet one of the requirements of Rule 23(b). Here, Plaintiffs allege that they meet the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2), that \"the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief ... is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). The party seeking certification bears the burden of persuasion, and must show that the putative classes meet the requirements of Rule 23 by a preponderance of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hoyte v.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The District challenges class certification under both Rule 23(a) and Rule 23(b)(2). Before confronting these challenges, the Court will briefly respond to two threshold arguments the District raises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The District's threshold arguments\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   First, the District contends that class certification is not appropriate because Plaintiffs cannot meet the requirements for a preliminary injunction. Def.'s Opp'n Pls.' Mot. Class Certification (\"Class Cert. Opp'n\") at 7-8; Def.'s Surreply Supp. Opp'n Pls.' Mot. Class Certification (\"Class Cert. Surreply\") at 2-3. The District cites a single case for this proposition:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Hardy v. Fischer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3936408\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/701/614/\">\n    701 F.Supp.2d 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. 2010). But that case in inapposite. In\n   <em>\n    Hardy\n   </em>\n   , the district court ruled that the putative class was not entitled to preliminary injunctive relief because the plaintiffs raised claims that could not be brought under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 622-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court stated that the \"denial of the motion for injunctive relief moot[ed] the motion for certification of an injunctive class.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 617 n.3. But here the District does not argue that Plaintiffs cannot bring injunctive relief claims under the statute at issue; rather, their arguments against the motion for preliminary injunction focus on why Plaintiffs fail to meet the specific requirements for preliminary injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp'n Pls.' Mot. Prelim. Inj.; Def.'s Surreply Supp. Opp'n Pls.' Mot. Prelim. Inj. In any case, even if the Court were to follow the approach taken by the court in\n   <em>\n    Hardy\n   </em>\n   , it would be premature to deny class certification on this ground now because the Court has not yet ruled on the preliminary injunction motion. If the Court were to conclude that Plaintiffs could not obtain any injunctive relief under the statute, it could decertify the class at that juncture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Second, the District argues that class certification is unnecessary because \"the 'injunctive relief sought by the named plaintiffs would benefit all proposed class members.' \" Class Cert Surreply at 3 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Sargent v. Block\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6048970\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/576/882/#p888\">\n    576 F.Supp. 882\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 888 (D.D.C. 1983) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Class Cert. Opp'n at 7. This is a somewhat odd position for the District to take: it later argues, as the Court will discuss, that a single injunction\n   <em>\n    would not\n   </em>\n   remedy the harms for all class members.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Class Cert Opp'n at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   This argument is unpersuasive in any event. The Court has an obligation to ensure that any injunction it issues is \"narrowly tailored to remedy the specific harm shown.\"\n   <em>\n    Nev. Dep't of Health &amp; Human Servs. v. U.S. Dep't of Health &amp; Human Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3451649,936347\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/435/326/\">\n    435 F.3d 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 330 (D.C. Cir. 2006). To the extent that the named plaintiffs show that\n   <em>\n    they\n   </em>\n   are individually harmed, the Court could issue an injunction narrowly tailored to\n   <em>\n    them\n   </em>\n   individually-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , directing the District to process their specific applications or issue their specific recertification notices on time-which would provide no relief to the absent class members. Thus, contrary to the District's argument, any injunctive relief issued to the named plaintiffs would not necessarily or automatically benefit the absent class members.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court will therefore turn to the requirements for certification under Rule 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Requirements of Rule 23(a)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The District argues that Plaintiffs fail to show they meet the four requirements for class certification in Rule 23(a). While the District challenges all four requirements, it focuses on commonality and typicality. The Court ultimately concludes that this case is\n   analogous to the D.C. Circuit's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    D.L. II\n   </em>\n   and, as there, Plaintiffs have demonstrated that the requirements of class certification in Rule 23(a) are met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    1. Numerosity\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The first requirement that must be met for class certification is numerosity: that \"the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1). To establish numerosity, a party need not provide a precise number of class members as long as there is a reasonable basis to estimate it.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Howard v. Liquidity Services Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12420058\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/322/103/#p117\">\n    322 F.R.D. 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 117 (D.D.C. 2017). Courts have typically considered a class of at least forty members to presumptively meet the requirement of numerosity.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Barnes v. District of Columbia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5680893\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/242/113/#p121\">\n    242 F.R.D. 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 121 (D.D.C. 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   With respect to Class One-District residents whose applications for SNAP benefits were and will not be processed in a timely manner-numerosity is easily satisfied. Plaintiffs point to the quarterly compliance reports that the District files with the Food and Nutrition Service, known as \"FNS-366B reports.\" According to the most recent such report-which covers the first quarter of the 2018 fiscal year, October to December 2017-the District approved 4,328 applications after the applicable time limit had passed, 367 initial applications and 3,961 recertification applications. Class Cert. Surreply Ex. B. Most, if not all, of these households would be members of the proposed class since their applications were not processed in accordance with the statutory time limits. Thus, even taking just the applications processed after the statutory time limit in one quarter of one fiscal year, Plaintiffs provide a reason to estimate the proposed class number to be in the hundreds, if not thousands. This presumptively satisfies numerosity, and the District offers no rebuttal to that presumption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Turning to Class Two-District residents whose benefits were interrupted because they failed to receive a timely recertification notice-the Court concludes that numerosity is also met. Plaintiffs have similarly provided a basis to conclude that this class number is in the hundreds, if not thousands, as well. For instance, Plaintiffs point out that a vendor's error in June 2017 resulted in 4,500 households failing to receive recertification notices and a significant portion of these households losing benefits. Pls.' Reply Ex. 2 (Deposition of Laura Zeilinger), at 130:11. And according to the FNS-366B reports, the District processes around 9,000 to 10,000 recertification applications every quarter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Class Cert. Surreply Ex. B. (FNS-366B report for first quarter, fiscal year 2018); Decl. of Jennifer Mezey Supp. Pls.' Reply Def.'s Opp'n Pls.' Mot. Prelim. Inj. Ex. P, at 2-4 (FNS-366B reports for second, third, and fourth quarter, fiscal year 2017). Even if just 1% of all the households up for recertification fail to receive notices and lose benefits as a result, the class numbers over 100. This, again, presumptively satisfies numerosity and the District has not rebutted that presumption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    2. Commonality\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Second, the classes must meet the requirement of commonality: that \"there are questions of law or fact common to the class.\" Fed. R. Civ.

Class Cert. Surreply at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The District's argument has a key underlying premise: that the determination of whether a statutory violation occurred depends upon\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   a failure to meet the statutory time limit happened. In other words, the District assumes that even if a particular SNAP application is untimely processed or a particular recertification notice is not sent, that may or may not constitute a statutory violation depending on\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   it happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   But that is not how the statutory scheme works. Determining if there is a statutory violation does not hinge on the reason for any particular failure to adhere to the statutory timelines.

Circuit again rejected a similar argument from the District as here, noting that a single injunction was able to provide relief to each class member, particularly since the district court's order \"d[id] just that.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276282\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/713/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276282\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/713/\">\n    at 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Like the district court in\n   <em>\n    D.L. II\n   </em>\n   , this Court could enter an order requiring the District meet certain levels of compliance with the statutory timelines and requiring improvement. And as in\n   <em>\n    D.L. II\n   </em>\n   , this order would remedy Plaintiffs' injuries. Thus, the requirements of Rule 23(b)(2) are met here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The District's primary argument against class certification-made with slight variations as to the requirements of commonality, typicality, and Rule 23(b)(2) -is that Plaintiffs' claims are too factually diverse and their legal theory too broadly defined to sustain a class action. But the statutory scheme provides the requisite level of\n   specificity: it sets clear timelines for handling SNAP benefit applications and recertification notices and clearly mandates that States follow them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202020\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(3), (9). And Plaintiffs present a single legal theory: the District has systemically failed to comply with the requirements under the statute for processing SNAP benefit applications and issuing recertification notices. Finally, the statute gives no indication that the reason why the District failed to process a particular application or issue a particular recertification notice within the relevant timeframe has any bearing on whether it violated the statute. Consequently, as in the D.C. Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    D.L. II\n   </em>\n   , any factual variations are not fatal to class certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Court's conclusion that the requirements for class certification are met here is further buttressed by the fact that other district courts have certified similar classes in SNAP benefit cases.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Briggs v. Bremby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%201987237\">\n    2013 WL 1987237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (D. Conn. May 13, 2013) (certifying a class of all Connecticut residents whose applications for SNAP benefits were not timely processed);\n   <em>\n    Reynolds v. Giuliani\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11182282\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/118/352/#p392\">\n    118 F.Supp.2d 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 392 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (certifying a class of all New York residents that sought to apply for SNAP benefits in a case alleging, in part, a failure to adhere to the SNAP statutory time frames). This is not surprising: as the D.C. Circuit has stated, \" Rule 23(b)(2) exists so that parties and courts, especially in civil rights cases like this, can avoid piecemeal litigation when common claims arise from systemic harms that demand injunctive relief.\"\n   <em>\n    D.L.

Accordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have demonstrated that their proposed classes meet the requirements for certification and will grant their motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   However, the Court will certify three, rather than two, classes. Because the statutory scheme is slightly different with regards to the processing of recertification as opposed to initial applications, in an abundance of caution and to avoid any possible conflicts of interest the Court will subdivide the first proposed class into two classes: one of residents whose initial applications were not processed on time and one of residents whose recertification applications were not processed on time. The Court may, of course, revisit certification or class definitions as the litigation progresses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, it is hereby\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that [2] Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification is GRANTED.
