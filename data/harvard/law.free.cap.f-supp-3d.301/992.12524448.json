BROWNING, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS MATTER\n   </strong>\n   comes before the Court on the Plaintiffs Jesse Berkey, Aaron Eaton, Joseph Gutierrez, Aurelio Marquez, Rudy Martinez, Paul Matamoros, Clifford Rogers, Harry Williams and Calvin Finch's Motion for Remand to State Court, filed August 15, 2016 (Doc. 329)(\"Motion\"). The Court held a hearing on October 3, 2016. The primary issue issues are: (i) whether the Court should decline to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction and remand to the Eleventh Judicial District Court, County of San Juan, State of New Mexico, the remaining state-law claims of Plaintiffs Jesse Berkey, Aaron Eaton, Joseph Gutierrez, Aurelio Marquez, Rudy Martinez, Clifford Rogers, Harry Williams, and Calvin Finch (\"Remaining Plaintiffs\") against Defendants San Juan Regional Medical Center, San Juan County, the San Juan County Detention Center, and Thomas C. Havel, as well as Plaintiff Jesse Berkey's remaining state claims against Defendant Presbyterian Medical Services, in No. CIV 15-0439; and (ii) whether the Court should remand Plaintiff Paul Matamoros' claims with the rest of the case. The Court concludes that: (i) the remaining Plaintiffs' federal claims in\n   <em>\n    Burkee, et al. v. San Juan County Detention Center, et al.\n   </em>\n   , No. CIV 15-0439, have been dismissed and, therefore, the Court declines to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining Plaintiffs' remaining state-law claims; and (ii) the Court should remand Matamoros' claims with the rest of the case, even though he was not a named party until after the case was removed to federal court. Accordingly, the Court grants the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This case arises from the Plaintiffs' incarcerations at the San Juan County Detention Center in San Juan County, New Mexico.\n   <em>\n    See Burkee, et al. v.

The Plaintiffs assert that they suffered various injuries while incarcerated at the San Juan Detention Center as a result of the County Defendants'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   violations of federal and New Mexico law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Burkee Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 18-153, at 4-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The parties have litigated this case for two years.

The Plaintiffs now move to remand the case to state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     The Motion\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Plaintiffs argue that, because they have stipulated to the dismissal of all of their federal claims, the Court should remand the case to state court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 1. The Plaintiffs indicate that they have agreed with San Juan Regional and with the County Defendants that the Plaintiffs \"will not move for leave to amend their complaint and to re-allege their federal claims and that the dismissals entered by the Court shall be considered by the parties to be dismissal with prejudice.\" Motion at 1. The Plaintiffs argue that \" '[t]he Tenth Circuit has held that district courts should presume to decline jurisdiction over state claims when federal claims no longer remain.' \" Motion at 3 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Young v. City of Albuquerque\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4250457\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/77/1154/#p1185\">\n    77 F.Supp.3d 1154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1185 (D.N.M. 2014) (Browning, J.) ). The Plaintiffs argue that their \"federal claims have all been dismissed and the only remaining claims are state claims.\" Motion at 4. They note that \"quasi-related death cases that were combined for purposes of discovery were mediated in June and July of 2016, with one having settled. Those death cases continue to assert federal claims, whereas these remaining ... plaintiffs do not assert similar federal claims.\" Motion at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   For these reasons, the Remaining Plaintiffs move the Court to remand their remaining state claims against San Juan Regional and the County Defendants, and Berkey's remaining state claims against Presbyterian Medical, to state court. They also note that Matamoros was not named as a plaintiff until after the case was removed to federal court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 4-5. Accordingly, the Plaintiffs ask that, if the Court cannot remand Matamoros' claims to state court, the Court dismiss his claims without prejudice so that he may re-file them in state court. Motion at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     The County Defendants' Response\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The County Defendants respond to the Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response to Motion for Remand for State Court, filed August 25, 2016 (Doc. 338)(\"Response 1\"). The County Defendants ask the Court to \"retain jurisdiction and dismiss the state law claims against the County Defendants with prejudice.\" Response 1 at 1. The County Defendants argue that \"district courts should seek to exercise supplemental jurisdiction in an effort to vindicate values of economy, convenience, fairness, and comity.\" Response 1 at 3 (quoting\n   <em>\n    OneBeacon Am. Ins. Co. v. San Juan Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205934351\">\n    2013 WL 5934351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (D.N.M. 2013) (Browning, J.) ). The County Defendants assert that \"the exercise of jurisdiction is especially appropriate in cases where the parties have expended a great deal of time and energy on the\n   state law claims.\" Response 1 at 4 (citing\n   <em>\n    Anglemyer v. Hamilton Cty. Hosp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7411002\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/58/533/#p541\">\n    58 F.3d 533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 541 (10th Cir. 1995) ). The County Defendants contend that, because they have litigated multiple state issues before the Court, the Court should retain jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response 1 at 5. They add that \"the state law claims do not raise any complex issues under state law.\" Response 1 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     San Juan Regional's Response\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   San Juan Regional filed a separate response.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant SJRMC's Response to Plaintiffs' Motion to Remand to State Court, filed August 30, 2016 (Doc. 339)(\"Response 2\"). San Juan Regional asserts that the \"parties have not reached any agreement about a motion to amend Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint.\" Response 2 at 1. San Juan Regional notes that the \"Plaintiffs have not [filed] a motion to amend, even though Plaintiffs' planned amendment of their Second Amended Complaint has been one of the major themes of their case.\" Response 2 at 2. San Juan Regional contends that the Plaintiffs' assertion that the parties \" 'have agreed that Plaintiffs will not move for leave to amend their complaint to re-allege their federal claims and that the dismissal entered by the Court shall be considered by the parties to be dismissal with prejudice' \" is not true. Response 2 at 3 (quoting Motion at 1). San Juan Regional argues that the parties \"cannot agree on what language would make the dismissal permanent if this Court remands any portion of\n   <em>\n    Berkey\n   </em>\n   .\" Response 2 at 3. \"SJRMC cannot be assured that Plaintiffs will not be allowed to re-allege their federal claims in state or federal court, should they choose to try.\" Response 2 at 3. San Juan Regional posits that \"the Order of Dismissal of the federal claims against SJRMC is an interlocutory order that this Court can reconsider at any time.\" Response 2 at 3. San Juan Regional also argues that, \"[g]iven the Court's familiarity with the procedural history and facts of\n   <em>\n    Berkey\n   </em>\n   , remanding any portion of this case to the state courts, even if only the claims of Plaintiff Matamoros are remanded, would be unduly expensive, inconvenient and unfair to SJRMC.\" Response 2 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     The Reply\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Plaintiffs reply to the Responses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply to Defendant SJRMC's Response to Plaintiff's Motion to Remand to State Court, filed September 9, 2016 (Doc. 352)(\"Reply\"). The Plaintiffs argue that \"the dismissal of the federal claims against SJRMC with prejudice by Court order ... and subsequent withdrawal of Plaintiffs' Motion to Amend Order of Dismissal of All Federal Claims Against San Juan Regional Medical Center ... moots the issue of whether Plaintiffs will further move to amend.\" Reply at 1 (citing Order Dismissing All Federal Claims Against Defendant San Juan Regional Center with Prejudice in 1:15-cv-00439 JB/LF, filed November 17, 2015 (Doc. 97) ). They argue that \"[t]he dismissal of the federal claims with prejudice is an order of the Court.\" Reply at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Plaintiffs contend that the only reason they have not stipulated not to amend their Complaint to re-allege federal claims is because \"counsel could not agree on the language of the stipulated dismissal.\" Reply at 2. The Plaintiffs assert that they \"have repeatedly agreed to dismissal with prejudice as a final order.\" Reply at 2. The Plaintiffs argue that \"the only remaining question is not whether plaintiffs should further amend the complaint, but whether the state law claims should be remanded, which was the point of the Motion.\" Reply at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    5.\n    <em>\n     The Hearing\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Court held a hearing on October 3, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Draft Transcript of Motion Proceeding\n   (taken October 3, 2016)(\"Tr.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Plaintiffs began by saying \"we've effectively now dismissed all federal claims against all of the defendants.\" Tr. at 3:21-23 (Hatfield). The County Defendants noted that, \"they never did file the motion to amend and of course that was one of our arguments that they should not be allowed to amend it at this time.\" Tr. at 7:4-7 (Childress). The County Defendants continued: \"[B]ut we don't think it would be proper to allow the plaintiffs to remand to state court and start this process all over again of attempting to bring the County Defendant[s] back in after they've missed the time limit to amend.\" Tr. at 8:11-16 (Childress). The Court then asked the Plaintiffs: \"[A]s far as Mr. Childress' clients, can you represent that you're not going to try to bring him back in with any sort of state or federal claims?\" Tr. at 8:18-21 (Court). The Plaintiffs responded: \"[W]e do not intend to do that.\" Tr. at 8:22 (Hatfield). The Court asked the County Defendants: \"I think you're pretty protected, don't you?\" Tr. at 8:5-6 (Court). The County Defendants indicated that they were satisfied with that response.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 8:7-8 (Childress).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   San Juan Regional then argued that the Plaintiffs have never made an effort \"to disentangle the factual basis for the state claims that are in their complaint ... from the federal constitutional claims against the hospital.\" Tr. at 9:15-17, 10:18-19 (Kelly). San Juan Regional continued that it was concerned about the status of the federal claims against it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 13:6-10 (Kelly). Specifically, it noted that the Court issued an \"order last year that the Plaintiffs had agreed to dismissing the federal claims against [San Juan Regional] with prejudice ... so we now have an interlocutory order dismissing the claims ... actually all the federal claims against the hospital with prejudice.\" Tr. at 14:11-19 (Kelly). San Juan Regional continued that \"it is very unclear what the status of that interlocutory order is if the remaining state claims get remanded. Because it's not a final judgment that the Court would be entering to remand.\" Tr. 14:21-25 (Kelly). The Court then asked the Plaintiffs if they had \"any intention of bringing federal claims if this case were remanded ... against the San Juan Regional Medical Center.\" Tr. at 15:22-24 (Court). The Plaintiffs responded: \"No, Your Honor.\" Tr. at 15:25 (Hatfield). The Plaintiffs added: \"[W]hen we withdrew our objection to the dismissal with prejudice that the Court entered last year, I assumed that to be final, and that's the position we've taken with Ms. Kelly.\" Tr. at 15:1-5 (Hatfield).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court then stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The federal claims are out.

In fact, \"the Court heard arguments ... regarding whether an amendment would be allowed in light of the fact that the deadline for amendments had passed,\" though the Court chose not to rule on the issue until a motion was before it.

The Court has no plans, however, to alter this order. Further, at the hearing, the Court asked the Plaintiffs if they had \"any intention of bringing federal claims if this case were remanded ... against the San Juan Regional Medical Center.\" Tr. at\n   15:22-24 (Court). The Plaintiffs responded: \"No, Your Honor.\" Tr. at 15:25 (Hatfield). The Plaintiffs added: \"[W]hen we withdrew our objection to the dismissal with prejudice that the Court entered last year, I assumed that to be final, and that's the positon we've taken with Ms. Kelly.\" Tr. at 15:1-5 (Hatfield). Further, the Court also asked the Plaintiffs: \"[A]s far as [the County Defendants], can you represent that you're not going to try to bring [them] back in with any sort of state or federal claims?\" Tr. at 8:18-21 (Court). The Plaintiffs responded: \"[W]e do not intend to do that.\" Tr. at 8:22 (Hatfield). The Court asked the County Defendants: \"I think you're pretty protected, don't you?\" Tr. at 8:5-6 (Court). The County Defendants indicated that they were satisfied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 8:7-8 (Childress). Given these counsel's representations, the Court concludes that there is no concern about the Plaintiffs re-alleging federal claims in state court. The Court has to take as true counsel's representations on a host of issues. The Plaintiffs' counsel has given the Court no reason not to trust them.

Dismissing Matamoros' claims without prejudice would force him to re-file them in state court, pay a filing fee, and move to consolidate his claims with the rest of the case, or at least move to intervene in the state court. Such a rule would also burden the Court. Every time it declined to exercise jurisdiction on some, but not all, individual claims under \u00a7 1367(c), it would have to go through the case's history and decide which claims to dismiss and which to remand. It would have to dismiss any claims added after remand. It would have to remand claims against defendants added after removal. The state court would receive these case fragments through remand and would have to put the case back together. It is hard to determine what policy-federalism, efficiency or comity-such a rule would advance. Further, nothing in \u00a7 1367(c) or\n   <em>\n    Carnegie-Mellon University v. Cohill\n   </em>\n   requires or suggests such an approach. In fact,\n   <em>\n    Carnegie-Mellon University v.
