The Government claims that Tuzman-the former chief executive officer of KIT digital, Inc.-and Omar Amanat of Enable Invest Ltd., conspired with others, including Stephen Maiden, to have Maiden's hedge fund purchase and hold KIT digital's stock to artificially inflate its price and trading volume, and to hide losses Maiden's hedge fund had sustained in Enable. Tuzman is also charged with making false statements to the public and to auditors about these transactions and KIT digital's finances. Tuzman has moved for a bill of particulars and an order dismissing the S8 Indictment as violating the rule against specialty. (Dkt. No. 262) Omar Amanat has moved to dismiss Count Four as duplicitous and to strike certain language in the S8 Indictment as surplusage. (Dkt. No. 269) Both Defendants have also moved for a severance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   (Dkt. Nos. 262, 269)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons stated below, Defendants' motions will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     THE S8 INDICTMENT'S FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Enable was a Dubai-based investment company managed by Irfan Amanat,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Omar Amanat's brother. (S8 Indictment (Dkt. No. 198) \u00b6 3) Omar Amanat raised funds for Enable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In June 2008, Omar Amanat solicited Tuzman to have KIT digital invest in Enable in exchange for Omar Amanat raising funds for a privately-held special purpose investment vehicle controlled by Tuzman that would invest in KIT digital (the \"KIT digital SPIV\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14, 18, 20, 22) To this end, in June 2008, Omar Amanat induced Stephen Maiden to have his hedge fund, Maiden Capital, invest $1 million in the KIT digital SPIV. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19) In the following months, Tuzman obtained approval from KIT digital's Board of Directors to invest $6.5 million-more than half of KIT digital's available cash-in Enable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-23) Tuzman also re-directed Maiden Capital's $1 million investment in the KIT digital SPIV to Enable, without Maiden's authorization. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24) Most of KIT digital's investment in Enable was placed in Enable's U.S. trading account. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25) By September 2008, that trading account had incurred more than $5.5 million in trading losses, and contained less than $113,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-26) Both Irfan Amanat-who controlled the account-and Omar Amanat were aware of the losses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-27)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In November 2008, Tuzman made a redemption request for a portion of the KIT digital funds held by Enable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28) In order to satisfy Tuzman's request, Omar Amanat asked Maiden to invest $2 million from Maiden Capital in Enable on a supposedly short-term basis, and Maiden agreed to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-28) Omar Amanat then caused Enable to wire nearly $1.5 million to KIT digital. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28(a)-(c) )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   By mid-December 2008, Maiden began requesting the return of at least part of Maiden Capital's $2 million investment. Unbeknownst to Maiden, however, Enable \"d[id not have the money] and \" 'd[id not] have any ability to repay it.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29-31) At the end of December-although Enable had not returned any funds to Maiden Capital-Maiden agreed with Tuzman and Omar Amanat that Maiden Capital would purchase $400,000 of KIT digital stock and hold it for 90 days. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58) Maiden also agreed not to redeem Maiden Capital's investment in either the KIT digital SPIV or Enable.\n   <em>\n    (Id.)\n   </em>\n   In return, Omar Amanat assigned a portion of his interest in the KIT digital SPIV to Maiden Capital, and Tuzman agreed to arrange for KIT digital to retain Maiden Capital for various services, and to assign to Maiden Capital a portion of Tuzman's interest in the KIT digital SPIV. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In a second agreement signed the same day, Omar Amanat and Tuzman agreed that Omar Amanat would facilitate further purchases of KIT digital stock in open market trading. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Both Omar Amanat and Tuzman were aware at this time that Enable was insolvent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In January 2009, Maiden Capital purchased approximately $400,000 in KIT digital stock while Maiden continued to request the return of funds from Enable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31, 59, 76(b) )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In March 2009, during a telephone call with the Amanat brothers and Tuzman,\n   Maiden learned that Enable was insolvent and that Maiden Capital's multimillion dollar investment in Enable was lost. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32) Over the next three years, in order to hide Enable's losses from Maiden Capital's investors and KIT digital's shareholders, Irfan Amanat provided false account statements concerning each entity's investment in Enable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35-37, 98, 137) Maiden, in turn, provided false account statements to Maiden Capital's investors, including KIT digital. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16, 35, 53, 80) Omar Amanat also wired hundreds of thousands of dollars to Maiden Capital to allow it to honor certain redemption requests. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38-41, 43-45) Omar Amanat, Tuzman, and Maiden discussed Enable's losses and insolvency in telephone and email communications, and in July 2011, they met to discuss these issues. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42, 62(e), 76(d) )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Between March 2009 and September 2011, Tuzman, with Omar Amanat's knowledge and approval, induced Maiden to purchase more than $2 million worth of KIT digital stock, in part using KIT digital funds provided by Tuzman and Tuzman's own funds, in order to inflate the price and trading volume of KIT digital's stock. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 60-62, 64-69) Tuzman and Omar Amanat represented to Maiden that supporting KIT digital's stock price would facilitate Maiden Capital being repaid, thereby hiding Maiden Capital's Enable losses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In addition to his use of the false account statements provided by Irfan Amanat and Maiden, Tuzman conspired with others to hide KIT digital's true financial condition between 2009 and 2012. Between 2010 and 2012, Tuzman arranged for KIT digital to improperly recognize revenue from sham licenses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 99-105) When the purported licensee refused to pay, Tuzman had KIT digital loan the licensee money in exchange for the licensee paying KIT digital's invoice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 106-115) Tuzman also used KIT digital funds in an escrow account to \"pay off fabricated or [other] uncollectible receivables\" so as to avoid negative accounting treatment, while at the same time claiming that the escrow account was empty. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 116-136)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In March 2012, KIT digital's Board of Directors began questioning certain of the Company's investments, including in Maiden Capital, and Tuzman agreed to resign as chief executive officer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80) In July 2012, Maiden Capital was unable to meet redemption requests and collapsed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     CHARGES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Counts One, Two, and Three of the S8 Indictment charge Omar and Irfan Amanat with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and aiding and abetting investment advisor fraud by (1) causing Maiden to make material misrepresentations and to omit material facts in communications with Maiden Capital investors about the status of their investments; (2) wiring hundreds of thousands of dollars to Maiden Capital in order to pay certain redemptions and forestall Maiden Capital's collapse; and (3) providing Maiden with false account statements regarding Maiden Capital's investment in Enable, knowing that such false account statements were intended to be presented, and were presented, to Maiden Capital investors.

Omar Amanat contends that Counts One, Two, and Three-in which he is charged along with Irfan Amanat-are misjoined with Counts Five and Six, which name Tuzman and Irfan Amanat. (Omar Amanat Br. (Dkt. No. 270) at 22-26\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) Both Omar Amanat and Tuzman contend that a severance is necessary due to irreconcilable defenses and spillover prejudice.

As discussed above, because the disclosure of the disastrous losses at Enable would lead to the collapse of Enable, Maiden Capital, and KIT digital, and discovery of the alleged fraud taking place at all three entities, Omar Amanat, Tuzman, and Maiden shared a common interest and purpose in concealing the Enable losses. According to the Government's theory as outlined in the S8 Indictment, the alleged fraud schemes at all three entities were mutually interdependent. Disclosure of the losses and financial improprieties at any one of these three entities would likely lead to the collapse of the other two entities and the disclosure of fraud taking place at those entities. Although Omar Amanat argues that \"[t]he government provides no authority for its position that the simple allegation that Enable losses were concealed, notwithstanding the dissimilar characteristics and circumstances of that concealment in each of the schemes, somehow satisfies Rule 8(b)'s standards for joinder\" (Omar Amanat Reply (Dkt.

In other words, a jury could accept Tuzman's argument that Enable was insolvent because of its trading losses, and still conclude that Omar Amanat did not conspire to hide these losses from investors. Similarly, a jury could reject Tuzman's claims that Enable was insolvent-and find that Enable was merely illiquid-but nonetheless acquit Tuzman.
