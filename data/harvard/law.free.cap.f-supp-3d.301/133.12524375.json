But instead of setting a\n   <em>\n    maximum\n   </em>\n   amount of trash that could\n   <em>\n    enter\n   </em>\n   the river before it failed to meet its water quality standards, the two jurisdictions set a\n   <em>\n    minimum\n   </em>\n   amount of trash that would have to be\n   <em>\n    removed\n   </em>\n   from the river (or prevented from entering it) for those standards to be satisfied. In this action, plaintiff Natural Resources Defense Council (\"NRDC\") challenges the Environmental Protection Agency's (\"EPA\") decision to approve the plan, arguing that its removal-based approach is inconsistent with the plain language of the CWA. For the reasons given below, the Court agrees with NRDC.

For example, the Trash TMDL here is expressed in terms of an undoubtedly \"appropriate measure,\" weight per time: it requires \"3,458.9\n   <em>\n    pounds\n   </em>\n   of trash to be prevented from entering, captured, or removed from the Anacostia River\n   <em>\n    on a daily basis\n   </em>\n   .\" EPA MSJ at 24 (emphases added) (citing AR 3114-3115). This confirms that the regulatory phrase \"other appropriate measure\" has a different meaning than the one the EPA ascribes to it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Intervenor-defendant D.C. Water offers a slightly more creative argument in defense of the Trash TMDL. Instead of arguing that the terms \"maximum\" and \"load\" are ambiguous, D.C. Water concedes that the terms have an unambiguous meaning but nonetheless claims that the Trash TMDL comports with that meaning: \"[t]he Trash TMDL defines the 'maximum load,' or 'loading capacity,' by numerically identifying the amount of trash that must be prevented from discharge and determining that the modest amount of trash that reaches the waterway beyond that baseline is the maximum load for the river.\" D.C. Water MSJ at 20. This definition is sufficient, D.C. Water contends, because the CWA requires only that a TMDL be \"established at a level necessary to implement the applicable water quality standards,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201313\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(C), and because here, the Anacostia River's narrative water quality standards essentially call for \"a subjective determination of what amounts to nuisance conditions,\" D.C. Water MSJ at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   D.C. Water is certainly correct that the Anacostia River's water quality standards use qualitative descriptors instead of quantitative values,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Mun.%20Regs.%20tit.%2021%2C%20%C2%A7%201104.3\">\n    D.C.

Code Regs. 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .08.02.03(B)(2), and that as a result, reasonable people could disagree over exactly how much trash pollution is enough to violate them. But this just means that the maximum permissible quantity of trash cannot be known with precision; it does not follow that that maximum may fluctuate from year to year. And as D.C. Water concedes,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D.C. Water MSJ at 22, the \"maximum\" purportedly set by the Trash TMDL would do just that: because the Trash TMDL requires that a certain quantity of trash be removed from the river every year, the amount of trash\n   <em>\n    remaining\n   </em>\n   in the river will vary each year as the amount of trash that enters the river varies,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Reply at 6 (noting that \"a removal-based approach to a TMDL is the functional equivalent of setting an upper limit on pollution only if pollution loading is constant and uniform over time,\" and that while \"some pollutants show up in some waterbodies [like] clockwork,\" \"trash in the Anacostia River is not among them\"). Indeed, it is logically possible that, in any given year, a sufficient amount of trash could enter the river such that even if the\n   <em>\n    average\n   </em>\n   annual discharge were removed (as the Trash TMDL requires), any reasonable observer would agree that the amount of trash remaining in the river was objectionable. Even under D.C. Water's reading, therefore, the Trash TMDL neither sets an \"upper limit\" on the amount of trash that can enter the river nor identifies \"the greatest quantity [of trash] attainable\" before water quality standards are\n   breached.\n   <em>\n    Maximum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third\n   </em>\n   1396. It therefore does not establish a \"maximum daily load\" within the plain meaning of that phrase, and EPA's contrary determination was inconsistent with the CWA and will be set aside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As a final matter, it remains for the Court to determine the appropriate remedy. NRDC urges the Court to vacate EPA's approval of the Trash TMDL, to remand to the agency with instructions to establish a new TMDL for trash in the Anacostia River \"within a reasonable amount of time,\" and to stay its order of vacatur until the new TMDL is complete. Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J. at 28. For its part, EPA asks the Court to remand without vacatur and without setting a time limitation or requiring the agency to take any specific action on remand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EPA MSJ at 39-40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \"The decision whether to vacate depends on [1] 'the seriousness of the order's deficiencies (and thus the extent of doubt whether the agency chose correctly) and [2] the disruptive consequences of an interim change that may itself be changed.' \"\n   <em>\n    Anacostia Riverkeeper II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4026502\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/713/50/#p51\">\n    713 F.Supp.2d at 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Allied-Signal, Inc. v.

True, \"the second\n   <em>\n    Allied-Signal\n   </em>\n   factor-the disruptive effect of vacatur-weighs in favor of remand without vacatur,\" because neither party wants the river to go without a TMDL for any period of time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But as was true in\n   <em>\n    Anacostia Riverkeeper II\n   </em>\n   , any disruption can be \"mitigated, if not eliminated, by staying vacatur.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, the Court will vacate EPA's decision to approve the Trash TMDL but stay its order of vacatur until such time as the EPA approves a replacement TMDL for trash in the Anacostia River.
