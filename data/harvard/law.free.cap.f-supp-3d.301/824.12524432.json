A proceeding in district court under Section 21 is \"both an appeal and a new action, which allows the parties to request additional relief and to submit new evidence\" that was not before the TTAB.\n   <em>\n    Bd.

While the Court reviews the TTAB's ultimate decision\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , as an appellate reviewer the Court must give deference to the TTAB's findings of fact by applying the substantial evidence standard set forth in Section 706 of the Administrative Procedure Act.\n   <em>\n    CAE, Inc. v.

Plaintiff and Defendants are longtime competitors in the tobacco product and accessories business, including the roll-your-own cigarette paper business.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (R. 56, Defs.' Add'l Facts \u00b6 1.) Cigarette papers come in varying sizes, which consumers choose based on their skill in rolling cigarettes and the amount of tobacco or other material they intend to roll into the cigarette. (245 TTABVUE 54.) The four principal sizes of cigarette papers are: (1) single wide or single width; (2) 1\u00bc; (3) 1\u00bd; and (4) double wide. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Although there are no industry standards governing the dimensions of cigarette papers, the size designations generally correlate to the surface area of the paper. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, the overall size of a cigarette paper increases as the numerical designation increases. (R. 56, Defs.' Add'l Facts \u00b6 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the 1980's, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted Plaintiff federal trademark registration of the marks \"1.5,\" \"1.25,\" and \"1.0\" (the \"Point Marks\"), in stylized form, for use with cigarette papers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Dels.' Resp. to Facts \u00b6\u00b6 1-3.) These marks, corresponding to Registration Nos. 1,331,207, 1,328,866, and 1,481,006, respectively, are shown below. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In February 2002, Plaintiff filed applications to register the marks \"1.5\" and \"1.25\" in standard character form, also for use with cigarette papers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5; R. 49-2, Gold Decl. \u00b6 49.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendants are the exclusive United States distributors of \"ZIG-ZAG\" brand cigarette papers, which they purchase from French company Bollor\u00e9, S.A., the holder and licensor of the ZIG-ZAG trademark.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (R. 56, Defs.'

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In January 1997, believing that Defendants were beginning to promote cigarette papers with packaging that used the \"1.5\" mark, Plaintiff wrote to Defendants to object and request that they cease and desist. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) Counsel for Plaintiff and Defendants exchanged multiple letters in the ensuing months. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27; R. 60, Dobbins Decl. \u00b6 6.) In a first response, dated February 24, 1997, Defendants' counsel wrote in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Our client, NATC, has now had an opportunity to consider your proposal that it continue its practice of marking its cigarette papers with the designations 1, 1\u00bc and 1\u00bd, rather than the designations 1.0, 1.25 and 1.5. We understand ... that this would relieve [your] concerns that confusion could result from NATC's use of the 1.0, 1.25 and 1.5 designations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Like [Plaintiff], NATC wishes to avoid the expense and distraction of litigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Accordingly, without making any admissions regarding the merits of [Plaintiff's] charge of infringement, but solely to avoid litigation, NATC intends to continue its practice of using the designations 1, 1\u00bc and 1\u00bd for its cigarette papers and to refrain from using the designations 1.0, 1.25 and 1.5.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   NATC's decision is conveyed to you in the spirit of cooperation, and is without prejudice and not to be deemed binding through contract, estoppel or otherwise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (R. 49-2 at 31, Feb. 1997 NATC Letter.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In a letter dated February 25, 1997, counsel for Plaintiff replied, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   I received your letter dated February 24, 1997 and, while I think that the sides are closer than before, the letter does not settle this issue. As we have discussed, [Plaintiff] owns the \"1.0\", \"1.25\" and \"1.5\" marks. The understanding we would like to reach is that [Plaintiff] would not proceed with a claim against NATC based upon NATC's past use if\n   NATC agrees that the marks belong to [Plaintiff] and that neither NATC or any of its affiliated or related companies will use or infringe upon [Plaintiff's] marks in the future. The implication in your letter was that NATC had decided to refrain from infringing upon or using the marks, but reserved the right to do so in the future. In order to resolve this matter, [Plaintiff] must require that NATC acknowledge [Plaintiff's] rights and agree not to use or infringe upon the marks in the future.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (R. 61-2 at 10, Feb. 1997 DRL Letter.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In a second response dated March 3, 1997, Defendants' counsel wrote back:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   NATC has considered your letter of February 25, 1997 to us in this matter, as well as your further comments conveyed during our telephone conversation of February 26, 1997.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   NATC's management wishes to assure [Plaintiff] that it has no intention of using the designations 1.0, 1.25 and 1.5 for its cigarette papers. It is hopeful that this matter can be laid to rest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (R. 49-2 at 32, March 1997 NATC Letter.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In a letter dated March 4, 1997, counsel for Plaintiff again replied, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Your letter dated March 3, 1997, brings us closer to resolving the issues regarding NATC's use of [Plaintiffs] proprietary \"1.0\", \"1.25\" and \"1.5\" designations which has been the subject of our prior correspondence, but is not sufficient to conclude this matter. The central point which the prior correspondence evades is that these marks are owned by [Plaintiff] and may not be used by NATC without [Plaintiff's] prior authorization. Accordingly, I must ask that your client execute a copy of the enclosed acknowledgment and return it to me to resolve this matter without further legal action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (R. 61-2 at 11, March 1997 DRL Letter.) Along with this letter, counsel for Plaintiff enclosed an \"Acknowledgment\" for Defendants to sign, which would have formally acknowledged that Plaintiff was the owner of the Point Marks for use in connection with cigarette papers and affirmed that \"[n]either NATC nor any of its affiliates or licensees will use any of the '1.0', '1.25' or '1.5' marks without proper authorization from the owner of such trademark designations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12, March 1997 Proposed Acknowledgement.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In its third response, dated April 4, 1997, Defendants' counsel wrote back:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   With reference to your letter to us of March 4, 1997, we regret that we have been unable to respond up to this point due to the urgency of other business matters.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Nevertheless, please be assured that NATC has ceased usage of the designations 1.0, 1.25 and 1.5 in connection with its cigarette papers, in order to assure [Plaintiff] of its good faith.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (R. 49-2 at 33, April 1997 NATC Letter.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' Resp. to Facts \u00b6 7; R. 18, Answer \u00b6 32.) The License Agreement is a long-term agreement that automatically renews for successive 20-year terms and was most recently renewed in November 2012. (R. 56, Defs.' Resp. to Facts \u00b6\u00b6 12-14.) It is a valuable asset whose continuation is of importance to Defendants. (R. 18, Answer \u00b6 35.) Defendants' parent company, Turning Point Brands, Inc. (\"Turning Point\"), is party to a $170 million first-tier credit facility that expressly requires Defendants to maintain the License Agreement. (R. 56,\n   Defs.' Resp. to Facts \u00b6 20.) In addition, in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an initial public offering, Turning Point has identified Bollor\u00e9 as Defendants' most important supplier. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The License Agreement includes a non-compete provision under which, during the term of the agreement and for a period of five years after termination, Defendants are prohibited from directly or indirectly manufacturing, distributing, marketing, or selling any cigarette papers or other tobacco accessories in the United States other than those supplied by Bollor\u00e9. (R. 56, Defs.' Resp. to Facts \u00b6\u00b6 9-10, 17; R. 18, Answer \u00b6\u00b6 34, 45.) However, in the event that Bollor\u00e9 is unable or declines to continue supplying cigarette papers to Defendants, or permanently discontinues manufacturing them, the License Agreement permits Defendants to secure an alternate supplier. (R. 56, Defs.' Resp. to Facts \u00b6 10; R. 53-1 at 28, License Agreement \u00b6\u00b6 3(g), 10(a)-(b).) The License Agreement gives Defendants the right to terminate the agreement in the event that Bollor\u00e9 becomes insolvent or undergoes bankruptcy or an equivalent reorganization. (R. 53-1 at 28, License Agreement \u00b6 6(b).) Other than those circumstances, however, the License Agreement does not give Defendants the right to unilaterally terminate it. (R. 56, Defs.' Resp. to Facts \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The License Agreement does not mention or expressly address Defendants' use (or non-use) of size indicators or decimal designations, such as the Point Marks, on cigarette papers. (R. 56, Defs.' Add'l Facts \u00b6 9.) However, it does require Defendants to submit for Bollor\u00e9's approval any advertising, promotional, or marketing materials. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' Resp. to Facts \u00b6 11.) The License Agreement specifies that Bollor\u00e9's approval \"shall not be unreasonably withheld\" and requires Bollor\u00e9 to \"specify the reasons\" for any disapproval. (R. 53-1 at 28, License Agreement \u00b6 4(a).) In 2003, Defendants sought permission from Bollor\u00e9 to use the decimal designation \"1.0\" on ZIG-ZAG cigarette papers that they sold in the U.S., but Bollor\u00e9 refused. (R. 56, Defs.'

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' Resp. to Facts \u00b6 21.) In a letter to Plaintiff's Chairman, Donald Levin, dated May 4, 2011, Bollor\u00e9's Industrial Manager, Cedric Bollor\u00e9, summarized Bollor\u00e9's position:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   This will confirm several long-established points. I believe, based on our long experience in the relevant market, that your companies have exclusively used the marks \"1.0,\" \"1.25\" and \"1.5\" on cigarette papers for many years in the United States. Our company (and its predecessors, Societe Job and Bollor\u00e9 Technologies, S.A.) have made papers for the cigarette paper industry, including your companies, for many decades, and we are not aware of others who have used those marks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Moreover, I am aware that before we acquired Societe Job, Societe Job had acknowledged that you had these rights. For example, I am aware that Societe Job agreed not to oppose your trademark applications for the marks \"1.0,\" \"1.25\" and \"1.5\" when published for opposition in the early 1980's. Our company has always conducted its business on the basis that you had the exclusive right to use of \"1.0,\" \"1.25\" and \"1.5\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Thus, for example, in 1987, our American distributor for Zig-Zag cigarette papers asked us to make \"Zig-Zag 1.5\" papers for them. We refused, because of your prior use of \"1.5\" and your trademark registration of \"1.5\" for cigarette papers sold by your companies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Our current distributor for Zig-Zag in the U.S., North Atlantic Trading Co., Inc. (\"NATC\"), is also aware of your use of \"1.0,\" \"1.25\" and \"1.5,\" and, when NATC asked about using the designation \"1.0\" to promote Zig-Zag papers in or about 2003, we did not approve its use in light of your trademark registration, your prior use and the practice we and our predecessors have adhered to since the 1980's.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Confirming our understanding, it continues to be our position that we are not permitted to use the decimal designations \"1.0,\" \"1.25\" and \"1.5\" in connection with the sale of any cigarette papers for distribution in the United States, and we hereby confirm that we have not done so, and have agreed not to do so in the future.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23; R. 49-1 at 18, 2011 Bollor\u00e9 Letter.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Along with the letter, Bollor\u00e9 supplied Plaintiff with a signed \"Consent to Registration\" in which it consented to Plaintiff's registration and use of the Point Marks in both stylized and standard character form for cigarette papers and agreed not to challenge, seek to cancel, or oppose any of Plaintiff's existing registrations or pending applications for the Point Marks. (R. 56, Defs.' Resp. to Facts. \u00b6 24; R. 49-1 at 20, 2011 Bollor\u00e9 Consent.) Bollor\u00e9 stated that its consent was \"based on the belief that the marks '1.0% ', '1.25' and ' 1.5' indicate that [Plaintiff] or its distributor Republic Tobacco L.P. is the source of the products that bear those marks.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (R. 49-1 at 20, 2011 Bollor\u00e9 Consent.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   On July 1, 2016, following protracted proceedings, the TTAB issued its consolidated decision in Opposition No. 91158276, cancelling Plaintiff's three registrations for the Point Marks in stylized form, and sustaining Defendants' opposition to Plaintiff's applications to register the Point Marks \"1.5\" and \"1.25\" in standard character form, on the ground that the marks were generic.\n   <em>\n    N.

July 1, 2016). As relevant here, the TTAB held that Defendants have standing because, as competitors of Plaintiff, they \"have a legitimate interest in preventing [Plaintiff] from gaining an unfair competitive advantage by maintaining the existing registrations for and registering purportedly additional generic and/or descriptive terms for cigarette rolling papers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *10-12. On August 26, 2016, Plaintiff filed its complaint with this Court for review of the TTAB's decision. (R. 1, Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 40, 59-61.) Defendants answered on September 20, 2016. (R. 18, Answer.) Discovery proceeded and closed on November 14, 2017. (R. 41, Min. Entry.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   On August 1, 2017, Plaintiff moved for summary judgment reversing the TTAB's decision, (R. 45, Mot.) Plaintiff contends that the undisputed facts show that, as a matter of law, Defendants lack the \"real interest\" necessary for standing to challenge Plaintiff's trademark registrations or applications for the Point Marks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.) Plaintiff argues that Defendants have acknowledged Plaintiff's rights in the Point Marks and have represented that they have no intention of using them, \"no matter the outcome of these proceedings.\" (R. 51, Mem. at 7-8.) Plaintiff further argues that even if Defendants wanted to use the Point Marks with cigarette papers, the License Agreement with Bollor\u00e9 effectively prohibits them from doing so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-15.) Plaintiff points out that under the License Agreement, Defendants may only distribute cigarette papers supplied by Bollor\u00e9 and must obtain Bollor\u00e9's approval for all marketing materials. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4, 12.) But, Plaintiff points out, Bollor\u00e9 has recognized Plaintiff's trademark rights in the Point Marks and has previously refused to allow Defendants to use them when marketing Bollor\u00e9's ZIG-ZAG cigarette papers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 5-6.) Plaintiff contends, in other words, that Defendants have essentially contracted away their standing by relinquishing any ability to use the Point Marks to market cigarette papers. According to Plaintiff, prior litigation involving Defendants confirms that the License Agreement has this preclusive effect on Defendants' standing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Plaintiff also argues that there is no realistic possibility that Defendants could extricate themselves from the License Agreement in order to make use of the Point Marks, because the License Agreement is essentially perpetual, does not give them any termination rights, and, in any event, is too important to their business to terminate or breach, as evidenced by Turning Point's statements in SEC filings and its $170 million line of credit that expressly requires Defendants to maintain the License Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5, 12.) In sum, Plaintiff contends that, because Defendants have no current or prospective right to use the Point Marks, they have no \"real interest\" in the proceedings and therefore lack standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Defendants respond that they easily satisfy the \"decidedly liberal and permissive\" threshold for standing. (R. 62, Opp'n at 2.) They argue first that the License Agreement with Bollor\u00e9 is altogether irrelevant because the fact that they are competitors of Plaintiff is sufficient, in and of itself, to confer standing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.) Defendants argue further that even if it were relevant, the License Agreement does not deprive\n   them of standing because they have not actually \"contracted away\" anything. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.) Instead, Defendants explain, the License Agreement merely requires Bollor\u00e9's approval to use the Point Marks, which Bollor\u00e9 cannot unreasonably withhold and may well grant in the event that the registrations and applications for the Point Marks are finally rejected-notwithstanding any past refusals by Bollor\u00e9 or assurances it may previously have given to Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, 9-12.) And even if the License Agreement expressly prohibited them from using the Point Marks, Defendants argue, they would still have standing because recent case law holds that \"even an opposer who has contractually promised not to use a generic or descriptive term has a competitive 'interest' in preventing its rivals from registering that term.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-9.) Last, Defendants deny that their prior correspondence with Plaintiff constitutes an acknowledgement of Plaintiff's rights in the Point Marks or an enforceable commitment to not use them. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In order to have standing to oppose an application for trademark registration, an opposer must \"believe[ ] that he would be damaged by the registration of a mark.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201063\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Plaintiff is consequently not entitled to summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As an initial matter, Plaintiff's argument that Defendants have acknowledged its rights in the Point Marks and have agreed to not use them, no matter the outcome of these proceedings, is simply not borne out by the record. Plaintiff asserts that the 1997 cease-and-desist correspondence between the parties shows that Defendants \"assure[d] [Plaintiff] that [they] would respect [Plaintiff's] rights in the Point Marks\" and \"agreed to not use the Point Marks.\" (R. 51, Mem. at 7.) It is obvious, however, that the correspondence establishes no binding commitment that would preclude Defendants from using the Point Marks, nor is it as unequivocal as Plaintiff suggests. While Defendants stated that they would continue using fractional terms for their cigarette papers, they also expressly noted that their decision to refrain from using the Point Marks was made solely to \"avoid the expense and distraction of litigation\" and was \"without prejudice\n   and not to be deemed binding through contract, estoppel or otherwise.\" (R. 49-2 at 31, Feb. 1997 NATC Letter.) Plaintiff recognized as much at the time and expressed dissatisfaction with Defendants' disclaimer, responding that the \"implication in [Defendants'] letter was that NATC had decided to refrain from ... using the marks, but reserved the right to do so in the future.\" (R. 61-2 at 10, Feb. 1997 DRL Letter.) Plaintiff also responded that Defendants' non-binding assurances were \"not sufficient to conclude th[e] matter\" and insisted-unsuccessfully-that Defendants execute a formal acknowledgement of Plaintiff's trademark rights and contractually agree to not use the Point Marks. (R. 61-2 at 11, March 1997 DRL Letter; R. 56, Defs.' Resp. to Facts \u00b6 27.) Given this record, a reasonable jury could easily find that the 1997 correspondence between the parties does not preclude Defendants from using the Point Marks or show that they have forever abandoned any intent of using them to promote cigarette papers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Turning to the remainder of the undisputed facts, there is sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that Defendants have a real interest in the proceedings. To begin with, the fact that Plaintiff and Defendants are longtime competitors in the roll-your-own cigarette paper business would ordinarily be sufficient evidence, \"in and of itself,\" to establish that Defendants have standing.\n   <em>\n    Ferro Corp. v.

More generally, the undisputed fact that Defendants have twice sought to use the Point Marks to market cigarette papers-once in 1997, which precipitated Plaintiff's cease-and-desist letter, and again in 2003, when Bollor\u00e9 refused to give them permission-could also support a jury's conclusion that they have a real interest and are more than mere intermeddlers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Plaintiff's principal argument is that Defendants have no real interest in the proceeding because the License Agreement-buttressed by Bollor\u00e9's recognition of Plaintiff's rights and its past refusal to allow Defendants to use the Point Marks-effectively prohibits them from using the Point Marks. Viewed in the light most favorable to Defendants, however, Bollor\u00e9's past refusals have been based in large part on Plaintiff's exclusive trademark registrations for the Point Marks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 49-1 at 18, 2011 Bollor\u00e9 Letter (stating that Bollor\u00e9's refusal in 2003 was based on \"[Plaintiff's] trademark registration, [Plaintiff's] prior use and the practice we and our predecessors have adhered to since the 1980's\").) It is plausible-and a jury could infer-that Bollor\u00e9 would no longer withhold permission in the event that those registrations were ultimately cancelled. In other words, a reasonable jury could conclude that Defendants have a real interest in these proceedings because the only obstacle to Defendants' use of the Point Marks has been Bollor\u00e9's refusal, which in turn is based largely on the existence of the challenged registrations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Even if the License Agreement expressly prohibited Defendants from using the Point Marks, which is not the case, a reasonable jury could still conclude that they have a real interest sufficient for standing. As Defendants point out, the TTAB has held in a factually analogous case that even competitors who have contractually committed to not use a mark have standing to challenge the mark as descriptive or generic, due to the competitive advantage that registration might give to the mark-holder.

This argument misses the mark. In\n   <em>\n    Republic Tobacco\n   </em>\n   , Defendants lacked standing to bring an infringement counterclaim because the License Agreement expressly deprived Defendants\n   of the right to do so.

Plaintiff responds that the contents are admissible as statements affecting an interest in property under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(15) or as statements against interest under Rule 804(b)(3). (R. 72, Reply at 11.) On summary judgment, the Court may consider any evidence that could be put in admissible form at trial.\n    <em>\n     Wheatley v. Factory Card &amp; Party Outlet\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324788\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/412/#p420\">\n     826 F.3d 412\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 420 (7th Cir. 2016) ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(2) (allowing objections to summary judgment evidence that \"cannot be presented in a form that would be admissible in evidence\"). Plaintiff could likely offer a witness at trial-such as Levin-to authenticate the letter.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Evid. 901(b)(1). But its contents, if offered at trial for the truth of the matters asserted, would likely constitute hearsay. For the Rule 803(15) exception to apply, the document containing hearsay must \"purport[ ] to establish or affect an interest in property,\" Fed. R. Evid. 803(15), which generally means that it must be a \"dispositive document\" such as a formal title document, mortgage, lien, or the like,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    30B Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 6923 (2017 ed.) (explaining that statements in such documents are considered reliable because they ordinarily are subject to scrutiny and adversarial negotiation and verification). The letter does not qualify; it is simply correspondence recounting a history of dealings between and among Plaintiff, Bollor\u00e9, and Bollor\u00e9's predecessor and distributors. Rule 803(15) therefore does not apply. Rule 804(b)(3) does not apply either because Plaintiff has not established or even argued Cedric Bollor\u00e9's likely unavailability as a witness.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Evid. 804(b). Nor are the letter's contents sufficiently against Bollor\u00e9's interest. Acknowledging Plaintiff's prior use of, and registered rights in, the Point Marks might undermine Bollor\u00e9's future ability to take a contrary position, but that is not \"powerfully\" against Bollor\u00e9's interests.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    30B Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 6995 (2017 ed.) (\"Only powerfully [against-interest] statements qualify for admission under Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(3).\"). Nevertheless, because its contents do not change the outcome of Plaintiff's motion, the Court will consider the letter.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    The Court notes that the declaration submitted by Plaintiff from Levin significantly misquotes the underlying Consent to Registration document, and does so in a manner that could not be the result of a mere transcription error. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    R. 49-1, Levin Decl. at 13 (misquoting the final paragraph of the 2011 Bollor\u00e9 Consent).)
