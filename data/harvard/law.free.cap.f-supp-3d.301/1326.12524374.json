Weihai's response brief targets the DSMC's arguments raised in the latter's 56.2 brief, but Weihai's reply brief is silent on the remand request. Because the agency's request appears legitimate and substantial, issues (8) and (9) will therefore be, and hereby are, remanded to harmonize with Court No. 15-00164 (but,\n   <em>\n    nota bene\n   </em>\n   section IX\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II. Deduction of Irrecoverable VAT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Jiangsu Fengtai, Weihai and Bosun challenge Commerce's determination with respect to Commerce's methodology for the deduction of \"irrecoverable\" VAT from the reported U.S. prices.\n   <em>\n    See IDM\n   </em>\n   at 14. They also challenge Commerce's specific deduction in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   By way of background, an antidumping duty represents the amount by which the \"normal value\" (\"NV\") of subject merchandise exceeds its United States price (\"USP\"), which is typically either an export price (\"EP\") or a constructed export price (\"CEP\").\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201673\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In a market economy situation, NV is typically the price at which the foreign like product is sold or offered for sale for consumption in the exporting country. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(1)(B). When Commerce calculates USP, regardless of whether the proceeding concerns a market economy or non-market economy (\"NME\") situation the statute calls for deduction of \"the amount, if included in such price, of any export tax, duty, or other charge imposed by the exporting country on the exportation of the subject merchandise to the United States\". 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In applying these provisions, Commerce has sought tax neutrality when comparing NV with USP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    IDM\n   </em>\n   at 15. It has also sought to avoid the \"multiplier effect\" in the determination of the margin. Explaining\n   what \"multiplier effect\" means by way of example concerning a market economy, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit had this to say:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Assume product A is sold in Japan for $100. The identical product is exported and sold in the U.S. for $90. The difference is $10, the amount by which the product is being dumped. Further assume a 10% VAT is imposed on the sale in Japan, but not on the export sale to the U.S. With the tax included, FMV\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   is $100 + 10% = $110. The similar calculation of USP, using the tax rate, is $90 + 10% = $99. The dumping margin, FMV-USP, is $11 ($110 - 99), rather than the $10 which is the actual amount of dumping. This mathematical peculiarity is known as the \"multiplier effect.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Federal-Mogul Corp. v.

Cir. 1995).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The case clarified that while Congress had specifically rejected a proposed tax neutral approach to the problem, the most that can be inferred from the statute as it came into being at that time is that Congress neither mandated nor precluded a tax-neutral approach to the administration of section 1677a.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416776\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/63/1572/#p1576\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416776\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/63/1572/#p1576\">\n    at 1579-80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Federal Circuit also noted that the easiest way to achieve tax neutrality would be to subtract the VAT from the price actually paid in the home market, which had been Commerce's approach to the problem in a number of cases prior to implementation of the URAA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416776\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/63/1572/#p1576\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416776\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/63/1572/#p1576\">\n    at 1576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , referencing\n   <em>\n    Zenith Electronics Corp. v.

For one, the problem Commerce had considered in\n   <em>\n    Federal-Mogul\n   </em>\n   , to repeat, was in the context of a market economy's VAT. But in a non-market economy (\"NME\") situation, Commerce must normally resort to determining NV on the basis of the factors of production (\"FOPs\") for subject merchandise. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c). Stated differently, the NV price in the NME home market is suspect. Weihai also emphasizes here that Commerce's historical position had been that 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(B) does not apply in NME cases because no reliable way existed to determine whether or not an export tax had been included in the price of a product from an NME. Either consideration leads to the second point: when comparing NV to USP, avoidance of the multiplier effect, assuming that is desirable, is distinct from a tax-neutral comparison. The latter, obviously, is not the same as \"tax-free.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Recent cases have sustained Commerce's theoretical interpretation of the statute as permitting the deduction from USP of irrecoverable VAT.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aristocraft of America, LLC, v. United States\n   </em>\n   , 41 CIT ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12434312\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/269/1316/\">\n    269 F.Supp.3d 1316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) (\"\n   <em>\n    Aristocraft\n   </em>\n   \"). The apparent reason such cases have been instituted is that Commerce reconsidered how it would apply the NME aspect of the antidumping statute in light of how the PRC's so-called \"socialist market economy\" has been evolving.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Methodological Change for Implementation of Section 772(c)(2)(B) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as Amended, in Certain NME Antidumping Proceedings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%2036481\">\n    77 Fed.

United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1397201\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/166/1364/#p1370\">\n    166 F.3d 1364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1370-71 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (\"\n   <em>\n    Magnesium Corp.\n   </em>\n   \"), which \"prohibits\" deduction from U.S. price of not only export taxes duties and charges that may be imposed upon the exportation of merchandise by NME countries but also the unrebated portion of internal VAT taxes. Jiangsu Fengtai claims these are \"by definition\" not a form of \"export tax, duty or other charge imposed\" by the PRC upon export of the subject merchandise. Jiangsu Fengtai 56.2 Br. at 7-12. But, in upholding Commerce's interpretation of section 1677a(c)(2)(B) in the context of the Russian Federation,\n   <em>\n    Magnesium Corp\n   </em>\n   . only upheld that section 1677a requires export taxes to be deducted from USP if the export tax is included in such price. The decision does not limit or preclude Commerce from determining the extent to which such taxes (or duties or other charges) are included in such price.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Nonetheless, Jiangsu Fengtai quotes\n   <em>\n    Magnesium Corp.'s\n   </em>\n   observations with respect to USP to the effect that in a market economy Commerce can \"presume\" any tax imposed on merchandise to be exported will be included in the USP of that merchandise and also that such a presumption is \"not available\" when the merchandise is produced in an NME, in that \"the price of the merchandise does not reflect its fair value because the market does not operate on market principles\" and \"no reliable way exists to determine whether or not an export tax has been included in the price of a product from\" an NME.\n   <em>\n    Magnesium Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1397201\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/166/1364/#p1370\">\n    166 F.3d at 1370\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

That interpretation is not inherently unreasonable, and Weihai's nuanced interpretation does not render it so,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the implicit argument being that the statute requires some form of explicit \"imposition\" that must simultaneously coincide with exportation, which, as discussed, is not the only reasonably possible interpretation of the statute. Accordingly, Commerce's interpretation of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1677(18)(A), in the context of this review, will be, and hereby is, sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   That does not, however, settle the methodological dispute. In the\n   <em>\n    Final Results\n   </em>\n   , Commerce described its methodology as involving two basic steps: \"(1) determining the amount of irrecoverable VAT on subject merchandise, and (2) reducing U.S. price by the amount determined in step one.\"\n   <em>\n    IDM\n   </em>\n   at 15. Commerce further explained that the definition of irrecoverable VAT is \"explicitly defined in [PRC] tax regulations\" and amounts to the following: (1) the free-on-board value of the exported good, applied to the difference between; (2) the standard VAT levy rate; and (3) the VAT rebate rate applied to exported goods.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. \"The first variable, export value, is unique to each respondent[,] while the rates in (2) and (3), as well as the formula for determining irrecoverable VAT, are each explicitly set forth in [PRC] law and regulation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Hence, because Jiangsu Fengtai and Weihai reported the standard VAT levy on the subject merchandise as 17% and the VAT rebate rate for the subject merchandise as 9%, the methodology called for removing from USP an amount calculated from the 8% difference between those rates as \"applied to the export sales prices (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , U.S. price net of international movement expenses), consistent with the definition of irrecoverable VAT under [PRC] tax law and regulation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Bosun argues the method for the deduction is unsupported by substantial evidence on the record. DSMC counters that the deduction was premised \"on the information the Jiangsu Fengtai Single Entity and Weihai placed on the record of this review, which provides an independent basis demonstrating that the PRC government imposes taxes that can be identified and measured\", echoing the\n   <em>\n    IDM\n   </em>\n   and the defendant's response. DSMC Resp. at 33, quoting\n   <em>\n    IDM\n   </em>\n   at 17. Weihai responds it is \"unclear\" what that \"independent basis\" is, but it is not unclear to the court.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Weihai argues that under PRC regulations the rate of VAT on exported goods is 0%, and that 17% VAT was merely paid on the purchase of \"inputs.\" It contends that a \"formulaic rate-based computation resulting in an 8% VAT deduction from [USP]\" is unlawful because the statute authorizes deduction for \"the amount\" of \"any export tax, duty or other charge\",\n   <em>\n    etc.\n   </em>\n   , that is included in the export price and\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   it is axiomatic that an adjustment based upon the difference between the VAT rates paid (on purchased inputs) and refunded (on export of finished goods) being applied to a common value base (FOB price of finished goods sold) is not the same as the actual amount paid when the applicable input VAT rate and refund rate are applied to two different value bases,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the value of inputs (17%) and the value of finished goods (9%), respectively.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Weihai Reply at 29 (emphasis removed). Weihai argues that in the instant case Commerce simply applied the irrecoverable VAT formula provided by PRC law as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Irrecoverable VAT = (FOB export value) multiplied by (standard VAT levy rate minus VAT rebate applicable to exported goods) = (FOB export value) * (17% - 9%) = FOB * 8%.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   But as the defendant's response points out, \"Commerce reasonably determined, based on unambiguous record evidence, that Jiangsu Fengtai and Weihai paid the standard [PRC] VAT rate on [their] purchas[es]\n   <em>\n    of subject merchandise\n   </em>\n   , and then received a rebate of nine percent.\" Def's Resp. at 39 (italics added). Jiangsu Fengtai's and Weihai's replies do not dispute this point, although Jiangsu Fengtai contends,\n   nonetheless, that the administrative record establishes that no part of the internal VAT, regardless of whether it is the refunded or unrefunded portion, is included in the price paid by the U.S. customer for the subject merchandise. JF Br. at 14, referencing JF's Section A Resp. at Ex. A-14, CDoc 70.\n   <em>\n    Methodological Change\n   </em>\n   indeed indicates that \"included in the price\" of subject merchandise from the PRC necessitates inquiry into whether the price is reported on a \"gross (i.e. inclusive) or net (i.e. exclusive) of tax\" basis,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%2036481\">\n    77 Fed.

The court perceives no reason, among the papers submitted, for interfering with that conclusion, as the burden is on the respondent to create clarity for the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    QVD Food Co. v.

Indeed, it is difficult to conceive of how one could be expected to arrive at \"the amount\" of VAT applicable to a particular transaction otherwise than through application of \"the formula\" that a particular VAT tax would call for.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    IDM\n   </em>\n   at 14 (\"we continue to apply our preliminary formula to adjust the VAT to deduct from the reported U.S. prices\n   <em>\n    an amount\n   </em>\n   for irrecoverable VAT\") (italics added). More to the point: the multiplier effect that would be of concern in a market economy situation, as expressed in\n   <em>\n    Federal-Mogul\n   </em>\n   , normally cannot be concluded relevant to an NME comparison of NV with USP, due to uncertainty over cost or pricing structures within the NME\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (which uncertainty does not, of course, extend to certainty established by law,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , the rate or amount of taxation on those transactions).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The above \"formulaic\" expression of PRC law, and its application by Commerce in the context of this proceeding, is in accordance with Weihai's reporting thereof and the PRC's regulation on the subject. It is also in accordance with the agency's methodology, as the defendant and DSMC contend.\n   <em>\n    See Methodological Change.\n   </em>\n   Commerce concluded that the unrefunded amount of VAT that must be, or have been, \"imposed\" on \"the exportation of the subject merchandise to the United States\" is the amount or value of VAT that the PRC itself has indicated to be the \"irrecoverable\" amount of its VAT program. And despite Weihai's argument, this is not a presumption, it is a factual inference from the record, and substantial evidence of record supports it. To conclude from the record that the amount of irrecoverable VAT was \"something less\" and/or \"capped\" by reference to what had purportedly been paid on inputs earlier in production would be to ignore the actual evidence of record\n   and the apparent manner in which the PRC itself operates its VAT program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Def's Resp. at 39,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204999476\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Expanding on that point, several observations are worthwhile. First, as indicated, the PRC formula reveals that the VAT rate in that home market is 17% and for exports of subject merchandise the VAT rebate is 9% of the full export value thereof, an obvious difference of 8%, and Commerce found this \"net\" remainder to be, or to equate to, the amount of \"irrecoverable\" VAT that is defined in PRC law. \"It is VAT paid on inputs and raw materials (used in the production of exports) that is non-refundable and, therefore, a cost.\"\n   <em>\n    IDM\n   </em>\n   at 15. Of course, the 8% amount of irrecoverable VAT may seem difficult to square with the \"actual\" amount of 17% VAT respondents claim as having been paid on \"inputs,\" because the 9% VAT rebate amount is calculated by reference to the full FOB export value of the good, not only (or merely) by reference to the full amount of VAT that purportedly would have been paid on \"inputs,\" but, as mentioned, the defendant has pointed out that in the context of this proceeding \"inputs\" can mean subject merchandise in any event.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Second, the formula reflects that in the context of export, the internal VAT credit that an exporter or producer paid on inputs, and uses to net\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   the amount owed on a sale of the merchandise, is a\n   <em>\n    separate\n   </em>\n   consideration from the VAT rebate amount that the PRC calculates by reference to the full FOB export price of subject merchandise due to the\n   <em>\n    implicit\n   </em>\n   amount of VAT attributable to that event. In other words, by tethering the rebate to the full export value of the merchandise, the PRC regulation essentially declares that the PRC is foregoing an 8% amount of VAT calculated by reference to the full export value of merchandise, notwithstanding the claim of 0% VAT \"imposed\" on subject merchandise upon its exportation. If the irrecoverable VAT of 8% of the full FOB export value of the subject merchandise is not the remainder of a 17% VAT that has been, or is, implicitly imposed on such merchandise, then it still bears little relationship, if any, to the 17% VAT imposed on the purchase of inputs used in production, because regardless of any \"rolling\" basis used to account for VAT paid and VAT rebated, the amount of both rebate and irrecoverable VAT must still be calculated based upon the full export value of the subject merchandise.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   That irrecoverable VAT, thus, represents an amount that must necessarily be included in the export price, because, as mentioned, it is that differential, between the full amount that the PRC government would otherwise receive, and the amount of VAT that the exporter actually receives in rebate, that the PRC itself deems, as Commerce found, \"irrecoverable,\" and which amount remains, at the time of export, an \"imposition\" on the value of the subject merchandise, and which therefore requires adjustment to USP. It is the functional equivalent of a cost.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Commerce's methodological resolution of these types of VAT problems has been held to require at least further clarity of late,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   but as articulated here by the defendant, Commerce's methodological approach\n   is based directly on the PRC's own law and regulation. In this matter, Commerce's application thereof appears reasonable and permissible, it has apparently been applied consistently,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   it is not unreasonable\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   , and it furthers the aim of the antidumping statute. In arguing for this court to conclude otherwise, the respondents are essentially asking for substitution of judgment on a conclusion or finding from the record that is within Commerce's domain, which is outside the standard of judicial review. Commerce requests deference to its reasonable interpretation of the statute and of the record and its methodology, and current law on the subject supports that request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Jacobi Carbons\n   </em>\n   , 41 CIT at ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271092\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/222/1159/#p1186\">\n    222 F.Supp.3d at 1186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Reliance Upon Contemporaneous Thai Import Data\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Among the FOPs requiring surrogate values (\"SVs\") during the review were nitrogen and oxygen. For the\n   <em>\n    Final Results\n   </em>\n   Commerce calculated those SVs based on the Global Trade Atlas (\"GTA\") data for headings 2804.30, and 2804.40 of the Thai Harmonized Tariff Schedule (\"HTS\") upon determining that those data were contemporaneous with the POR, represented broad-market averages free of taxes and duties, came from the primary surrogate country, and were the best available information.\n   <em>\n    IDM\n   </em>\n   at 49-50. Jiangsu Fengtai agrees with use of GTA statistics for the Thai HTS headings 2804.30 and 2804.40 for valuing nitrogen and oxygen, respectively, but it argues Commerce should use the Thai import statistics from the fourth administrative review because the instant review data are aberrational in comparison therewith insofar as the total quantity of imports in the Thai GTA data are \"commercially and statistically insignificant\" in comparison with its own consumption of nitrogen and oxygen. Jiangsu Fengtai Br. at 27-28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The defendant contends that in order to exclude an SV, interested parties must provide specific evidence showing it to be aberrational.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Commerce explained in the\n   <em>\n    Final Results\n   </em>\n   that such a determination does not involve comparing the volume of imports in the import data to the volume of the input a respondent purchased or of non-identical inputs but rather comparing the total import volumes of potential surrogate countries to one another.\n   <em>\n    See IDM\n   </em>\n   at 50.

Weihai argues both the defendant and DSMC implicitly concede that the 2014 data is incomplete and not representative of a fully loaded labor cost even of the generalized manufacturing sector, because given the omission \"employer's contribution to social security\" they failed to argue or show how the 2014 Labor Force Survey data were \"comprehensive.\" Weihai Reply at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Furthermore, Weihai contends, Commerce erred because a certain letter Weihai obtain from NSO for the record clarified that the 2011 Industrial Census\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the 2014 Quarterly Labor Force Survey data were materially different in terms of scope and data collection methodology and,\n   citing to its 2011 Labor Survey report data, NSO \"affirmed that the 2011 NSO Industrial Census data, notwithstanding [their] lack of contemporaneity, w[ere] more reliable and accurate for valuing labor cost in the Thai manufacturing sector.\" Weihai Reply at 18.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Weihai Br. at 46.

In any event, Commerce's determination did not rest upon contemporaneity alone, and the defendant agrees as to the \"material differences\" between the two data sets that Weihai concedes: Commerce \"was unable to rely on the NSO clarification letter\" because, \"although the letter explained the difference between the 2011 Labor Force Survey and the 2011 Industrial Census data, it did not provide an explanation for the difference between the two sets of data that Commerce had on its record-that is, the difference in methodology between the 2011 Industrial Census data and the 2014 Labor Force Survey data.\" Def's Resp. at 49. The defendant thus contends Weihai's argument is directly contradicted by record evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Weihai's reply, contending that the differences between the two NSO labor cost databases described in the NSO clarification letter are not limited to the 2011 data but are with regard to \"all\" of the Labor Survey reports including those issued during the POR, does not address the entirety of the defendant's (and Commerce's) point. Be that as it may, the NSO letter is mere opinion, albeit an official one, and it is not dispositive as to which of the two sets of data Commerce could choose as the best information available on the record. Commerce's position is that although the letter explained the difference between the 2011 Labor Force Survey and the 2011 Industrial Census data, it did not provide an explanation for the difference between the two sets of data that Commerce had on its record,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the difference in methodology between the 2011 Industrial Census data and the 2014 Labor Force Survey data.\n   <em>\n    IDM\n   </em>\n   at 48. Commerce's explanation is not inherently unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Nonetheless, Weihai argues Commerce's finding that the 2011 Industrial Census data \"cannot reasonably reflect the labor cost, even after the adjustment for inflation\" is erroneous because Commerce has impermissibly conflated two very different databases. Weihai Br. at 36. DSMC's response is that \"the 2011 data could not be accurately inflated using the CPI, because Thai labor costs rose between 2011 and the POR by a far greater rate than the CPI\", \"[n]or could the agency reasonably have simply assumed that the 2011 data could be accurately inflated using the CPI, particularly given that, as Weihai itself concedes, Thai labor costs grew hugely between 2011-2014.\" DSMC Br. at 36-37, referencing Weihai's Br. at 36 (stating that the Thai minimum wage grew by 45% between 2011-2014). Weihai contends that it \"debunked\" these arguments in its opening brief and that DSMC is misconstruing its position, which is that while there was a substantial increase in the average labor cost for manufacturing labor between 2011 and 2014, this was attributable to a 45% enhancement in the Thai minimum wages\n   during this period, and \"the enhanced Thai wage of 300 Baht/day (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   37.5 Baht/hr) does not affect the substantially higher labor cost of 61.39 Baht/Hr for the industry-specific Code 25939 in the NSO Industrial Census report.\" Weihai Reply at 13-14, referencing Weihai Br. at 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In other words, Weihai contends, the effect of enhancement in the minimum Thai wage rate was limited to those manufacturing sectors where the prevailing wage or labor rates were below 300 Baht/day or 37.5 Baht/hr. \"Given that the average labor rate in the saw blade industry was already significantly higher-61.39 Baht/hr-which is 64% higher than the enhanced minimum wage rate of 37.5 baht/hr., it is axiomatic that this particular manufacturing industry would have remained largely unaffected by this increase.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. Weihai's fuller reply is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   ... DSMC counters Weihai by raising two arguments. First, DSMC argues that given that \"[t]he average labor cost for general manufacturing in 2011 was above the increased minimum wage rate ... under Weihai's logic, the wage for the manufacturing sector generally could not have been affected by the minimum wage increase-a position that is entirely inconsistent with its assertion that the increase in the general manufacturing labor cost is due solely to the minimum wage increase.\" DSMC Br. at 37 n.8. However, DSMC misses the point that the average labor cost for the general manufacturing sector is based on aggregating the data for 464 distinct and disparate manufacturing sectors. Weihai Br. at 34. Some of these industrial sectors (like saw blades) have higher labor cost (and wage) rates while several others could potentially have had wage rates that were lower than the enhanced Thai minimum wage rate of 300 Baht/day. Consequently, the enhanced Thai minimum wage rate would have affected all those industries wherein the prevailing wage rates were lower than 300 Baht/day. As a result, even though the average labor cost for general manufacturing in 2011 was already above the increased minimum wage rate, it went up further on account of buoyancy experienced by all of those impoverished industrial sectors where the prevailing wage rates were less than 300 Baht/day.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   DSMC's second argument is unpersuasively presumptive and results oriented. Based on a hypothetical involving five hand tool workers where the daily wage of some of the workers was less than 300 Baht/day, DSMC conveniently argues that \"even though the average rate had been above the post-increase minimum wage, the rise in the minimum wage rate still affected the average rate.\" DSMC Br., 37. As such, it should be rejected. DSMC also argues that since \"the average wage rate under Code 25939, corresponding to hand tools/hardware manufacturing, was 384 Baht per day ... [which] is only 84 Baht per day more than the minimum wage increase in 2014, it is highly unlikely that there were no workers under this code that were affected by the minimum wage increase.\" DSMC Br., 37 n.9. DSMC misconstrues Weihai's arguments. Weihai never argued that Commerce directly apply the industry specific labor cost rate from 2011; instead, Weihai has consistently argued that the labor cost surrogate value be determined after inflating the 2011 industry-specific labor cost by the applicable CPI index.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Weihai Reply at 14-15 (Weihai's bracketing and ellipses).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   If the time-period over which Weihai argues for its preferred methodology were shorter, the argument might have more appeal, but the unevenness of wage rates between manufacturing sectors only serves\n   to underscore the speculative nature of Weihai's argument. Whether it might otherwise be reasonable to infer that the rate of wage inflation over the four-year period from 2011-in an industry sector which already had as its starting point purportedly higher average wages as compared with other sectors-must correspond to \"the applicable CPI index\" (as opposed to being significantly higher or lower during that period in reality\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   ), Weihai's arguments are no less presumptive than DSMC's, as they do not sufficiently explain the 28.75 percent to 35.71 percent disparity in the cost of labor between the 2014 Labor Force Survey and the 2011 Industrial Census data even if the latter are adjusted for inflation. The arguments therefore do not undermine Commerce's conclusion on Weihai's inflation-adjustment methodology.\n   <em>\n    See IDM\n   </em>\n   at 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   DSMC argues\n   <em>\n    Hangzhou Spring Washer Co. v.

Calculation of Surrogate Truck Freight\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   To calculate the truck freight surrogate value to the port of export, Commerce relied on two factors for determining that distance: the \"standardized\" company's location from the Thai\n   <em>\n    Doing Business\n   </em>\n   report for 2015, and the destination port. The issue here is Commerce's determination of the \"Port of Bangkok\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   as the destination port, based on the\n   <em>\n    Doing Business\n   </em>\n   report, which provided the destination port\n   <em>\n    per\n   </em>\n   \"Port Name: Bangkok\". Commerce reasoned as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   Unlike the previous versions of\n   <em>\n    Doing Business\n   </em>\n   in the past reviews,\n   <em>\n    Doing Business\n   </em>\n   explicitly identifies Bangkok as the name of the port and the name of the city where the standardized company is located.[ ] Therefore, we do not find that\n   <em>\n    Doing Business\n   </em>\n   made a general reference to ports that serve the Bangkok metropolitan area when it explicitly stated that the name of port used to compile these data is Bangkok. Therefore, even if cruise companies and other companies call both ports Bangkok ports as Weihai claims, they are irrelevant to the fact that the freight transportation data compiled in\n   <em>\n    Doing Business\n   </em>\n   are based on the transportation from Bangkok to the Port of Bangkok. Also, for the same reason, we find that the quantity of freight the Port of Laem Chabang handles compared to the quantity of freight the Port of Bangkok handles is irrelevant in our valuation of truck freight expense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <em>\n    IDM\n   </em>\n   at 53-54, referencing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Tapered Roller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished and Unfinished, from the PRC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%201396\">\n    81 Fed.

Commerce obviously concluded otherwise, and Weihai's \"averaging\" argument would appear to concede \"Port of Bangkok\" as proper in the calculation thereof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Nonetheless, Weihai persuades that this determination requires remand at least for further explanation, or reconsideration if Commerce so chooses, which may involve further development of the record. The conclusion that \"Port Name: Bangkok\" is an explicit reference to \"Port of Bangkok,\" of course, is the basis upon which Commerce held irrelevant the fact that cruise and other companies call both ports Bangkok as well as the respective quantities of freight handled by the Port of Laem Chabang compared to the Port of Bangkok, but it remains unclear to the court why \"Port Name: Bangkok\" should be regarded as substantial evidence of record to support the conclusion that this is an explicit reference to \"Port of Bangkok\" rather than a mere scintilla.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   For example, in addition to its evidence that Khlong Toei and Laem Chabang are referred to as Bangkok ports in commercial parlance, Weihai argued that the \"Trading Across Borders Survey\" questionnaire that was used for the\n   <em>\n    Doing Business\n   </em>\n   report instructs survey participants to respond considering \"[t]he\n   <em>\n    seaport most commonly used by traders\n   </em>\n   \" and report the \"Cost of inland transport (from warehouse in \u00abSurvey_City\u00bb to\n   <em>\n    seaport\n   </em>\n   ) and handling (loading and unloading)\" and also notes that \"[t]he main method of transporting the containerized product specified above between the \u00ab Survey_City\u00bb and the chosen\n   <em>\n    seaport\n   </em>\n   is considered.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such, Weihai argued, the underlying survey \"unambiguously\" indicates that the expression \"Port Name: Bangkok\" means a Bangkok\n   <em>\n    seaport\n   </em>\n   , record evidence shows that Laem Chabang is the most widely used commercial\n   <em>\n    seaport\n   </em>\n   servicing Bangkok, handles 4.4 times the volume of containerized cargo than Khlong Toei port (\n   <em>\n    i.e\n   </em>\n   , Port of Bangkok), and shows that the latter is a\n   <em>\n    riverport\n   </em>\n   , not a\n   <em>\n    seaport\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Weihai claims that as this latter fact is undisputed, it suggests that the expression \"Port Name: Bangkok\" actually references the seaport of Laem Chabang, but at a minimum the expression must at least encompass the seaport of Laem Chabang-in other words, Weihai continues, on a conservative basis substantial evidence supports Commerce's preliminary decision to average the distance from Bangkok to Khlong Toei riverport and Laem Chabang seaport. Weihai additionally complains of Commerce's \"cursory rejection\" of the other corroborative published information that Weihai provided (in particular those relevant to the import/export community and trucking companies in its rebuttal brief, PDoc 384 at 37, which demonstrated that Laem Chabang port is also referred to as Bangkok port) as simply \"irrelevant\" fails to account for relevant evidence fairly detracting from Commerce's conclusion. Furthermore, Weihai argues, Commerce's decision is inconsistent with its then-recent \"precedent\" in which it has determined different distance factors when using the\n   <em>\n    Doing Business\n   </em>\n   (2015) Thailand report for valuing truck freight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \"Inconsistent\" is the very word, all right, for Commerce's determinations regarding\n   the Bangkok-to-port truck freight distance are, quite literally, all over the map. Notwithstanding the lack of specificity of the distance between a \"model\" surrogate commercial company in Bangkok and its \"model\" commercial port of export in the 2015\n   <em>\n    Doing Business\n   </em>\n   report, one would suppose such a seemingly verifiable fact ought not be a bone of contention, but the parties' arguments reveal wide disparities in Commerce's determinations thereof from review to review.

The defendant contends that the\n   <em>\n    Doing Business\n   </em>\n   report for 2015 \"explicitly\" identified the Port of Bangkok as the destination port. However, Weihai's arguments, recitation of the evidence of record, and the administrative precedents discussed by the parties, persuade that the\n   <em>\n    IDM's\n   </em>\n   reasoning does not evince complete consideration or address of Wehiai's arguments on the record by the agency. Those appear to be of cogent materiality, as more fully described in Weihai's briefing, and thus the determination on the meaning of \"Port Name: Bangkok\" as stated in the\n   <em>\n    Doing Business\n   </em>\n   report is unclear.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The defendant also contends the court should decline Weihai's argument for the agency to take administrative notice and for the court to take judicial notice of the\n   <em>\n    Doing Business\n   </em>\n   report for 2016, but that contention is mooted by the foregoing, upon which the issue of the agency's determination of truck freight distance must be, and hereby is, remanded in order to more fully address Weihai's arguments with respect thereto.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   VI.

Selection of Surrogate Financial Statement\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Commerce derives financial ratios by selecting one or more surrogate financial statements. In both the preliminary and final results, Commerce selected the financial statements of a Thai company, K.M. &amp; A.A. Co., Ltd. (\"KM\"), after finding that company's production comparable to the subject merchandise and a subject of the primary surrogate country during the POR and fiscal year 2014.\n   <em>\n    PDM\n   </em>\n   at 23;\n   <em>\n    IDM\n   </em>\n   at 42. Weihai challenges this selection on two grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The first of Weihai's challenges on this issue concerns semantics. After issuance of the preliminary results, both Weihai and DSMC submitted comments and evidence concerning the translation of a Thai term in KM's financial statements.\n   <em>\n    IDM\n   </em>\n   at 42 n.151, citing PDocs 331, 354, 355. The translation of the particular term\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   was relevant in determining whether KM was a producer of comparable merchandise.\n   <em>\n    IDM\n   </em>\n   at 42. Weihai argued that the Thai term meant \"grinding\n   <em>\n    stone\n   </em>\n   ,\" submitted a translation supporting its argument, and argued that KM was therefore not a producer of comparable merchandise.\n   <em>\n    IDM\n   </em>\n   at 41; PDoc 354 at Ex. 2. DSMC, in turn, submitted documents indicating that the word at issue translated to \"grinding\n   <em>\n    wheel\n   </em>\n   \" and thus would support the finding that KM was a producer of comparable merchandise.\n   <em>\n    IDM\n   </em>\n   at 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   In response to these submissions, Commerce conducted its own research and placed several documents on the record.\n   <em>\n    IDM\n   </em>\n   at 42; PDoc 356. The first document demonstrated that the dictionary definition of the word was \"grinding stone.\" PDoc 356 at 2. The three other documents demonstrated that in the abrasives industry, the same word translated to \"grinding wheel.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-5. Commerce invited comments from interested parties on the seeming polyseme, and the petitioner (only) submitted comments.\n   <em>\n    See IDM\n   </em>\n   at 42; PDoc 358. Based on such research and commentary, Commerce found KM a producer of comparable merchandise.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The issue here is whether, in order to support Commerce's finding that KM was a producer of comparable merchandise, substantial evidence on the record supports Commerce's determination that the translation of the Thai word at issue means \"grinding wheel\" as opposed to \"grinding stone\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Weihai argues that Commerce erred in selecting KM's financial statement. Weihai's argument, that KM is not a producer of comparable merchandise because the record evidence \"only\" supports finding that the Thai word in dispute means \"grinding stone\" and not \"grinding wheel,\" is insufficient to overcome Commerce's conclusion from the record that the Thai word at issue as used in the abrasives industry means \"grinding wheel.\" Commerce found that a translation from a third-party translation agency, KM's own website, and websites of other companies in the abrasives industry, taken together, demonstrate that the Thai word at issue means \"grinding wheel\".\n   <em>\n    IDM\n   </em>\n   at 42.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PDocs 355, 356. Commerce explained that\n   although the dictionary definition of the Thai word at issue means \"grinding stone\", in the Thai abrasives industry it is used as a hyponym,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"grinding wheel.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Commerce also relied on copies of KM's website, which were contemporaneous with the POR, which demonstrated that KM produced grinding wheels.\n   <em>\n    Id. ;\n   </em>\n   CDoc 263 at Ex. 1C. Notwithstanding Weihai's arguments in this regard (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Weihai Reply at 5-7, quoting,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Yantai Xinke Steel Structure Co. v.

Websites of other companies in the same industry also, apparently, demonstrated that the word is employed to mean \"grinding wheel.\" PDoc 356. In short, Weihai's arguments presented here to the contrary do not persuade that Commerce's conclusion thereon was unreasonable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Weihai argues nonetheless that it was unreasonable for Commerce to select KM's financial statements rather than those of Trigger Co. Philippines, Inc. (\"Trigger\"), a producer of DSBs and subject to a country not on Commerce's list of surrogate countries prepared for the review (\"OP List\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Weihai Br. at 10-21.

But, Commerce's determinations are made on the basis of the administrative record before it,\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the fact that Trigger's financial statements were used in the prior administrative reviews does not necessarily inform as to what is the best available information for a subsequent review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Downhole Pipe &amp; Equipment LP v.

Weihai Br. at 17-21. Commerce's decision was not only due to the fact that those statements predated the POR and were therefore not contemporaneous, they were not from the primary surrogate country.\n   <em>\n    IDM\n   </em>\n   at 43. Weihai does not dispute those observations,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Weihai Br. at 27-28, but\n   it argues that the Trigger financial statements fell short of contemporaneity \"by two months only\" and that \"contemporaneity alone is an insufficient justification for dismissing better surrogates.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17, quoting\n   <em>\n    Blue Field (Sichuan) Food Industry Co. v.

It argues that KM's financial statements were not as detailed as Trigger's, for example with respect to inventories open and closed and has no specific line item for outward freight and handling, and that Commerce should conduct a \"side by side\" comparison of KM's and Trigger's financial statements in accordance with\n   <em>\n    CP Kelco US, Inc. v.

Weihai replies that it did exhaust, by alerting Commerce to the fact that \"the 2013 Trigger financial is the most detailed statement available on record\" and by discussing breakouts of certain specific line items in Trigger's financial statement in its administrative case brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   That is a weak reed. Arguing in favor of particular financial statements for the purposes of an administrative review does not equate to a reason for impugning the usability of others on the record.

At the end of the review, Weihai continues, rearguing for rescission in its case brief, a review during which it had been forced to expend substantial resources participating, would have been \"futile.\" Weihai contends that once Commerce denied its rescission request in May 2016, Commerce rendered an \"irreversible\" decision to proceed with the review, and as a result Weihai was forced to proceed or suffer the penalty of incurring an adverse facts available result if it did not. Thus, Weihai submits, \"the damage was done\", and under these circumstances, Weihai complains, it should not have been obligated to brief agency reconsideration of the rescission that had already been denied unequivocally, because by doing so it would in effect be asking Commerce to ignore its participation in the administrative review-as if a subsequent reversal of the earlier rescission denial could undo the prejudicial impact of the initial denial. \"Adherence to such an absurd formality would not be 'appropriate.' \" Weihai Reply at 40, quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202637\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   However, the defendant's response correctly points out that the background of the matter at bar differs materially from that of\n   <em>\n    Glycine &amp; More\n   </em>\n   , in which that plaintiff presented in its administrative\n   case brief \"all arguments that continue to be relevant to the Secretary's ... final results\".\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.309\">\n    19 C.F.R \u00a7 351.309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2).
