The Court holds that the Interior Board of Land Appeals' finding that the Federal Oil and Gas Management Act authorizes Bureau of Land Management representatives to conduct warrantless, unannounced inspections of oil wells on Plaintiffs' fee lands was not arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise contrary to law. The Court declines to address Plaintiffs' unpreserved argument that corrective action ordered by the BLM is not statutorily permissible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 11, 2013, Gabriel Trujillo, a Bureau of Land Management (\"BLM\") technician, contacted Maralex Resources, Inc. (\"Maralex\") to announce his intention to inspect oil wells operated by Maralex. (AR at 105.) A Maralex employee told Mr. Trujillo the wells were on property belonging to Mickey O'Hare, and that she foresaw problems with obtaining access to the lease sites. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She directed Mr. Trujillo to contact Mr. O'Hare. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Mr. O'Hare told Mr. Trujillo that the BLM had \"no rights to be on his land\" to inspect the wells \"because the surface and minerals were owned by him.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After speaking with Mr. O'Hare, Mr. Trujillo and a BLM law enforcement officer attempted to inspect the wells, but were unable to do so because of a locked gate blocking access to the property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43-44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 26, 2013, the BLM issued four Notices of Incidents of Noncompliance (\"INCs\") to Maralex for refusing to permit inspection of the wells. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-21.) The INCs classified Maralex's violations as \"minor\" and did not assess any fines. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14, 16, 18, 20.) As a corrective action, however, the INCs mandated that Maralex provide keys to the locked gates, or, alternatively, allow the BLM to place its own locks on the gates so that the BLM could access the wells. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 13, 2013, six months after Mr. Trujillo attempted to inspect the wells, Mr. O'Hare met a BLM inspector at the gate to his property and \"allowed [him] to enter and inspect the wells and facilities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 108.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Maralex eventually appealed the INCs to the Interior Board of Land Appeals (\"IBLA\"), thereby exhausting its administrative remedies. On July 10, 2015, the IBLA upheld the INCs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 469.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Communitization Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The oil wells in dispute are subject to a Communitization Agreement (\"CA\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26.) The parties to the CA include, among others, lessee Maralex, of which Mr. O'Hare is the President, and the Southern Ute Indian Tribe (\"the Tribe\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38-40.) The CA states that \"[t]he Communitized Area shall be developed and operated as an entirety, with the understanding and agreement between the parties hereto that all Communitized Substances produced therefrom shall be allocated among the leaseholds comprising said area in the proportion that the acreage interest of each leasehold bears to the entire acreage interest committed to this agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The parties recognized that their mineral interests \"under the leases and lands subject to this agreement ... cannot be independently developed and operated.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.) They agreed to \"communitize and pool their respective mineral interests in lands subject to this agreement for the purpose of developing and producing communitized substances.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27.) The interests\n   committed to the CA are treated as a single entity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28, 41.) The oil production is proportionally allocated among the parties based on the number of acres they each committed to the agreement.
