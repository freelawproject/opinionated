MOON, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Todd Hawkins and Jonathan Fishbeck founded the BuilderFish entities, three software development companies. But the partners split, and Hawkins alleges that Fishbeck and the other defendants (a co-worker, Fishbeck's father, and two companies) utilized BuilderFish's resources improperly for their own gain. He claims that they collectively misappropriated trade secrets and infringed copyrights, and that Fishbeck violated a non-compete agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants respond to these allegations in two ways. First, Jonathan Fishbeck argues that the claims against him are subject to arbitration. Because the employment agreement containing the arbitration clause has a significant relationship to the claims against him, the Court will grant the motion for all claims for damages against him, but the claims for injunctive relief are explicitly excepted by the agreement. Second, Defendants collectively argue that Hawkins does not plead sufficient facts to plausibly state his claims against them. While Hawkins properly pleads facts that state a trade secret claim, his copyright and covenant not to compete claims are both fatally flawed. The motion will accordingly be granted in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R.

BuilderFish Enterprises, LLC, BuilderFish, LLC, and BuilderFish Services, LLC (collectively \"the BuilderFish entities\") are each Virginia limited liability companies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2). BuilderFish, LLC and BuilderFish Services, LLC are wholly owned subsidiaries of Builderfish Enterprises, LLC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff and Jonathan Fishbeck each own 50% of BuilderFish Enterprises, LLC, the parent company. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10).

Starting in September 2016, Defendants Jonathan Fishbeck, Heapes, and Ronald Fishbeck (Jonathan's father) allegedly removed this software from the BuilderFish entities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13, 14, 21). Defendants Ultra Lifestyle, LLC and Griffin Group Global, LLC allegedly received this software code and used it to create unauthorized derivative products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21, 22). Defendants Jonathan Fishbeck, Ronald Fishbeck, and Heapes have at least partial ownership of these two LLCs.

The test requires: (1) \"the existence of a dispute between the parties\"; (2) \"a written agreement that includes an arbitration provision which purports to cover the dispute\"; (3) \"the relationship of the transaction, which is evidenced by the agreement, to interstate or foreign commerce\"; and (4) \"the failure, neglect or refusal of the [plaintiff] to arbitrate the dispute.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11433971\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/303/496/#p500\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Here, the parties only contest the second element, and more specifically whether the arbitration provision covers the trade secret and copyright infringement claims.

Plaintiff also sufficiently pleads that the BuilderFish entities took reasonable measures to keep this information secret by \"including confidentiality and non-compete agreements\" in their employment agreements. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201839\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201839\">\n    \u00b6 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

Plaintiff alleges that these two companies joined the other Defendants in creating \"unauthorized derivative works based on [the] software code. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22). These facts, taken as true, create \"a plausible claim for relief [that] survives a motion to dismiss.\"\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p679\">\n    556 U.S. at 679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p679\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Third, Defendants also protest that Plaintiff does not sufficiently plead the interstate commerce requirement. Although Plaintiff's recitation that the various aspects of the purported trade secrets \"relate[ ] to products and services intended to be sold in or used in interstate commerce\" is conclusory, the amended complaint elsewhere satisfies this element by discussing commerce with other developers and tests with potential customers. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16 (discussing marketing plans, feedback from potential customers, and business with outside developers)).

Accordingly, the covenant not to compete is unenforceable, and Plaintiff's claim for injunctive relief under Count III must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Defendant Jonathan Fishbeck seeks arbitration on the claims against him under Counts I, II, and III. This motion will be granted in part-arbitration is compelled and the claims against him for damages will be stayed. The Defendants collectively seek dismissal of Counts I, II, and III, arguing that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim under the Defend Trade Secrets Act, that Plaintiff cannot bring a copyright claim because neither he nor the BuilderFish entities own a copyright, and that the state law covenant not to compete agreement is unenforceable. The Defendants' motion will be denied as to Count I, but granted as to Counts II and III. Claims under Count II and III (except the claims for damages against Jonathan Fishbeck) will be dismissed with prejudice because any attempt to amend these Counts would be futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   While this motion to dismiss was pending, Plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. (Dkt. 23). That motion will be considered separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Plaintiff also filed a motion to strike Defendants' motions to compel arbitration and to dismiss because Defendants did not schedule a hearing within 60 days of filing their motions. (Dkt. 28). But the local rule only states that motions are deemed withdrawn \"unless otherwise ordered,\" and this Court retains the authority to determine a motion without oral hearing pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 78(b) and Local Rule 11(b). Furthermore, this Court previously allowed Plaintiff extra time to file a response to these motions. Accordingly, this Court has considered the motions and orders that Plaintiff's motion to strike is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   An appropriate Order will issue, and the Clerk of the Court is hereby directed to send a copy of this Memorandum Opinion to Plaintiffs, Defendants, and all counsel of record.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Plaintiff has not pled that the written demand was made ninety days before commencement of the action. This is not necessarily fatal to Plaintiff's derivative action-a plaintiff can avoid the ninety-day waiting period if irreparable injury would result. Va. Code \u00a7 13.1-1042(B)(2) ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     DCG &amp; T ex rel. Battaglia/Ira v.

Va. 2014). The Fourth Circuit has noted that \"[i]rreparable injury often derives from the nature of copyright violations, which deprive the copyright holder of intangible exclusive rights.\"\n    <em>\n     Christopher Phelps &amp; Assocs., LLC v.
