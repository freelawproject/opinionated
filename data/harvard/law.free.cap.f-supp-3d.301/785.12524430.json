The Defendants filed a Response [Doc. 19], and the Plaintiff filed a Reply [Doc. 22]. The parties have also filed a number of supplemental notices [Docs. 27, 29, 30], which the Court has considered. The parties appeared before the Court on March 2, 2017, for a motion hearing. Attorney Evan Smith appeared on behalf of the Plaintiff. Attorneys Mark Solomons, Laura M. Klaus, and Richard Solomons appeared on behalf of the Defendants. Accordingly, and for the reasons more fully explained below, the Court hereby\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment [\n   <strong>\n    Doc. 17\n   </strong>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court notes that the Plaintiff's Motion contains a section of material facts. [Doc. 17 at 2]. The Defendants did not specifically respond to the Plaintiff's statement of material facts, but it appears to the Court that there is no dispute regarding the administrative procedural history of this case. Thus, the following facts are taken from the Plaintiff's statement of material facts, unless otherwise noted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Plaintiff, filing on behalf of the estate, is the widow of Reddin Byrge, who worked for Defendant Premium Coal Company, Inc., (\"Premium Coal\") in Campbell and Anderson Counties in Tennessee. In June 2010, Mr. Byrge filed a claim for benefits pursuant to the Black Lung Benefits Act with the United States Department of Labor. The Director of the Office of Workers' Compensation Program administers the program. On April 15, 2011, the district director's office found that Mr. Byrge was entitled to black lung benefits. The Defendants sought a formal hearing before an administrative law judge (\"ALJ\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Defendants did not begin payment of Mr. Byrge's monthly benefits while the appeal was pending with the ALJ. As a result, the Department of Labor's Black Lung Disability Trust Fund (\"Trust Fund\") made interim payments to Mr. Byrge. On January 16, 2013, following a formal hearing, the ALJ awarded benefits to Mr. Byrge dating back to June 2010. The ALJ's Order was received by the district director on February 14, 2013. [Doc. 17-1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In a letter dated March 4, 2013, to Defendant Premium Coal, the Office of Workers'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Compensation stated, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   In accordance with the Decision and Order-Awarding Benefits issued by Daniel F. Solomon dated January 16, 2013[,] Premium Coal Company, Inc. shall provide monthly benefits to the claimant beginning February 2013 (check to be issued March 15, 2013) at the rate of $938.30. The operator shall reimburse the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund the sum of $21,580.90 for interim benefits paid to the claimant from April 2011 through February 2013.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Premium Coal Company, Inc. shall also pay the claimant retroactive benefits from June 2010 through March 2011, in the amount of $9,383.00.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Please be advised that by failing to initiate benefits and reimburse the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund within 10 days of the date payment is due, the employer may be subject to a penalty of up to 20% of the amount due. (In a footnote, the letter continues: See 20 CFR 725.607 and Section 14(f) of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act as incorporated by Section 422(a) of the Black Lung Benefits Act. Such benefits are due within the 30 day period following the date of the decision in this case). Further, failure to pay benefits as ordered may result in enforcement of the final award in Federal District Court ( 20 CFR 725.604 ). An appeal does not stay this penalty unless an Order staying payments has been issued by the Board or Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [Doc. 17-2]. On February 11, 2013, the Defendants appealed the ALJ's award to the Department of Labor's Benefits Review Board. During this appeal, the Defendants did not pay Mr. Bryge's benefits and did not receive or request a stay.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Trust Fund continued to make interim payments to Mr. Byrge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On February 24, 2014, the Benefits Review Board affirmed the ALJ's award of benefits. The Defendants sought reconsideration, but the Board denied on May 28, 2014. Later, on July 23, 2014, the Defendants petitioned the United States Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. On February 23, 2015, while the claim was still pending, Mr. Byrge passed away. Subsequently, on July 22, 2015, the Sixth Circuit affirmed Mr. Byrge's award of benefits. The Sixth Circuit issued its mandate on September 11, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Office of Workers' Compensation sent Defendant Premium Coal a letter dated October 28, 2015, stating that \"in accordance with the Decision and Order-Awarding Benefits issued by the Court of Appeals dated July 22, 2015, the operator shall also reimburse the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund the sum of $52,676.50 for interim benefits paid to the claimant from June 2010 through January 2015.\" [Doc. 17-3]. The letter continues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Please be advised that by failing to initial benefits and reimburse the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund within 10 days of the date payment is due, the employer may be subject to a penalty of up to 20% of the amount due. (In a footnote, the letter continues: See 20 CFR 725.607 and Section 14(f) of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act as incorporated by Section 422(a) of the Black Lung Benefits Act. Such benefits are due within the 30 day period\n   following the date of the decision in this case). Further, failure to pay benefits as ordered may result in enforcement of the final award in Federal District Court ( 20 CFR 725.604 ). An appeal does not stay this penalty unless an Order staying payments has been issued by the Board or Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Defendants state that they repaid $52,676.50 within the ten days of their receipt of the October 28, 2015 letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On March 21, 2016, the Plaintiff initiated [Doc.1] the instant action. The Plaintiff alleges that the Defendants refused to pay Mr. Byrge's benefits while the appeal was pending even though the Defendants did not receive a stay of the ALJ's Order pending appeal. The Plaintiff states that the Trust Fund stepped in and made interim payments to Mr. Byrge. The Plaintiff alleges that from February 2013 until February 2015, the Defendants did not pay Mr. Byrge his benefits within 10 days of being due. The Plaintiff requests 20% additional compensation on the unpaid benefits, which results in $10,535.30 (20% of $52,675.50). Further, the Plaintiff argues that the Defendants owe interest on the $10,535.30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Plaintiff has now moved for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Plaintiff argues that the Defendants failed to pay Mr. Byrge his benefits within ten days of being due from February 2013, when the ALJ's Order became effective, until February 2015, when Mr. Byrge passed away. The Plaintiff asserts that the ALJ's Order became effective when it was filed with the District Director on February 14, 2013. The Plaintiff submits that despite the Defendants' appeals, an order can become \"effective\" before it becomes \"final.\" Because the Defendants missed twenty-five payments from February 2013 to February 2015 and the lump sum payment for back benefits that was due on April 3, 2013, the Plaintiff submits that they are responsible for an additional 20% compensation on the missed payments. In support of its argument, the Plaintiff cites to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20914\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20725.607\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 725.607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and 725.530(a). The Plaintiff contends that although the Trust Fund made interim payments while the case was on appeal, this does not affect the Defendants' legal responsibility to pay the 20% additional compensation. The Plaintiff asserts that she is entitled to 20% of $52,676.50 or $10,535.30. In addition, the Plaintiff contends that pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20725.608\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3), the Defendants owe interest on the additional compensation, which began to accrue on March 25, 2013. In addition, the Plaintiff asserts, \"A lump-sum reimbursement was due on April 3, 2013 .... Interest on that payment began to accrue on April 13, 2013.\" [Doc. 17 at 16].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Finally, the Plaintiff argues that its claims are both ripe and timely. The Plaintiff asserts that she is under no obligation to exhaust any administrative remedy and that \u00a7 921(d) of the Longshore Act provides a freestanding right of action for claimants to enforce a final award of benefits, including the 20% additional compensation. In addition, the Plaintiff asserts that she does not need to seek a supplementary order from the district director prior to bringing suit under \u00a7 921(d). The Plaintiff asserts that the claim is not barred by any statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Defendants assert that Plaintiff requests the Court to impose a Longshore penalty provision on the adjudication of a black lung claim, which as applied here, punishes the Defendants for litigating this claim. The Defendants assert that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20914\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f) has no proper place when applied in the adjudication of a black lung claim and that it is punitive for no reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Defendants assert that the Plaintiff's request is time-barred or that no penalty is due. The Defendants explain that a plaintiff may seek to enforce an award through the district court by two avenues:\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20918\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   or \u00a7 921. The Defendants argue that \u00a7 918 has a one-year window, which would bar the instant suit. The Defendants asserts that under \u00a7 921, the compensation order was not final until September 11, 2015, when the Sixth Circuit issued its mandate. Thus, the Defendants assert that the Plaintiff does not seek to enforce a final order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Further, the Defendants argue that the Department of Labor's departure from\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20914\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f) is unlawful. The Defendants explain that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20725.607\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   is an unauthorized departure from the Longshore Act and the Black Lung Benefits Act. The Defendants argue that the provision is arbitrary and capricious. The Defendants reason that Congress created the Trust Fund to pay benefits when a specific employer declined to do so in order to exercise an employer's right to contest a claim. The Defendants argue that imposing a penalty on them for exercising the right to litigate and to decline to immediately pay benefits on a disputed claim is unconstitutional. Finally, in a footnote, the Defendants assert that the Plaintiff \"arguably lacks standing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Plaintiff filed a Reply [Doc. 22] starting that the Defendants do not contest that there is a genuine dispute as to any material fact and that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20914\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f) is one of the incorporated provisions from the Longshore Act. Further, the Plaintiff asserts that the Defendants' argument with respect to standing is incorrect. The Plaintiff argues that she is seeking its statutory compensation traceable to Defendants' failure to pay Mr. Byrge in a timely fashion. Moreover, the Plaintiff argues that the Defendants failed to challenge the statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20914\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f), but instead argue that the regulation,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20725.607\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , is unconstitutional. The Plaintiff asserts that the Defendants did not request a stay and that the 20% additional compensation provision only comes into play if the employer loses a claim. The Plaintiff asserts that it is not a penalty but an acknowledgement that the beneficiary deserves interim benefits and that the employers should avoid shifting the risk to the Trust Fund. Further, the Plaintiff argues that the 20% additional compensation is no different than many other litigation costs. With respect to the Defendants' due process concerns, the Plaintiff submits that their arguments are factually and legally wrong. The Plaintiff asserts that the claim is not time-barred and that the Plaintiff is entitled to interest under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20725.608\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Defendants filed a Notice of Supplemental Authorities [Doc. 24]. In the Notice, the Defendants submit that the United States Supreme Court granted certiorari in a case involving the rule of lenity or its companion canon of strict construction of penal statutes. Further, the Defendants assert that since they first raised the issue of standing, the Sixth Circuit issued an unpublished opinion, adopting an expansive view of the standing in the aftermath of\n   <em>\n    Spokeo Inc. v. Robins\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/\">\n    136 S.Ct. 1540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/\">\n    194 L.Ed.2d 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).

She has not suffered an injury-in-fact, a basic requirement for Article III standing.\" [Doc. 19 at 17, n. 1]. The Defendants assert that whether a statute can \"confer standing in the absence of any injury is an unresolved question.\" [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18, n. 1]. Later, the Defendants filed a Notice of Supplemental Authorities [Doc. 24], directing this Court to Sixth Circuit case law, although no analysis of the case law or how it relates to the instant case was provided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Plaintiff responds that she is not asserting a generalized grievance but rather is seeking the statutory compensation traceable to Defendants' failure to pay Mr. Byrge in a timely fashion.

In order to establish standing, a plaintiff must allege: (1) \"injury\n   in fact,\" (2) \"a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of,\" and (3) redressability.\n   <em>\n    Lujan v.

Here, the Plaintiff has alleged that the estate of Mr. Byrge is owed 20% additional compensation (injury in fact) and that the Defendants are obligated to pay the additional compensation because they failed to timely pay monthly benefits (causal connection). Further, the Plaintiff requests that the Court order the Defendants to pay the additional compensation (redressability).

First, if the Defendants prevail in their continued litigation, they will not owe the Plaintiff-hence, no punishment. Second, if they had sought and received a stay order, they would not have had to pay the additional compensation for non-payment. Third, once an award was made for the Plaintiff, the Defendants had to engage in a risk analysis,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   whether to hold onto the award money and not pay it to Plaintiff and instead continue to litigate (and continue to earn interest on the unpaid amount) and have the Trust Fund pay the Defendants' obligation, all with hopes of prevailing eventually, or not to run a risk of the additional 20% award by paying the award now (or seeking a stay) and still continue to litigant with the risk of over recovery for the miner if the Defendants ultimately prevail.

Although the Defendants have challenged the regulation, they acknowledge, however, that \u00a7 914(f) is an incorporated provision from the LHWCA. [Doc. 19 at 4]. The Defendants contend that \u00a7 914(f) does not make sense when applied in the adjudication of a black lung claim prior to the issuance of a final award. The Defendants reason that \u00a7 914(f) operates to ensure injured workers are not required to wait for compensation during an appeal, but in the context of a black lung claim, the Trust Fund makes interim payments to the claimant. Further, the Defendants assert that its application forces an employer to pay unrecoverable benefits in contested claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \"Congress passed the [BLBA] and created the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund to provide benefits for miners and their survivors when a miner is killed or disabled by pneumoconiosis.\"\n   <em>\n    Arkansas Coals, Inc. v.

The Defendants have not cited any support for their allegation that the Trust Fund was established for the benefit of employers. To the contrary, and to this Court, all indications are that it was created to benefit the miner-to allow him/her a paid benefit if the employer refused to pay, was unable to pay, or continued to litigate without paying. Regardless, coal mine operators are afford protection from the additional compensation while seeking an appeal in the form of a stay. Here, the Defendants acknowledge that they did not even request a stay and claimed, without any legal support, at the hearing that \"no one\" gets a stay. This allegation is an insufficient ground to rule \u00a7 725.607 unconstitutional.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hudson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20386736\">\n    2012 WL 386736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *6 (noting that the coal company had not challenged the dispositive regulation, \u00a7 725.607, \"[n]or could it,\" as the \"law imposes a heavy burden on employers challenging the validity of a regulation promulgated under a statute, such as the BLBA, that provides a broad grant of rulemaking authority\") (other citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The Court agrees with the Plaintiff in that the purpose of the additional compensation is to discourage employers from shifting the risk to the Trust Fund and that the Secretary of Labor's enactment \u00a7 725.607 was reasonably related to the purpose of the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arkansas Coals Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4083149\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/739/309/#p312\">\n    739 F.3d at 313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that \"[t]o ensure that the fund does not bear the sole burden of black lung claims, the\n   Department of Labor ..., following congressional authorization, established regulations to ensure that coal mine operators are liable \"to the maximum extent feasible\" for awarded claims\") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Director, OWCP v.

[Doc. 19-1 at 10]. Furthermore, as the Plaintiff has argued, the district director's 2011 decision was not an \"effective order\" that resulted in the 20% additional compensation. Instead, the compensation order is the ALJ's 2013 decision that was filed with the district director.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20725.502\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(2) (noting that a proposed order by a district director becomes effective at the expiration of the thirtieth day thereafter if no party timely requests a hearing and that an order issued by an ALJ becomes effective when it is filed with the district director).

The Plaintiff asserts that the right to additional compensation arises ten days after the payment becomes due and that payments were due on the fifteenth of each month from March 2013 to February 2015.

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Although discussed herein to the extent relevant to the Court's analysis, the Court presumes familiarity with the facts of this case as well as the analysis in the underlying opinion. Relevant here, on March 31, 2017, the Court entered a Memorandum Opinion [Doc. 31] granting Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment. A separate Judgment [Doc. 32] was also entered. Specifically, the Court found that Plaintiff was entitled to 20% additional compensation and interest on the additional compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Defendants have now moved the Court, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e), to alter or amend the March 31 Judgment in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    II. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Defendants argue that the plain language of the Longshore and Black Lung Acts and the Department's regulations preclude a finding that the penalty in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20914\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f) applies in this case. Further, Defendants assert the prior black lung precedent holds that the Longshore Act's procedures do not supersede black lung regulations. Defendants continue that the Court's analysis equating the Longshore Act and the Black Lung program is not supported by fact or law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Plaintiff responds [Doc. 35] that pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20725.502\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2), the thirty-day grace period for payment only applies to back benefits and that regardless, the thirty-day period expired on April 4, 2013. Plaintiff submits that the ALJ's 2013 decision is the relevant \"compensation order\" and contained all the information that Defendants needed to initiate monthly payments to Mr. Byrge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    III. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   As mentioned above, Defendants' Motion was filed pursuant to Federal Rule Civil Procedure 59(e). Rule 59(e) provides, \"A motion to alter or to amend a judgment must be filed no later than 28 days after the entry of the judgment.\" A court may grant a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend if there is: (1) a clear error of law; (2) newly discovered evidence; (3) an intervening change in controlling law; or (4) a need to prevent manifest injustice.\n   <em>\n    Intera Corp. v.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Defendants request that the Court reconsider as follows: (1) whether Defendants' payments were in keeping with the regulatory language setting the date the payments were due and were, therefore, timely; (2) whether prior case law, including Sixth Circuit precedent, requires this Court to follow Department of Labor's black lung rules and not Longshore rules in matters concerning the payment of benefits; (3) whether the Court's decision properly accounts for the fact that in black lung claims, but not in Longshore claims, it is necessary to coordinate a transition from payments made by the federal government in accordance with federal disability benefit program rules used in Social Security Act programs that are not designed to accommodate an immediate switch over from federal payments to private payments; and (4) whether the decision of the ALJ, the Benefits Review Board or Court provided adequate information to support an informed decision on how to pay benefits and how much to pay. [Doc. 33-1 at 3].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Defendants have asserted three primary arguments in support of their request that the Court reconsider the above. The Court will address the arguments in the order that they appear in Defendants' brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Additional Compensation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Defendants assert that this Court stands alone in its rejection of the rational system for paying black lung benefits necessitated by the specific circumstances of the black lung program. Defendants argue that the Black Lung Benefits Act (\"BLBA\") expressly provides that Longshore procedures to the extent applicable in black lung claims may be amended or abandoned. Defendants continue that when it comes to the payment of benefits, the black lung regulations do not follow the Longshore rules for many reasons. First, they assert that the black lung payment rules were originally established by the Social Security Administration (\"SSA\"). They assert that the SSA's disability benefits payment procedures were made applicable for the payment of black lung benefits. In addition, they assert that the black lung rules include a regulation that defines when a benefit payment following an adjudicated award becomes due and payable,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20725.502\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Defendants assert that no court, no ALJ, and no member of the Benefits Review Board has concluded that an employer or carrier who has complied with \u00a7 725.502(b)(2) was liable for a penalty and that the Court has no sound basis to break a new trail on this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   In its previous decision, the Court already noted that pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20932\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), the Secretary of Labor is\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   authorized to prescribe in the Federal Register such additional provisions, not inconsistent with those specifically excluded by this subsection, as he deems necessary to provide for the payment of benefits by such operator to persons entitled thereto as provided in this part and thereafter those provisions shall be applicable to operators.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=30%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20932\">\n    30 U.S.C. \u00a7 932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The Court further noted that in exercising the above authority, the Secretary of Labor promulgated\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20725.607\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This section states that if any benefits payable under an award by the district director, a decision and order filed and served by an ALJ, or a decision filed by the Board or a U.S. Court of Appeals are not paid within 10 days of being due, the operator must pay 20 percent of such unpaid benefits, unless review\n   of the order is sought\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   an order staying payments has been issued.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20725.607\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Defendants assert that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20725.502\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) is clear that benefits are not due for the purposes of \u00a7 914(f) when an ALJ, Board, or Court issues an opinion but only thirty days after the district director issues his compensation. Specifically, \u00a7 725.502(b) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   (b)(1) While an effective order requiring the payment of benefits remains in effect, monthly benefits, at the rates set forth in \u00a7 725.520, shall be due on the fifteenth day of the month following the month for which the benefits are payable. For example, benefits payable for the month of January shall be due on the fifteenth day of February.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   (2) Within 30 days after the issuance of an effective order requiring the payment of benefits, the district director shall compute the amount of benefits payable for periods prior to the effective date of the order, in addition to any interest payable for such periods (see \u00a7 725.608 ), and shall so notify the parties. Any computation made by the district director under this paragraph shall strictly observe the terms of the order. Benefits and interest payable for such periods shall be due on the thirtieth day following issuance of the district director's computation. A copy of the current table of applicable interest rates shall be attached to the computation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20725.502\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Contrary to Defendants' assertion, in its previous Memorandum Opinion, the Court did not hold that that benefits were due for purposes of \u00a7 914(f) when an ALJ issues an opinion or decision. Instead, the Court held as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   When the ALJ issued his decision granting benefits, the Defendants were not required to immediately start paying some unknown amount. As explained below, the ALJ's compensation order does not become effective until it is filed with the district director.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20921\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20725.479\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). As noted above,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2) provides that the district director has thirty days after the issuance of an order to compute the amount and notify the parties. Further, \u00a7 725.502(b)(2) states, \"Any computation by the district director under this paragraph shall strictly observe the terms of the order.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   [ Doc. 31 at 797 ]. Although not entirely clear, it appears Defendants' argument is that the district director's computation is the 2015 letter. The Court has already explained its Memorandum Opinion that the order granting benefits (i.e., ALJ's Order) was effective in 2013 (i.e., when it was filed with the district director) and benefits were payable thereafter. The Court finds no reason to repeat its findings herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Further, Plaintiff asserts that that Defendants' reading of \u00a7 725.502(b) is flawed because the regulation makes a distinction between (1) benefits that are due each month for after the effective date of an order requiring the payment of benefits (i.e., \"ongoing benefits\"); and (2) benefits that are due for the period before that effective date (i.e., \"back benefits\"). The Court agrees with Plaintiff's interpretation based on the clear language in the regulation. Further, the Court observes that Plaintiff presented this argument in her Motion for Summary Judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 15 at 8-9]. As Plaintiff originally explained, \u00a7 725.502(b)(1) provides that monthly benefits are due the fifteenth day of the month following the month for which the benefits are payable, or in this case March 15, 2013. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8]. Plaintiff further explained that the District Director's March 4, 2013, pay order made this clear to Defendants because the letter specifically stated that the\n   check should be issued March 15, 2013, at the rate of $983.30. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Plaintiff further explained that pursuant to \u00a7 725.502(b)(2), a lump-sum reimbursement for back benefits was due on April 3, 2013. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9]. The district director also computed this amount. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9]. Defendants did not pay either amounts. Defendants' arguments do not change the Court's underlying opinion because Defendants did not pay benefits until 2015-over two years after the benefits became due-nor did they request a stay. Accordingly, the Court finds the Defendants' argument not well taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Prior Black Lung Precedent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Defendants assert that prior black lung precedent holds that the Longshore Act's procedures do not supersede black lung regulations. Defendants further argue that because black lung claimaints are paid interim benefits under the federal disability insurance system administered by the SSA by agreement with Department when an employer declines to pay benefits, and the SSA cannot stop payment on a dime or even in ten days, the application of Longshore Act practices to this very different payment scheme makes no sense. They assert that the DOL payment regulation makes sense, is supported by BLBA, and is clear in its requirement that payment is due thirty days after the district director computes the benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Similar to the Court's explanation above, Defendants do not explain why the Court's original finding (i.e., benefits were due in 2013 as opposed to 2015) was in error. It appears that they are asserting that the Court should rely on \u00a7 725.502(b), but the Court did rely on this regulation, in addition to others.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 31 at note 7]. Further, as noted above, Defendants' argument does not change the Court's underlying opinion. Finally, with respect to Defendants' argument regarding SSA administering interim payments, Plaintiff disputes Defendants' allegation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Doc. 35 at 5] (\"The Social Security Administration does not manage payment of claims like Mr. Byrge's that arise under \"Part C\" of the Black Lung Benefits Act.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Regardless, even if true, the Court agrees with Plaintiff that this is not a reason to justify Defendants' failure to pay benefits when they became due. The Court reiterates that when the ALJ issued his decision and filed it with the district director, the order granting benefits became effective, and Defendants had to start paying benefits shortly thereafter,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20725.502\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), or request a stay pending appeal. They did neither.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20725.502\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (explaining that benefits become due after the issuance of an \"effective order\" and notwithstanding a motion to reconsider or an appeal, \"except that benefits shall not be considered due where the payment of such benefits has been stayed by the Benefits Review Board or appropriate court\"). Accordingly, Defendants' argument is not well taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Court's Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Defendants assert that claims under the BLBA and Longshore Act are different, primarily because black lung claims are filed long after the claimant has left employment. Defendants assert that the presence of the Trust Fund eliminates the potential loss of wages, unlike claims under the Longshore Act. Defendants argue that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20725.502\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 725.502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   recognizes that benefits shall become \"due\" after the issuance of an effective order but that the actual compensation order that triggers payments is issued by the district director pursuant to \u00a7 725.502(b)(2). Defendants continue that the payment scheme for black lung benefits requires a set of calculations\n   based on dates of a claimant's employment, the applicate rates, the number of dependents and augmentees, potential offsets and the costs of medical and indemnity benefits to be reimbursed. Defendants assert that this is not a ministerial calculation that can be done simply because an ALJ has decided that a claimant is entitled to benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   As mentioned above, in its Memorandum Opinion, the Court previously explained, \"When the ALJ issued his decision granting benefits, the Defendants were not required to immediately start paying some unknown amount.\" [Doc. 31 at ----]. The Court continued that under \u00a7 725.502(b)(2) the district director has thirty days to compute the amount and notify the parties. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Further, Defendants argue, \"To trigger any obligation under Section 14(f), the ALJ in Byrge's case would have had to provide the information that the district director set out in his October 28, 2015 letter. It is only with that information that defendants would know what was due.\" [Doc. 33-1 at 12-13]. The Court finds this argument meritless. As Plaintiff has emphasized in her brief, the information in the October 2015 letter is not materially different than the March 4, 2013 letter, by the district director. Instead, the only difference is that in 2015, Defendants owed more money to the Trust Fund because they did not pay Mr. Byre during their many appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   To be sure, the Court has again reviewed the March 4, 2013 letter. [Doc. 17-2]. The letter states that Defendants shall provide monthly benefits to the claimant beginning February 2013 (check to be issued March 15, 2013) at the rate of $938.30. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. In addition, the letter states that the operator shall reimburse the Trust Fund in the sum of $21,580.90 for the interim benefits paid to the claimant from April 2011 through February 2013. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Further, the letter states that the Defendants shall pay the claimant retroactive benefits from June 2010 through March 2011 in the amount of $9,383.00. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. Finally, the letter explains that the employer may be subject to a 20% penalty of the amount due for the failure to pay such amount and that an appeal does not stay the penalty, unless an order staying payments has been issued by the Board or Court. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The Court finds Defendants' allegation that they did not know the amount that was due, as they claim in their brief, is wholly misleading, given that the district director calculated such amount in March 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Accordingly, for the reasons explained above and for the reasons stated in this Court's Memorandum Opinion [Doc. 31], Defendants' Motion to Alter or Amend Judgment [\n   <strong>\n    Doc. 33\n   </strong>\n   ] is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    The Plaintiff's statement of material facts submits that the Defendants did not receive a stay.

[Doc. 19 at 4].\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-144\">\n    The Court notes that the Defendants argued in their brief that the Plaintiff's suit is untimely if brought pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20918\">\n     33 U.S.C. \u00a7 918\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
