CASEY RODGERS, CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This matter is before the Court on two motions: (1) Morette Company, individually and for the benefit of BITCO National Insurance Company's Motion for Summary Judgment on Liability, ECF No. 31; and (2) Southern-Owners Insurance Company's Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 46. The Court's rulings are set forth below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This consolidated action involves an insurance coverage dispute over the obligation, if any, of Southern-Owners Insurance Company (\"Southern-Owners\") to defend and indemnify various parties against state court claims for property damage due to allegedly defective work performed by two of its insureds, Etheridge Construction, Inc. (\"Etheridge Construction\") and Wallace Sprinkler &amp; Supply, Inc. (\"Wallace Sprinkler\"), while serving as subcontractors for the construction of the Margaritaville Beach Hotel (\"Margaritaville\") in Pensacola Beach, Florida. The state court lawsuit and the federal court actions arise from the following undisputed facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In August 2008, Little Sabine, Inc. (\"Sabine\"), the developer and owner of Margaritaville, hired Morette Company, Inc. (\"Morette\") as general contractor for the Margaritaville project. Morette subcontracted various portions of the construction work to Etheridge Construction and Wallace Sprinkler. The terms of their respective subcontracts required each subcontractor to defend and indemnify Morette for all damages claims \"occasioned by\" the subcontractor's work and to reimburse Morette for all expenses incurred, including reasonable attorney's fees, as a result of such claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1-5 at 12. The subcontracts also required each subcontractor to maintain liability insurance naming Morette as an additional insured.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As per their subcontracts, both Etheridge Construction and Wallace Sprinkler obtained commercial general liability policies (\"CGL policies\") with blanket additional insured endorsements (\"Endorsements\") from Southern-Owners.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Endorsements provide that \"[a] person or organization is an Additional Insured, only with respect to liability arising out of 'your work' for that Additional Insured by or for you ... [i]f required in a written contract or agreement.\" ECF No. 1-4 at 189. The CGL policies define \"your work\" as \"(1) [w]ork or operations performed by you or on your behalf; and (2) [m]aterials, parts or equipment furnished\n   in connection with such work or operations.\" ECF No. 1-5 at 62. The Endorsements also specify that the \"insurance is primary for the Additional Insured, but only with respect to liability arising out of 'your work' for that Additional Insured by or for you. Other insurance available to the Additional Insured will apply as excess insurance and not contribute as primary insurance to the insurance provided by\" Southern-Owners.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 1-4 at 189. The parties agree that Morette is an additional insured under the CGL policies pursuant to the subcontracts and the Endorsements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After the construction of Margaritaville was complete, Sabine retained an architect to inspect the finished project. The architect issued a report identifying a number of alleged defects purportedly resulting from improper design and construction of Margaritaville. Sabine then served a notice of claim on Morette, pursuant to Florida Statutes 558.004.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The notice of claim advised Morette of the discovery of the purportedly defective work set forth in the architect's report and provided Morette an opportunity to inspect and cure the defects. When Sabine and Morette were unable to informally resolve the problems identified in the notice, Sabine filed a lawsuit against Morette in the Circuit Court for Escambia County, Florida (the \"state court lawsuit\"), alleging breach of contract, breach of implied warranty, violation of Florida building code, and negligence for numerous unresolved construction and design defects that caused damage to the hotel property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1-1 at 2, 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Morette determined that the allegedly defective work was performed by its subcontractors, Etheridge Construction and Wallace Sprinkler.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thereafter, Morette sent multiple letters to Etheridge Construction, Wallace Sprinkler, and their insurer, Southern-Owners, invoking its rights as an additional insured under the CGL policies and demanding defense and indemnification for the claims in the state court lawsuit. Southern-Owners declined to provide coverage. Morette, represented by attorneys provided by its own liability insurer, BITCO National Insurance Company (\"BITCO\"), defended against the state court lawsuit and also asserted third-party claims against Etheridge Construction, Wallace Sprinkler, and other subcontractors, seeking to recover from them any amounts for which Morette might be held liable. The state court lawsuit subsequently settled, but Morette reserved its right to seek defense and indemnity from Southern-Owners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Since that time, two actions have been filed and consolidated for adjudication by this Court. First, on March 3, 2015, Southern-Owners filed an action for declaratory judgment for the purpose of determining its rights and obligations under the CGL policy issued by Southern-Owners to Wallace\n   Sprinkler.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Case No. 3:15cv077/MCR/EMT, ECF No. 1. In the operative complaint, Southern-Owners seeks a declaration that it had no duty to defend or indemnify Sabine, Morette, or various other entities against the claims alleged in the state court lawsuit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Case No. 3:16cv110, ECF No. 19. Second, on March 14, 2016, Morette filed a separate action against Southern-Owners, seeking a declaration that both Etheridge Construction and Wallace Sprinkler's CGL policies obligated Southern-Owners to defend and indemnify Morette in the state court lawsuit and alleging breach of contract based on Southern-Owners refusal to provide the requisite defense.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 1. The parties have filed and briefed cross-motions for summary judgment on the same legal issue-whether Southern-Owners owes a duty to defend and indemnify Morette for the claims alleged in the state court lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A district court applies the same legal standards when ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment as it does when only one party files a motion.\n   <em>\n    Certain Underwriters at Lloyds, London Subscribing to Policy No. SA 10092-11581 v.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Morette argues it is entitled to summary judgment because the allegations in the state court lawsuit triggered Southern-Owners' duty to defend and indemnify, which Southern-Owners has refused to do. Southern-Owners opposes Morette's motion and moves for summary judgment in its favor regarding the duty to defend and indemnify. More specifically, Southern-Owners asserts it had no duty to defend or indemnify Morette because the state court lawsuit did not allege \"property damage\" as defined in the CGL policies, and alternatively, the CGL policies' various exclusions operate to preclude coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Duty to Defend\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The question of whether Southern-Owners owes a defense to Morette or the other remaining defendants turns on whether the allegations in the state court lawsuit bring that action within the scope of the CGL policies' coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

In response, Morette argues that the Court also should review the \"Chapter 558 Notice of Defects\" that it contends was incorporated by reference in the state court complaint,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 42-1 (\"Notice 1\"), as well as a \"revised Chapter 558 Notice of Defects\" that was sent to Etheridge Construction and Southern-Owners\n   by Morette on November 11, 2013,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1-6 at 81-82. (\"Notice 2\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   As discussed above, whether an insurer has a duty to defend a lawsuit against its insured generally depends on the allegations in the operative complaint and the terms of the insurance policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Appel v.

The policy specifically excludes from coverage damage to \"[y]our work,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 47, which is defined as \"[w]ork or operations performed by you on your behalf\" and \"[m]aterials, parts or equipment furnished in connection with such work or operations,\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62, 62. Also specifically excluded from coverage is property damage to \"your product,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 47, which includes \"[a]ny goods or products ... manufactured, sold, handled, distributed or disposed of by you,\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Reading these three standard CGL provisions together, Florida courts have consistently held that a claim for the cost of repairing or replacing the insured's defective construction work does not qualify as a claim for \"property damage,\" whereas a claim for the costs of repairing independent damage\n   <em>\n    caused by\n   </em>\n   the insured's defective work is a claim for \"property damage.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Auto-Owners Ins.

Importantly, the term \"property damage\" includes damage wreaked on the work product of a different subcontractor on the same construction project.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carithers v.

In particular, the state court lawsuit alleges,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the \"improper design and construction of floor pavers does not allow for proper drainage,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1-1 at 65, which resulted in clogging of the concrete floor drains,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 42-1 at 4, and caused standing/ponded water throughout the concrete floor cavity underneath the pavers around the Margaritaville structure,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 42-1 at 4-5. There are also allegations of staining and moisture intrusion into the building and its columns, as well as cracks to the concrete flooring and walls, caused by \"[i]mproper joints and sealant of joints.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 1-1 at 65, 42 at 23-25, 32, 42. Etheridge Construction was the subcontractor responsible for the floor pavers at Margaritaville,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1-2 at 56, and Wallace Sprinkler performed the joint and sealant work, see ECF No. 1-5 at 10. Neither Etheridge Construction nor Wallace Sprinkler designed or constructed the concrete floor drains, columns, walls, or flooring.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 1-2 at 56, 1-5 at 10, 51 at 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Thus, the allegations in the state court lawsuit do not solely encompass the cost of repairing or replacing the work of Etheridge Construction and Wallace Sprinkler. Instead, the state court lawsuit alleges additional, independent damage to the non-defective work product of other subcontractors, which was allegedly caused by the faulty workmanship of Etheridge Construction and Wallace Sprinkler. Because these allegations describe \"property damage\" under the CGL policies, the Court finds that the entire state court lawsuit fell within their coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Even where allegations in a complaint fairly and potentially fall within the policy coverage, an insurer has no duty to defend where the complaint shows that a policy exclusion applies.\n   <em>\n    State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Tippett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9292155\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/864/31/#p35\">\n    864 So.2d 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 35 (Fla. 4th DCA 2003). In Florida, an insurer relying on a CGL policy exclusion to deny coverage bears the burden of proving that an exclusion applies.\n   <em>\n    LaFarge Corp. v. Travelers Indem. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"508955\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/118/1511/#p1516\">\n    118 F.3d 1511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1516 (11th Cir. 1997). Southern-Owners argues that even if the state court complaint establishes coverage, three policy exclusions extinguish its duty to defend: the contractual liability exclusion, the impaired property exclusion,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the recall exclusion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that none of these exclusions applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   First, the contractual liability exclusion has no relevance to this case. This exclusion precludes coverage for amounts \"the insured is obligated to pay [as] damages by reason of the assumption of liability in a contract or agreement.\" ECF No. 1-5 at 94. Construing this provision according to its plain meaning, it is clear that the exclusion applies when the insured has assumed another person or entity's liability to a third-party. Both Etheridge Construction and Wallace Sprinkler assumed the obligation to provide non-defective work when they entered into their respective subcontracts with Morette, but neither of them contracted or agreed to assume any other party's liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Subcontracts, ECF No. 1-2 at 56-59, 1-5 at 10-13. Absent such an assumption of liability, the contractual liability exclusion does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The impaired property exclusion also does not preclude coverage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   This exclusion is included in standard CGL policies to prevent an insured from claiming economic losses resulting from its own faulty workmanship, such as loss of use of its own product.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Transcontinental Ins. Co. v. Ice Systems of America, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"171948\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/847/947/#p950\">\n    847 F.Supp. 947\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 950 (M.D. Fla. 1994). In relevant part, the provision excludes from coverage \" 'property damage' to 'impaired property' or property that has not been physically injured, arising out of ... [a] defect, deficiency, inadequacy or dangerous condition in 'your product' or 'your work.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1-5 at 47. As the\n   Court has already determined that the state court lawsuit alleges that Etheridge Construction and Wallace Sprinkler's faulty workmanship caused \"physical injury\" to the work product of other subcontractors, it necessarily follows that the impaired property exclusion, on its face, is inapplicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Finally, the recall exclusion does not apply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   This exclusion, sometimes called the \"sistership exclusion,\" excludes from coverage damages for removal of a product because of known or suspected defects in \"sister\" products.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Auto-Owners Ins.

Its purpose is \"to limit the insurer's exposure in cases where, because of the actual failure of the insured's product, similar products are withdrawn from use to prevent the failure of these other products, which have not yet failed, but are suspected of containing the same defect.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3952379\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/820/1265/#p1271\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In this case, the state court lawsuit does not assert any claim for damage based on remedial measures taken as a result of the withdrawal or recall of any product.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harris Specialty Chemicals, Inc. v.

Therefore, the Court finds that Southern-Owners has not met its burden of demonstrating that the recall exclusion applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In sum, the Court concludes that the state court lawsuit alleged \"property damage\" that fairly and potentially fell within the coverage of Etheridge Construction and Wallace Sprinkler's CGL policies and that none of the policy exclusions invoked by Southern-Owners apply. Accordingly, the Court finds that Southern-Owners owed a duty to defend Morette against the entire state court lawsuit; therefore, Morette is entitled to summary judgment on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    B.
