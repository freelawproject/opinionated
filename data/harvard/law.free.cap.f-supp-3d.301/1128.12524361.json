Andrews may presumably present evidence to a jury of the grievances he filed in the past against Lt. Miner on the issue of Lt. Miner's subjective motive and state of mind.

It noted, in the context presented, that \"[t]he lack of a clearly defined standard by which to judge such claims, and the nature of the claim as based primarily on the credibility of each party, would likely lead to widespread litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4251057\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/818/1194/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4251057\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/818/1194/\">\n    at 1211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The same holds true for Andrews's First Amendment retaliation claim. In the \u00a7 1983 context, a plaintiff must present evidence of a retaliatory animus on the part of the defendant, i.e., \"the defendant was subjectively motivated to [take action] against the plaintiff for exercising his First Amendment rights.\"\n   <em>\n    O'Bryant v. Finch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4197673\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/637/1207/#p1219\">\n    637 F.3d 1207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1219 (11th Cir. 2011) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Moton v. Cowart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4084909\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/631/1337/#p1341\">\n    631 F.3d 1337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1341 (11th Cir. 2011). Andrews claims Lt. Miner used excessive force on him because Andrews filed grievances against Lt. Miner. If this Court allows an implied\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy for First Amendment retaliation by use of excessive force, it could lead to the unwanted result of inmates filing grievances against correctional officers and then claiming that any use of force by the officers resulted from retaliatory animus. Any increase in suits by inmates necessarily involves increased litigation costs to the Government and burdens on the individual employees who must defend such claims. First Amendment retaliation claims, requiring inquiry into a defendant's subjective state of mind, often would present genuine issues of material fact not easily resolved on summary judgment. This, in turn, would necessitate trials and further increase litigation costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The threshold is low on this issue: all that a \"special factor counselling hesitation\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   must do is \"cause a court to hesitate before answering [the question of whether to imply a new\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy] in the affirmative.\"\n   <em>\n    Abbasi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604999\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1843/\">\n    137 S.Ct. at 1858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because this Court finds reason to hesitate in extending the reach of\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   in this context, it will not allow Andrews's\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   First Amendment retaliation claim to proceed to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Lt. Miner's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings as to Andrews's First Amendment retaliation claim. (Doc. 107.) That claim is hereby\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   . Andrews's remaining Eighth Amendment excessive force claims against Lt. Miner will proceed to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    DONE\n   </strong>\n   AND\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   ON AUGUST 25, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    The motion was filed on behalf of all Defendants, but all except for Lt.
