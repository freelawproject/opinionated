Cobb, III to Produce Documents and Testify at Deposition (ECF No. 104). Defendants filed a timely response to the Objection on September 15, 2017 (ECF No. 140). On October 13, 2017, this Court entered an Order (ECF No. 145) overruling United Bank's Objection.

VCB, and now United Bank, had been a creditor of the estate of John D. Buckingham (\"John\") and of John's business, Sun Control Systems, Inc. (\"SCS\"). ECF No. 16 \u00b6 8. United Bank alleges that John's son, Defendant David Buckingham (\"David\"), in his capacity as guardian of John's property, transferred the ownership and changed the beneficiaries of certain life insurance policies to remove the value of the policies from John's estate, the estate of Elizabeth (\"Betty\") Buckingham, David's mother, and SCS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1. These changes were made, United Bank claims, \"for the purposes of hindering, evading and/or defrauding\" United Bank.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1. United Bank asserts that the transfer of ownership and change of beneficiaries to David, in his personal capacity and as trustee of the Osprey Trust and the Blue Heron Trust, both of which were created just before the changes of ownership and beneficiaries, were fraudulent conveyances under the Maryland Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act (\"MUFCA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20Com.%20Law%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2015-201\">\n    Md.

He ruled from the bench, denying the Motion. ECF No. 129. As stated at the hearing, Judge Sullivan concluded that the Motion to Compel should be denied because United Bank had not \"made out a prima facie case of fraud such that the crime fraud exception could apply.\" ECF No. 130 at 53. He held that, even assuming that a conveyance deemed fraudulent under the MUFCA can trigger the crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege (which this Court has not yet determined), United Bank had failed to make the requisite prima facie showing of fraud to pierce the privilege.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20Com.%20Law%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2015-201\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20Com.%20Law%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2015-201\">\n    at 53-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It bases its Objection on three grounds, arguing that Judge Sullivan erred in holding that: (1) a fraudulent conveyance does not warrant application of the crime-fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege under Maryland law; (2) United Bank did not establish a prima facie case of \"fraud\" because it failed to produce evidence of \"deception, dishonesty, misrepresentation, falsification, or forgery\" and thus the crime-fraud exception does not apply; and (3) the Defendants did not impliedly waive the attorney-client privilege.

Application of the Crime-Fraud Exception to Fraudulent Conveyances\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Regarding its first challenge, United Bank argues that Judge Sullivan incorrectly concluded that the crime-fraud exception cannot be triggered by a conveyance deemed fraudulent by statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 135-1 at 5. It asserts that Judge Sullivan misconstrued Maryland legal precedent on the issue to conclude erroneously that the exception is to be construed narrowly and disregarded the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Husky.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3381817\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/95/704/#p709\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   It is United Bank, however, that has misconstrued the applicable law. As the Defendants point out in their Opposition, ECF No. 140 at 3, Judge Sullivan did not rule categorically that statutory fraudulent conveyances are insufficient to warrant application of the exception. Judge Sullivan stated that \"to the extent that the transactions might constitute fraudulent conveyances under the Maryland Uniform Fraudulent Conveyances Act, I do not find that this type of fraud is sufficient for the application of the crime fraud exception.\" He did not reach a categorical conclusion that fraudulent conveyances can\n   <em>\n    never\n   </em>\n   trigger the exception, but rather that a conveyance deemed fraudulent by statute does not\n   <em>\n    necessarily\n   </em>\n   trigger the exception. ECF No. 130 at 54. For an alleged conveyance deemed fraudulent under the statute to trigger application of the exception, the allegations must present sufficient evidence of \"deception, dishonesty, misrepresentation, falsification, or forgery.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3381817\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/95/704/#p709\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As it is true that not all fruits are apples, so also it is true that not all conveyances deemed fraudulent by statute trigger the exception, even if some might.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   This conclusion is in line with both Supreme Court and Maryland precedent. Although United Bank argues that Judge Sullivan gave no weight to\n   <em>\n    Husky\n   </em>\n   , it advocates for too much weight. United Bank is correct that the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Husky\n   </em>\n   held that \"actual fraud\" can include fraudulent conveyance schemes, even those that do not involve a false representation.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4259915\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1581/#p1586\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But, nowhere did the Court say that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   fraudulent conveyances constitute actual fraud. The Court explained that \"actual fraud\" by definition requires \"wrongful intent,\" and therefore by logic can only encompass conveyances deemed fraudulent by statute that are done with wrongful intent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4259915\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1581/#p1586\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4259915\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1581/#p1586\">\n    at 1586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By the Court's own distinction, \"implied\" fraud or fraud \"in law\" are insufficient to trigger an exception without a showing of actual fraud.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4259915\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1581/#p1586\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4259915\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1581/#p1586\">\n    at 1586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   United Bank argues that because it is alleging that the fraudulent conveyances at issue in this case were done\n   <em>\n    intentionally\n   </em>\n   , that should be enough to pierce the attorney-client privilege. ECF No. 135-1 at 12. United Bank argues that by requiring a showing of \"deception, dishonesty, misrepresentation, falsification, or forgery,\" Judge Sullivan inappropriately imposed an additional burden.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4259915\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1581/#p1586\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It points to the holding by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Husky\n   </em>\n   \"that the term 'actual fraud' as used in Section 523(a)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code included transfers done to 'hinder, delay or defraud' creditors,\" the same language employed by the MUFCA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Md.%20Code%20Ann.%2C%20Com.%20Law%20%C2%A7%2015-207\">\n    Md. Code Ann., Com. Law \u00a7 15-207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, United Bank argues, if \"[p]laintiffs have demonstrated to the Court's satisfaction that the challenged transfers were done with wrongful intent, then, under\n   <em>\n    Husky\n   </em>\n   , the Court would be effectively ruling that Plaintiff must make out a prima facie case of something more than 'actual fraud' \" if it must also show \"deception, dishonesty, misrepresentation, falsification, or forgery\" to trigger the exception. ECF No. 142 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   What United Bank fails to understand is that Judge Sullivan only concluded that it had failed to demonstrate that the challenged transfers were done with\n   <em>\n    wrongful intent\n   </em>\n   , despite its blanket assertions that they were \"intentional.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 142. Judge Sullivan merely assumed for the sake of argument \"that the transactions at issue were invalid under Maryland law,\" ECF No. 130 at 53-54, not that they had been done with the requisite intent to constitute\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   fraud. Judge Sullivan's finding that United Bank failed to make a showing of \"deception, dishonesty, misrepresentation, falsification, or forgery\" to bring the transactions into the actual fraud category, therefore, is entirely consistent with\n   <em>\n    Husky.\n   </em>\n   He merely recognized the fundamental difference between a transaction done with wrongful intent, and thus actual fraud, and a transaction done without wrongful intent, and thus only implied fraud, despite both transactions constituting \"fraudulent conveyances\" under the MUFCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   This conclusion is fully supported by Maryland case law. United Bank correctly summarizes the precedent regarding application of the exception, but misconstrues it. Although the Court of Appeals of Maryland has never ruled that conveyances deemed fraudulent under the MUFCA warrant application of the crime-fraud exception, there is nothing in the case law to suggest that it would \"decline to apply the crime-fraud exception to communications relating to an\n   <em>\n    intentional\n   </em>\n   fraudulent conveyance under Com. Law. Art., \u00a7 15-207.\" ECF No. 135-1 at 6 (emphasis in original). Again, however, United Bank misrepresents Judge Sullivan's reliance on Maryland case law. In finding that the Court of Appeals, first in\n   <em>\n    Newman\n   </em>\n   and then in\n   <em>\n    BAA\n   </em>\n   , had held that the crime-fraud exception should be viewed narrowly,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 130 at 54-55, Judge Sullivan also was not saying that all statutory fraudulent conveyances can never trigger the exception. Furthermore, Judge Sullivan's rejection of\n   <em>\n    Koch\n   </em>\n   as a helpful analogue for this case,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 130 at 55, was not a rejection of the exception's application in fraudulent conveyance cases generally. Instead, because\n   <em>\n    Koch\n   </em>\n   involved assistance by the defendant's in-house counsel in the alleged false representations themselves,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5662031\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/437/362/#p376\">\n    437 F.Supp.2d at 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Koch\n   </em>\n   was a clear case of actual fraud that warranted application of the exception, unlike in this case where there has been no showing of assistance in \"the perpetration of falsehood\" on the part of Mr. Cobb.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 130 at 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Prima Facie Case of Actual Fraud\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   This brings us to United Bank's second challenge to Judge Sullivan's ruling, i.e., that \"[United Bank] did not establish a prima facie case of 'fraud' to warrant application of the crime fraud exception, and specifically, [United Bank] was required to produce evidence of 'deception, dishonesty, misrepresentation, falsification, or forgery.' \" ECF No. 135-1 at 5. Although, as discussed above, the Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Husky\n   </em>\n   that a qualifying fraudulent conveyance to constitute actual fraud need not include a false representation, there still needs to be a showing that the alleged fraud was more than implied fraud, i.e., that it included\n   <em>\n    wrongful intent.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   In order to invoke the crime/fraud exception, the movant must make a prima facie showing that the communications were either made for an unlawful purpose or that the communications reflect ongoing or future unlawful activity.

These facts include: (1) \"the transfers of the interests in the policies\"; (2) \"the insolvency and enormous debt of SCS\"; (3) \"the relationship between the transferor and transferee in the transactions that conveyed the interests in the policies at issue (David was both the transferor and transferee)\"; (4) \"the pendency or threat of litigation, (i.e. creditor collection actions by Plaintiff)\"; and (5) \"the transfer of the debtor's entire estate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As sufficient indicia of fraud, United Bank asserts that it has shown that \"(i) Defendants implemented an intentional plan to preserve the value in the insurance policies for family members rather than expose the assets to creditors and (ii) Calvin Cobb's services were used\n   <em>\n    in furtherance\n   </em>\n   of that plan.\" ECF No. 142 at 6 (emphasis in original).

In this case, unlike in\n   <em>\n    CR-RSC Tower I, LLC\n   </em>\n   , both Susan's and David's references to Mr. Cobb were done so only as shields, as protection against disclosing privileged material. Nowhere in the cited statements do the Defendants attempt to use those communications with Mr. Cobb as a defense of wrongful conduct taken. In response to the question posed to David about the legal fees, David does not assert that he made his decision based on communications with Mr. Cobb or that the decision was done in good faith as justified by his consultation with Mr. Cobb, unlike the defendants in\n   <em>\n    CR-RSC Tower I, LLC\n   </em>\n   who attempted to use their communications with their attorneys to prove they acted in good faith.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715451\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/429/387/#p435\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715451\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/429/387/#p435\">\n    at 440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715451\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/429/387/#p435\">\n    56 A.3d at 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this crucial way, the Defendants' invocation of the attorney-client privilege was done only as a shield, the traditional and protected use of the privilege, and not as a sword to deny wrongdoing or as affirmative justification for their allegedly wrongful conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   This case, then, fits under the distinction articulated in\n   <em>\n    Fraidin v.

Rather, because his liability was premised on \"his alleged conduct in inducing the [plaintiffs] to discharge their counsel by making counsel's discharge a condition of the settlement,\" an action the defendant denied he took, his reference to the advice of his counsel could not constitute a waiver.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2344893\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/93/168/#p228\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2344893\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/93/168/#p228\">\n    at 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2344893\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/93/168/#p228\">\n    611 A.2d at 1076\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
