(\"Elysium\"). (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 26 [First Amended Complaint, hereinafter \"FAC\"].) Elysium counterclaims for breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, fraudulent inducement, declaratory judgment of patent misuse, and unlawful and unfair business practices in violation of California's Unfair Competition Law (\"UCL\"), California Business &amp; Professions Code \u00a7\u00a7 17200\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   . (Dkt. 31 [First Amended Counterclaims, hereinafter \"CC\"].) Before the Court is Elysium's motion to dismiss ChromaDex's fourth, fifth, and sixth amended claims, (Dkt. 30), and ChromaDex's motion to dismiss Elysium's third, fourth, and fifth amended counterclaims, (Dkt. 34). For the following reasons, Elysium's motion is GRANTED IN SUBSTANTIAL PART and ChromaDex's motion is GRANTED IN PART.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"ChromaDex is Elysium's sole supplier of the two active ingredients in Elysium's only product: a dietary supplement named 'Basis.' Specifically, ChromaDex supplies Elysium with NIAGEN\u00ae, a patented, proprietary health ingredient that is comprised of nicotinamide riboside ('NR'), and pTeroPure\u00ae, a patented, proprietary health ingredient made of pterostilbene, in return for product payments and sales royalties for NIAGEN.\" (FAC \u00b6 2.) ChromaDex is apparently the sole commercial supplier of NR. ( CC \u00b6 4.) Elysium began discussions with ChromaDex to obtain a supply of NR in the summer of 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) Elysium expressed concern regarding ChromaDex's \"onerous\" terms, such as \"upfront cash payments, minimum purchase commitments, royalties and even equity positions from businesses seeking to use ChromaDex as a source for the supply of [NR].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.) After negotiating and exchanging draft agreements in November and December 2013, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43-54), the parties entered into a NIAGEN (NR) Supply Agreement on February 3, 2014, a Trademark License and Royalty Agreement on February 3, 2014, and a pTeroPure (pterostilbene) Supply Agreement on June 26, 2014. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 16-18;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201836\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Exs. A-D.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to ChromaDex, ChromaDex and Elysium's commercial arrangement was \"expanding but unremarkable\" prior to June 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) Then, in the first quarter of 2016, Elysium ordered nearly double the amount of NIAGEN it had ordered in all of 2015, and in the second quarter of 2016, Elysium first raised concerns about pricing under the NIAGEN Supply Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.) Elysium allegedly refused or ignored ChromaDex's offers to resolve its concerns, however. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) On June 28, 2016, \"without any prior discussion or advance notification, Elysium submitted two extraordinarily large purchase orders for NIAGEN and pTeroPure.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) These orders were approximately four times larger than any previous orders and more than double the sum of all Elysium's prior orders. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) They also included a demand for two products at less than half of the previously agreed upon price. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   ChromaDex set up a call with Elysium about the price of these orders on June 30, 2016, and Elysium allegedly stated that because it was \"ramping up,\" Elysium expected to use all of its ordered products over the next few months and would place additional large orders in the third and fourth quarters of 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24-27.) Based on this representation, ChromaDex offered Elysium a discounted price for NIAGEN, which Elysium was \"not entirely satisfied with\" but accepted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-29.) ChromaDex alleges that Elysium \"intended to induce ChromaDex to inadvertently supply large amounts of NIAGEN and pTeroPure to Elysium at grossly discounted prices.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) ChromaDex filled the orders on July 1 and August 9, 2016, and sent Elysium invoices totaling $2,983,350. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30-31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On August 10, 2016, however, Elysium informed ChromaDex that it would not pay the past due invoices until other concerns raised on the June 30, 2016, call were resolved according to Elysium's terms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.) Elysium has allegedly refused to pay the amount due or engage in discussions about a resolution. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.) Elysium apparently has not ramped up its business or placed additional orders with ChromaDex as promised. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) ChromaDex further alleges that Elysium's false promises were motivated by the fact that it \"was seeking financing during the middle of 2016 and at least into November 2016, [and] has been able to improve its balance sheet by continuing to sell its product for millions of dollars in revenue without paying ChromaDex a dime for the supply, likely engaging in fictional book keeping and deceiving potential or actual investors about Elysium's financial condition.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Accordingly, Elysium has allegedly breached the pTeroPure Supply Agreement by failing to pay 30% of the amount due within 30 days of the date of the invoices and the remainder within 60 days of the date of the invoices, and it has allegedly breached the NIAGEN Supply Agreement by failing to pay the amount due within 30 days of the invoice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45-56.) Under the terms of the Royalty Agreement, Elysium has also breached its obligation to pay royalties to ChromaDex based on its net sales of its product containing NIAGEN and to furnish quarterly reports detailing such royalties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 57-67.) ChromaDex estimates these royalties will amount to no less than $1 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Elysium also allegedly conspired with two ChromaDex employees, Mark Morris (Vice President of Business Development) and Ryan Dellinger (Director of Scientific Affairs), to steal ChromaDex's \"confidential and proprietary information\" to injure ChromaDex for Elysium's benefit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 68-72.) Morris allegedly informed Elysium of ChromaDex's \"confidential business dealings and information ChromaDex had acquired about one or more potential partners\" on or around April 28, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73.) \"On or around May 25, 2016, Morris made an unusual request for the contact information for one of ChromaDex's research partners from Dellinger, which Dellinger provided. Less than a month later, on or around June 24, 2016, Dellinger was contacted by that ChromaDex partner, who informed him that he had been contacted by Elysium. Dellinger encouraged that ChromaDex partner to talk with Elysium and did not inform anyone at ChromaDex about Elysium's activity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74.) Morris resigned from ChromaDex on\n   July 16, 2016, and shortly thereafter joined Elysium. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75.) Dellinger resigned from ChromaDex the same day Elysium notified ChromaDex that it would not pay the past due invoices (August 10, 2016), and joined Elysium soon after. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76.) ChromaDex alleges that Morris and Dellinger disclosed additional proprietary and confidential business information, but the full extent is not now known and \"can only be uncovered through discovery.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Based on these allegations, ChromaDex brings claims for breach of the pTeroPure supply agreement, breach of the NIAGEN supply agreement, breach of the Royalty agreement, fraudulent deceit, and misappropriation of trade secrets under both state and federal law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 79-121.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Elysium's counterclaims, in turn, stem from its allegations that \"ChromaDex has committed patent misuse and engaged in unfair competition by leveraging its market power in the supply of [NR] to impose conditions on its customers that impermissibly broaden the scope of the patent grant with anticompetitive effect.\" ( CC \u00b6 6.) ChromaDex's market power apparently comes from, among other things, patents it has in-licensed relating to NR, including U.S. Patent Nos. 8,383,086 (\"the '086 patent\"), 8,197,807 (\"the '807 patent\"), 8,106,184 (\"the '184 patent\"), 8,114,626 (\"the '626 patent\"), and 7,776,326 (\"the '326 patent\"), which are assigned to third parties and exclusively licensed to ChromaDex. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32, 35-36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Elysium alleges that ChromaDex has conditioned its sale of NIAGEN on purchasers' agreement to license ChromaDex trademarks and pay substantial royalties as a result. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) Elysium claims that ChromaDex conditioned the execution of the NIAGEN Supply Agreement on Elysium's simultaneous execution of the License and Royalty Agreement, \"which forces Elysium to pay a substantial royalty to ChromaDex on all Elysium products containing ingredients supplied by ChromaDex under the [NIAGEN] Supply Agreement, even if Elysium does not use, and does not want to use, any ChromaDex marks.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) \"Not only is the royalty obligation unconnected to use of ChromaDex's trademarks, but the royalty rate also changes for reasons unrelated to use of any trademarks. Instead, for example, the royalty rate increases as Elysium's annual worldwide net sales of products containing ingredients supplied by ChromaDex increases,\" which provides \"additional means for ChromaDex to protect its market power in [NR], unlawfully extend ChromaDex's patent monopoly, and adversely affect competition.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 57, 59.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Elysium claims that to induce Elysium to sign the License and Royalty agreement, ChromaDex falsely insisted that all of its NR customers must sign similar agreements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) \"In reliance on ChromaDex's false representation that it required all of its customers to execute trademark license and royalty agreements, Elysium concluded that the issue was non-negotiable, and instead focused its efforts on negotiating the other provisions of the [NIAGEN] Supply Agreement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Elysium contends that ChromaDex also breached the NIAGEN Supply Agreement, under which Elysium is \"entitled to receive pricing on [NR] that is at least as favorable as the price at which ChromaDex supplies [NR] or a substantially similar product to other purchasers, but never more than a certain maximum price\" (the \"MFN Provision\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) On June 13, 2016, in response to a request from Elysium for information regarding ChromaDex's compliance with the MFN Provision, ChromaDex allegedly provided Elysium with a \"manipulated and misleading Excel spreadsheet\" which purported to \"list the prices at which ChromaDex was selling\n   [NR] to purchasers other than Elysium under various supply agreements.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) The spreadsheet was supposed to omit the identity of ChromaDex's other customers, but inadvertently included two tabs containing \"unblinded\" sheets, which listed additional customers that ChromaDex omitted from the \"blinded\" sheets, and purportedly showed that ChromaDex had agreed to sell NR to other purchasers at a price more favorable than the price given to Elysium. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.) \"On a June 30, 2016 phone call with two of Elysium's co-founders, Eric Marcotulli and Dan Alminana, [ChromaDex's CEO, Frank Jaksch] confirmed that other purchasers of [NR] had been paying a price substantially lower than Elysium had been paying, in violation of the MFN Provision.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) The spreadsheet also apparently revealed that not all ChromaDex customers were required to sign license and royalty agreements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) \"[A]t least one of these customers, in ChromaDex's own words, 'pre-dates Elysium.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68.) For this reason, Elysium submitted purchase orders for 3000 kg of NR and 580 kg of pterostilbene on June 30, 2016, \"with the understanding that ChromaDex would promptly issue a refund or credit to Elysium on account of ChromaDex's breach of the MFN Provision.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   After submitting the June 30 Purchase Orders, Elysium discovered that other products containing both NR and pterostilbene or NR and resveratrol, a product substantially similar to pterostilbene, were being sold on the market by other ChromaDex customers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) ChromaDex was apparently even \"actively recommending to other customers that they create such products to compete with Elysium's Basis, in violation of the Exclusivity Provision\" in the NIAGEN Supply Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As a result, Elysium has counterclaimed for breach of the NIAGEN Supply Agreement, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing relating to the NIAGEN Supply Agreement, fraudulent inducement relating to the License and Royalty Agreement, declaratory judgment of patent misuse, and unlawful and unfair business practices in violation of the UCL. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 89-122.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    III. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) tests the legal sufficiency of the claims asserted in the complaint. The issue on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is not whether the claimant will ultimately prevail, but whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the claims asserted.\n   <em>\n    Gilligan v.

(Dkt. 30-1 at 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    1.

To the extent ChromaDex contends that Elysium did not\n   <em>\n    in fact\n   </em>\n   rely on the misrepresentation because it would have had no choice if it wanted to procure NR from the only available supplier (ChromaDex), this argument improperly asks Court to wade into the merits of Elysium's claims.

Unquestionably, a licensee must pay if he uses the patent. Equally, however, he may insist upon paying only for use, and not on the basis of total sales, including products\n   in which he may use a competing patent or in which no patented ideas are used at all. There is nothing in the right granted the patentee to keep others from using, selling, or manufacturing his invention which empowers him to insist on payment not only for use but also for producing products which do not employ his discoveries at all.\"). That ChromaDex has not threatened Elysium with patent infringement is immaterial.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Miotox LLC v.

Cal. May 5, 2015) (\"Allergan has alleged that Miotox is seeking royalties on all sales of Botox for the treatment of migraine headaches even though the original '468 Patent has expired. The '468 Patent covered the broad treatment of migraine headaches using Botox. Miotox demands that Allergan pay the same royalties now, after the expiration of the '468 Patent, as it did previously, regardless of the scope of the New Patents, which are narrower. Under the patent misuse principles articulated in\n   <em>\n    Zenith\n   </em>\n   , the Court finds that Allergan has adequately stated a claim for relief.\" (internal citations omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   ChromaDex next argues that the patent misuse counterclaim fails because ChromaDex's alleged conduct-that it conditioned access to its products (through an implied license) on the purchase from ChromaDex of a trademark license-does not amount to an illegal tying arrangement. (Dkt. 34-1 at 12-13.) ChromaDex asserts that the trademark rights under the express terms of the Trademark License and Royalty Agreement are \"wholly optional\" and Elysium need not use the trademarks, but instead must pay royalties on products sales \"to compensate ChromaDex for that portion of the product purchase price that Elysium claimed it could not afford to pay upfront, when it placed a purchase order.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.) This argument fails because Elysium does not complain that it was forced to\n   <em>\n    use\n   </em>\n   the licensed trademarks, only that it was forced to\n   <em>\n    buy\n   </em>\n   the license for the trademarks in order to have access to NR. ( CC \u00b6\u00b6 6, 48.) This is sufficient for a tying claim.\n   <em>\n    Eastman Kodak Co. v. Image Tech.

However, as Elysium points out, ChromaDex has conflated the test for product separability in the antitrust context with that in the patent misuse context. (Dkt. 38 at 17-18.) \"The law of patent misuse in licensing need not look to consumer demand (which may be non-existent) but need look only to the nature of the claimed invention as the basis for determining whether a product is a necessary concomitant of the invention or an entirely separate product.\"\n   <em>\n    Senza-Gel Corp. v.

Cir. 1986). The Court agrees that here, the patents, and the supply of NR, are entirely different products from ChromaDex's NIAGEN trademark, which Elysium does not use. \"The NIAGEN mark is not essential to the sale, supply or use of NR; a\n   seller could call NR by many names, including different brand names or just the chemical name, using 'NR' or 'nicotinamide riboside' to describe the product.\" (Dkt. 38 at 18.)

UCL\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   ChromaDex argues that Elysium fails to adequately plead a violation of the UCL, (Dkt. 34-1 at 21-24), which is premised on three of ChromaDex's alleged acts: (1) \"conditioning its supply of [NR] on the purchaser's agreement to license ChromaDex's trademarks,\" (CC \u00b6 117); (2) \"stepping up the royalty rates tied to its supply of [NR] as its patent and market power decreases,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 118); and (3) \"breaches of the NR Supply, its active and deliberate concealment of those breaches from Elysium, and its attempt to defraud Elysium by its presentation to Elysium of the Fraudulent Spreadsheet,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 119). Elysium alleges that \"ChromaDex has violated patent law and policy by committing patent misuse as a consequence of one or more of these acts or practices\" and that \"[t]hese acts or practices constitute unlawful and/or unfair acts or practices under California's state law of unfair competition.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 120-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Linear Tech.

In\n   <em>\n    Linear\n   </em>\n   , however, the Court affirmed dismissal of the plaintiff's UCL claim because the alleged victims were \"neither competitors nor powerless, unwary consumers,\" but rather were \"corporate customers ..., 'each of which presumably has the resources to seek damages or other relief.' \"\n   <em>\n    Linear Tech.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3812768\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/152/115/\">\n    152 Cal.App.4th at 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=61%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20221\">\n    61 Cal.Rptr.3d 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
