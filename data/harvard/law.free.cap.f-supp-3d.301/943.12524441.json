Wright, United States District Judge\n   Plaintiffs Professional Portable X-Ray, Inc. (PPX), and Evolve, Inc., seek, among other things, a declaratory judgment that PPX owns the copyright in certain computer software and that Defendants' registered copyright in that software is invalid. Defendants move to dismiss this aspect of Plaintiffs' complaint. For the reasons addressed below, the Court grants Defendants' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   PPX provides portable digital diagnostic imaging services to correctional facilities, nursing homes, and other long-term care facilities. In September 1999, PPX requested a proposal from Defendant Brad Nelson for the development of computer software that would allow PPX customers to transmit certain information over the Internet. On September 14, 1999, Orion Services LTD and Kern Consulting Inc., which are companies respectively owned at the time by Nelson and Defendant Ken Kern, submitted a proposal to PPX to develop \"Business Nursing Home Services\" software. The 1999 Proposal outlined a two-step development process and provided that the developed software \"shall be the property of PPX once the [$25,000] development costs are paid,\" and that \"[a]ny proceeds of the resale of the custom developed software ... shall go to PPX after paying Orion Services LTD, and Kern Consulting a 25% royalty fee.\" The 1999 Proposal expired after 60 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Nelson and Kern founded Defendant WebInterstate in June 2000 \"for the purpose of developing PPX's custom software.\" PPX thereafter \"worked closely\" with WebInterstate to \"define and design ... software specifications.\" On April 4, 2002, PPX signed a \"Web Application Proposal\" submitted by WebInterstate. The 2002 Proposal details PPX's interest in the creation of a web-based application, outlines the core features of the application, includes a timeline for its development, and establishes a development cost of $35,250. The 2002 Proposal is not signed by Nelson, Kern, or WebInterstate. PPX paid WebInterstate; and the custom software, MediMatrix, was released in or about July 2002. PPX thereafter paid WebInterstate to host and manage the software.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In December 2002, PPX asked WebInterstate to \"update the MediMatrix software\" and subsequently \"worked closely\" with WebInterstate to develop the update. WebInterstate completed MediMatrixII on or about April 1, 2004, but WebInterstate returned PPX's payment for the software update without explanation. In January 2005, WebInterstate advised PPX that the monthly hosting fee had been discounted because PPX was \"a good customer for [MediMatrixII].\" WebInterstate stated that the discounts would continue until PPX received $25,000. PPX objected, fearing that WebInterstate was attempting to acquire ownership of MediMatrix.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   WebInterstate subsequently requested that PPX sign a \"MediMatrix Software Services Agreement\" and \"MediMatrix2 sales commission agreement.\" PPX declined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 21, 2005, without PPX's knowledge or permission, Nelson and Kern registered a copyright in MediMatrixII-Registration Number TX0006175487. Nelson and Kern identified themselves as the sole authors of the copyright, registered the entire source code for MediMatrix, and\n   did not designate MediMatrixII as either a derivative of or an adaptation of MediMatrix.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   PPX commissioned a separate developer in 2008 to create Lattice Pro, a software replacement of MediMatrix. Lattice Pro does not use any of MediMatrix's source code. Plaintiff Evolve, Inc., was incorporated on or about March 10, 2009, for the purpose of owning and marketing Lattice Pro. In November 2009, WebInterstate threatened to stop hosting MediMatrix unless PPX signed a service agreement. PPX \"acquiesced,\" and both PPX and WebInterstate signed the MediMatrix Software Services Agreement on November 23, 2009. This agreement classifies WebInterstate as an independent contractor, provides PPX a license to use MediMatrix, and acknowledges that MediMatrix is a \"valuable trade secret[ ] of WebInterstate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   WebInterstate sent PPX a cease and desist letter on May 12, 2017, alleging that Lattice Pro infringes on WebInterstate's copyright in the MediMatrix software. On July 3, 2017, PPX and Evolve filed this action seeking, as relevant here, a declaratory judgment that PPX owns MediMatrix and that Nelson and Kern's copyright in MediMatrix is invalid. Defendants move to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Declaratory Judgment Act provides for a declaration of \"the rights and other legal relations of any interested party . whether or not further relief is or could be sought.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Because PPX commissioned the creation of MediMatrix as a work for hire, Plaintiffs allege, PPX's ownership interest in MediMatrix is established. Plaintiffs alternatively assert that the 1999 Proposal transferred Defendants' copyright ownership in MediMatrix to PPX. The Court addresses each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Work for Hire under the Copyright Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   PPX owns MediMatrix, Plaintiffs contend, because PPX commissioned Defendants to create the software as a work for hire under the Copyright Act.

Because the 1999 Proposal states that the developed software \"shall be the property of PPX\" and the 2002 Proposal details the creation of the software, Plaintiffs argue, the parties clearly intended a work-for-hire relationship. But neither the 1999 Proposal nor the 2002 Proposal is a written instrument signed by both parties. The 1999 Proposal is not signed by\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   party. And only PPX signed the 2002 Proposal. Plaintiffs do not cite, nor has the Court identified, any legal authority for Plaintiffs' theory that multiple documents when read together can satisfy\n   the written-instrument requirement of the Copyright Act. Moreover, stitching together multiple documents to ascertain implied intent is at odds with both the language and purpose of the Copyright Act's work-for-hire provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515665\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/969/410/#p412\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (explaining the importance of the written-instrument requirement to effectuate the purpose of the Copyright Act).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs nevertheless contend that general principles of contract interpretation cure their apparent failure to allege facts that satisfy the written-instrument requirement. Plaintiffs cite\n   <em>\n    Nimmer on Copyright\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that \"the vast bulk of copyright contractual issues must be resolved under state law,\n   <em>\n    given the silence of the Copyright Act\n   </em>\n   in addressing such issues.\" 1 Melville B. Nimmer &amp; David Nimmer,\n   <em>\n    Nimmer on Copyright\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1.01(B)(3)(a) (2013) (emphasis added). But the Copyright Act is not silent in addressing this issue. The Copyright Act expressly requires both parties to sign a written instrument to create a work-for-hire relationship.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Assuming without deciding that general principles of contract interpretation apply to these circumstances, such principles do not cure Plaintiffs' failure to satisfy the statutory written-instrument requirement.

But, akin to Plaintiffs' work-for-hire contention, this argument fails because Defendants did not sign the 1999 Proposal. Instead, the 1999 Proposal was submitted on behalf of distinct, non-party entities. Plaintiffs allege that WebInterstate was created for the express purpose of developing MediMatrix in June 2000-a date that is after the 1999 Proposal was submitted. Although Plaintiffs allege that WebInterstate assumed the obligations of the 1999 Proposal when it agreed in the 2002 Proposal to develop MediMatrix, the 2002 Proposal neither incorporates nor references the 1999 Proposal. Moreover, as addressed in Part I,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the 1999 Proposal and 2002 Proposal are inconsistent and cannot be read together. Finally, the statement in the 1999 Proposal that the developed software \"shall be the property of PPX\" is not a clear and unequivocal transfer of copyright ownership.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20202\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (providing that ownership of a material object is distinct from copyright ownership);\n   <em>\n    Saxon v.
