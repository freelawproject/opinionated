After the search, if the occupants are being cooperative, they are allowed a brief time to gather items such as money, jewelry, medication, keys, phones, and documents.

Occupants are then directed to exit the property and to wait outside....

When all appropriate property has been removed from the dwelling and placed in the public space, the DUSM[s] will turn the premises over to the landlord, and the landlord will sign the writ and acknowledge receipt of the premises.

DUSM Hunt and I tried to explain to Plaintiff that she could not reenter the apartment, but she would not listen and continued to attempt to bypass me to reenter the apartment. Initially, I merely tried to block Plaintiff's reentry, but then she had to be placed in restraints because she continued to struggle to get past us. I placed the restraints on her to protect her from injury and to reduce the need to maintain physical control by placing my hands on her. She continued to struggle, yell, and kick, and we eventually placed her on the ground and placed leg restraints on her to attempt to prevent further kicking. Plaintiff continued to try to kick once restrained. She continued to move about outside while restrained.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   14.

I recall first interacting with Plaintiff at the entrance to her apartment or the landing area, while... DUSMs Shanks and Tyler entered the apartment to clear it. Plaintiff was arguing and yelling and was kicking DUSM Alford and me as she tried to reenter the apartment. We tried to explain to Plaintiff that she could not reenter the apartment, but she continued to try to reenter. Because of Plaintiff's struggling to reenter the apartment, she was handcuffed, but she continued to kick at us and struggle. At some point, a deputy (I believe Frank Tyler) retrieved leg restraints and we placed them on Plaintiff. However, she continued struggling and trying to kick. We sat Plaintiff on the steps to try to keep her from continuing to go back in the apartment and struggle with us.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   9. As Plaintiff was being evicted, she was not allowed to reenter the apartment. Also as a matter of officer safety, as well as to effectuate the Writ, tenants are not allowed to reenter the apartment once removed, particularly when they are being disruptive. Accordingly, to keep Plaintiff from reentering the apartment and from assaulting officers, she was restrained with handcuffs and leg restraints.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.

Instead, plaintiff rests on the allegations of her amended complaint and unsupported assertions that the appearance of Hughes' title and name on the writ proves that Hughes himself was present for and participated in the eviction, and the alleged constitutional violations occurring at that time. Plaintiff's claim against Hughes fails because she has not demonstrated Hughes' personal involvement in the alleged unconstitutional activity.

Defendants demonstrate the existence of a valid writ of restitution issued by the L &amp; T Court, and their efforts to verify that plaintiff's eviction should have proceeded as scheduled on April 20, 2012, a date well within the 75-day period the USMS could have executed it. Their supporting declarations show that plaintiff cooperated initially, and was allowed to retrieve some property and to change clothes. Only after she was escorted out of the apartment did she begin to argue with and yell at the DUSMs. In addition, DUSMs Alford and Hunt aver that plaintiff attempted to reenter the apartment even after they told her she could not; so persistent was she that DUSM Alford could not simply block plaintiff's reentry.

He and the eviction team arrived at plaintiff's former residence for the purpose of executing a valid writ of restitution, and notwithstanding plaintiff's cooperation early in the encounter, were faced with a yelling, arguing, kicking, and otherwise disruptive tenant. The Court concludes that DUSM Alford's use of force-physically blocking plaintiff's reentry into the apartment, handcuffing her, and placing her in leg restraints-was reasonable under the circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Wardlaw v.
