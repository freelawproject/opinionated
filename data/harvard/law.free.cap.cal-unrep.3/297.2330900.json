Defendant answered in the form of an ordinary complaint on a promissory note, and to this plaintiff filed a reply, alleging fraud in procuring the note, mistake, and want of consideration. Held, the action being purely statutory and equitable in form, the reply to plaintiff\u2019s answer was unnecessary to the relief sought, and he was not entitled to a jury trial upon the issue thereby raised.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b299-10\">APPEAL from Superior Court, City and County of San Francisco.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Code of Civil Procedure, section 1050, provides: \u201cAn action may be brought by one person against another for the purpose of determining an adverse claim, which the latter makes against the.former, for money or property upon an alleged obligation; and also against two or more persons, for the purpose of compelling one to satisfy a debt due to the other for which plaintiff is bound as a surety.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b300-5\">Chas.

This answer is, in legal effect, the same as an ordinary complaint on a promissory note, and prays for judgment in like manner. The only allegations therein, not properly belonging to a complaint on a promissory note, are that the note set out is the obligation mentioned in plaintiff\u2019s complaint, and a denial of the allegation in the complaint that the plaintiff did not know the exact nature of the defendant\u2019s claim. The plaintiff treated the defendant\u2019s answer as a cross-complaint, so far as it set up and relied upon the note, and filed an answer thereto, alleging fraud in procuring the note, mistake and want of consideration. On the issues thus formed the case went to trial. The court below found, for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>defendant, and rendered judgment in Ms favor on the note. The plaintiff moved for a new trial, which was denied, and he appeals. The plaintiff demanded a jury trial as to what he claims were the legal issues formed by the answer or cross-complaint, and his answer of fraud, mistake and want of consideration. This was denied, and he complains that this was error. The respondent contends that there were no legal issues in the case; that the action was brought by the plaintiff; that it was statutory and equitable in its nature; that the issue presented was made by the complaint, and the answer of the defendant; and that the pleading on the part of the plaintiff by way of answer was unnecessary and superfluous. The question is not entirely free from doubt, but we think that the court below was right in denying the plaintiff a jury trial. The real issue presented by the pleadings was whether the defendant\u2019s claim was a pretended one, as alleged by the plaintiff, or a valid one, as averred by the defendant. If an invalid and pretended one, asserted against the plaintiff, he was entitled to judgment so declaring it. If a valid one, as claimed by the defendant, he was entitled to a judgment to that effect, and that it be enforced as such. The plaintiff, instead of waiting and allowing the defendant to bring his action on the note, saw fit to bring a purely statutory action, equitable in form, to have the claim declared invalid and set aside, and prayed in his complaint for such relief. The sole object of his complaint was to have the claim presented that he might have it so declared and set aside. It was only necessary for the defendant to set up his claim. This presented the whole issue. No pleading was necessary on the part of the plaintiff in reference to the defendant\u2019s answer. It was not a cross-complaint, nor was it pleaded as such. Under the allegations of his complaint the plaintiff might have proved every fact necessary to show the invalidity of the defendant\u2019s claim without further pleading. This was the gist of his complaint, and the very foundation of his right to maintain the action. The fact that legal issues, incidental to the main issue, which is equitable, must be determined in arriving at a decision of the case, does not entitle either party to a jury trial: Downing v. Le Du, 82 Cal. 472, 23 Pac. 202. In this ease the cause of action being to declare an obligation invalid, and to set it aside, the real issue in the case was equi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>table, and the plaintiff, having chosen this equitable remedy, and thus brought the defendant into court to meet his equitable cause of action, cannot complain that a jury trial, which would have been his right, if he had allowed the defendant to maintain his common-law action on the note, was denied him. It is contended that the findings of the court below were not sustained by the evidence, and that they do not sustain the judgment. There was evidence to support each of the findings, and the weight of the evidence must be left to the determination of the trial court. The findings are sufficient to uphold the judgment. Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">We concur: Fox, J.; Paterson, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
