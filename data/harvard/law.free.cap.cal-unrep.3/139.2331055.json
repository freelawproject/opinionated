The complaint is unnecessarily long, and to attempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>to state even its substance would for that reason extend this opinion in like manner, and serve no useful purpose. The court below sustained a demurrer to the complaint, and we think properly. It does not sufficiently state the facts claimed to have constituted the fraud, nor does it show that the plaintiff was in a position to have been injured, conceding that the conveyances were fraudulently made. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-3\">We concur: Fox, J.; Paterson, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
