The answer of defendant denies that the plaintiff did the amount of labor or furnished the amount of materials alleged in the complaint; and also denies the alleged value of the labor and materials admitted to have been done and furnished, but admits them to have been of the value of $841.70. Defendant also pleads a counterclaim against plaintiff for labor and materials, amounting to $139.75. The cause was tried by the court, and judgment given for the plaintiff in the sum of $1,177.15. From this judgment, and from an order denying his motion for a new trial, the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-12\">1. It is contended for appellant that the evidence is insufficient to justify certain findings of fact as to which his counsel admits that there is a slight conflict of evidence. It seems to me, however, after a careful examination of the evidence, that the conflict is substantial to a degree which precludes consideration of the question here.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-13\">2. Appellant\u2019s counsel in his brief makes the point that the court erred in matter of law in rejecting a part of defendant\u2019s counterclaim; but there is no foundation for this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>point in the record, either by exception or specification. I think the judgment and order should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">We concur: Temple, C.; Belcher, C.</p>\n<author id=\"b489-5\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"Ap7\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
