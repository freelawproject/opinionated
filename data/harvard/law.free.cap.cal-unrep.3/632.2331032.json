Wherefore plaintiff demands judgment against defendant for the sum of $330.45, with interest from March 1, 1890, and for the costs of this action. W. W. McNair, Attorney for plaintiff.\u201d Indorsed: \u201cFiled February 7, 1891. Wm. J. Blattner, Clerk. By J. J. Grief, Deputy Clerk.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b635-6\">Walter H. Linforth for appellant; W. W. McNair for respondent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b635-7\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"AiR\">This is an action upon a promissory note. The complaint was demurred to upon the grounds that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action, and was ambiguous and uncertain. The demurrer was overruled, and the defendant given ten days to answer. He declined to answer, and thereupon judgment was entered against him, from which he appeals. The complaint was inartistically drawn, but we think it must be held sufficient. Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
