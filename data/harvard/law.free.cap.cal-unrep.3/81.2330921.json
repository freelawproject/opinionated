J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ab\">Action upon bill of exchange against executors of deceased acceptor. The pleadings are verified. Judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff on the pleadings, defendants excepting. We think the answer was sufficient to raise an issue as to the ownership of the bill, and consequently that the rendition of the judgment without any proof of plaintiff\u2019s title was error. Judgment reversed, and cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">We concur: Works, J.; Paterson, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
