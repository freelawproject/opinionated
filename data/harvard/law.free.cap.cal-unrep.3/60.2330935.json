The judgment of the court below was entered on July 6, 1887. Notice of appeal was filed and served nearly a year thereafter, to wit, June 29, 1888. As there was no motion for a new trial, therefore, the evidence should not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-13\">2. There are no assignments of error, or specifications of insufficiency of the evidence, in the bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-14\">3. The findings cover the issues, are against the appellant, and, although the record is not in a condition to require of us an examination of the evidence, it is apparent from a cursory review of it that the findings are correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-15\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-16\">We concur: Works, J.; Sharpstein, J.; Thornton, J.; McFarland, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
