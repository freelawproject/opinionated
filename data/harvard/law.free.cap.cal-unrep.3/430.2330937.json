The overruling of petitioners\u2019 motion for a judgment in their favor in the case of Tibbetts et al. v. The Riverside Banking Company et al., and the refusal to allow the plaintiffs therein to prove certain matters alleged in their complaint, were decisions of questions of law arising during the trial. If there was any error in such rulings, the petitioners were afforded a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy by an appeal from the final judgment rendered in the action. Application for writ denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
