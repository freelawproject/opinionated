The language of the information is sufficiently full and explicit in charging the offense, and we think that the court did not err in overruling the demurrer. The appeal is from the judgment only. The bill of exceptions contains none of the evidence. We cannot say, therefore, that the court erred in refusing certain instructions referred to in appellant\u2019s brief. In the former decision filed herein (16 Pac. 884) it was held that \u201cthe pleas of former acquittal and once in jeopardy, as the defendant asked to have them entered, were in substantially the form required by the code.\u201d In support of this proposition, there was quoted in the opinion a portion of the contents of a written plea offered by defendant\u2019s counsel, and it was said: \u201cIf the clerk failed to make the entry as fully as he ought to have done, the defendant cannot be made to suffer for that failure.\u201d The pleas actually entered upon the minutes of the court were as follows: \u201cFirst, defendant pleads not guilty of the offense charged; second, a former acquittal; third, once in jeopardy.\u201d The jury found the defendant guilty, but did not find on the issues of former acquittal and once in jeopardy. The pleas, as entered upon the minutes, were insufficient. Section 1017, Penal Code, prescribes the form for such pleas. If the defendant plead a former conviction or acquittal the form is as follows: <em>\u201c</em>The defendant pleads that he has already been convicted [or acquitted] of the offense charged by the judgment of the court of \u2014\u2014, [naming it], rendered at \u2014\u2014, [naming the place], on the \u2014\u2014 day of \u2014\u2014.\u201d If he plead once <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>in jeopardy, the form is as follows: \u201cThe defendant pleads that he has been once in jeopardy for the offense charged, [specifying the time, place, and court.] \u201d The object of these forms is plain. The people should be informed of the circumstances as to time, place and court. None of these circumstances are named in the plea actually entered upon the minutes of the court below; and we cannot resort to the written document, which, it is claimed, was filed at the time the plea was entered in aid of the plea actually entered. Section 1017, supra, provides that \u201cevery plea must be oral, and entered upon the minutes of the court in substantially the following form: . . . .\u201d The bill of exceptions in the record before us was prepared for and used only upon the motion in arrest of judgment. The bill of exceptions does not purport to be a bill prepared to present exceptions to the rulings of the court, upon any other matter than that of the motion in arrest of judgment. The written plea referred to is not properly in the bill of exceptions. Section 1185\", Id., prescribes the grounds upon which a motion in arrest of judgment may be made. It is \u201cfounded on any defects in the indictment or information mentioned in section 1004.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">There was no error in the ruling of the court below upon the defendant\u2019s motion in arrest of judgment, and, the pleas referred to not being in the form required by the code, it was not necessary for the jury to find on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">We see no merit in the contention that the defendant should have been discharged from custody because the court below failed to render an opinion that the objection to the information to which the demurrer had been sustained could be overcome by filing another. The court directed the district attorney to file a new information, and this was a sufficient compliance with section 1008 of the Penal Code. It was not said in People v. Jordan, 63 Cal. 219, that the court must, in addition to directing the district attorney to file a new information, render an .opinion that the objection to the information could be overcome by filing another. Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">We concur: Searls, C. <em>J.; </em>McFarland, J.; Thornton, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
