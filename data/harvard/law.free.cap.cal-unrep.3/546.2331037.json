In the complaint (which was not verified) it is averred that plaintiff is, and during a certain named period was, \u201cthe owner of and lawfully in possession of\u201d a large body of land described by legal subdivisions; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>that during the said named period defendant\u2019s cattle pastured on said land, and destroyed grass, hay, etc., to plaintiff\u2019s damage in the sum of $3,000. In the answer \u201ceach and every allegation\u201d of the complaint is denied. The court found that plaintiff was not either the owner or in possession of any part of the land described in the complaint at any time mentioned therein, and the evidence clearly warrants said finding. To prove paper title, plaintiff introduced a properly certified transcript of a recorded deed from one Maurice Dore to plaintiff, which purported to convey \u201ca portion\u201d of the land described in the complaint\u2014what portion does not appear. There was then introduced a defective certificate of another recorded deed from said Dore to plaintiff of a \u201cfurther portion\u201d of said lands, and another defective certificate of a recorded deed to plaintiff from one Fisher of the \u201cremaining portion\u201d thereof. This was all the evidence offered on that subject. There was no evidence tending to show that either said Dore or Fisher ever had title, or any estate or interest whatever, in any part of said land. There was no attempt to trace the title to its paramount source, and therefore no title was shown. There was no evidence that plaintiff entered upon said land, or any part of it, claiming under either of said deeds, and therefore there was no color of title shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-3\">There was no evidence showing that plaintiff was ever in the actual possession of the land or of any part of it. It is mostly tule land, unfenced and uninclosed. An agent of plaintiff visited the land once, and had some surveying done for the purpose of locating a certain Coon lake; and he also at one time advertised it for sale or rent, but had no offers. He also notified defendant\u2019s agent once to keep his cattle off \u201cthat land.\u201d These were the only acts done in the premises, and, of course, they did not constitute actual possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">Appellant contends that there is some evidence of plaintiff\u2019s title to some parts of the land in certain answers of its witness Hiatt, given on cross-examination, in which he says, without objection, that \u201cthe bank owns\u201d certain mentioned small tracts. But these answers were in response to questions in cross-examination, evidently, not with reference to the subject of title or ownership, but for the pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>pose of locating the lands claimed by appellant, and distinguishing them from lands claimed by Mr. Parks, and it was clearly so understood by both the questioner and the witness. Hiatt had testified in chief about the lands \u201cdescribed in the complaint,\u201d but he did not say or pretend to know anything about the title. At the end of his cross-examination he said: \u201cI am only answering from the map; that is the only way I can answer it. \u2019 \u2019 The form of the answers, therefore, cannot be taken as evidence\u2014certainly not as sufficient evidence\u2014to establish title or ownership. The correct finding that appellant had no ownership or possession of the land renders it unnecessary to examine the somewhat complicated question as to what fence law obtains in Sutter county. The point that, because respondent made the separate defense that the lands described in the complaint were not fenced, he is estopped from denying' that appellant owned them, is obviously too untenable to need discussion. Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">We concur: De Haven, J.; Sharpstein, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
