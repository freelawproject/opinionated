Moore, deceased, was instituted in the superior court of Santa Cruz county by W. H. Moore, a son and heir at law of the decedent, but was subsequently removed to the superior court of Santa Clara county.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b164-9\">Hall <em>&amp; </em>Rodgers (Warren Olney of counsel) for appellant; Charles B.

Said order is based upon a finding that \u201cthe said Thomas W. Moore has wrongfully and willfully neglected said estate, and has unnecessarily, willfully, and wrongfully prolonged the administration of said estate, and to the great detriment thereof.\u201d The question whether the finding is justified by the evidence is the only one which we shall now consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">It clearly appears that appellant was appointed and entered upon the discharge of his duties as administrator of said estate in the early part of the year 1873, and the petition for his removal was filed July 14, 1887. Between the appointment and the filing of the petition more than fourteen years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>had elapsed. This was prima facie evidence of neglect, and we fail to find any satisfactory explanation of this long delay consistent with the duty of the administrator to wind up the administration within a reasonable period. The power of removal for the cause specified is vested in the superior court; and \u201cwith the exercise of this power, so necessary to the protection and security of estates, an appellate court should not interfere, unless it be clearly shown that there had been a gross abuse of discretion by the probate court. The facts of this case, as disclosed by the record, establish no such abuse of discretion\u201d: Deck\u2019s Estate v. Gherke, 6 Cal. 666. Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
