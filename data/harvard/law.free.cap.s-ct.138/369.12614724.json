McDonough,</em> <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276490\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/573/#p584\">547 U.S. 573</extracted-citation>, 584, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276490\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/573/#p584\">126 S.Ct. 2096</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3276490\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/573/#p584\">165 L.Ed.2d 44</extracted-citation> (2016). The All Writs Act does not excuse a court from making these findings. Because the District Court enjoined respondent's execution without finding that he has a significant possibility of success on the merits, it abused its discretion. We accordingly vacate the injunction.</p><p id=\"p-6\">Justice BREYER and Justice SOTOMAYOR would deny the application to vacate the injunction.</p></opinion>\n</casebody>\n</body></html>"
