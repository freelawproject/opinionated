Because those provisions of the Order have \"expired by [their] own terms.\" the appeal no longer presents a \"live case or controversy.\" <em>Burke v. Barnes,</em> <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216314\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/361/#p363\">479 U.S. 361</extracted-citation>, 363, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216314\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/361/#p363\">107 S.Ct. 734</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216314\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/479/361/#p363\">93 L.Ed.2d 732</extracted-citation> (1987). Following our established practice in such cases, the judgment is therefore vacated, and the case is remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit with instructions to dismiss as moot the challenge to Executive Order No. 13,780. <em>United States v. Munsingwear, Inc.</em> <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6930686\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/340/36/#p39\">340 U.S. 36</extracted-citation>, 39, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6930686\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/340/36/#p39\">71 S.Ct. 104</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=95%20L.%20Ed.%2036\">95 L.Ed. 36</extracted-citation> (1950).
