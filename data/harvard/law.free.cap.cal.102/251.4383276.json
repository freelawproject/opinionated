The charge is that he swore falsely before a deputy registrar in the city and county of San Francisco; and the only point made is that the registrar had no power to appoint a deputy who could administer oaths, because such appointment was not \u201c necessary for the faithful and prompt discharge of the duties of his office,\" as provided by section 4112 of the Political Code. The contention is that an applicant for registration can make the requisite affi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>davit before any other officer qualified to administer oaths; that the duty of administering oaths is not specially enjoined on the registrar; and that, therefore, it is not <em>\u201c </em>necessary\u201d for him to perform that duty, or to have a deputy to do it. We see no real merit in this contention. It would apply to nearly all other county officers; for, generally, the law merely confers upon such officers the power to administer oaths. Administering the necessary oaths to those coming to the registrar to be registered is as much the duty of the registrar as of any other officer; it naturally belongs to his office, and it was evidently contemplated by the act creating such office. The number of his deputies was limited only by his discretion. (Pol. Code, sec. 877.) The judgment and order denying motion in arrest of judgment are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Beatty, C.
