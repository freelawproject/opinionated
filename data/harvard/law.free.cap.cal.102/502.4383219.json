W. Hyde entered into a written contract with defendant Perkins, to erect for him a certain building according to plans and specifications prepared by R. H. White, architect, and to finish the same within ninety days from said date, for the sum of $4,900, payable in installments \u2014 the fifth installment of $687.50 to be paid when the building should be completed and accepted, and the sixth installment of $1,250 to be paid thirty-five days after its completion. This contract was duly recorded, and, under it, Hyde proceeded to erect the building. On September <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>16th he contracted with the assignors of the plaintiff to do the tinning and plumbing of the building, which they did, for the agreed price of $720, of which $475 was paid, leaving still due and owing therefor the sum of $245, for which, on March 1, 1890, they duly filed and caused to he recorded their claim of lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">The building \u201cwas completed and finished, according to the plans and specifications, on the twenty-seventh day of January, 1890, but it was accepted by the defendant, William Perkins, on the eighteenth day of January, 1890, and was actually occupied and used by the tenants of defendant William Perkins on the twenty-fifth day of January, 1890, which tenants rented it on the twenty-first and twenty-second days of January, 1890. But plaintiff had no notice of the acceptance of said building by said defendant Perkins, or of its occupation by said defendant\u2019s tenants until the thirty-first day of January, 1890, on which day the architect, R. H. White, issued a certificate in the following words and figures, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-6\">\u201c\u2018San Francisco, January 31, 1890.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-7\">\u201c \u2018 <em>To William </em>Perkins:.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-8\">\u201c \u2018 This is to certify that the sum of six hundred and eighty-seven and 50-100 dollars, amount of fifth payment on building located, etc., is due and payable toE. W. Hyde.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-9\">\u201c\u2018[signed] R. H. White, Architect.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">The contract between Hyde and Perkins contained the following provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-11\">\u201cWhen each payment or installment shall become-due, and at the final completion of the work certificates, in writing shall be obtained from the said architect, stating that the payment or installment is due or work completed, as the case may be, and the amount then, due; and the said architect shall at said times deliver said certificates under his hand to the contractor, or, in lieu of such certificates, shall deliver to the contractor, in writing, under his hand, a just and true reason for not issuing the certificates, including a statement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>the defects, if any, to be remedied, to entitle the contractor to the certificate or certificates. \u2022 And in the event of the failure of the architect to furnish and deliver said certificates, or any of them, or in lieu thereof the writing aforesaid, within three days after the times aforesaid and after demand therefor, made in writing by the contractor, the amount which may be claimed to be due by the contractor and stated in the said demand made by him for the certificate shall at the expiration of said three days become due and payable, and the owner shall be liable, and bound to pay the same on demand. In case the architect delivers the writing aforesaid, in lieu of the certificate, then a compliance by the contractor with the requirements of said writing shall entitle the contractor to the certificates.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">Appellant contends that these provisions of the contract made the certificate of the architect a prerequisite to the payment of any money to the contractor, and that until such certificate was issued the building could not be considered completed nor accepted as completed, and hence, as the lien was filed within thirty days after the certificate above mentioned was issued, it must be held to have been filed in time.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The provisions of the contract were not, in our opinion, as far reaching as claimed, but were intended simply for the protection of the owner by making the approval of the architect a condition precedent to the contractor\u2019s right to demand payment of the money. This condition, however, the owner was at liberty to waive, if he choose to do so, and he might, without any certificate from the architect, have accepted the building, and paid for it as he had agreed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">The statute provides that every person, save the original contractor, who claims the benefit of the law in regard to liens, \u201cmust within thirty days after the completion of any building, improvement, or structure,\u201d file for record with the county recorder his claim of lien, and that \u201c the occupation or use of the building, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>improvement, or structure by the owner or bis representative, or the acceptance by said owner, or his agent, of said building, improvement, or structure, shall be deemed conclusive evidence of completion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">This language is clear and positive, and, as the right to a lien is purely statutory, is -decisive of appellant\u2019s rights here.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">It follows that the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Vanclief, C., and Temple, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion the judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">Harrison, J., Garoutte, J., Van Fleet, J.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
