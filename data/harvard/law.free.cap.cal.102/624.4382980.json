(Chitty on Pleadings, 15th Am. ed., 828, 835; <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>70 Cal. 562. See Bouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary under \u201cTrover\u201d; Boone\u2019s Code Pleading, sec. 136; <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>38 Cal. 510; <em>Guthrie </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>108 Mass. 192.) The cost of the articles is not evidence of their value. (See <em>Angell </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>79 Cal. 183; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>90 N. Y. 4; 43 Am. Rep. 131 <em>Norton </em>v. <em>Willis, </em>73 Me. 580; <em>Douglass </em>v. <em>Kraft, </em>9 Cal. 562; <em>Cox v. McLaughlin, </em>76 Cal. 70; 9 Am. St. Rep. 164.) The fixtures were put up without an agreement to remove them, and screwed and nailed to a building not owned by any of the parties, and no right to remove them was shown, and they were a part of the realty. (Civ. Code, sec. 1013. See <em>Merritt </em>v. <em>Judd, </em>14 Cal. 59; <em>Marks </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>63 Cal. 111; <em>Lavenson </em>v. <em>Standard Soap Co., </em>80 Cal. 245; 13 Am. St. Rep. 147; <em>McKiernan </em>v. <em>Hesse, </em>51 Cal. 596.) There can be no conversion of fixtures until their removal from the freehold; as long as they' remain annexed to the freehold trover does not lie. <em>(McNally </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>70 Cal. 3; <em>Woodruff etc. Iron Works </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>37 Conn. 233; 6 Wait\u2019s Actions and Defenses, 161, 162.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b657-7\"><em>Henry N. Clement, </em>for Respondents.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-8\">The demurrer to the complaint, on the grounds of ambiguity, unintelligibility, and uncertainty, was not well taken, as the complaint must have been defective in each and all of these distinct respects in order to warrant the sustaining of the demurrer. <em>(Kraner </em>v. <em>Halsey, </em>82 Cal. 209; <em>White </em>v. <em>Allatt, </em>87 Cal. 245; <em>Wilhoit </em>v. <em>Cun</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number><em>ningham, </em>87 Cal. 453.) The cost of the fixtures was proper evidence of their value. <em>(Angell </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>79 Cal. 183; Jones v. <em>Morgan, </em>90 N. Y. 4; 43 Am. Rep. 131; <em>Mortimer </em>v. <em>Marder, </em>93 Cal. 177.) The fixtures were not affixed to the realty and even if they were the question as to whether or not the plaintiffs had a right to remove them cannot be raised in this action, the landlord no't being a party thereto. <em>(March </em>v. <em>McKoy, </em>56 Cal. 85; <em>Hendy </em>v. <em>Dinkerhoff, </em>57 Cal. 7; 40 Am. Rep. 107; Civ. Code, secs. 660, 1013, 1019.) It is not necessary that the fixtures should have been taken away from the building in order to constitute conversion. The cases cited by the counsel for appellant support this proposition, and show that trover was the proper remedy. <em>(McNally </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>70 Cal. 3; <em>Hitchcock </em>v. <em>McElrath, </em>72 Cal. 565; 6 Wait\u2019s Actions and Defenses, 163, 167; <em>Rider </em>v. <em>Edgar, </em>54 Cal. 127.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b658-5\">McFarland, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AoM\">This is an action to recover the value of certain personal property alleged to have been converted by defendants. The verdict was for plaintiffs in the sum of four hundred and seventy-five dollars, for which sum they had judgment. Defendant appeals from the judgment, and from an order denying a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The demurrer to the complaint was properly overruled. It was upon the ground that the complaint \u201c is ambiguous, unintelligible, <em>and </em>uncertain,\u201d for the reason that it does not contain a sufficient description of the property sued for. It is clearly not ambiguous or unintelligible; therefore, if it were uncertain as to description, the demurrer did not reach it. <em>(Kraner </em>v. <em>Halsey, </em>82 Cal. 209; <em>White </em>v. <em>Allatt, </em>87 Cal. 245.) We think, however, that the description is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">The property in suit consisted of \u201c bar fixtures\u201d put by respondents into a saloon on premises owned by a third party, and appropriated and converted by appellant; and whether, as between the owner of the building and respondents, they could have been removed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>the latter, is a question which does not arise here. Appellant removed part of the property, detached other parts of it and removed them from their position in the saloon against respondents\u2019 wishes, and refused to deliver them to respondents or pay for them. This was a conversion. There was sufficient proof of a demand. We see no error committed by the court in ruling upon the admissibility of evidence on the issue of the value of the property. It was proper to consider the cost of the property as a circumstance tending to show value. <em>(Angell </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>79 Cal. 181.) And it was no error to exclude evidence of the value of the fixtures when removed from their position, and considered without reference to the uses for which they were intended. We see no error in that part of the charge to the jury to which appellant excepted. There is no reason to think that the amount of the verdict is excessive. The question whether an attorney\u2019s fee for trying the case could be allowed does not arise. There are no other points which need to be noticed. We see nothing in the record that would warrant a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">Judgment and order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Fitzgerald, J., and De Haven, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Hearing in Bank denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
