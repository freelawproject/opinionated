The court erred in deciding that the administration taken out by Jacob De Cordova on the estate of Thomas K. Pierson was a valid administration. The transcript of the record of said administration shows that Thomas <em>K. </em>Pierson died in the year 1836, and the petition for the grant of letters to said De Cordova was not filed until the 14th day of October, 1850; the presumption of law was, that at that time there were no debts and no necessity for administration. (Blair <em>v. </em>Cisneros, 10 Tex., 46; Wardrup <em>v. </em>Jones, 23 Tex., 495.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-16\">II. The transcript of the record of said administration shows that said Thomas K. Pierson had no domicil in this State, and no property in said Harris county; and the proof in evidence in the case shows that said Pierson died at Goliad, Texas. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 1260; Hearn <em>v. </em>Camp, 18 Tex., <em>551.)</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b615-17\">III. It is evident, from the transcript of the record of said administration, that the administration was taken out in fraud of law, and for the benefit of the administrator and officers of court, and not for the benefit of said estate. (McMahan <em>v. </em>Rice, 16 Tex., 335.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>IV. It was in proof, that Pierson was killed in the service of the Republic of Texas, and that he was a volunteer from a foreign country. The record failing to show that De Cordova was next of kin, or had authority from the next of kin to administer on said estate, the administration was without authority of law. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 1398; Vogelsang <em>et at. v. </em>Dougherty, 46 Tex., 471, 473.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-6\">V. The court erred in holding the sale by De Cordova, as administrator of the estate of Thomas K. Pierson, deceased, to W. R. Baker, to be a valid sale of the land certificate and land located under it, it being admitted that Pierson was a volunteer from a foreign country, and had been killed in the service of the Republic of Texas, and the record of said administration failing to show that said De Cordova had the consent or approbation of the heirs of said Pierson to such sale, said De Cordova being an administrator <em>de bonis non </em>on said estate, and his administration being a continuation of the administration of H. L. Pierson, granted on said estate in 1838. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., arts. 1278, 1376, 1399; Harris <em>v. </em>Graves, 26 Tex., 580.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-7\">VI. By the terms of the agreement upon which the case was submitted, plaintiff\u2019s title was dependent upon the validity of the administration on the estate of Thomas K. Pier-son, and the proceeding therein to divest the. heirs of said Pierson of title to the land in controversy, and the administration and proceeding therein being invalid, his title was invalid. (Murphy <em>v. </em>Menard, 14 Tex., 62, 66; Blair <em>v. </em>Cisneros, 19 Tex., 46, 47; Wardrup <em>v. </em>Jones, 23 Tex., 494; Boyle <em>v. </em>Forbes, 9 Tex., 35; Chandler <em>v. </em>Hudson, 11 Tex., 37; Fisk <em>v. </em>Horvel, 9 Tex., 13; Hurt <em>v. </em>Horton, 12 Tex., 287; Francis <em>v. </em>Hall, 13 Tex., 192; Rose <em>v. </em>Newman, 26 Tex., 133.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b616-8\"><em>J. D. </em>Thomas, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-9\">I. The existence of debt is not essential to the jurisdiction to grant administration. (Kleinecke <em>v. </em>Woodward, 42 Tex., 311.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b617-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>II. The Probate law of 1848, under which administration was granted to De Cordova, is broad enough to authorize administration wherever th\u00e9re is unadministered property of the decedent within the jurisdiction of the court. (Green <em>v. </em>Eugely, 23 Tex., 540.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b617-6\">III. The jurisdiction to grant administration did not depend on Pierson\u2019s domicil in the State; (Green <em>v. </em>Rugely, 23 Tex., 540;) but the record does not show that the intestate had no property in the county of the administration.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b617-7\">IV. It does not appear from the transcript, or from appellants\u2019 statement, that the administration was in fraud of the law, or for the benefit of the administrator and officers of the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b617-8\">V. In October, 1850, when administration was granted to De Cordova, the law did not require authority to administer on a soldier\u2019s estate to be procured from the next of kin, or that the administrator should be the next of kin. (Act 1846, repealing clause, Hart. Dig., 1108 ; reenactment December 17, 1851, Paschal\u2019s Dig., 1400.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b617-9\">VI. If authority to administer, from the next of kin, was essential, then, in the absence of proof to the contrary, it will be presumed to have been shown to the court before administration was granted. (Pleasants <em>v. </em>Dunkin, 47 Tex., 355; Vogelsang <em>v. </em>Dougherty, 46 Tex., 472; Withers <em>v, </em>Patterson, 27 Tex., 496.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b617-10\">VII. When De Cordova sold the certificate, April 1,1851, there was no law requiring him to procure the assent of the heirs of decedent to the sale. (Act 1846, repealing clause, Hart. Dig., 1108.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b617-11\">VII. The act of 1841 (Paschal\u2019s Dig., 1399) inhibits the sale of land, but not of personal property, without the consent of the heirs. The land certificate was personal property. (Pleasants <em>v. </em>Dunkin, 47 Tex., 355; Cox <em>v. </em>Bray, 28 Tex., 247; Peevy <em>v. </em>Hurt, 32 Tex., 150.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b617-12\">IX. De Cordova having been appointed administrator in 1850, was not required by law to procure the assent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>heirs to the sale. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., 1399; Harris <em>v. </em>Graves, 26 Tex., 580.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b618-6\">X. If necessary to support the jurisdiction of the court, it will, in the absence of proof to the contrary, be presumed that between the time when Thomas K. Pierson volunteered as a soldier, and the time of his death, he became a citizen of Texas. He is admitted to have been a citizen of Louisiana when he volunteered, but the time is not stated. He is further shown to have been killed in the service of Texas, at Goliad, in 1836.</p>\n<p data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b618-7\">XI. It is now too late for appellants to set up the invalidity of the proceedings in probate. The land certificate was sold April 1,1851. It was sold because the estate had no money to locate it or to pay costs. The petition alleges title and possession in appellee January 1, 1872, and that appellants on that day entered and ejected him. (Kleinecke <em>v. </em>Woodward, 42 Tex., 311; Vogelsang <em>v. </em>Dougherty, 46 Tex., 472.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b618-8\">XII. When a Probate Court has made the regular and usual orders through the entire administration of an estate, then, in a collateral proceeding, every fact essential to its jurisdiction will be presumed, unless the contrary is clearly proved. (Pleasants <em>v. </em>Dunkin, 47 Tex., 355 ; Vogelsang <em>v. </em>Dougherty, 46 Tex., 472; Withers <em>v. </em>Patterson, 27 Tex., 496.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b618-9\">Moore, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"ACe\">The transcript in this case exhibits several errors, for which this judgment must be <em>reversed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">In the absence of an averment and proof of some special necessity for the grant of letters of administration upon the estate of Thomas K. Pierson, it must be presumed that there was no occasion for it at the date of De Cordova\u2019s application for the appointment of administrator of his estate. Without clear proof to the contrary, it should be presumed that there were no debts due by or to said intestate, or necessity for an administration upon his estate after the lapse of so great a length of time from his death. The absence of existing debts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>against the deceased, in this instance, however, does not depend upon mere presumption: the record of the pretended administration demonstrates that there was no valid and subsisting debt against said Pierson at the date of the administration ; nor were any shown to be due to him. The only pretense of such debts is the cost which had been incurred by one Henry L. Pierson in a futile effort to take out letters of administration upon the estate of Thomas K. Pierson in the year 1838, over ten years prior to De Cordova\u2019s application, which, however, was abandoned before letters of administration were actually issued to him. The costs incurred in this abandoned effort to administer upon the estate were, unquestionably, justly chargeable to the party by whom they were incurred, and not against the deceased or his property. (Marks <em>v. </em>Hill, 46 Tex., 345, and cases cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">It is too plain to require argument to demonstrate, that De Cordova administered upon the estate, not for the benefit of those in any way interested in it, but of those to be benefited by the costs to be thereby incurred, or who wished to profit by the sale of the certificate belonging to the decedent. The time and circumstances under which the pretended letters \"were granted, render it obvious, that although nominally he obtained letters of administration on the estate of a deceased volunteer soldier of the Eepublic, he in fact administered upon that of his heirs; and, under the guise and pretense of administration, he attempted to sell and transfer to the principal beneficiary of the pretended administration property of the hen\u2019s with which neither he nor his confederates had any right to intermeddle.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">But if the administration had not been wholly unwarranted by reason of the lapse of time between the death of Thomas K. Pierson and the issuance of the letters of admin- * e istration, his estate should have been administered upon in Goliad county, where he died, and not in Harris, where it is plain he had neither domicil nor property at the date of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>death, or at any time prior thereto. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 1260.)</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">But even if the estate of the decedent had been subject to administration in Harris county at the date of De Cordova\u2019s appointment and qualification, the grant of letter\u2019s of administration to him, the order of sale, and the sale of the certificate under which the land in controversy in this case is held, were all in plain violation of the act of January 14, 1841,' entitled \u201cAn act to protect the rights of the heirs and next of kin to the members of the Georgia battalion, and other volunteers from foreign countries, who have fallen in the battles of the Republic, or otherwise died in the limits of the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">There is no pretense that the requirements of this statute were complied with in the grant of the letters of administration to De Cordova, or in ordering the sale of the certificate to which the estate of Thomas 3L Pierson was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">It is claimed, however, that the omission to' do so does not affect the title acquired by the purchaser from the administrator. First: Because the certificate was personalty, and therefore not, as appellee maintains, within the statute ; but, unquestionably, it is within its spirit and meaning. It was the purpose of this statute to protect the estates of deceased soldiers from just such sales as this; and it would be a narrow and technical construction of it to allow their estates to be stripped of the property given them by. the Republic, and which, it may be inferred, was all they had which an administration could reach, and therefore just that which must have been in the mind of the Legislature, because of a technical distinction between land and a certificate for, or a right to acquire, land. It was land- that was , promised to those who should volunteer as soldiers for the defense of the country, and it was just such certificates as this which were given them in fulfillment of this pledge. It would be plainly in violation of the spirit and purpose of \u2022 the law forbidding the sale of land belonging to the heirs of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>deceased soldiers, if until its location, the certificate by which the land promised therein by the government could alone be obtained, could be sold without the consent of the heirs. Second: It is insisted that this act forbidding such administrations was repealed by the act to organize Probate Courts, approved May 11, 1846; hut, evidently, to hold the act of January 14,1841, enacted for the special purpose of protecting the estates of volunteer soldiers from foreign countries who had fallen in battle or otherwise died in the \u00a1Republic, repealed by the repealing clause of this general act of 1846 organizing Probate Courts, would do violence to the well-established canons for the construction of special and general laws, and their proper relation and bearing to each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
