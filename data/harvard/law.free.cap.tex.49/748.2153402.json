The plaintiff, Bussell Adams, was emigrating from Georgia, and the goods in question were his household goods, put up carefully, and marked \u201cB. Adams.\u201d They were shipped at Columbus, Georgia. Plaintiff accompanied the goods as far as Hew Orleans, Louisiana, where he last saw them. He there directed them to be forwarded to Bremond, Bobertson county, Texas, his destination. Defendant\u2019s shipping agent received them January 12, 1871, and shipped them to Brenham, where they arrived January 19, 1871.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b757-6\">On authority of a letter written from Burton, and received by the defendant\u2019s agent at Brenham, signed B. Adams, the goods were forwarded, January 23, to Burton. There they were delivered, March 16, 1871, to a man calling himself Eobert Adams, who had no bill of lading or receipt for same. He had lived in the neighborhood of Burton for several months before receiving the goods, and remained in the neighborhood several months after receiving them. He was a day laborer, a single man; received letters from <em>Illinois; </em>dug a well for an agent of the defendant at Burton, and borrowed from him to pay the freight and charges.

(Garside <em>v. </em>Trent and Mersey Navigation, 4 Term R., 581; Hyde <em>v. </em>Trent and Mersey Navigation, 5 Term R., 389; McHenry <em>v. </em>Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad, 4 Harrington, 448; Thomas <em>v. </em>Boston and Providence Railroad Company, 10 Met., 472; Norway Plains Company <em>v. </em>Boston and Maine Railroad, 1 Gray, 263.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b758-7\">Notice to the consignee is excused when he cannot be found. (Fisk <em>v. </em>Newton, 1 Denio, 45; Ostrander <em>v. </em>Brown, 15 Johns., 39.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b758-8\">The evidence in this case shows that the plaintiff was a resident of Bremond, in Bobertson county, and never resided in Brenham or Burton, and the use of the utmost diligence would not have enabled the carrier to discover his proper address, no clue to which was given by the marks on the goods or otherwise. The goods were received at Brenham on the 19th of January, 1871, and stored in their warehouse, and afterwards were forwarded to Burton on the 23d of the same month, where.they were again stored in the warehouse of the company until the 16th of March. The railroad com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>pany, from the time the goods were so placed in their warehouse, ceased to be insurers, and from that date were bound to take common and reasonable care of them. (Story on Bail., sec. 444.) Common and reasonable care is that which men of business usually exhibit in their own affairs, and is to be judged of by the habits of business and general usages of life. (Story on Bail., sec. 11.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b759-6\">Applying this test to the delivery of the goods by plaintiff in error, on the 16th of March, to \u201cR. Adams,\u201d whose name was marked on the goods, is there evidence of that want of \u201c common and reasonable care \u201d which would render the company responsible for their value to another \u201cR. Adams,\u201d who, by a suit at law, has established his title to the property ? The goods, as before stated, were marked \u201cR. Adams.\u201d The full Christian name or residence, which would have aided in identifying the consignee, was not given. By a written order of \u201cR. Adams,\u201d they were forwarded to Burton. Inquiry for the goods was frequently made at Burton before they came by a person well known in that community, where he had resided for months, as \u201cR. Adams.\u201d Would a man of common and reasonable care, judged by the usual habits of business, have delivered the goods to the claimant under these circumstances ? It is true, that if a warehouseman delivers the goods to a wrong person by mistake, he is liable to his bailor for their value. But that is when such delivery is made through negligence or want of care by the bailee, as in Willard <em>v. </em>Bridge, 4 Barb., 361, where the goods of Bridge were delivered to one Hurbert. The delivery of the property of one person to another of a different name, although by mistake, is evidence of the want of common and reasonable care; but the delivery of property marked with a particular name, to a person to whom that name belongs, is not such evidence. Would a man of common and reasonable care, according to the usual habits of business in this country, require from the claimant of property in his hands for delivery, other evidence than his identity with the name to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>the goods were consigned ? In Sewell <em>v. </em>Evans and Roden <em>v. </em>Ryde, 4 Ad. &amp; EL, (Isl. S.,) 626, cited in 1 Greenl. on Ev., 575, it is held that the evidence of identity from the similarity of names, in an action at law, was <em>prima fade </em>sufficient.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b760-5\">The testimony shows that the rule was familiarly acted on by the business men of the State, and a departure from it would have been regarded as just cause of complaint.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b760-6\">In Chamblee <em>v. </em>Tarbox, 27 Tex., 189, it is said, by Mr. Justice Moore, that mere \u201c similarity of name \u201d affords evidence of identity. In that case the similarity of the given name of a married woman, with other circumstances, was sufficient evidence to establish a chain of title. If, then, identity of name is <em>prima-fade </em>evidence of identity of person, can the delivery to the person thus identified, especially when there were other circumstances, as the frequent inquiry about the goods, possession of a printed bill of lading therefor, &amp;c., to support the conclusion, be said t&lt;j be negligence ? * * *</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b760-7\"><em>Shepard &amp; Garrett, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4-\">The railway company was clearly liable as common carrier.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A62a\">The liability of a common carrier, by statute of this State, begins on the receipt of the goods, and continues until \u201cthe carrier at the point of destination shall use due diligence to notify the consignee, and the goods are not taken by the consignee, and have, in consequence, to be stored in the depots or warehouses of the company\u201d; after this he becomes liable as a warehouseman. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 455.) This is the rule at common law. (Morgan <em>v. </em>Dibble, 29 Tex., 118 ; Powell <em>v. </em>Meyers, 26 Wend., 591; Redfield\u2019s Am. Railway Cases, 133.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b760-9\">Railway carriers are exceptions to the general rule of personal delivery, for they must necessarily stop at the depots on their respective routes, but in lieu of personal delivery, the law requires a notice, and nothing will dispense with that notice. (Michigan Central Railway <em>v. </em>Ward, 2 Mich., 538.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b760-10\">There is no proof to show that any attempt was made to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>notify plaintiff of the arrival of his goods at any point; not the slightest diligence is proved. * * *</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b761-6\">The company was responsible for the mistake of its receiving agent. (Meyer <em>v. </em>Chicago &amp; N. W. E.

Y., 34; citing Hawkins <em>v. </em>Hoffman, 6 Hill, 586; Powell <em>v. </em>Meyers, 26 Wend., 290; Devereux <em>v. </em>Barclay, 2 Barn. &amp; Aid., 702; Guillaume <em>v. </em>Hamburg and American Packet Co., 42 N.

The carrier is under the same contract obligation or duty to deliver the goods safely that he is to carry them safely. The law fixes these duties upon the carrier, and he cannot relieve himself from them by proving his usage.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b762-5\">In Stephenson <em>v. </em>Hart, 4 Bing., 476, a box addressed to J. West was sent to a person signing himself J. West to a letter requesting it to be sent to the \u201c Pea Hen,\u201d a public house in St. Albans. The carriers were held liable to the plaintiff for its value.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b762-6\">The identity of name in Sewell <em>v. </em>Evans and Roden <em>v. </em>Ryde, cited in 1 Greenleaf on Evidence, 575, where there is no circumstance to raise a question, is something from which inference may be drawn. But these are cases where the parties are sought to be charged on contract, and the learned judge very pertinently answers the question why they should be required to proves, negative, that itwould be so easily done. In this case, the beneficiary of the goods colluded with the defendants in establishing his identity, and thereby the real owner must be estopped from setting up a claim to them. John Smith\u2019s goods would be common property, with a tenure as uncertain as that of an umbrella or a green veil. * * *</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b762-7\">Carrier may withhold the goods from the proper consignee until he obtains proper evidence of his identity. (Finn <em>v. </em>Western Railway Co., 102 Mass., <em>283; </em>McEntee <em>v. </em>N. J. Steamboat Co., 45 N. Y., 34.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b762-8\">2. If the court should believe that the\u2019 verdict cannot be sustained on the first ground, it can readily be supported on the second.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b762-9\">The instruction to the jury was, that the liability of the carrier ceased if demand was not made in a reasonable time, and the liability of warehouseman began, and this responsibility was for \u201c ordinary diligence,\u201d which was defined to be \u201c such as a prudent man would use in the transaction of bis own business.\u201d Under this charge, it was for the jury to say, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>\u201c under all the evidence in the case,\u201d whether or not this oiv .dinary diligence had been exercised. (Morgan <em>v. </em>Dibble, 29 Tex., 120, 121.) Their verdict is in accordance with the facts and the law of the case. Warehousemen are responsible for delivery to wrong persons. (Devereux <em>v. </em>Barclay, 2 Barn. &amp; Aid., 702.) Warehousemen are not only responsible for losses .which arise by their negligence, but also for losses occasioned by the innocent mistake of themselves and of their servants in making a delivery of the goods to a person not entitled to them. (Story on Bail., sec. 450.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b763-6\">We have seen, in Winslow <em>v. </em>The Vermont and Massachusetts Railroad Company, that the defendants, as carriers, cannot be relieved by proving their usage.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b763-7\">So the law fixes the duty of warehousemen; and because defendants were in the habit of delivering goods to well-known business men without requiring the production of a receipt, they cannot be excused for delivering them to a person comparatively unknown, and with no fixed place of residence or business. And the usage proved by the station agent, Van Hutton, was that freight was delivered only to well-known business men without requiring the production of a receipt. This is a general rule with railroad and express companies, and with banks.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b763-8\">Ho identification is required of well-known persons, and yet no strange or irresponsible person could receive a package or get a draft cashed without identification. * * *</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b763-9\"><em>Sayles &amp; Bassett, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApWY\">The plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence, by marking the, goods \u201c E. Adams,\u201d and failing to designate with sufficient certainty the full name of the consignee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b763-10\">In Congar <em>v. </em>C. &amp; N. R. W. Co., 24 Wis., 157, an action for lost goods, the place of destination as marked upon the goods was \u201c Iuka, Iowa.\u201d There were in the State of Iowa two towns named Iuka, one in Keokuk county, and the other in Tama county. It was held that the failure to state the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>name of the county, or otherwise to indicate in what part of the State the Iuka intended was situated, was such negligence on the part of plaintiff as precluded a recovery. That was a far stronger case against the carrier than the ease at bar; for there it was shown that the company\u2019s agents\u2014not those, however, engaged in making the particular shipment, but others along the line of the road\u2014knew the location of the Iuka intended and the station at which freight for that place should have been delivered; while here no such fact wras alleged or proved.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b764-5\">Besides, the fact that there were two towns of the same name in the State might well be presumed to be known <em>to </em>the citizens thereof; while the fact that there were two men to whom the description \u201c R Adams \u201d would equally apply could hardly he presumed, in-absence of testimony charging the defendant with such knowledge.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b764-6\">But in the case at bar, by reason of the fault of the plaintiff and his agents at Galveston in forwarding, the place of destination was negligently given as Brenham, instead of Bremond.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b764-7\">Since our original brief was filed, the following additional authorities, in support of the proposition that identity of name is <em>prima-fade </em>evidence of identity of person, have fallen under our notice: Garwood <em>v. </em>Garwood, 29 Cal., 515; Thompson <em>v. </em>Manrow, 1 Cal., 428.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b764-8\">It seems clear, under the authorities, that upon the facts of this case the appellant\u2019s liability as a common carrier had been discharged before the loss, and that his liability after the loss was that of a \u00abwarehouseman, and not a carrier.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b764-9\">The rule of ordinary diligence- exacted of bailees in general, including warehousemen, is satisfied when the party acts on a <em>prima-fade </em>case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b764-10\">To constitute the gross negligence necessary to charge them, they must have had actual knowledge, or have been charged with actual knowledge, of facts from which notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>might be fairly inferabl\u00e9. Eothing of the kind appears in the case.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b765-6\">Moore, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"AER\">By the contract upon which this action was brought, the plaintiff in error undertook and bound itself, as a common carrier, to safely carry from the city of Houston, in Harris county, and deliver at its depot in the town of Brenham, the goods for the value of which the defendant in error brought this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">It appears from the receipt given by the forwarding agent of plaintiff in error at Galveston, January 12, 1871, that the bales and box containing the goods to recover the value of which this action is brought were marked \u201c E. Adams, Brenham, Texas \u201d; but we cannot infer from the record that the identity or ownership of them by defendant in error was otherwise disclosed, or that the place of residence of the consignee was known to plaintiff in error, or its agents who forwarded or received the goods, either at Brenham or Burton, where they were lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">The statement of facts shows that on the 19th of January, 1871, the goods arrived at Brenham, and were placed in plaintiff\u2019s depot at that place; but, on a letter from some one signing himself \u201c E. Adams\u201d requesting it, they were, on the 23d of the same month, forwarded to Burton, where they remained in plaintiff\u2019s depot until the 16th of March, 1871, when they were delivered to Eobert Adams, who receipted for them by writing his name E. Adams in plaintiff\u2019s freight book, opposite the entry therein of said articles. The Eobert Adams to whom the goods were delivered is shown to have been about Burton for a month or two previous to the delivery of the goods to him, or it may be for that time prior to their arrival at Burton; and he remained there for several months subsequently. He seems to have been an ordinary laborer. His occupation during a part of the time was that of digging a well for one of defendant\u2019s agents or clerks at that place. It is shown that he had frequently inquired for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>goods previous to their arrival, stating that they had been shipped to Brenham, but that he had requested defendant\u2019s agent at that place to forward them to Burton.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Subsequently to the delivery of the goods-to Robert Adams at Burton, and probably a month or two after he had left there, the defendant in <em>error, </em>discovering that they had been forwarded, as we may infer, by mistake of the forwarding agent of the Morgan line of steamers at Galveston, (and who must be regarded as also defendant\u2019s agent,) to Brenham, instead of Bremond, demanded them of plaintiff in error at Brenham, and also at Burton, having previously made repeated applications for them at Bremond. Failing, however, to receive the goods at either place, on the 6th of February, 1873, he instituted this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Admitting that the mistake in freighting the goods to Brenham, instead of Bremond, cannot be imputed to defendant, still it cannot be denied that defendant was bound as a common carrier to deliver the goods in Brenham to the real consignee to whom they in fact belonged, and that the delivery of them to any one else was a violation of the contract, which entitled the owner to an action for their value. The case of Winslow <em>v. </em>The Vermont and Massachusetts Railroad Company, 42 Vt., 700, is strictly in point, and fully sustains this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">It is there said: \u201cIt has been urged, that the defendants cannot, even as carriers, be held liable for delivering the goods to the wrong party, if they deliver them in the cus- - tomary manner and in the usual course of business. We think no such exception to the common-law rule can be made. The carrier is under the same contract, obligation, or duty to deliver the goods safely that he is to carry them safely. The law fixes th*se duties upon the carrier, and he cannot relieve himself from them by proving his usage. It is true, as urged, that it is not as customary for other carriers, as it is for express companies, to oblige themselves to look up the owner and consignee, and deliver the goods to him at his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>residence or place of business. But all classes of common carriers are responsible, and equally responsible, for a loss of the goods by delivery to the wrong person.\u201d And says the court in McEntee <em>v. </em>The Hew Jersey Steamboat Company, 45 H. Y., 34: \u201cCommon carriers deliver property'at their peril, and must take care that it is delivered to the right person; for if the delivery be to the wrong person, either by an innocent mistake or through fraud of third persons, as upon a forged order, they will be responsible, and the wrongful delivery will be treated as a conversion.\u201d Humerous other cases to the like effect might be easily cited, but it is unnecessary. The proposition is too elementary to require it. (Story on Bail., secs. 540, 543, <em>545b.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">It certainly follows, if the carrier is guilty of a\" conversion of the goods by delivering them to the wrong person, though he has acted in good faith and with due caution, he is equally so when he forwards them from their point of destination elsewhere on the order of any one but the party to whom they should have been delivered. (Stephenson <em>v. </em>Hart, 13 E. C. L., 596.) The consignee is entitled to receive his goods at the place where the carrier undertook and bound himself to deliver them, and is under no obligation to seek or demand them elsewhere. Hor can he be held bound by, or be supposed to have consented to, their improper shipment or delivery by the carrier, merely by following them to the point to which they have been improperly forwarded, or by demanding them from the party to whom they were wrongfully delivered.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">But plaintiff in error maintains that its liability to defendant in error as common carrier, in respect to these goods, had ceased even before they were forwarded to Burton; and if not, it certainly had before they were delivered at Burton to Robert Adams. In order to determine whether plaintiff\" in error incurred any liability to the owner by forwarding the goods to Burton and delivering them after their arrival there to said Robert Adams, it is maintained that recourse must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>had to the law applicable to warehousemen,.and not to that to which carriers are held subject. But let us see if it is true that defendant\u2019s liability as \"carrier for the delivery of these goods had ended before they were delivered to the pretended owner at Burton, or would when they were forwarded from Brenham.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">When the course of business of the carrier is such as will not ordinarily admit of a personal delivery of the goods to the consignee, there seems to be some conflict in the adjudged cases as to the precise time and circumstances when the liability of the carrier as such ceases and that of warehouseman begins; but whatever difficulty may be found in determining this point at common law or in reconciling the different decisions regarding it, is eliminated in this State by statute, by which it is clearly and definitely determined.</p>\n<p id=\"Ag-\">Section 4 of the act concerning common carriers, and defining their liabilities in certain cases, (Paschal\u2019s Dig., art. 455,) reads as follows, to wit: \u201cRailway companies and other common carriers having depots or warehouses for storing goods, shall be liable as warehousemen as at common law for goods, and the care of the same, stored in such depots or warehouses before the commencement of the trip or voyage on which said goods are to be transported; but shall be liable as common carriers from the commencement of the trip or voyage until the goods are delivered to the consignee at the point of destination. If' the carrier at the point of destination shall use due diligence to notify the consignee, and the goods are not taken by the consignee, and have in consequence to be stored in the depots or warehouses of the common carriers, they shall thereafter only be liable as warehousemen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">Evidently, by the plain language of this statute, the com- \u25a0 mon-law liability of the carrier continues until the goods are delivered to the consignee, unless due diligence has been used by the carrier to notify him of the arrival of his goods, and he has failed to take them away. What are the essential facts constituting the diligence required by the statute, must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>obviously depend in some- degree upon the facts and circumstances of each case in which it is to be shown, and upon the custom and usage of business at the place of delivery. (Blumenthal <em>v. </em>Brainerd, 38 Vt., 402.) But we need not speculate in this case as to what are the essential facts which must be shown to establish the fact that due diligence had been exercised to notify the consignee of the arrival of his goods, as there is no pretense that any effort whatever was made to ascertain defendant\u2019s residence, or to give him notice of their arrival at their point of destination. If any effort at diligence had been made, it might have been necessary to pass upon its sufficiency; but as none whatever was used, or even attempted, there can be no reasonable pretense that defendant did not continue to hold the goods as carrier. (Michigan Central Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Ward, 2 Mich., (Gibbs,) 538.)</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">But if defendant\u2019s liability was merely that of warehouseman, would the facts shown in the record have justified the forwarding of the goods from Brenham, or the subsequent delivery of them to a party in whom the evidence fails to show anything more than a mere pretense of right to them ? While a warehouseman may no doubt be fully justified in many instances in delivering freight to well-known and responsible business men residing in the immediate vicinity of the place to which goods are sent, we think there can be no hesitancy in saying that it was gross negligence to deliver goods of the description and value of these to a man without family, or settled place of residence, or permanent occupation, who held no receipt or bill of lading for them; and this, too, in the absence of facts or circumstances of any kind tending to show that he either owned or had any connection with them, except his statement, before the arrival of this particular freight, that a lot of freight belonging to him had been shipped to Brenham, and that he had ordered it forwarded to Burton, and the bare fact of the similarity of his surname and the initial letter of his Christian name with that of the consignee; and certainly nothing whatever is shown to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>warranted defendant in forwarding the goods from Burton. It does not appear that defendant\u2019s agents knew, or had even ever heard, prior to the receipt of his letter, that such a person as \u201cE. Adams\u201d was residing there, or could rightfully lay any claim to these goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">The only remaining question is,\u2014Was the action barred by limitation when the suit was brought ? There is no pretense that it was, unless defendant was guilty of a conversion of the' goods when they were forwarded to Burton on the order of E. Adams; but if so, certainly the statute would not begin to run against plaintiff until he had notice of their conversion, or the lapse of time had been sufficient to charge him with notice of it. It is not pretended that plaintiff is chargeable with actual knowledge of the conversion in time to complete the bar before the commencement of his suit; and certainly we cannot say that the mere lapse of time from the 23d of January to the 6th of February is sufficient to raise a presumption that he must have known of the conversion of the goods, which we must do before we can reverse the judgment on this ground. When actual knowledge of the conversion is not shown, the statute cannot commence to run against the consignee before it was his duty to apply for the delivery of the goods. The time within which the owner is bound to apply for or demand them, evidently' depends upon the terms of. the contract under wffiich they were freighted, the usual length of time required to transport. freight from the place of delivery to its point of destination, the reasonable course of business at the place of its delivery, and other attending circumstances. These facts and circumstances, however, were not developed or exhibited upon the trial, as they should have been, by defendant, upon whom the affirmative of this issue rested. Whatever, therefore, may be the real facts, the evidence before them would not have warranted the jury in finding the action barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">There is no error in the judgment, and it is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
