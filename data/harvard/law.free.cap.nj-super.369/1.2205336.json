The Chancery Division judge held that it does not. He dismissed the complaint seeking admission of the purported will to probate and declared the decedent to have died intestate.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-15\">We agree and affirm substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Clarkson S. Fisher, Jr., in his comprehensive opinion reported at 369 <em>N.J.Super. </em>136, 848 A.2d 81 (Ch. Div.2003).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
