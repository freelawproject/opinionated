She pled guilty to third-degree possession of CDS, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-10a(l), in exchange for dismissal of the second-degree charge and a recommended non-custodial sentence. She then formally applied to PTI and the application was denied. Defendant was thereafter placed on probation for two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">On this appeal, defendant argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-13\">POINT I SINCE A DEFENDANT DEEMED INELIGIBLE FOR PTI BEFORE TRIAL MAY SEEK RECONSIDERATION OF THAT DECISION BY THE PTI PROGRAM EVEN POST-CONVICTION, THE TRIAL COURT SHOULD HAVE GRANTED MS. FRANGIONE\u2019S PRE-CONVICTION MO<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>TION SEEKING RECONSIDERATION BY THE PTI PROGRAM OF ITS \u201cPRE-SCREENING\u201d DETERMINATION IN HER CASE<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">We reject the argument and affirm the order of August 23, 2002, denying defendant\u2019s \u201cmotion to permit PTI application out-of-time.\u201d <em>See State v. Wallace, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>576, 580-81, 588-89, 684 A.2d 1355 (1996) (upholding denial of PTI involving a post-rejection plea <em>to a </em>reduced third-degree charge or a \u201cnegotiated plea [which] reduces the second-degree offense to a third-degree offense for sentencing purposes\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See also R. </em>3:28(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">We add only the following. <em>R. </em>3:28 and the PTI Guidelines have undergone various revisions between adoption of the Rule in 1970 and today. In the early and mid-1970\u2019s, some unsuccessful PTI applications were reconsidered after a plea or verdict depending upon the ultimate offenses before the court. <em>See R. </em>3:28 entitled \u201cDefendant\u2019s Employment Program\u201d and then \u201cDefendant\u2019s Diversionary Programs\u201d from October 1970 to April 1, 1974. That practice ended with the adoption of the PTI Guidelines after the decision in <em>State v. Leonardis, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>85, 363 A.2d 321 (1976); <em>see also State v. Leonardis, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>360, 375 A.2d 607 (1977); <em>Guideline </em>6 to <em>R. </em>3:28 with respect to the timing of PTI applications, and ultimately by adoption of the Code of Criminal Justice. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>2C:43-12e requiring applications for PTI to be made \u201cprior to trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\"><em>State v. Halm, 319 N.J.Super. </em>569, 726 A.2d 269 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>131, 741 A.2d 98 (1999), on which defendant relies, is distinguishable from the case at hand. <em>Halm </em>permitted reconsideration of a PTI denial for a third-degree crime on which defendant was convicted after presumptively ineligible first and second-degree charges <em>(see Guideline </em>3(i)) embodied <em>in </em>a separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>indictment were disposed of favorably to the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 573-74, 726 A.2d 269. Here, the second-degree crime was charged in the very indictment which included the third-degree count to which defendant pled guilty, thereby resulting in the conviction for which defendant now seeks PTI.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">We recognize that non-custodial probation is very similar to aspects of PTI, although here there is a conviction of record. However, consideration of this PTI application would be inconsistent with the application deadlines of the Code, to which the Supreme Court conformed <em>R. </em>3:28, and the PTI Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b290-8\">A challenge to the PTI denial is preserved, notwithstanding the <em>guilty plea, </em>pursuant to <em>R. </em>3:28(g), which is premised on the fact a guilty plea normally follows the PTI denial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b290-9\"> Defendant did not contest the denial of the application while the second-degree CDS offense was pending and does not challenge the initial denial before us. <em>See Guideline </em>3(i) to <em>R. </em>3:28.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
