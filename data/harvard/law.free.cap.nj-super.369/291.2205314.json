On April 2, 1993, in accordance with his plea agreement, P.L. was sentenced to a probationary term of three years, with the imposition of a $1000 f\u00edne, $50 laboratory fee, $50 violent crime penalty, and a driver\u2019s license suspension of six months. On June 30, 2003, P.L. petitioned for the expungement of his arrest and conviction for this offense, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:52-1 to -32, to which the State objected.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Law Division <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Judge concluded that expungement could be granted where the offense was possession with intent to distribute, as opposed to an actual or intended sale of a controlled dangerous substance (\u201cCDS\u201d), and that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:52-2c did not preclude this determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The State appeals, raising this issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">OUE LEGISLATUEE DID NOT INTEND TO PEEMIT THE EXPUNGEMENT OF CONVICTIONS FOB THE POSSESSION OF DEUGS WITH THE INTENT TO DISTBIBUTE WHEN THE METHOD OF DISTEIBUTION WAS OTHEKTHANASALE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">The State does not dispute that P.L.\u2019s arrest and conviction for possession with intent to distribute CDS would qualify for ex-pungement if <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:52-2c did not apply. That statute, in pertinent part, provides: \u201cIn the case of conviction for the sale or distribution of a controlled dangerous substance or possession thereof with intent to sell, expungement shall be denied____\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This statute clearly does not contain, within its preclusive terms, a conviction for the intent to distribute CDS. Thus, the literal terms of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:52-2c bar expungement only if the conviction embraced the actual sale or distribution of CDS, or the intent to sell CDS.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-14\">We find that the language in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:52-2c is clear and unambiguous. Accordingly, it is unnecessary for us to look beyond the statute\u2019s literal terms in order to ascertain its meaning. <em>See State v. Thomas, </em>166 <em>N.J. </em>560, 567, 767 A.2d 459 (2001) (\u201cIf the statute is clear and unambiguous on its face and admits of only one interpretation, we need delve no deeper than the act\u2019s literal terms to divine the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d (citation omitted)). Unlike <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-5a(1) which determines it a crime \u201c[t]o manufacture, distribute or dispense, or to possess or have under [a person\u2019s] control with intent to manufacture, distribute or dispense\u201d CDS, the expungement exception of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:52-2c <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>clearly refers to \u201cintent to sell\u201d and not to the \u201cintent to distribute\u201d CDS. The words \u201csell\u201d and \u201cdistribute\u201d are not synonymous; the word \u201cdistribute\u201d is defined more broadly. The statute defines \u201cdistribute\u201d to mean \u201cto deliver\u201d and \u201cdeliver\u201d \u201cmeans the actual, constructive, or attempted transfer from one person to another of a controlled dangerous substance.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-2. Thus, a person need not intend to sell CDS in order to be convicted of possession with the intent to distribute CDS; it is sufficient, for example, that a person intend to give CDS to another as a gift. <em>See State v. Heitzman, </em>209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>617, 621, 508 A.2d 1161 (App.Div.1986), <em>aff'd, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>603, 527 A.2d 439 (1987), This dichotomy has remained without change since 1979 although the Legislature amended <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:52-2 in 1989, 1993, and 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The Law Division Judge properly applied the principles of statutory construction in his determination of P.L.\u2019s expungement, holding that it was not precluded by the plain language of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:52-2c. We do not find this interpretation to be repugnant to the expressed purpose of expungement, which is to grant relief to a reformed, one-time offender. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:52-32. Despite the State\u2019s claim that this literal interpretation will hinder the plea-bargaining process, with which we do not necessarily agree, we cannot alter the plain meaning of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:52-2c. <em>See Rollins Leasing Corp. v. Dir., Div. of Taxation, </em>279 <em>N.J.Super. </em>540, 551, 653 A.2d 1131 (App.Div.1994) (\u201c[A] court\u2019s function is not to rewrite legislation, and it should not attempt to do so simply because the legislation does not comport with the court\u2019s idea of how the statute should read.\u201d). It is the court\u2019s duty to interpret a statute as written, not to legislate. <em>Casey v. Brennan, </em>344 <em>N.J.Super. </em>83, 125, 780 A.2d 553 (App.Div.2001), <em>aff'd, </em>173 <em>N.J. </em>177, 801 A.2d 245 (2002). If the plain meaning of the statute\u2019s operative words is at odds with the legislative intent behind their creation, then it is the Legislature that must fashion an appropriate correction.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b322-12\"> P.L. also petitioned for the expungement of two earlier arrests on charges of which he was acquitted. The State did not object to the expungement of these arrests.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b323-15\"> The statutory exceptions are not relevant to the facts of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
