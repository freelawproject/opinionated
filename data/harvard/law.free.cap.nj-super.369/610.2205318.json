To have done so is contrary to law and constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>The facts follow: On January 29, 1998, defendant Simmone Ikerd pled guilty to one count of third-degree theft by deception (welfare fraud), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-4. It was her first indictable conviction. Ikerd was sentenced on March 16 of that year to a five-year period of probation, conditioned upon entry into and completion of drug treatment and restitution of $2,675 at the rate of $25 per month, payable through probation, as well as payment of a VCCB penalty of $50 and a SNSF assessment of $75 at the rate of $5 per month. The sentencing judge found the need to deter defendant and others from violating the law as the sole aggravating factor relevant to Ikerd\u2019s sentence. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-1a(9). He found no mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">On February 14, 2008, Ikerd appeared before a different judge as the result of a reported violation of probation (VOP). At the time, she had paid only nineteen or twenty dollars in restitution and allegedly had been noncompliant with other probationary conditions. She remained drug-addicted, but she stated that she was undergoing drug treatment through a methadone clinic.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Ikerd had been arrested approximately two to three weeks before the February hearing when she was eight weeks pregnant, and initially had been confined to the Middlesex County Adult Correctional Facility. However, because of her pregnancy, she was transferred to Robert Wood Johnson Hospital for a period of two weeks in order to obtain access to methadone, which was not available in the jail. The hospitalization may also have been required to treat Ikerd\u2019s severe asthma. Although Ikerd had appeared in court on multiple occasions (the judge counted thirty-five or thirty-eight), her probation records disclose that this was her third VOP, and that one of the two prior violations had been withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">At the time of the February hearing, Ikerd was eleven weeks pregnant, a fact that she confirmed upon questioning by the judge. Although there had been some concern regarding the condition of her fetus, hospital tests had found that it remained viable. Ikerd sought continuation of her probation so that she could attempt to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>finish her drug treatment; the State requested incarceration in State prison because of the risk to both mother and fetus from drug abuse. The prosecutor argued: \u201cThere is nothing \u2014 no conditions of probation \u2014 that will help Miss [Ikerd] away from her addiction, help the life of her baby, and they will both be at risk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The judge characterized Ikerd\u2019s situation as creating a \u201cdilemma.\u201d She had acknowledged that she desired her present pregnancy. Yet, according to a doctor who had written to the court regarding Ikerd\u2019s treatment and condition, methadone maintenance was necessary to the preservation of that pregnancy, and, as the judge recognized, it was not available in county jail. Medical treatment in a hospital setting, the judge observed, would cause \u201c[t]he taxpayers to pay out a fortune.\u201d However, if Ikerd\u2019s probation were continued, there was no assurance that she would seek the high-risk pre-natal care that had been recommended as medically necessary. The judge believed that only place where Ikerd\u2019s addiction and the health of her fetus could be adequately addressed was the Edna Mahan Correctional Facility. He observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">I dare say, that there isn\u2019t a person in this group, who has a personal opinion, you know, put her in jail. Not because we want to punish her; but because we want to save the baby. Because we know, once we release her on the street, she\u2019s going to Mil herself, she\u2019s going to kill the baby, if she doesn\u2019t Mil herself. It\u2019s only because she\u2019s developed a tolerance that is beyond words. Because this bright lady, this educated lady, who is a public employee for years, is going to use drugs no matter what we do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-7\">So, we all agree. But how can I ignore the fact that she is pregnant?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">After further discussing options with the probation officer, prosecutor and defense counsel participating in the hearing, the judge observed that he did not \u201cfeel comfortable\u201d placing Ikerd in county jail. He then directed defense counsel to discuss punishment with Ikerd, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-9\">If you want to make my weekend, tell me that Miss Ikerd said, \u201cJudge, sentence me to the minimum amount of time at Edna Mahan, so I know that this child can be bom.\u201d Please do that. Tell me that she wants to go to jail, so she can save the baby.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVa\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>Ikerd responded through her counsel that she sought \u201cmercy from the Court\u201d and that she was \u201casking for the minimum time at Edna Mahan State Prison.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">A factual basis for the VOP was established, consisting of Ikerd\u2019s acknowledgment of a urine test that was positive for opiates on March 30, 2001, failure to pay \u201cfines\u201d in the approximate amount of $3,000, and failure to cooperate with prenatal testing that had been scheduled at a local hospital on March 23, 2001, a condition imposed by the probation department after the inception of the present pregnancy. We note that \u201c[n]o revocation of suspension or probation shall be based on failure to pay a fine or make restitution, unless the failure was willful.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:45-3a(4). The willfulness of Ikerd\u2019s conduct was not established in connection with her plea. We note as well that Ikerd asserted a defense in connection with her failure to obtain prenatal testing, stating that she had to leave the testing site on the date in question to take her daughter, who was ill with a streptococcal throat infection, to the doctor \u2014 a defense that was apparently rejected by the judge, who remarked: \u201cI\u2019ll accept her position. I\u2019m going to impose a guilty finding based on that.\u201d The court thereupon found a sufficient factual basis to permit acceptance of Ikerd\u2019s \u201cplea of guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">An extended discussion then occurred regarding sentencing. The fact that Ikerd had 261 days of jail credits created a problem in the judge\u2019s view. \u201cIf I sentence her to three years, with 261 days credit, and not a whole lot of criminal record in her background, she might be released in two or three months. Then where are we? She wants the baby.\u201d The prosecutor suggested the imposition of a period of parole ineligibility, to which the court agreed, with thanks. The judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-7\">Under the circumstances, what I\u2019m going to do is sentence Miss Ikerd ... to a three-year term. I am satisfied that the aggravating factor of the risk she will commit another offense is present. She does not have an extensive prior criminal history. The need to deter her and others from violating the law. There are really no mitigating factors that I see. I will add to that reason, the fact that she has showed a disinclination to cooperate with probation in any respect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>So, I\u2019m satisfied <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that the aggravating factors substantially outweigh the mitigating factors. I am going to sentence her to a three-year term, with an 18-month period of parole ineligibility. And 261 days credit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">Now, Mr. Fleming [defense counsel], if she loses the baby, if there is a problem, and she has the baby, I\u2019ll consider, since this is a Violation of Probation, any application that you wish to make at that time____But the point is, I want to keep her off the street. I don\u2019t want her using drugs. The only way I can do it is by putting her in jail.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">Ikerd appealed her sentence and, after a preliminary hearing as part of our Excessive Sentence Oral Argument Program, we requested further briefing of the issues raised by the court\u2019s sentencing procedures and decided to consider the matter in a plenary decision. Before this appeal was argued, Ikerd gave birth to a healthy child and was released from prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">The State argues in opposition to this appeal that it has been mooted by Ikerd\u2019s release from custody. We disagree, finding the issues presented to be of substantial importance, to be capable of repetition, and yet to be likely to otherwise evade review. <em>Roe v. Wade, </em>410 <em>U.S. </em>113, 124-25, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>705, 712-13, 35 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>147, 161 (1973).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-12\">[W]hen, as here, pregnancy is a significant fact in the litigation, the normal 266-day human gestation period is so short that the pregnancy will come to term before the usual appellate process is complete. If that termination makes a ease moot, pregnancy litigation seldom will survive much beyond the trial stage, and appellate review will be effectively denied. Our law should not be that rigid. Pregnancy often comes more than once to the same woman, and in the general population, if man is to survive, it will always be with us. Pregnancy provides a classic justification for a conclusion of nonmootness. It truly could be \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-13\"><em>[Id. </em>410 <em>U.S. </em>at 125, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 713, 35 L.Ed.2d at 161 (quoting <em>Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. ICC, </em>219 <em>U.S. </em>498, 515, 31 <em>S.Ct </em>279, 283, 55 <em>L.Ed. </em>310, 316 (1911)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AX\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number><em>See also Mistrick v. Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>158, 165, 712 A.2d 188 (1998); <em>Zirger v. General Accident Ins. Co., </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>327, 330, 676 A.2d 1065 (1996); <em>Division of Youth and Family Servs. v. J.B., </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>112, 118-19, 576 A.2d 261 (1990). Thus, even if this case can be considered moot, we find a decision on the merits to be warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Nor do we regard Ikerd to have waived her right to contest the sentence imposed when, faced with no viable alternative, she threw herself upon the mercy of the court. In such a circumstance, her equivocal acceptance of a pre-ordained result cannot be termed voluntary or knowing. <em>State v. Scherzer, </em>301 <em>N.J.Super. </em>363, 449, 694 A.2d 196 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>466, 700 A.2d 878 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">We recognize that punishment, including the imposition of a term of incarceration in the custody of the Department of Corrections, can legally be imposed on a defendant as the result of an inexcusable failure to comply with a condition of probation. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:45-3a(4) and -3b. However, the February hearing in Ikerd\u2019s case clearly demonstrated that the extent of the punishment imposed upon Ikerd resulted solely from her status as a pregnant addict. It bore no relationship to the offense that she initially committed, was excessively punitive, and accomplished no legitimate penal aim. It thus violated New Jersey law, and likely violated Ikerd\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">We commence our analysis with a discussion <em>of </em>New Jersey sentencing law and the bedrock principle that sentences should be oriented toward the offense, not the offender. <em>State v. Jabbour, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>1, 6, 570 A.2d 391 (1990); <em>State v. Baylass, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>169, 175, 553 A.2d 326 (1989); <em>State v. Roth, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>334, 355, 471 A.2d 370 (1984); <em>State v. Hodge, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>369, 375, 471 A.2d 389 (1984). Accordingly, when imposing a sentence on a VOP, the focus of the sentencing judge must be upon the underlying crime and the sentence appropriate to that crime when considered in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>conjunction with the aggravating factors found by the court at the time the initial sentence was imposed and any mitigating factors surviving the probationary violation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-6\">Generally, aggravating factors concentrate on the circumstances surrounding the commission of the original offense and serve to distinguish that offense from other similar offenses. <em>State v. Yarbough, </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>135, 143, 478 A.2d 432 (App.Div.1984), <em>remanded, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>627, 498 A.2d 1239 (1985). Once the court decides to impose a custodial sentence Tas the result of a VOP], it must again weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors to determine whether to impose the presumptive sentence or one that is more appropriate. The only aggravating factors the court may consider are those that existed at the time of the initial sentencing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-7\">[Baylass, <em>supra, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>at 176, 553 A.2d 326.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-8\"><em>See also State v. Vasquez, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>189, 205-06, 609 A.2d 29 (1992); <em>State v. Molina, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>181, 184-85, 553 A.2d 332 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">The fact that there has been a violation of probation \u201cmeans a failure of non-custodial rehabilitation. It does not necessarily suggest aggravating circumstances regarding the original offense mandating an enhanced punishment scheme.\u201d <em>State v. Smith, </em>226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>276, 280, 543 A.2d 1060 (App.Div.1988). <em>See also State v. Wilson, </em>226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>271, 276, 543 A.2d 1057 (App.Div.1988). <em>Cf. also People v. Bedenkop, </em>252 <em>Ill.App.3d </em>419, 192 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>163, 625 <em>N.E.2d </em>123 (1993) (reversing sentence on VOP premised on defendant\u2019s conduct in giving birth to an addicted baby while on probation and on the court\u2019s desire to insulate defendant from further opportunities for pregnancy). Initial consideration of a defendant\u2019s amenability to probation relates to the weighing of mitigating, not aggravating factors, which if found to have been present then but not after probation was violated, can be deleted from the calculus when imposing a sentence on the VOP. <em>Baylass, supra, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>at 177, 553 A.2d 326; <em>Molina, supra, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>at 185, 553 A.2d 332. <em>See also State v. Robinson, 232 N.J.Super. </em>21, 27-28, 556 A.2d 342 (App.Div.1989), <em>certif. denied, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>654, 569 A.2d 1349 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">In the present case, the VOP judge considered as an aggravating factor not only the need to deter, found initially, but also the previously uncited risk that Ikerd would commit another offense, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number><em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:44-la(3), as well as Ikerd\u2019s \u201cdisinclination to cooperate with probation in any respect.\u201d The precedent that we have discussed demonstrates that neither of the latter two factors should have been considered.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge was likewise wrong in seeking to address Ikerd\u2019s addiction in the fashion that he did. \u201cBy emphasizing the potential rehabilitative effect of incarceration, the court departed from the Code\u2019s mandate to forego defendant\u2019s capacity for rehabilitation and to concentrate on fitting the penalty to the crime.\u201d <em>Baylass, supra, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>at 179, 553 A.2d 326 (citing <em>State v. Hodge, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>369, 378-79, 471 A.2d 389 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Further, we find no warrant in the Code of Criminal Justice or case law interpreting it for imposition by the judge of a period of parole ineligibility in connection with a VOP sentence of less than the presumptive term, as occurred in this case. <em>See, State v. Ervin, </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>458, 473, 575 A.2d 491 (App.Div.1989), <em>certif. denied, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>634, 583 A.2d 328 (1990). There is no logic in a determination that the crime, in context, justified only a reduced sentence, but nonetheless was of such magnitude that a period of parole ineligibility was required. <em>See, e.g., Baylass, supra, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>at 179, 553 A.2d 326; <em>State v. Kruse, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>354, 361-62, 521 A.2d 836 (1987) (finding only limited circumstances in which a period of parole ineligibility can be imposed even on a presumptive sentence); <em>Smith, supra, </em>226 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 280-81, 543 A.2d 1060.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">Finally, we are satisfied that the judge\u2019s reasons for sentencing Ikerd to prison had no relationship whatsoever to the Criminal Code, as is required. No where was there any real consideration given to the impact of the probation violation that was demonstrated and to which Ikerd admitted guilt (essentially, the use of drugs in 2001) on the \u201cin out\u201d decision that must precede any sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>on a VOP. <em>Baylass, supra, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>at 175, 179, 553 A.2d 326; <em>Molina, supra, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>at 184, 553 A.2d 332. The transcript of the February hearing clearly discloses that the only reason that the judge sent Ikerd to prison was to protect the health of her fetus, a consideration wholly unrelated to Ikerd\u2019s underlying crime of welfare fraud. That the court was willing to reconsider its sentence if Ikerd\u2019s pregnancy terminated constitutes disturbing but compelling proof of this proposition. Ikerd was punished by being subjected to the extended prison term because she was pregnant and addicted, and for no other reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">A sentencing judge\u2019s personal views as to the nature of appropriate protections in this circumstance cannot substitute for the Code\u2019s carefully delineated sentencing scheme in this regard. \u201cJudges have no business imposing their views of \u2018enlightened\u2019 sentencing on society.\u201d <em>State v. Des Marets, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>62, 66, 455 A.2d 1074 (1983) (citing <em>id. </em>at 91, 455 A.2d 1074 (Handler, J. dissenting)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-7\">The purpose of the criminal justice system is to determine whether a crime has been committed and, if so, to punish the guilty parties \u2014 not to determine the most effective policy to combat a particular social ill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-8\">[Jean Reith Schroedel <em>&amp; </em>Pamela Fiber, <em>Punitive Versus Public Health Oriented Responses to Drug Use by Pregnant Women, </em>1 <em>Yale J.

It was contrary to statute. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:l-5a (\u201cno conduct constitutes an offense unless the offense is defined by this code or another statute of this State.\u201d). It violated principles of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>the separation of powers. <em>See State v.

It was thus improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">Our decision to vacate the sentence imposed in this matter finds ample support in state law, and thus we do not discuss at length the constitutional implications of the court\u2019s action. However, we recognize that the VOP judge\u2019s sentencing rationale touches upon, at least, intertwined principles underlying federal and state safeguards against cruel and unusual punishment <em>(see, e.g., Robinson v.

Nonetheless we find no legal support for what he did. Because the initially imposed period of probation was within those authorized for a third-degree crime, and the maximum period of that probation with appropriate credits has long expired, we reinstate the original probationary sentence and direct that no further proceedings are required.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b647-14\"> At our request, the February transcript was reviewed for accuracy during the course of this appeal. Changes, including the substitution of \"satisfied\" for \"received\u201d and a change in the attribution of a comment, were made by the transcribing reporter and communicated to us and to the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b650-7\"> Although not addressed by the VOP judge, Ikerd's drug use during pregnancy did not, at time of sentencing, by virtue of the pregnancy constitute a crime. <em>Cf. In re K.H.O., </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>337, 349, 736 A.2d 1246 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b652-7\"><em> </em>Commentators have faulted protective incarceration of methadone-dependent pregnant women in facilities that lack methadone treatment because the deprivation of methadone causes severe physical consequences to the mother and almost inevitably leads to the death of the fetus, thereby constituting cruel punishment. <em>See </em>Stephen R. Kandall <em>&amp; </em>Wendy Chavkin, <em>Illicit Drugs in America: History, Impact on Women and Infants, and Treatment Strategies for Women, </em>43 <em>Hastings L.J. </em>615, 629 n. 126 (1992). <em>See also </em>Peggy Hora &amp; Barrie Becker, <em>Judicial Considerations when Sentencing Pregnant Substance Abusers, </em>35, No.2 <em>Judges' J. </em>3, 6 (Spring 1996). That concern, arising initially in this case as the result of the imprisonment of Ikerd in the Middlesex County Jail, was alleviated by her transfer to a hospital facility and her subsequent transfer to a prison where methadone was apparently available.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
