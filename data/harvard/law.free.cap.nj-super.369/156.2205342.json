The lawyer asserted that the corporation was required to indemnify him for the expenses of the suit on the basis that he is a \u201ccorporate agent,\u201d as that term is used in the New Jersey Business Corporation Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>14A:1-1 to 16-1, specifically <em>N.J.S.A. </em>14A:3-5(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">The requirement that a corporation indemnify a \u201ccorporate agent\u201d is set forth in <em>N.J.S.A </em>14A:3-5(4), which essentially provides that a New Jersey corporation \u201cshall indemnify a corporate agent against expenses to the extent that such corporate agent has been successful on the merits or otherwise in any proceeding referred to in subsections 14A:3-5(2) and 14A:3-5(3) or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein.\u201d The trial judge ruled that the attorney was \u201ca corporate agent\u201d and thus entitled to such statutory indemnification. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">The attorney in this ease is Stephen C. Muhlstock and his law firm is Gittleman, Muhlstock, Chewcaskie &amp; Kim, to whom we collectively refer, unless the context otherwise requires, as \u201cMuhlstock.\u201d Muhlstock was outside counsel for Southbridge Park, Inc. (Southbridge), a New Jersey business corporation whose purpose is to provide residences for shareholders at a 174 unit cooperative apartment building in Fort Lee known as The Plaza.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>Beginning in 1988, C &amp; R Realty and Management, Co., Inc. (\u201cC &amp; R\u201d) became The Plaza\u2019s managing agent. The property manager that C &amp; R assigned to work at The Plaza was Anthony Pellosie, who had begun with C &amp; R in 1987. In 1995, the property management agreement between Southbridge and C &amp; R was in its last year, with a September 1 expiration date. A few months before that date, Southbridge\u2019s board of directors looked into alternate management arrangements for The Plaza. It decided in the end to hire Pellosie and another C &amp; R employee as its property managers and the agreement between Southbridge and C &amp; R came to an end.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">About two years earlier, Muhlstock had been hired by South-bridge\u2019s board of directors as their attorney. Muhlstock and his firm had a number of other clients and engaged in a general practice that included litigation, real estate, matrimonial, and other legal work. The firm represented five to eight condominium and cooperative boards.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Pellosie left C &amp; R and was in fact hired by Southbridge effective September 8, 1995. C &amp; R then sued him for alleged breach of agreement, and Southbridge entered into an indemnification agreement with Pellosie. Muhlstock prepared that agreement, and he also prepared board resolutions and a conflict of interest waiver. When C &amp; R asserted new claims in the litigation in October 1997, Muhlstock was replaced as counsel for Pellosie in that litigation because it appeared he would be a witness with respect to those new claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">On May 3, 1999, plaintiffs brought a derivative action on behalf of Southbridge alleging conspiracy and fraud in the hiring of a property manager. In that action, plaintiffs claimed that Muhlstock committed legal malpractice in representing the corporation in the hiring of a manager. Among other things, that suit sought a declaration that the indemnification agreement with Pellosie had been unlawfully entered into by Southbridge. The sixth count of the complaint contained a claim for damages against Muhlstock for counsel fees that Muhlstock received for representing Pellosie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>in the other litigation. Plaintiffs amended their complaint a second and third time on May 11, 1999, and January 31, 2000. The trial court consolidated the derivative action with the C &amp; R action, against which Southbridge had provided indemnification to Pellosie for his legal expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">At the trial of the claims in the derivative action, the court dismissed the claims against Muhlstock. When Muhlstock moved to have Southbridge indemnify it for the counsel fees and disbursements incurred in defending the malpractice claim, his motion was granted on the basis that he was the \u201ccorporate agent\u201d of Southbridge as that term is used in <em>N.J.S.A </em>14A:3-5(1)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">In granting Muhlstock\u2019s indemnification motion, the trial court noted that <em>N.J.S.A </em>14A:3-5(4) \u201cprovides for the indemnification of a corporate agent.\u201d The court then rejected Southbridge\u2019s contention that Muhlstock was \u201cmerely an independent contractor and not an agent,\u201d reasoning instead that, \u201c[b]oth intuitively and as a matter of law, a corporate attorney advising a corporate client on matters relating to the employment of other corporate employees and other corporate agents is clearly a corporate agent within the meaning of the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">Muhlstock asserts that the trial court reached the correct result when it concluded that he was Southbridge\u2019s \u201ccorporate agent\u201d for purposes of <em>N.J.S.A </em>14A:3-5(4). He argues that an \u201cattorney-client relationship is always considered that of principal-agent pursuant to New Jersey and other persuasive law,\u201d and thus that he unquestionably is entitled to the statutory indemnification that is available to \u201ccorporate agents\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A </em>14A:3-5(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">In <em>Witco Corp. v. Beekhuis, </em>38 <em>F.</em>3d 682, 691 (3d Cir.1994), the Third Circuit noted that modern corporate indemnification legislation is designed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-10\">to \u201cpromote the desirable end that corporate officials will resist what they consider\u201d unjustified suits and claims, \u201csecure in the knowledge that their reasonable expenses will be borne by the corporation they have served if they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>vindicated.\u201d Beyond that, its larger purpose is \u201cto encourage capable men to serve as corporate directors, secure in the knowledge that expenses incurred by them in upholding their honesty and integrity as directors will be borne by the corporation they serve.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-6\">[quoting <em>Merritt-Chapman &amp; Scott Corp. v. Wolfson, </em>321 A.2d 138, 141 (Del.Super.1974) (quoting Folk, <em>The Delaware General Corporation Law </em>98 (1972)) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Here, of course, the issue is not whether indemnification for corporate officials should be approved, because our Legislature has already approved it. Rather, our inquiry is whether Muhlstock comes within that class of persons the Legislature has deemed entitled to indemnification. Specifically, the focal point of our analysis is the statutory language \u201ccorporate agent,\u201d since if Muhlstock, though serving as an outside attorney, was acting as a corporate agent within the statute\u2019s meaning, he was entitled to indemnification pursuant to its terms, and otherwise he was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">It is firmly established that \u201c[t]he first step in determining the Legislature\u2019s intent is to look at the plain language of the statute.\u201d <em>Hubbard v. Reed, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>387, 392, 774 A.2d 495 (2001). Furthermore, \u201cwhen the language of a statute is clear on its face, \u2018the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Sheeran v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>548, 556, 404 A.2d 625 (1979)) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">In our view, however, this is not a \u201cplain language\u201d case, and Muhlstock\u2019s argument oversimplifies the lawyer-client relationship. While \u201c[i]t is clear that an attorney acts as an agent for his client,\u201d <em>Hewitt v. Allen Canning Co., </em>321 <em>N.J.Super. </em>178, 184, 728 A.2d 319 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>335, 736 A.2d 528 (1999), it is also true that a \u201clawyer, although required to work for the client\u2019s benefit, has considerable independence in doing so.\u201d <em>Restatement (Third) of The Law Governing Lawyers, </em>Introductory Note to Chapter 2, The Client-Lawyer Relationship (2000). Thus, \u201cattorneys are also independent contractors as well as agents.\u201d <em>McCarthy v. Recordex Serv., Inc., </em>80 F.3d 842, 853 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>519 <em>U.S. </em>825, 117 <em>S.Ct. </em>86, 136 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>42 (1996); <em>see Restatement (Second) of Agency, </em>\u00a7 14N (1958) (\u201cOne <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>who contracts to act on behalf of another and subject to the other\u2019s control with respect to his physical conduct is an agent and also an independent contractor\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">There appears to be no published case in New Jersey that has decided whether an attorney who was outside counsel to a corporation and who was subsequently sued for malpractice by shareholders of that corporation may be indemnified as a \u201ccorporate agent\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>14A:3-5(4) against legal costs incurred in defending against the malpractice claim. We are, however, guided by the interpretive principle that a court can find assistance in construing a statute by examining similar statutes in other states, 2B Singer, <em>Sutherland on Statutory Construction, </em>\u00a7 52.03 (6th ed.2000), particularly if they are statutes from which ours has been copied or derived, <em>Francis v. United Jersey Bank, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>15, 28, 432 A.2d 814 (1981), or a uniform act, Singer, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 52.05. We accordingly turn to the law of other states that have considered similar issues under statutory indemnification provisions that are comparable to those in <em>N.J.S.A </em>14A:3-5. While the law on this point appears to be sparse, a few reported cases afford valuable guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">In particular, the cases from other jurisdictions that we find helpful in this connection, and which we cite here in the order in which we will discuss them below, are <em>Western Fiberglass, Inc. v. Kirton, McConkie and Bushnell, </em>789 P.2d 34 (Utah App.1990); <em>Channel Lumber Co. v. Porter Simon, 78 Cal.App.4th </em>1222, 93 <em>Cal.Rptr.2d </em>482 (2000); and <em>Fasciana v. Electronic Data Systems Corp., </em>829 A.2d 160 (Del.Ch.2003).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>As a threshold matter, we point out that the issue before us stands on a different footing than claims under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>14A:3-5(2) and 14A:3-5(3), which provide for permissive corporate indemnification of certain persons in certain circumstances. Thus, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>14A:3-5(2) provides that a New Jersey corporation has the power to indemnify a \u201ccorporate agent\u201d against liability and legal expenses incurred \u201cin connection with any proceeding involving the corporate agent by reason of his being or having been such a corporate agent, other than a proceeding by or in the right of the corporation.\u201d Addressing shareholders\u2019 derivative actions and other actions by or on behalf of a corporation, <em>N.J.S.A </em>14A:3-5(3) essentially provides that a corporation has the power to indemnify a \u201ccorporate agent\u201d against such legal expenses \u201cin connection with any proceeding by or in the right of the corporation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>procure a judgment in its favor which involves the corporate agent by reason of his being or having been such corporate agent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">The present claim stands outside the fact pattern of a typical permissive indemnification claim under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>14A:3-5(2) and 14A:3-5(3). Instead, it rests on <em>N.J.S.A </em>14A:3-5(4), which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-5\">[a]ny corporation organized for any purpose under any general or special law of this State shall indemnify a corporate agent against expenses to the extent that such corporate agent has been successful on the merits or otherwise in any proceeding referred to in subsection 14A:3-5(2) or subsection 14A:3-5(3) or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Read in conjunction with <em>N.J.SA </em>14A:3-5(3), <em>N.J.SA </em>14A:3-5(4) requires that a corporation indemnify its \u201ccorporate agent\u201d if that agent is successful in a shareholders\u2019 derivative action involving that agent. In the present case, the court relied upon <em>N.J.SA </em>14A:3-5(4) as its basis for ordering Southbridge to indemnify Muhlstock against legal expenses incurred in plaintiffs\u2019 derivative action.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">The court in <em>Western Fiberglass, supra, </em>noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">Mandatory indemnification, was enacted primarily to protect vindicated officers and directors from a refusal to indemnify when an adverse shift in management occurred. However, the Delaware statute does not limit application to that situation. Barrett, <em>[Mandatory Indemnification of Corporate Officers and Directors, </em>29 Sw.L.J. 727 (1975) ] concluded:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Al\">under [Delaware\u2019s] section 145(c) an insider who has been successful wholly or partially on a technical defense may demand and receive indemnification, including legal fees, notwithstanding the standards of conduct in (a) and (b) that must be met if the corporation chooses to indemnify. An underlying policy for the enactment of an indemnification provision favorable to management was the desire to attract incorporators for the state of Delaware.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-9\">[789 P.2d at 37-38.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">Under <em>N.J.SA </em>14A:3-5(l)(a), the term \u201ccorporate agent\u201d is defined as \u201cany person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the indemnifying corporation.\u201d Muhlstock, of course, is not a Southbridge director, officer, or employee, and his only basis for mandatory indemnification under <em>N.J.SA </em>14A:3-5(4) arises if he is properly categorized as Southbridge\u2019s \u201ccorporate agent\u201d under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>14A:3-5(1)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>In <em>Western Fiberglass, </em>a corporation sold equipment to a third party that apparently failed to make the necessary payments for that equipment. 789 P.2d at 34-36. Foreclosure loomed, and the corporation discovered that its security interest had not been perfected and that another creditor\u2019s lien was superior. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The corporation brought a malpractice action against its outside legal counsel for not perfecting the security interest. The lawyers evidently had played a minimal role in the negotiations with the third party and did not represent the corporation at the closing on the purchase loan. <em>Id. </em>at 36. The lawyers and the corporation were found to be equally negligent, and this barred recovery against the lawyers under Utah law, where a recovering party\u2019s negligence must be less than that of the defendant. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Asserting that they were acting as the corporation\u2019s \u201cagent\u201d in the security-interest matter, the lawyers requested that the corporation indemnify them against their legal expenses in defending against the corporation's malpractice action pursuant to a statutory provision, Utah Business Corporation Act, \u00a7 16-10-4(2)(e), that has an obvious similarity to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>14A:3-5(4).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 35-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">The Utah Court of Appeals framed the issue on appeal as \u201c[d]oes the word \u2018agent\u2019 in the corporate indemnification provision of our statute include a law firm engaged by a corporation to render legal advice concerning a sale of corporate equipment?\u201d It decided that question in the negative, determining that the lawyers were not the corporation\u2019s agent within the meaning of the controlling statute. <em>Id. </em>at 36-39. In doing so, it determined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-9\">[^legislatures have implemented indemnity statutes so corporations can attract capable management executives, not competent attorneys at law. The statutes are designed to protect persons exercising corporate discretion and authority, not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>attorneys those persons hire to give them legal advice. Based on public policy considerations, we conclude that ... [the lawyer] was not a corporate \u201cagent\" within the meaning of the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-4\"><em>[Id. </em>at 38 (citations and footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-5\"><em>Western, Fiberglass </em>also found that the lawyers had not had \u201cmanagement authority\u201d within the corporation and that, at the time of the closing with the third-party equipment buyers, they were \u201cnot exercising any corporate discretion- or authority but [were] ... under the direction of [the corporation\u2019s] ... officers and agents.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 39. At the same time, the Court of Appeals observed that under the controlling statute, the terms \u201cdirector, officer, employee or agent\u201d have \u201csynonymous underlying meanings,\u201d and that the term \u201cagent\u201d \u201cindicates persons operating on equal footing in the management authority of the corporation.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>It concluded that the indemnification \u201cstatute is concerned with corporate personnel who exercise management discretion and who have authority to bind the corporation, not someone like ... [the lawyer] having any type of agency relationship with the corporation.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Another instructive out-of-state decision is <em>Channel Lumber, supra, </em>where a corporation had retained lawyers as trial counsel to defend an action by the corporation\u2019s tenants. 93 Cal.Rptr.2d at 485. The defense was unsuccessful, and the corporation in turn unsuccessfully sued the lawyers for professional negligence. The trial court granted judgment for the lawyers and they sought indemnification as the corporation\u2019s agent under a California statute, <em>Cal. Corp.Code </em>\u00a7 317(d)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, similar to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>14A:3-5. Although the trial court granted judgment for the lawyers, the Court of Appeals reversed, with one dissent, concluding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adm\">when outside counsel (as opposed to in-house counsel) is retained by a corporation to represent it at trial and then is sued by the corporation for allegedly committing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>legal malpractice while representing the corporation, outside counsel is a party to the malpractice suit by reason of his or her actions in the capacity of an independent contractor, not \u201cby reason of the tact that [outside counsel] is or was an agent of the corporation,\u201d within the meaning and purposes [of the controlling statute.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 484 (quoting <em>Cal. Corp.Code </em>\u00a7 317(c) (West 1990)).J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">The court analyzed the relationship between an outside trial lawyer and the corporate client and concluded essentially that the independent nature of the skilled services provided by such lawyers indicates that they are independent contractors, performing work that corporations cannot perform without the aid of such professionals. <em>Id. </em>485-88. On the other hand, it also noted that the attorney-client relationship is plainly governed by principles of agency. <em>Id. </em>at 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Accordingly, the court opined that \u201cin a broad and general sense, an outside attorney retained to represent a corporate client at trial is both an independent contractor and an agent,\u201d and \u201cwhether an outside trial attorney is an agent of his or her corporate client within the meaning of ... [the statute] must be determined by reference to the purpose of the statute.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">The Court of Appeals in <em>Channel Lumber </em>further observed that the controlling statute \u201cwas enacted to encourage capable individuals to act for and in the place of the corporation by affording them indemnification for the expenses of defending against lawsuits to which they are made parties because they are agents of the corporation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 489. Thus, the statute</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-10\">is an indemnity statute, not an attorney fee statute. The Legislature did not provide therein for an award of attorney fees whenever an agent is successful in litigation with a corporate principal. Bather, indemnification is limited to actions in which a person is involved \u201cby reason of the fact that the person is or was an agent of the corporation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-11\"><em>[Id. </em>at 488 (quoting <em>Cal. Corp.Code </em>\u00a7 317(c) (West 1990)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-12\">By so limiting a corporation\u2019s mandatory indemnification obligation, the statute</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-13\">is intended not only to afford reasonable protection to corporate agents, but also to impose safeguards to protect shareholders by restricting indemnity to situations in which liability is sought to be imposed upon an individual by reason of the fact the person was an agent of a corporation, i.e., based upon acts or omissions in which, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>under general principles of agency law, the person was charged with acting for and in the place of the corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuR\"><em>lid. </em>at 489.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">The Court of Appeals concluded by determining that neither of these statutory purposes would be served by allowing an outside trial counsel to avail itself of mandatory statutory indemnity, because the lawyers had been sued for malpractice by the corporation for their \u201cactions in the capacity of an independent contractor of the corporation, not for acts which, under principles of agency, are deemed to be those of the corporation.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Stated somewhat differently, the lawyers had been sued for malpractice because of their actions as legal professionals concerning the discovery violations, not for some action taken by them for and in place of the corporation. <em>Ibid:</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The court thus reversed the order entered below and thereby denied indemnification to the lawyers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>concluding that it would neither serve the statutory purpose of providing reasonable protection to an agent whose acts could be deemed to be those of the corporation nor protect shareholders from unnecessary indemnification expenses. <em>Id. </em>at 489-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Finally, we consider <em>Fasciana, supra, </em>where a lawyer served as outside counsel for a corporation. 829 A.2d at 164-66. A federal grand jury returned an indictment against the lawyer essentially alleging that he had conspired with certain corporation employees to defraud the corporation and had made material misrepresentations to third parties on behalf of the corporation as part of the illegal scheme. <em>Id. </em>at 165.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">The corporation later filed a civil action against the lawyer asserting malpractice, negligence, and fraud, based on the allegation that questionable legal advice given to it by the lawyer was intended to advance the fraudulent scheme and that the lawyer allegedly made material misrepresentations to the third parties on behalf of the corporation. <em>Id. </em>at 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Thereafter, the lawyer filed an action seeking an advance of his legal expenses in the criminal and civil actions pursuant to a corporate bylaw that provided for such advance to the fullest extent permitted by a controlling statute. <em>Id. </em>at 167-68. The court interpreted Delaware\u2019s counterpart to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>14A:3-5, <em>Del.Code Ann. </em>tit. 8, \u00a7 145, under which corporations are permitted \u201cto afford advancement and indemnification rights to then-agents,\u201d as well as to former directors, officers, and employees. <em>Id. </em>at 168 n. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">The Vice Chancellor framed the \u201ckey question\u201d in <em>Fasciana </em>as \u201cwhat definition of agent did the General Assembly intend to use in drafting \u00a7 145?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 168. The court noted that \u201cattorneys are identified as common examples of agents\u201d but refused to accept the lawyer\u2019s argument that \u201c\u00a7 145 was intended to be coextensive with the broadest possible meaning of that term in colloquial American legal usage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>Instead, the judge thought it \u201cmore likely that the General Assembly intended the term to be used in the more precise sense characteristic of its primary common law definition, which embraces the \u2018essential\u2019 requirement that an agent have \u2018the power to act on behalf of the principal with third persons.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(footnote omitted). According to the court, \u00a7 145 has a \u201climited purpose\u201d in light of the legislature\u2019s apparent belief \u201cthat corporations ought to be able to extend advancement and indemnification rights to outside contractors who acted on .behalf of the corporation in dealings with third parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 170 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">With that limited purpose in mind, the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">[T]he General Assembly intended that the term agent be used in its most traditional senses as involving action by a person (an agent) acting on behalf of another (the principal) as to third parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-7\">By contrast, whether or not attorneys are sometimes loosely referred to [as] agents of their clients, there seems to be little to commend extending that loose appellation into the \u00a7 145 context. One can imagine many situations in which outside attorneys are engaged by corporations to provide specialized legal advice about a particular problem. That type of representation might simply involve the lawyer providing candid, confidential legal advice to the client to address a legal issue arising out of specific factual circumstances. In providing that advice, the lawyer is duty-bound to give his client her best legal judgment, applying appropriate standards of professional care. Indeed, in that capacity, the lawyer might well owe the obligations of a fiduciary to the client for obvious reasons, including that the attorney has been entrusted with the client\u2019s confidences in circumstances in which the client is entitled to repose confidence and trust. That this is so does not, it seems to me, make the lawyer the agent of the corporation in the sense that \u00a7 145 intends. If all that the attorney does is give the corporation confidential, private legal advice <em>that is not intended for use with third-parties, </em>the policy concerns of \u00a7 145 are not implicated and the dangers of applying an overly loose definition of agency quickly emerge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-8\">Why? Because in a malpractice dispute between the corporation and the lawyer, the lawyer would, if deemed an agent and if the corporation had a not-uncommon bylaw providing mandatory advancement rights to agents, find himself able to fund his defense from the corporation\u2019s coffers. This is an odd result that is unlikely to have resulted from a specific retention agreement between a corporation and outside attorney, and is not one that \u00a7 145 should be construed as creating when the use of a more constrained and, indeed, traditional definition of agency can avoid that result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-9\"><em>[Id. at </em>170-72 (footnotes omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Thus rejecting any \u201coverly loose definition\u201d of the term \u201cagent,\u201d <em>Fasciana </em>framed the remaining question as whether the lawyer \u201cfaces claims that involve his conduct as an agent for ... [the corporation] in dealing with third parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 172. On the facts before it, the court answered this question, \u201c[b]y and large,\u201d in the negative, stating that most of the allegations of fraud in the criminal and civil actions involved the lawyer\u2019s \u201cmisconduct in his capacity as a legal advisor\u201d to the corporation. <em>Id. </em>at 172-73.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">The rationale and result of the persuasive authorities that we have reviewed argue compellingly against determining that Muhlstock is a \u201ccorporate agent\u201d entitled to statutory indemnification by Southbridge. We glean the following relevant factors from these other cases. As in those eases, Muhlstock was not cloaked with any management authority by his client, Southbridge, and he did not exercise managerial discretion on its behalf. Instead, Muhlstock acted in his role as outside counsel and provided legal advice to Southbridge, his corporate client. Also, Muhlstock was sued because of that advice and not because of any direct action by him on behalf of Southbridge concerning a third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">Additionally, the legislative purpose apparently underlying <em>N.J.S.A. </em>14A:3-5(4) would not be served if Muhlstock\u2019s indemnification is allowed to stand. The legislative history behind <em>N.J.S.A </em>14A:3-5 is sparse, but a \u201cpredominant object of the 1968 Revision [of the New Jersey statute] was. to expand and render more flexible the powers and uses of corporations in the light of modem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>business convenience and practice, thereby to attract incorporators to this State.\u201d <em>Roxbury State Bank v. The Clarendon, </em>129 <em>N.J.Super. </em>358, 368, 324 A.2d 24 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>66 <em>N.J. </em>316, 331 A.2d 16 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Plainly, this \u201cpredominant object\u201d of the statute would not be served by an interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A </em>14A:3-5(1)(a) that expands the definition of \u201ccorporate agent\u201d to include outside counsel who only give advice to a corporation and do not exercise authority or discretion on behalf of the corporation in relation to third parties. There is no basis rationally for concluding that incorporators would be attracted to a jurisdiction that requires a corporation to pay the legal expenses of retained counsel when the corporation sues that counsel for malpractice in rendering legal advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Similarly, the \u201cpurpose of indemnification [statutes like <em>N.J.S.A </em>14A:3-5(4) ] is to encourage capable and responsible individuals to accept positions in corporate management, secure in the knowledge that expenses incurred by them in upholding their duties will be borne by the corporation.\u201d 13 <em>Fletcher Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations </em>\u00a7 6045.10 (1995 Revised Volume, 1995). That purpose would not be served by indemnifying persons, like Muhlstoek, whose purportedly indemnifiable litigation expenses do not arise out of their exercise of managerial authority on behalf of the corporation, but rather arose out of their role as outside counsel to the corporation, providing legal advice to corporate management. Plainly, Muhlstock\u2019s services did not involve the exercise of managerial authority or discretion on behalf of South-bridge or the representation of Southbridge in dealings with third parties. Instead, he was sued by Southbridge essentially for providing it with allegedly faulty legal advice concerning Pellosie\u2019s indemnification in the C &amp; R action and for failing to disclose any knowledge about Pellogreen.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Nor would the statute\u2019s purpose necessarily be advanced in a situation such as the present one when, as counsel indicated at oral argument, the indemnification claim essentially is one for subrogation being pursued by the attorney\u2019s malpractice insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>earner. Indeed, while corporations often obtain directors and officers insurance to assist in fulfilling their indemnification obligations to those officials, by contrast outside professionals typically maintain their own coverage against professional liability. Thus, outside attorneys can look to that coverage rather than having to depend on corporate director and officers insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Moreover, Muhlstock and Southbridge are engaged in separate occupations, and Muhlstock\u2019s occupation as a lawyer requires skills and professional accreditation that Southbridge did not possess and was therefore compelled to hire. The work performed by Muhlstock (the provision of legal advice to cooperative housing organizations) is not part of Southbridge\u2019s regular business. Thus, the ability to enter into the indemnification agreement and to hire Pellosie rested at all times with Southbridge. Muhlstock\u2019s role was only that of a legal advisor who provided a professional opinion concerning the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">With respect to the issue of control, it appears that Southbridge exercised very little control over Muhlstock\u2019s actions as a legal advisor, deferring to his professional opinion rather than directing him to form an opinion that comported with Southbridge\u2019s corporate requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">Even though Muhlstock did not function as Southbridge\u2019s trial counsel, his legal services for Southbridge were comparable in that he performed legal work that Southbridge was unable to provide itself: he provided legal advice to Southbridge concerning Pellosie\u2019s indemnification. Furthermore, Muhlstock was sued by Southbridge because of his provision of that legal advice and his alleged failure to disclose another matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">Under the rationale of <em>Channel Lumber, supra, </em>Muhlstock is not eligible for mandatory indemnification because he was not acting for or in the place of Southbridge when he provided that legal advice. Instead, the provision of such advice was part of his function as an independent-contractor/outside counsel servicing a corporate client. Moreover, Muhlstock\u2019s position is different than that of an in-house counsel, a kind of \u201cagent\u201d which Southbridge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>virtually conceded at oral argument would have a stronger claim to being a \u201ccorporate agent\u201d under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">In the present case, Muhlstock was Southbridge\u2019s outside counsel, but he did not represent Southbridge in any litigation or negotiations with third parties pertinent to this case. Instead, with Southbridge\u2019s active encouragement, Muhlstock represented Pellosie in the C &amp; R litigation, and he provided advice to Southbridge about Pellosie\u2019s indemnification agreement about that litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">To summarize, we conclude in light of the language of <em>N.J.S.A </em>14A:3-5(l)(a) and 14:3-5(4) and in view of the persuasive case law which has informed us, that the trial court erred in determining that Muhlstock was Southbridge\u2019s \u201ccorporate agent\u201d and thus eligible for mandatory statutory indemnification. Rather, statutes such as <em>N.J.SA </em>14A:3-5 are intended to provide indemnification to protect persons who exercise binding managerial authority and discretion on behalf of a corporation in matters involving third parties. They are not intended to be attorney\u2019s fees statutes nor to provide indemnification for outside legal counsel who only provide legal advice to the corporation without interaction with third parties on behalf of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Accordingly, we reverse the order entered below granting indemnification for Muhlstock against the legal expenses he incurred in defending Southbridge\u2019s malpractice action against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Muhlstoek\u2019s cross appeal contends that the trial court erred in denying his request for the payment of his expert\u2019s fees as part of the indemnification award against Southbridge. Because Muhlstock is not entitled to indemnification, necessarily he is not entitled to be indemnified against his expert witness expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">We reverse the order of indemnification. As a result, the issue as to expert witness expenses is moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b192-6\"> The indemnification statutes in New Jersey and the other states to which we refer appear to have originated in Delaware law. In 1950, the American Bar Association's Committee on Corporate Laws of the Section of Corporation, Banking and Business Law (\"Committee\") published the Model Business Corporation Act (\"1950 Model Act\"). <em>Model Bus. Corp. Act </em>\u00a7 5, Official Comment at 218 (2d ed.1971). \"In preparing the 1950 edition of the Model Act, the Committee deemed it important to provide for statutory indemnity and selected the Delaware statute as it then existed because of its brevity and simplicity.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>In that manner, <em>Del.Code Ann. </em>tit. 8, \u00a7 122(10), became the source upon which the corresponding provisions oi the 1950 Model Act, \u00a7 4(o), were based. <em>See Model Bus. Corp. Act </em>\u00a7 4(o), Official Comment at 146 (1960). This was Delaware's \"original provision\u201d respecting the indemnification of corporate officers and directors. Bishop, <em>The Law of Corporate Officers and Directors, </em>\u00a7 6.02 at 6. Thereafter, \"the Committee in February 1967 approved a new section 4A to supplant section 4(o)\u201d of the 1950 Model Act, and this new \u00a7 4A \"was developed in consultation with the Delaware Corporation Law Revision Committee and is substantially identical with Section 145 of the new Delaware General Corporation Law of 1967,\u201d <em>Model Bus. Corp. Act </em>\u00a7 5 Official Comment at 218 (2d ed.1971), which among other things provided for the mandatory indemnification of directors, officers, employees, and agents of a corporation under certain circumstances. <em>Del.Code Ann. </em>tit. 8, \u00a7 145(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">To summarize, the indemnification provisions in <em>NJ.S.A. </em>14:3-5 are \"derived from section 4A of the Model Act,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>14:3-5 \"Commissioners' Comment \u2014 1968,\u201d which in turn were based on the Delaware statute. Additionally, the Utah mandatory indemnification provision, <em>Utah Code Ann. </em>\u00a7 16\u2014 10-4(2)(c), involved in <em>Western Fiberglass, supra, </em>789 If 2d at 36, appears to have followed the Delaware pattern in that it applied to directors, officers, employees, and agents of a corporation. The California mandatory indemnification provision involved in <em>Channel Lumber, supra, APSB Bancorp v. Grant, </em>26 <em>Cal.App.4th 926, </em>31 <em>Cal.Rptr.2d. </em>736 (1994), and <em>Katayama v. Interpacific Props., Inc., </em>236 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>108 (Ct.App.1987), appears also to have followed the Delaware pattern, at least loosely. <em>Cal Corp.Code </em>\u00a7 317; <em>see </em>Bishop, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 6.40 (discussing the California statute).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b195-10\"> The Utah statute reads, \u201d[t]o the extent that a director, officer, employee, or agent of a corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in Subsection (2)(a) or (b), or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, he shall be indemnified against expenses, including attorneys' fees, which he actually and reasonably incurred in connection therewith.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b196-7\"> The California statute reads, \"[t]o the extent that an agent of a corporation has been successful on the merits in defense of any proceeding referred to in subdivision (b) or (c) or in defense of any claim, issue, or matter therein, the agent shall be indemnified against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by the agent in connection therewith.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b198-6\"> <em>Channel Lumber </em>relied on another California appellate decision, <em>APSB Bancorp, supra, </em>which involved an accounting firm, not a law firm. 31 <em>Cal.Rptr. 2d </em>at 737-38. In affirming the denial of indemnification, the court in <em>APSB Bancorp </em>determined that the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-7\">allows indemnification for corporate \"agents\" sued for carrying out activities on behalf of a corporation within the common law meaning of agency, but not where the acts giving rise to the underlying suit arose out of retention of an independent contractor performing business for its own benefit, even though the activities may directly benefit the corporation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKs\"><em>[Id. at </em>737.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">The court also observed that the client, a bank, had \"exercised very little control over\u201d the accountants, and while the bank's \"provision of workplace, employees, financial records and computers\" to the accountant during audits tended to show that the accountant was the bank's agent, the \"stronger case for a nonagency relationship is shown because the two parties are engaged in separate occupations, the work performed by ... [the accountant] is not part of ... [the bank's] regular business, the contractual nature of the engagements and the parties did not expressly create an agency relationship as evidenced by the engagement letters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 740.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">Although another California case, <em>Katayama, supra, </em>appears to support Muhlstock's position in this appeal, it is unpersuasive. <em>See </em>236 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>at 109. While the opinion appears in the California Reporter, the California Supreme Court evidently \u201cordered that the opinion be not officially published.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 108 n. *. We thus take its value as precedent to be negligible and mention it only because the parties refer to it in their briefs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b201-9\"> The court found, however, that there was one exception to its conclusion that the lawyer did not face charges or claims \"arising out his conduct as an agent\u201d of the corporation, which involved the criminal charges and civil claims arising out of the material misrepresentations the lawyer allegedly made to third parties on behalf of the corporation and in furtherance of the fraudulent scheme. <em>Id. </em>at 173-74. The court determined that, because the lawyer functioned as the corporation\u2019s agent in dealing with those third parties, he was entitled to an advancement of his legal expenses to defend the specific charges and claims arising out of that agency. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
