James, appellant, filed with the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission a claim for benefits against General Motors Corporation, appellee. His claim, that he was temporarily totally disabled as a result of an occupational disease (bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome) arising out of and in the course of his employment with General Motors, was confirmed by the Commission, and appellee appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">The appeal was tried before a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Appellant\u2019s motion for judgment made at the end of his case and, again, at the end of the entire case having been denied, one issue, whether appellant was \u201clast injuriously exposed to the hazards of the occupational disease [bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome before September, 1985] while employed by the General Motors Corporation, Wilmington, Delaware,\u201d was submitted to the jury. The jury answered yes and, accordingly, the court entered judgment on the verdict in favor of appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">Appellant has appealed, presenting two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-12\">1. Did the trial judge err in denying the claimant\u2019s motion for judgment and refusing to affirm the decision of the Maryland\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>in view of the fact that the claimant\u2019s last injurious exposure to the hazards of his occupational disease occurred at the employer\u2019s plant in Baltimore?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-4\">2. Did the trial judge err in denying the claimant\u2019s motion for judgment for failure of the employer to produce legally sufficient evidence to satisfy its burden of proving that the decision of the Maryland Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission was incorrect?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Since our answer to the first question is- in the affirmative, we will reverse; therefore, it is unnecessary that we reach question 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">The parties have submitted an agreed Statement of Facts to facilitate our review. That statement is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">1. The claimant, Wayne D. James, was an employee of General Motors Corporation for 13 years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-8\">2. The claimant was employed as an assembly line worker at the employer\u2019s Baltimore plant until June 1981 when he was laid off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-9\">3. The claimant was rehired at the employer\u2019s Baltimore plant on September 9, 1985.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-10\">4. During the interim period between June, 1981 and August 1985, the claimant worked at the employer\u2019s plant in Wilmington, Delaware for approximately three years. During this employment, the claimant worked with a grinder, repetitively pressing with his hands.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-11\">5. The claimant continued working at the employer\u2019s Baltimore plant until April 23, 1986. During this period of employment from September 1985 to April 1986, the claimant used air tools and air guns which turned and jerked his hands and wrists repetitively.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-12\">6. The medical experts who testified (Dr. Andrew J. Weiland, the treating orthopedic surgeon, and Dr. Carmen Fratto, the employer\u2019s plant physician) agreed that the claimant has an occupational disease of his hands and wrists known as bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. He began having symptoms of this condition in 1979.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>7. On August 2, 1985, the claimant\u2019s expert Dr. Weiland found the claimant had symptoms of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-4\">8. On September 9, 1985, before commencing his return to actual employment in Baltimore, the claimant underwent diagnostic tests which confirmed Dr. Weiland\u2019s diagnosis of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome. During the next several months, he underwent further examinations and tests which further confirmed this diagnosis. He began losing time from work when he was hospitalized for surgery on his left wrist on April 23, 1986. He is presently awaiting surgery on his right wrist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">9. Dr. Andrew J. Weiland, the claimant\u2019s expert witness, testified that in his opinion the claimant\u2019s condition is the result of his use of air tools and air guns at the employer\u2019s plant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">10. Dr. Carmen Fratto, the employer\u2019s expert witness, testified that the claimant\u2019s condition could have been caused by his use of air tools and air guns, but it could have also resulted from his use of a grinder at the employer\u2019s plant in Delaware.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-7\">11. Dr. Fratto further testified that it is not medically possible to determine whether a person with a history of football playing, lawnmowing, tennis playing, splitting firewood, snow sking, weightlifting, solder grinding, and the use of air power hand tools, who subsequent to all of these activities develops carpal tunnel syndrome, developed the carpal tunnel syndrome as a result of any particular one or more of these activities to the exclusion of some or all of the others. Evidence from company records introduced during the Employer\u2019s/Self-Insurer\u2019s case demonstrated that the claimant had engaged in all of these activities prior to employment at the Baltimore plant on September 9, 1985.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-8\">Maryland Rule 2-519 provides, in pertinent part: (a) Generally.\u2014A party may move for judgment on any or all of the issues in any action at the close of all the evidence offered by an opposing party, and in a jury trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>at the close of the evidence. The moving party shall state with particularity all reasons why the motion should be granted. No objection to the motion for judgment shall be necessary. A party does not waive the right to make a motion by introducing evidence during the presentation of an opposing party\u2019s case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-4\">(b) Disposition.\u2014When a defendant moves for judgment at the close of the evidence offered by the plaintiff in an action tried by the court, the court may proceed, as a trier of fact, to determine the facts and to render judgment against the plaintiff or may decline to render judgment until the close of all the evidence. When a motion for judgment is made under any other circumstances, the court shall consider all evidence and inferences in the light most favorable to the party against whom the motion is made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">This Rule makes clear that when ruling on a motion for a judgment the trial judge must consider the evidence, including the inferences reasonably and logically drawn therefrom, in the light most favorable to the party against whom the motion is made. <em>See Pahanish v. Western Trails, Inc., </em>69 Md.App. 342, 353, 517 A.2d 1122 (1986). If there is any evidence, no matter how slight, legally sufficient to generate a jury question, the motion must be denied. <em>Virgil v. \u201cKash N\u2019 Karry\u201d Service Corp., </em>61 Md.App. 23, 28-29, 484 A.2d 652 (1984), <em>cert.denied, </em>302 Md. 681, 490 A.2d 719 (1985); <em>McSlarrow v. Walker, </em>56 Md.App. 151, 158, 467 A.2d 196 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>299 Md. 137, 472 A.2d 1000 (1984); <em>Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. v. McFarland, </em>21 Md.App. 501, 513, 319 A.2d 824 (1974). On the other hand, where the evidence is not such as to generate a jury question, <em>i.e., </em>permits but one conclusion, the question is one of law and the motion must be granted. <em>Schaeffer v. United Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>32 Md.App. 339, 343, 360 A.2d 461 (1976), <em>aff'd sub nom, United Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Schaeffer, </em>280 Md. 10, 370 A.2d 1138 (1977). An appellate court reviewing the propriety of the grant or denial of a motion for judgment by a trial judge must conduct the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>analysis. <em>Pahanish, </em>69 Md.App. at 354, 517 A.2d 1112. Before doing so in the instant case, however, we will review the legal framework in which the analysis is to be conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">Provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act pertaining to occupational disease give context to the facts which we are called upon to analyze and may be helpful in our determination of the correctness of the trial judge\u2019s ruling on the motion for judgment. Maryland Code Ann. art. 101 \u00a7 23(b) embodies the test for determining the employer who is liable for paying compensation to an employee who suffers from an occupational disease. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\"><em>What employer and insurer liable; amount of compen</em>sation.\u2014When compensation is payable for an occupational disease, the employer in whose employment the employee was last injuriously exposed to the hazards of the disease, and the insurance carrier, if any, on the risk when the employee was last so exposed under the employer, shall be liable therefor; the amount of the compensation shall be based upon the average wages of the employee when last so exposed under such employer; and the notice of injury and claim for compensation, as hereinafter required, shall be given and made to the employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1j\">Liability for compensation benefits has relevance only if the employee is entitled to receive compensation. Sections 67(13) and 22(a) address this issue. Section 67(13) defines an occupational disease to be \u201cthe event of an employee\u2019s becoming actually incapacitated, either temporarily, partially or totally, because of a disease contracted as the result of and in the course of employment, as provided in \u00a7 22 of this article\u201d. Under \u00a7 22(a), an employee entitled to compensation is one who, in addition to meeting the statutory requirements, \u201csuffers from an occupational disease, and is thereby disabled<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from performing his work in the last occupa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>tion in which he was injuriously exposed to the hazards of such disease\u201d. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">From the foregoing, it is clear that an employee suffers from an occupational disease when he or she is actually incapacitated and compensation is payable only when he or she suffers from an occupational disease. It is equally clear that there is a distinction between the date of last injurious exposure and the date of disability. <em>See Travelers Ins. Co. v. Proctor, </em>59 Md.App. 149, 153, 474 A.2d 957 (1984), citing <em>Shifflett, </em>293 Md. at 203, 442 A.2d 980. When the issue is who must pay compensation, it is the date of last injurious exposure to the hazard of the disease, and not the date of disability, that governs. <em>See Shifflett, </em>293 Md. at 203, 442 A.2d 980; <em>Proctor, </em>59 Md.App. at 152, 474 A.2d 957.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Both medical experts agree that appellant \u201chas an occupational disease of his hands and wrists known as bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome\u201d. And the evidence is undisputed that the symptomology for this condition began as early as 1979. In fact, appellant\u2019s expert discovered the symptoms on August 2, 1985 and his diagnosis was confirmed on September 9, 1985, when appellant underwent diagnostic tests prior to returning to his employment with appellee. Nor can it be disputed that appellant\u2019s work at appellee\u2019s plant could have caused bilateral carpal syndrome: both appellant\u2019s and appellee\u2019s experts testified to that effect, although appellee\u2019s expert further testified that the condition could have resulted from his job responsibilities at his prior employment in the Delaware plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>Appellee notes that appellant\u2019s expert did not testify that appellant\u2019s condition was aggravated by the work he performed at appellee\u2019s Baltimore plant. Thus, it argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A66\">\u201c[t]he jury was free to reject the doctor\u2019s causal relationship opinipn ... because the activities described by the doctor as <em>the </em>cause took place after his diagnosis of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome between August 2nd and September 9th of 1985____ The only <em>cause </em>which the doctor assigns for the <em>effect </em>is activities which unquestionally came after the existence of the effect had been medically and factually established.\u201d (emphasis in original)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Appellee\u2019s position, then, is that the date of last injurious exposure is a question of fact, the resolution of which is not necessarily related to the date of disablement. Indeed, appellee asserts that, for an exposure to be injurious, unless testimony tends to establish that the exposure aggravated the already existing disease, it must have occurred prior to the diagnosis of the disease. To reach this conclusion, appellee relies upon the definition of \u201cinjurious\u201d as set out in Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary, Second College Edition, <em>i.e., </em>\u201cinjuring or likely to cause injury; harmful\u201d. Appellee also attempts to distinguish <em>Proctor, supra </em>and <em>Shifflett, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Appellee\u2019s argument is a variation of the argument made in <em>Proctor. </em>There, the claimant first noticed symptoms of Raynaud\u2019s disease, an occupational disease, in February, 1980, which prompted her to visit a doctor. In March, she was diagnosed as suffering from Raynaud\u2019s disease and advised not to return to work. Nevertheless, the claimant continued to work until April, 1980, when she could not do her job any longer. She filed for workmen\u2019s compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>benefits alleging disability due to an occupational disease. The question before the lower court was which of two insurance carriers was liable for the payment of the benefits to which the claimant was unquestionably entitled. Both carriers focused upon the date of disability as being dispositive of the question and the trial judge agreed. We disagreed. Significantly, we stated: \u201cViewing the facts in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion for summary judgment, ... it would appear that the date of Proctor\u2019s last injurious exposure was her last day working for Giant\u2014April 22, 1980.\u201d (Citation omitted) 59 Md.App. at 153, 474 A.2d 957. We remanded the case for further proceedings to determine if there was a genuine dispute of material fact as to the claimant\u2019s last injurious exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Although the procedural posture of <em>Proctor </em>is different from that of the case <em>sub judice, </em>the facts are analogous. Therefore, we believe <em>Proctor </em>is dispositive of the issue here presented. <em>Proctor </em>rejected the argument that whether an exposure to the hazards of an occupational disease is injurious is dependent upon when the occupational disease is first diagnosed. Rather, it explicitly recognized and held that it was not. In so holding, we simply gave effect to the purpose of \u00a7 23(b)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>: arbitrarily to assign liability to the last employment that could have caused the disease, so as to allow the claimant to satisfy his burden of proof as to actual causation. <em>See Lowery v. McCormick Asbestos Company, </em>300 Md. 28, 39, 475 A.2d 1168 (1984). Since there is absolutely no dispute that appellant\u2019s work at appellee\u2019s Baltimore plant \u201ccould have been a contributory cause of the disease\u201d, it follows that there was nothing for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>the jury to decide. Accordingly, we hold that the trial judge should have granted appellant\u2019s motion for judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"AX5\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY FOR ENTRY OF JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF APPELLANT. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLEE.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b511-6\">. <em>See </em>\u00a7 67(15) which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">\"Disablement\" as used in \u00a7 22 of this article means the event of an employee\u2019s becoming actually incapacitated, either partly or totally,</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>because of an occupational disease, from performing his work in the last occupation in which exposed to the hazards of such disease; and \u201cdisability\" means the state of being so incapacitated----</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\"><em>See also Shifflett v. Powhattan Mining Co., </em>293 Md. 198, 201, 442 A.2d 980 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b512-9\">. There is no dispute on this appeal that appellant meets the other statutory requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b513-8\">. <em>Proctor </em>is distinguished on the basis that the Court did not address the question of the date of the claimant\u2019s last injurious exposure. <em>Shifflett </em>is distinguished on the basis that \"the last injurious exposure happened to coincide with the last time the claimant was even exposed to a causative agent of his disease, and took place approximately 16 years before diagnosis of the disease.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b514-5\">. The language of the section is clear and unambiguous. Moreover, the result obtained from giving effect to the language of the statute is not absurd in light of the purpose of the statute. <em>See Miller v. Western Electric Co., </em>310 Md. 173, 187, 528 A.2d 486 (1987). <em>See also D &amp; Y, Inc. v. Winston, </em>74 Md.App. 157, 536 A.2d 1169 (1988). Consequently, we need not look any further for the intent of the legislature; in this case, statutory interpretation simply is not required. <em>See City of Baltimore v. Hackley, </em>300 Md. 277, 283, 477 A.2d 1174 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
