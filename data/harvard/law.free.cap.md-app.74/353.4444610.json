Upon finding that an assistant pastor of the church had acted with malice while acting within the scope of his employment, the jury returned a verdict on both counts against the church and its assistant pastor for compensatory and punitive damages.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">Appellant St. Luke Evangelical Lutheran Church, Inc. (St. Luke) raised only one issue which we will need to review in this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-10\">Whether the trial court committed reversible error in granting plaintiff eight peremptory strikes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">Appellant Rev. David M. Buchenroth (Pastor Buchenroth) posits the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-13\">1. Whether the trial court erred in instructing the jury that Ms. Smith was not a public figure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-14\">2. Whether the trial court committed reversible error in failing to instruct properly on the attachment of and burden of proof as to a qualified privilege.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-15\">3. Whether, as a matter of law, Pastor Buchenroth acted with malice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Shortly after graduating from the University of Maryland in 1983, Ms. Ginny Ann Smith (Ms. Smith) was hired as the Associate Director of Youth Ministry at St. Luke\u2019s. She had been an active member of the church since childhood and had participated in many church-sponsored activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">At the time Ms. Smith was hired, St. Luke had three pastors, Senior Pastor Raymond Shaheen, Associate Pastor David R. Shaheen (Pastor Shaheen) and Assistant Pastor David Buchenroth (Pastor Buchenroth). As part of her responsibilities, Ms. Smith worked alongside Pastor Shaheen as Administrative Assistant for Crossroads, a conference of church youth from throughout the Maryland Synod of the Lutheran Church, and Tent Troupe, a drama group sponsored by St. Luke which traveled four months a year. Ms. Smith had been highlighted in the St. Luke Messenger, a weekly journal, on two occasions for her continuing contributions to the church.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">In February, 1984, Ms. Smith went on a church-sponsored trip to the Holy Land with other members of the church, including Pastor David Shaheen and one of his sons. In Ms. Smith\u2019s absence, Pastor Buchenroth had occasion to go into her office in search of a file regarding an upcoming church event. While searching, he discovered a file marked \u201cDRS-GAS\u201d which contained personal correspondence from Pastor Shaheen to Ms. Smith. He removed the file and went through its contents as he \u201cwas curious as to what the correspondence was.\u201d After examining the letters and notes contained in the file, Pastor Buchenroth concluded that they confirmed his suspicion that Ms. Smith and Pastor Shaheen were involved in a sexual relationship. While seeking advice from a trusted co-worker, Mrs. Joan Patton, Pastor Buchenroth allowed her to examine the file. Mrs. Patton confided to Pastor Buchenroth that she had recently come upon Pastor Shaheen and Ms. Smith as they were engaged in an embrace. She thought it best to tell Pastor Shaheen\u2019s wife, Ellen, of the developing situation as evidenced by the nature of the notes and letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Shortly thereafter, Pastor Buchenroth advised both Pastor Shaheen\u2019s wife and Mrs. Virginia Smith (Ms. Smith\u2019s mother) that he believed that Pastor Shaheen and Ms. Smith were having an affair. He explained to Mrs. Smith that by an \u201caffair,\u201d he meant that they were \u201csleeping together.\u201d As he had provided Mrs. Shaheen with the background of his belief, Pastor Buchenroth provided Mrs. Smith with specific times and places where he thought the liaisons had been taking place. He further offered his belief that Pastor Shaheen and Ms. Smith might not return from the trip.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">After Ms. Smith and Pastor Shaheen returned from the Holy Land, they were asked to attend several \u201ccounseling sessions\u201d which had been arranged by the senior pastor in an effort to promote a \u201chealing process.\u201d In addition to Senior Pastor Raymond Shaheen and his son Pastor David and Ms. Smith, other persons in attendance included Ellen Shaheen, Virginia Smith, Dr. Cheryl Wilhoyte (Chairperson of St. Luke\u2019s Committee on Staff) and Rosemarie Rhyne (St. Luke\u2019s Director of Counseling Ministry). The group discussed the letters that had been found and the accusations which had been made. Mrs. Shaheen had reviewed the correspondence earlier and had thoroughly discussed the situation with her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Based primarily on Mrs. Shaheen\u2019s belief that the \u201caffair\u201d between her husband and Ms. Smith was not of a sexual nature, Pastor Buchenroth acknowledged to the group that he no longer believed the affair to have been sexually oriented. He further apologized to Ms. Smith and to Pastor Shaheen for \u201cany pain that might have been caused\u201d by his accusations. In an effort to avoid having the charges leaked to the congregation, everyone in the group, including Pastor Buchenroth, vowed to keep the entire matter confidential.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">Because of the obvious discordant working relationship that developed following his accusations, Pastor Buchenroth made an appointment to see the Bishop of the Maryland Synod to request a transfer. Before meeting with the Bishop, however, Pastor Buchenroth visited the home of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>personal friends, Mr. and Mrs. Rupert, both of whom were active members of the St. Luke congregation. Mr. Rupert also served as an officer in the church. After explaining that he was breaking a vow of confidentiality, Pastor Buchenroth divulged to the Ruperts that he had come across a file of letters written by Pastor Shaheen to Ms. Smith and what had taken place in the aftermath of his discovery. In essence, Pastor Buchenroth \u201cbared his soul\u201d to the Ruperts and \u201cdescribed to them how we got in the predicament we were in.\u201d Contrary'to his representation earlier that he had made to the Committee on Staff that he no longer believed the relationship to have been of a sexual nature, however, he related specific instances in which Ms. Smith and Pastor Shaheen had opportunities to be alone while traveling. He then postulated that such a relationship was inappropriate between a married pastor and a staff member. Pastor Buchenroth further related to the Ruperts that he was dissatisfied with the lack of progress that the Committee on Staff was making in resolving the situation and that he did not want to be the \u201cfall guy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">As a result of his conversation with Pastor Buchenroth, Mr. Rupert contacted Mrs. Patton, Senior Pastor Shaheen, Dr. Wilhoyte, and Stanley Benning, a member of the Committee on Staff who also served with Mr. Rupert on the Board of Governors for Hallowood.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mr. Rupert warned Mr. Benning that unless some action were taken to prevent Pastor Shaheen and Ms. Smith from both participating in Tent Troupe, he would contact the parents of the children who participated in the drama group and tell them what Pastor Buchenroth had alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Due to Mr. Rupert\u2019s threat, beginning in late May, 1984, the Committee on Staff began to conduct a long series of meetings addressing the issue. At several of these meetings, each of the persons involved, was required to answer questions posed by members of the Committee. Pastor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Buchenroth appeared and told the Committee why he believed that there was an affair between Ms. Smith and Pastor David. He reported to the Committee, as he had to Virginia Smith and the Ruperts, the specific times and places where he thought the affair had been taking place.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">When asked to relate her perception as to what Pastor Buchenroth had described regarding the nature of the relationship between Ms. Smith and Pastor Shaheen, the chairperson of the Committee on Staff, Dr. Wilhoyte, testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaO\">Based on the reference to the October Philadelphia trip,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to an incident that occurred in Hunt Valley,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to the amount of time spent together, and to his decision to go to Mrs. Shaheen with the letters and indicate what he believed about the relationship, I felt that all of that from Pastor Buchenroth had led him to believe that there was an affair between Pastor David Shaheen and Ginny Ann Smith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">After the Committee met several times, a proposal that Ms. Smith be placed on administrative leave, because of the charges Pastor Buchenroth had made, was adopted and then deferred until the next meeting. On June 18, 1984, Ms. Smith appeared before the Committee on Staff and was requested by Senior Pastor Shaheen to relinquish her responsibilities voluntarily. Although continuing to express that the \u201ccharges\u201d against her were false, Ms. Smith advised the group that she would voluntarily resign but would continue to serve as a member of the Tent Troupe staff. She then left the meeting and returned to Hallowood to rejoin Tent Troupe. Later that evening, Dr. Wilhoyte went to Hallowood and advised Ms. Smith that the Committee would not accept her offer of resignation.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>The Tent Troupe staff was then made aware of the charges that had been made and the Ruperts\u2019 pending threat to tell all Tent Troupe parents about Pastor Buchenroth\u2019s allegations unless Ms. Smith were prevented from going on the tour to New England. The next day, a statement was read by the Tent Troupe staff which described the allegations that had been made of \u201can affair\u201d and reported the actions which had been taken by the Committee on Staff against Ms. Smith and Pastor Shaheen. After the statement was read, it was decided that the drama group would go on tour with its entire staff, including Pastor Shaheen and Ms. Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">After Ms. Smith returned from the tour in late July, the Church Council advised her by letter that it would accept her resignation which the Committee on Staff had rejected. When this attempt to oust Ms. Smith failed, the church formed a Special Committee, without the knowledge of the chairperson of the Committee on Staff, and recommended that Ms. Smith\u2019s position be abolished immediately. The recommendation was adopted and approved by the Church Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">I. PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES</p>\n<p id=\"AkQ\">Co-defendant/appellant St. Luke challenges the authority of the trial judge to have awarded the plaintiff/appellee eight peremptory challenges rather than four. There is no question that in Maryland each party to a civil action is permitted four peremptory challenges to the venire of prospective jurors. Md.Cts. &amp; Jud.Proc.Code Ann. \u00a7 8-301(d) (1987 Supp.). Similarly, Md.Rule 2-512(h) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-6\">Each party is permitted four peremptory challenges plus one peremptory challenge for each group of three or less alternate jurors to be impanelled. For purposes of this section, several plaintiffs or several defendants shall be considered as a single party unless the court determines that adverse or hostile interests between plaintiffs or between defendants justify allowing to each of them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>separate peremptory challenges <em>not exceeding the number available to a single </em>party____ (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">In the case at bar, therefore, as party plaintiff, Ms. Smith was permitted four peremptory challenges and each co-defendant was initially entitled to share four peremptory challenges. On motion by the co-defendants, however, the trial judge ruled that their interests were sufficiently adverse to justify the award to each of four separate peremptory challenges. The trial judge then awarded <em>sua sponte, </em>over objection of co-defendant St. Luke, four additional peremptory challenges to the plaintiff. Thus, the end result was that each side, rather than each adverse party, had a total of eight peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">In explaining his decision to also award additional strikes to the party plaintiff, the trial judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">The reason I suggested that we add another four strikes to [the party plaintiff] is that we have plenty of jurors and in an effort to make sure that everybody gets a fair shake, if they want to strike eight, I do not see any problem with it. If you [co-defendants] want to strike eight, you take your four and four and you get eight to make sure everybody feels comfortable with the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Thereafter, the following colloquy took place between counsel for St. Luke and the trial court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">MR. DONOHUE: I understand the Court\u2019s comment, but I would object to that for the record because I think there should be four allotted per interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-9\">THE COURT: It normally would be, but I see a conflict between two of you, and I do not want to impose your having to agree with a potential of conflict on only four, and I feel the only fair thing to do is to give them another four as well. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-10\">MR. DONOHUE: Thank you, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">Appellant St. Luke argues, in essence, that as Ms. Smith, an adversarial party, \u201chad twice as much to say about who would not sit on the panel as any other party,\u201d it was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>assured a fair trial decided solely on the basis of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Ms. Smith admits that the effect of the court\u2019s ruling was to allow her \u201cto have twice as much to say about who sat on the jury than either defendant.\u201d She explains, however, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-5\">this is always the case under Rule 2-512(h) where, as here, there are twice as many defendants as plaintiffs <em>unless </em>the court determines that adverse or hostile interests justify allowing separate peremptory challenges to each party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">Ms. Smith concludes, therefore, that she</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APh\">would still have had twice as much to say about who sat on the jury than either St. Luke or Pastor Buchenroth even if the court had followed the rule to the letter and awarded four strikes to each side.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">The Court of Appeals was faced with a somewhat similar problem in <em>King v. State Roads Commission, </em>284 Md. 368, 396 A.2d 267 (1979). In that case, the plaintiff and defendant each received four peremptory challenges. After the challenges were exercised, 17 veniremen remained. The trial judge then struck five additional names to obtain a panel of 12 jurors. In remanding the case to determine if an objection had been timely noted, the Court of Appeals observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-8\">[T]his selection method impaired the effectiveness of these parties\u2019 peremptory challenges to the extent that the trial judge, with five strikes, had more to say about who would not sit on the panel than either of the parties. In our view, unless waived, the only adequate remedy for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>such a clear violation of Rule 543 is a new trial before a correctly selected jury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A1Fm\"><em>Id. </em>at 372, 396 A.2d 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">Writing on behalf of the Court in <em>King, </em>Judge Digges stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b389-5\">No citation of authority is needed to support the proposition, which is intrinsic to the American concept of justice, that when a jury trial is authorized, the panel should be composed of fair and impartial individuals selected from among one\u2019s peers. In insuring that such an impartial jury is chosen, a reasonable peremptory challenge right plays a vital role because it permits a party to eliminate a prospective juror with personal traits or predilections that, although not challengeable for cause, will, in the opinion of the litigant, impel that individual to decide the case on a basis other than the evidence presented____ Further, the importance of the peremptory challenge requires that any significant deviation from the prescribed procedure that impairs or denies the privilege\u2019s full exercise is error that, unless waived, ordinarily will require reversal without the necessity of showing prejudice. <em>Swain v. Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 202, 219, 85 S.Ct. 824, 835, 13 L.Ed.2d 759 (1965).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 370-71, 396 A.2d 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">Rule 2-512(h) clearly limits each party to a maximum of four initial peremptory challenges. In a matter involving multiple litigants the Rule permits the trial court to grant additional peremptory challenges if it \u201cdetermines that adverse or hostile interests between plaintiffs or between defendants justify allowing to each of them separate peremptory challenges----\u201d In order to do so, the court must make a factual finding of adverse or hostile interests. It is then totally within the court\u2019s discretion as to whether that interest justifies allowing the additional challenges. <em>Kloetzli v. Kalmbacher, </em>65 Md.App. 595, 501 A.2d 499 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>(1985). In the event the court determines the interests to be sufficiently diverse as to justify the award of additional strikes, the Rule provides that they may not exceed \u201cthe number available to a single party.\u201d In other words, if adverse interests justify additional strikes, as was found to be the case in the matter <em>sub judice, </em>each co-defendant is to be treated as a single party for purposes of awarding peremptory challenges.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">In his well-intentioned effort \u201cto make sure that everybody gets a fair shake\u201d the trial judge decided to deviate from the established peremptory procedure and award twice as many strikes as that given to each co-defendant who were now entitled to be treated as individual parties. Our task is to determine whether the deviation was so significant as to impair the peremptory privilege on behalf of St. Luke\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">As cogently expressed by Judge Liss on our behalf in <em>Vaccaro v. Caple, </em>33 Md.App. 413, 416, 365 A.2d 47 (1976), \u201cthe function of the peremptory challenge is to eliminate extremes of partiality and to assure the parties that the case is decided solely on the basis of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AM7\">Judge Moylan outlined the historical importance of the peremptory challenge in <em>Spencer v. State, </em>20 Md.App. 201, 203-4, 314 A.2d 727 (1974):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-6\">The accepted use of the peremptory challenge, as an incident to the right of trial by jury, came to the Maryland Colony with the first settlement. Its history in this State, and statutory vicissitudes, is well traced in <em>Turpin </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number><em>v. State, </em>55 Md. 462. See also <em>Parker v. State, </em>227 Md. 468, 470-471, 177 A.2d 426 [1962], and <em>Brice v. State, </em>264 Md. 352, 365-367, 286 A.2d 132 [1972], Judge Gilbert discussed and analyzed in great depth the nature of the peremptory challenge in <em>Pearson v. State, </em>15 Md.App. 462, 291 A.2d 167 [1972]. See also <em>Bever v. State, </em>4 Md.App. 436, 439-440, 243 A.2d 634 [1968], and <em>Johnson v. State, </em>9 Md.App. 143, 148-151, 262 A.2d 792 [1970].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">The Supreme Court recognized the value of the right in <em>Lewis v. United States, </em>146 U.S. 370, 13 S.Ct. 136, 36 L.Ed. 1011 (1892). See also 47 Am.Jur.2d, <em>Jury, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 233-264; 50 C.J.S., <em>Juries, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 279-285. In <em>Swain v. Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 202, 85 S.Ct. 824, 13 L.Ed.2d 759 (1965), the Supreme Court discussed the nature of the challenge at 380 U.S. 220-221:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">\u201cThe essential nature of the peremptory challenge is that it is one exercised without a reason stated, without inquiry and without being subject to the court\u2019s control ____ While challenges for cause permit rejection of jurors on a narrowly specified, provable and legally cognizable basis of partiality, the peremptory permits rejection for a real or imagined partiality that is less easily designated or demonstrable____ It is often exercised upon the \u2018sudden impressions and unaccountable prejudices we are apt to conceive upon the bare looks and gestures of another,\u2019 ... upon a juror\u2019s \u2018habits and associations,\u2019 ... or upon the feeling that \u2018the bare question [of a juror\u2019s] indifference may sometimes provoke a resentment,\u2019 ... It is no less frequently exercised on grounds normally thought irrelevant to legal proceedings or official action, namely, the race, religion, nationality, occupation or affiliations of people summoned for jury duty. For the question a prosecutor or defense counsel must decide is not whether a juror of a particular race or nationality is in fact partial, but whether one from a different group is less likely to be.\u201d (Citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>We hold that in the case at bar, once the trial court properly determined that the interests of the two defendants were sufficiently adverse to warrant additional strikes, the court significantly deviated from the prescribed procedure and impaired the peremptory privilege of each co-defendant to be treated as a single party when it awarded twice as many peremptory challenges to the party plaintiff. As to St. Luke, therefore, the case is reversed and remanded. As Pastor Buchenroth failed to preserve the peremptory challenge issue for our review, however, we shall need to discuss the remaining issues raised by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">II. DENIAL OF PUBLIC FIGURE INSTRUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"AT-\">During the hearing on proposed instructions, appellant\u2019s counsel proposed that the jury be advised that Ms. Smith was classified, for purposes of defamation litigation, as either a \u201cgeneral\u201d or \u201climited\u201d public figure. As such she would need to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that Rev. Buchenroth had made the defamatory statements with malice. The trial judge denied the requested instruction on the ground that Ms. Smith, as a matter of law, was not a public figure. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The concept of a \u201cpublic figure\u201d was explicated by the Supreme Court in <em>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., </em>418 U.S. 323, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974). The Court held that, in an action for defamation of character, a plaintiff who is a public figure must prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that the defendant had made the defamatory statement with malice.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Court further observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-7\">[the] designation of a person as a public figure may rest on either of two alternative bases. In some instances an individual may achieve such pervasive fame or notoriety that he becomes a public figure for all purposes and in all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>concepts. More commonly, an individual voluntarily injects himself or is drawn into a particular public controversy and thereby becomes a public figure for a limited range of issues. In either case such persons assume special prominence in the resolution of public questions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AT0\"><em>Id. </em>at 351, 94 S.Ct. at 3012-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">Pastor Buchenroth argues that Ms. Smith\u2019s activities were \u201cinextricably intertwined with the fitness of Pastor Shaheen for his position as Associate Pastor.\u201d By that means, he contends, she thrust herself into the forefront of an on-going controversy and became a public figure within the church community. The appellant avers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\">By pursuing a course of \u201cvoluntary and intentional conduct,\u201d Ms. Smith \u201csought to directly influence\u201d these matters of interest to the relevant audiences. In assuming her position as Associate Director of Youth Ministry, Ms. Smith voluntarily thrust herself into the continuing question\u2014or \u201cgeneral controversy\u201d\u2014of the fitness of the leaders of the Youth Ministry. More importantly, by engaging in an inappropriate relationship with Rev. Shaheen, she brought into question her particular fitness to serve as Associate Director of Youth Ministry. Thus, Ms. Smith can be said to have created the particular controversy in question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">In addition, by virtue of her relationship with Rev. Shaheen, she thrust herself into the continuing question\u2014or \u201cgeneral controversy\u201d\u2014of the fitness of the Associate Pastor for his position. In addition, she precipitated\u2014and thus cast herself into\u2014the particular controversy\u2014the fitness of Rev. Shaheen\u2014which prompted the alleged defamatory statements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">In <em>Time, Inc. v. Firestone, </em>424 U.S. 448, 96 S.Ct. 958, 47 L.Ed.2d 154 (1976), the Supreme Court provided further guidance in determining which persons are to be deemed public figures for purposes of defamation litigation. In that case, Mrs. Firestone filed a complaint for separate maintenance; her husband counterclaimed with a suit for divorce on grounds of extreme cruelty and adultery. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>trial court granted the divorce on the grounds that neither party was domesticated, within the meaning of that term as used by the Florida courts. A reporter for Time magazine, however, indicated that the divorce had been granted due to Mrs. Firestone\u2019s cruelty and adultery. In holding that Mrs. Firestone was not a public figure, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZV\">Respondent did not assume any role of especial prominence in the affairs of society, other than perhaps Palm Beach society, and she did not thrust herself to the forefront of any particular public controversy in order to influence the resolution of the issues involved in it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-5\">Dissolution of a marriage through judicial proceedings is not the sort of \u201cpublic controversy\u201d referred to in <em>Gertz, </em>even though the marital difficulties of extremely wealthy individuals may be of interest to some portion of the reading public. Nor did respondent freely choose to publicize issues as to the propriety of her married life. She was compelled to go to court by the State in order to obtain legal release from the bonds of matrimony. We have said that in such an instance \u201c[rjesort to the judicial process ... is no more voluntary in a realistic sense than that of the defendant called upon to defend his interests in court.\u201d <em>Boddie v. Connecticut, </em>401 U.S. 371, 376-77, 91 S.Ct. 780, 785-86, 28 L.Ed.2d 113 (1971).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 453-54, 96 S.Ct. at 964-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">In a later case, <em>Wolston v. Reader\u2019s Digest Assn. Inc., </em>443 U.S. 157, 99 S.Ct. 2701, 61 L.Ed.2d 450 (1979), the petitioner was subpoenaed to appear before a New York grand jury investigating allegations of Soviet espionage. When the petitioner failed to appear for one of the hearings, a contempt citation was issued. At no time was the petitioner ever indicted for espionage. The Reader\u2019s Digest reported, however, that Wolston had been identified as a Soviet agent and had been convicted following an indictment for espionage. In holding that Wolston was not a public figure, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>Petitioner\u2019s failure to appear before the grand jury and citation for contempt no doubt were \u201cnewsworthy,\u201d but the simple fact that these events attracted media attention also is not conclusive of the public-figure issue. A private individual is not automatically transformed into a public figure just by becoming involved in or associated with a matter that attracts public attention. To accept such reasoning would in effect re-establish the doctrine advanced by the plurality opinion in <em>Rosenbloom v. Metromedia, Inc., </em>403 U.S. 29, 44 [91 S.Ct. 1811, 1820, 29 L.Ed.2d 296] (1971), which concluded that the <em>New York Times </em>standard should extend to defamatory falsehoods relating to private persons if the statements involved matters of public or general concern. We repudiated this proposition in <em>Gertz </em>and in <em>Firestone, </em>however, and we reject it again today. A libel defendant must show more than mere newsworthiness to justify application of the demanding burden of <em>New York Times. </em>See <em>Time, Inc. v. Firestone, </em>424 U.S., at 454 [96 S.Ct. at 965].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">Nor do we think that petitioner engaged the attention of the public in an attempt to influence the resolution of the issues involved. Petitioner assumed no \u201cspecial prominence in the resolution of public questions.\u201d See <em>Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., </em>418 U.S., at 351 [94 S.Ct. at 3013]. His failure to respond to the grand jury\u2019s subpoena was in no way calculated to draw attention to himself in order to invite public comment or influence the public with respect to any issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 167-68, 99 S.Ct. at 2707-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">We find the above cited precedents controlling in the case <em>sub judice. </em>As the Court stated in <em>Gertz, </em>418 U.S. at 352, 94 S.Ct. at 3013:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-8\">We would not lightly assume that a citizen\u2019s participation in community and professional affairs rendered him a public figure for all purposes. Absent clear evidence of general fame or notoriety in the community, and pervasive involvement in the affairs of society, an individual should not be deemed a public personality for all aspects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>of his life. It is preferable to reduce the public-figure question to a more meaningful context by looking to the nature and extent of an individual\u2019s participation in the particular controversy giving rise to the defamation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">In this context, we believe the trial court properly ruled that Ms. Smith had remained a private person. She did not thrust herself into the controversy surrounding Pastor Shaheen\u2019s fitness for office. Indeed, there was no such controversy until generated by subsequent events.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Nor do we believe, contrary to appellant\u2019s contention, that Ms. Smith should be considered to be a public figure because she protested at a church meeting against Pastor Buchenroth\u2019s appointment. Moreover, if, as postulated by Pastor Buchenroth, the purported controversy in the church community was in fact the issue concerning Pastor Shaheen\u2019s fitness to serve the congregation, Ms. Smith\u2019s pronouncements on Pastor Buchenroth\u2019s qualifications for appointment were irrelevant to such issue in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">III. INSTRUCTION AS TO QUALIFIED PRIVILEGE AND ITS DEFEASANCE</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">As we have held that the trial court ruled correctly that Ginny Ann Smith was not to be considered a public figure, a standard of ordinary negligence applies in proving defamation. In a defamation or invasion of privacy suit, as in the case at bar, a qualified privilege may be a valid defense. <em>General Motors Corporation v. Piskor, </em>27 Md.App. 95, 129, 340 A.2d 767 (1975). In this regard, however, the qualified privilege itself is subject to defeasance if it is found that the defamer exceeded the scope of the privilege. <em>Hughley v. McDermott, </em>72 Md.App. 391, 530 A.2d 13 (1987). <em>See also Marchesi v. Franchino, </em>283 Md. 131, 387 A.2d 1129 (1978); <em>Jacron Sales Co., Inc. v. Sindorf </em>276 Md. 580, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>350 A.2d 688 (1976); <em>Exxon v. Schoene, </em>67 Md.App. 412, 508 A.2d 142 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">In a matter involving the availability of a qualified privilege defense, the court, as a matter of law, is required to instruct the jury whether a qualified privilege to convey information of a defamatory nature has attached. <em>Happy 40, Inc. v. Miller, </em>63 Md.App. 24, 34, 491 A.2d 1210, <em>cert. denied, </em>304 Md. 299, 498 A.2d 1185 (1985). It is then the responsibility of the jury to determine whether such privilege has been forfeited by its abuse. <em>IBEW, Local 1805 v. Mayo, </em>281 Md. 475, 379 A.2d 1223 (1977). <em>See also Jacron Sales, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Pastor Buchenroth maintains that the trial judge committed reversible error when he ruled that a qualified privilege applied but then instructed the jury that, \u201cthere is in law the <em>possibility </em>of what we call a conditional privilege----\u201d He also contends that the trial judge failed to instruct the jury that Ms. Smith had the burden of proving the defeasance of a qualified privilege by malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">As to the instructions at issue the court gave the jury the following charge, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">Now, I tell you that there is in law <em>the possibility </em>of what we call a conditional privilege, but before I go into that, let me give you some more instructions on defamation as it means in this case, (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-10\">Defamation is the negligent publication of a false and defamatory statement about another. A defamatory statement is one which tends to expose a person to public scorn, hatred, contempt, or ridicule, thereby discouraging others in the community from having a good opinion of or from associating or dealing with that person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-11\">Negligent publication is the unreasonable failure to determine whether the statement is true or false. A defamatory statement is published when it is communicated to and understood by someone other than the Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>The communication, as I said, must be oral or in writing or by any other means.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-4\">Now, as I told you, there is such a thing as a privilege when it comes to making a defamatory statement. A person who publishes a defamatory statement about another is not responsible, to the other if he or she had a right to make that statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">Now, I tell you as a qualification to that that a person does not have this right if he acted with malice, that is, with ill will, with hostility, with hatred, with lack of good faith or reckless disregard of the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-6\">As stated in another way, in order to recover in an action for defamation for what this amount is due\u2014that is, the defamatory statement of slander\u2014the Plaintiff, Ms. Smith, must also prove by a fair preponderance of the evidence that Reverend Buchenroth knew at the time that he uttered that the defamatory statement was false, and that it defamed Ms. Smith, or he acted in reckless disregard of the falsity and defamatory nature of the statement, or he acted negligently in failing to ascertain the falsity and defamatory nature of the statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">I told you that there is the <em>possibility </em>of a qualified privilege, and I explained to you when I said that a person who publishes a defamatory statement about another is not responsible if he or she had a right to make the statement, (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-8\">In certain circumstances a person who publishes a defamatory statement about another is not responsible to the other if he or she had a right to make the statement. Such a right is based on the concept that a speaker may avoid liability for a statement which would otherwise be defamatory if publication of that utterance advances social policies of greater importance than the vindication of the Plaintiffs interests in her reputation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>This right is also known as a conditional or a qualified privilege because under certain circumstances, the speaker\u2014that is, the one who makes the statement\u2014can lose that right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-4\">I tell you that <em>as a general rule defamatory communications between parishioners or between parishioners and clergymen that concern matters related to the church are subject to a qualified privilege, </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">This rule is based on the broader rule that a qualified privilege attaches to a communication if both the speaker and the recipient have a common interest in and a duty as to the subject matter of the communication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">For example, a qualified privilege attaches to communications concerning the fitness, moral or otherwise, of clergymen for their positions, and the fitness, the moral or otherwise, or church members for membership in the church.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">The instructions given in <em>IBEW Local 1805, supra, </em>were much less definitive than those related to the jury in the case at bar. In <em>IBEW Local 1805, </em>the trial judge failed to instruct the jury that a qualified privilege had attached. Instead, he left both determinations to the jury as to whether the privilege had attached and whether it had been defeased by abuse.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The trial judge also instructed the jury, however, on the New York Times definition of malice which, as adopted in Maryland, is equated to knowing falsity or reckless disregard of truth. <em>Marchesi v. Franchino, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Thereafter, as in the case at bar, the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>returned a verdict against the defendant and made a specific finding of malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">In viewing the instructions pertaining to the attachment of a qualified privilege as a whole, we believe the instructions were correct but could have been more definitive that Pastor Buchenroth was entitled to a qualified privilege as to the defamatory statements attributed to him. Assuming error, however, we believe it was harmless in light of the fact that the jury was specifically instructed that its finding of malice would defeat the attachment of any qualified privilege. We further hold that the record reflects the jury was properly instructed as to Ms. Smith\u2019s burden of proof to show malice.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">IV. SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE AS TO MALICE</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Pastor Buchenroth contends that the evidence presented to the jury was, as a matter of law, insufficient to allow the jury reasonably to conclude that he had acted with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>malice in making the statements which were deemed to be defamatory. He argues that his \u201cuncontradicted testimony\u201d compelled the finding that he believed the alleged defamatory statements to be true and not, as Ms. Smith contends, that he knew them to be untrue.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">Pastor Buchenroth further asseverates, \u201c[n]or does the evidence support any inference that [he] acted recklessly in accusing Ms. Smith of having an affair with Pastor Shaheen.\u201d He bases this contention \u201con a long train of indicia of which, cumulatively if not individually, would lead a reasonable person to suspect that Ms. Smith and Rev. Shaheen were engaged in an affair.\u201d In addition to the specific instances between the two that he deemed inappropriate behavior, such as the reported close embrace and affectionate conduct shown toward each other, he predicated his conclusions on the intimate expressions contained in the series of letters he had discovered in the file cabinet from Pastor Shaheen to Ms. Smith.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>As previously discussed, whether a defamatory statement is entitled to a qualified privilege is a question of law for the court, but whether that qualified privilege had been abused is generally a question of fact for the jury. <em>Mareck v. Johns Hopkins Univ., </em>60 Md.App. 217, 482 A.2d 17 (1984). Also, as previously discussed, a qualified privilege may be lost if the publication is made with malice, that is, with knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard of its truth. <em>Marchesi v. Franchino, </em>283 Md. at 139, 387 A.2d 1129.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Although Pastor Buchenroth contends that his testimony was \u201cuncontradicted\u201d and that he believed the defamatory statements attributed to him to be true, it is clear that his testimony was disputed. Evidence was presented to the jury that when he discussed \u201cthe affair\u201d with the Ruperts and with the Committee on Staff, he had earlier admitted to the initial group of concerned individuals, including Pastor Shaheen\u2019s wife and Ms. Smith\u2019s mother, that he no longer believed his accusations to be correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">We believe, therefore, that the jury, as factfinder, was presented with sufficient evidence from which it reasonably could have inferred that Pastor Buchenroth\u2019s statements had been made with knowing falsity or with reckless disregard of truth. Furthermore, although not specifically argued by Pastor Buchenroth, we believe that the jury reasonably could have concluded from the evidence submitted that Pastor Buchenroth\u2019s conduct unreasonably intruded upon the private concerns of Ms. Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">JUDGMENTS AS TO ST. LUKE EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH, INC., REVERSED AND REMANDED; COSTS TO ABIDE THE RESULT OF RETRIAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">JUDGMENTS AS TO REVEREND DAVID M.

On the other hand, two defendants who have filed cross-claims against each other have interests adverse to each other and are each entitled to four.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b392-8\">. As to conduct which constitutes malice, the Supreme Court held in <em>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964), that an individual has acted with malice if he makes a defamatory statement either with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard as to its truth or falsity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b396-7\">. It is axiomatic that those charged with defamation cannot, by their own conduct, create a defense by attempting to characterize the claimant as a public figure. <em>Harris v.

Due process requires that all parties have an opportunity to reply to new issues asserted against them____ <em>See also Berkson v.
