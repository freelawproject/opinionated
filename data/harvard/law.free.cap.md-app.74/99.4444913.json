Yol.), Art. 48A, \u00a7 504. All insurers writing any kind of direct insurance, except life insurance, health insurance and annuities, are required to be members of the corporation as a condition of their authority to transact insurance business in the State.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> PCIGC is \u201cexempt from payment of all fees and all taxes levied by this State or any of its subdivisions except taxes levied on real or personal property.\u201d Art. 48A, \u00a7 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">Under the provisions of the Worker\u2019s Compensation law, the Subsequent Injury Fund (SIF), Article 101, \u00a7 66, and the Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund (UEF), Article 101, \u00a7 90 et. seq., are partially funded by assessments levied against employers and their insurers. When an employee is granted a worker\u2019s compensation award, the employer or insurer paying the claim is charged with SIF and UEF assessments, which are computed as percentages of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">After the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (WCC) invoiced PCIGC for SIF and UEF assessments in cases where PCIGC had paid claims of injured workers because the employer\u2019s insurer had become insolvent, PCIGC filed a complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief against WCC <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. That court (Jacobson, J.) determined</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-4\">that the assessments required by [A]rt. 101[,] \u00a7\u00a7 66 and 91 are such \u201ctaxes or fees\u201d as are contemplated by [A]rt. 48A[,] \u00a7 515.... [and] that PCIGC is not liable for the payment of such assessments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">From that judgment, the Commission appeals, asserting two questions, which it states as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-9\">1. Whether the Circuit Court erred in holding that the Article 101 assessments are fees or taxes within the meaning of Article 48A, \u00a7 515.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b128-10\">2. Whether the Circuit Court erred in construing Article 48A, \u00a7 515 so as to create a conflict between that provision and other provisions governing the obligations of the PCIGC, and in leaving unresolved the question of who is responsible for the payment of the Article 101 assessments after an insurer becomes insolvent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b128-11\">We agree with the trial judge that the sole issue before him was whether the SIF and UEF assessments constitute \u201cfees or taxes.\u201d If so, under the plain language of Article 48A, \u00a7 515, PCIGC is exempt from paying them.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-12\">As Judge Jacobson observed, a review of a multitude of authorities attempting to define \u201cfees\u201d and \u201ctaxes\u201d reveals no clear rule, the definitions varying from case to case in accordance with the particular facts in controversy. We have been referred to no appellate decision specifically holding that the assessments levied to support the Subsequent Injury Fund and the Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund are or are not \u201cfees or taxes.\u201d In his dissenting opinion in <em>Cooper v. Wicomico County, </em>284 Md. 576, 585, 398 A.2d 1237, 1242 (1979), Judge Eldridge characterized the SIF assessments as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>in the nature of a general tax assessed against members of a certain group to cover expenses of administering a government program involving that group.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-4\"><em>See also Cooper v. Wicomico County, </em>278 Md. 596, 607, 366 A.2d 55, 62 (1976) (Eldridge, J., dissenting). Although that statement is contained in a dissenting opinion, the nature of the assessment was not the point of disagreement with the majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">In <em>Allied American Co. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>219 Md. 607, 150 A.2d 421 (1959), insurers challenged the assessments imposed upon them to partially finance the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund\u2014a fund designed to \u201cindemnify the innocent victims of financially irresponsible owners and operators of motor vehicles.\u201d <em>Allied, supra, </em>219 Md. at 612, 150 A.2d at 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">In determining the validity of the fund, the Court addressed the power and authority of the State to create such a fund and its authority to require private entities to finance it. In upholding the State\u2019s authority to create the fund and impose assessments on insurers, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Az\">We think insurers have no sound ground on which to challenge the right of the State to levy the small percentage of the Maryland premiums they are required to pay annually to the fund. It is clearly established that the State may raise funds by taxation to expend for general welfare, and it is for the Legislature and not the taxpayers or the courts to choose the methods and subjects of taxation. It is no proper objection to a scheme of taxation that the benefits paid and those to whom they are paid are unrelated to the persons taxed and the amount they pay, or that those who have to pay may not have contributed to the conditions requiring the tax and may not be benefitted by the expenditure of the tax money.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AgG\"><em>Allied, supra, </em>219 Md. at 616, 150 A.2d at 427.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">The Court concluded that the assessments and other obligations imposed under the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund were justified as an exercise of the State\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>taxing power and the State\u2019s police power. <em>Allied, supra, </em>219 Md. at 623, 150 A.2d at 431. The Court reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADN\">[ajutomobile liability insurers make their profits because motorists use the roads and need protection both from paying claims and from not being able to collect if they are injured or damaged. It is reasonably conceivable, therefore, that insurers should be a group to pay taxes to be used to give protection to those who use the roads\u2014 those who are their paying customers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-4\"><em>Allied, supra, </em>219 Md. at 623-24, 150 A.2d at 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Appellant asserts, correctly, that the Court in <em>Allied </em>did not say such assessments are \u201ctaxes,\u201d but merely held them to be constitutionally valid under the State\u2019s taxing power. Appellant relies upon <em>State Insurance v. Nationwide, </em>241 Md. 108, 215 A.2d 749 (1966), in which the Court held that the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund assessment constituted an \u201cobligation\u201d which statutorily justified a credit on an insurer\u2019s retaliatory tax return. The Court did not decide whether such payments are taxes, but said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Al\">For the purposes of this opinion, we shall assume, without deciding, that the payments did not come within the purview of \u201ctaxes, fees, fines, penalties, licenses [or] deposit requirements.\u201d (In <em>Allied Amer. Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>219 Md. 607, [150 A.2d 421], we referred to such payments as a \u201ctax,\u201d but we were discussing the constitutionality of the assessments on insurance companies for the support of the Fund and not the specific nature of such payments in the context of the statute. Although not excluding the possibility that the payments may properly be classified as \u201ctaxes,\u201d we find it unnecessary to base our conclusion herein on such a classification.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-6\"><em>State Insurance, supra, </em>241 Md. at 112, 215 A.2d at 752 (bracketed material in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">At the same time, the Court did not say that the assessments are <em>not </em>taxes, and, in fact, concluded that the UCJ assessments are similar to taxes.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>The exactions imposed by Section 151 are, we think, similar in character to both \u201ctaxes\u201d and \u201clicenses,\u201d specific items named in the statute preceding \u201cor other obligations.\u201d Their payment is a prerequisite to the continuance of a foreign corporation\u2019s doing business in this state, and, at least to that extent, are in the nature of license fees____ <em>And license fees are, in reality, taxes.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-5\"><em>State Insurance, supra, </em>241 Md. at 116-17, 215 A.2d at 754 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">We conclude that SIF and UEF assessments imposed by Article 101, \u00a7\u00a7 66 and 91 constitute \u201cfees or taxes\u201d within the meaning of Article 48A, \u00a7 515, and appellee is exempt from payment of those assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Appellant next asserts that \u00a7 515 is in conflict with the stated legislative purpose that PCIGC is to provide payment of \u201ccovered claims\u201d made against insolvent insurers. It posits that the SIF and UEF assessments are a part of the \u201ccovered claims.\u201d The principal rationale for this position seems to be that the Legislature has left unresolved the question of who is responsible for payment of the assessments if PCIGC is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">\u201cCovered claims\u201d is defined in Maryland Code (1957, 1986 Repl. Vol., 1987 Supp.), Art. 48A, \u00a7 505.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The assessments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>to the Subsequent Injury Fund and the Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund are <em>\u201cin addition to any payment of compensation to employees.\u201d </em>Maryland Code (1957, 1985 Repl. Vol., 1987 Supp.), Art. 101, \u00a7 66(2)(b) and \u00a7 91(d)(3) (emphasis added). They are not obligations arising out of the contract with the insurer. They are obligations assessed by the Legislature as a condition of doing business in this State. Moreover, \u00a7 11 of Article 48A provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-4\">Provisions of this article relative to a particular kind of insurance or a particular type of insurer or to a particular matter shall prevail over provisions relating to insurance in general or insurers in general or to such matter in general.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Any conflicts which may exist between the Worker\u2019s Compensation Law and the Insurance Code must be resolved in favor of the Insurance Code. Although such assessments may be part of the \u201cbenefits\u201d furnished by an employer, <em>Subsequent Inj. Fund v. S.R.C., </em>35 Md.App. 353, 370 A.2d 597 (1977), we hold they are not a part of the \u201ccovered claims\u201d as defined in the Insurance Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">As to who shall pay such assessments if the PCIGC does not, that issue was not raised before the trial court and we do not address it. Rule 1085. We think the resolution of that question is properly left to the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPELLANT TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b127-6\">. PCIGC is the latest in a long line of entities created for similar purposes. Its immediate predecessor, The Maryland Insurance Guaranty Association (MIGA) created by Ch. 703, Acts of 1971, succeeded the Motor Vehicle Security Fund, created by Ch. 912, Acts of 1965 and repealed by Ch. 651 Acts of 1975. As originally enacted, MIGA did not include workmen's compensation insurance. The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Insolvency Fund, established by Ch. 149, Acts of 1967, was transferred to MIGA by Ch. 599, Acts of 1981, which repealed \u00a7\u00a7 85-89 of Article 101 dealing with liability for awards against insolvent workmen\u2019s compensation insurers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b127-7\">.
