After Georgetown filed a third-party claim against Harlan Hadley,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appellant amended her complaint to include Hadley as a defendant. On June 12, 1986, the trial court granted Hadley\u2019s motion for directed verdict as to appellant\u2019s claim, and on June 13, 1986, a jury rendered a verdict for Georgetown as to appellant\u2019s claim. On September 25, 1986, the court denied appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial. On October 22, 1986, appellant noted an appeal, which was voluntarily dismissed because appellant believed that the judgment appealed from was not final. Appellant then moved for entry of a final judgment on the third-party claim of Georgetown against Hadley. After the circuit court granted the motion on July 31, 1987 and entered judgment in favor of Hadley, appellant noted this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">\u201cA final judgment from which an appeal may be taken is defined as \u2018one which settles the rights of the parties or concludes the cause\u2019, and has been entered on the docket.\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Mitchell Properties, Inc. v. Real Estate Title Co., Inc., </em>62 Md.App. 473, 490 A.2d 271 (1985). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>hold that the directed verdict in favor of Hadley on June 12 and the jury verdict in favor of Georgetown on June 13, 1986, both of which were entered on the docket, amounted to final appealable judgments. The entry of those judgments settled the rights of the parties, put the plaintiff out of court, and denied her the means of further prosecuting her case. <em>Houghton v. County Com\u2019rs of Kent Co., </em>307 Md. 216, 221, 513 A.2d 291 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">Apparently, appellant believed that because the circuit court had not ruled on the third-party claim of Georgetown against Hadley, the judgments were not final.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nevertheless, as we have observed, we believe that the entry of judgments in favor of both defendants \u201cdisposed of the entire action.\u201d A third-party claim may be filed by a defendant against a \u201cperson not previously a party to the action who is or may be liable to the defendant for all or part of the plaintiffs claim against the defendant.\u201d Rule 2-332. Thus, the third-party claim must be based on the plaintiffs claim against the original defendant. <em>White v. Land Homes Corp., </em>251 Md. 603, 248 A.2d 159 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the verdicts in favor of Georgetown and Hadley \u201cadjudicated\u201d all of the claims of appellant, as well as the third-party claim against Hadley, inasmuch as the third-party claim would only have been viable if Georgetown had been found liable to appellant. Indeed, the court instructed the jury: \u201cYou need only consider this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>claim (the third-party claim) if your verdict is for the Plaintiff against Georgetown Leather Design, Inc.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ATB\">Although the Maryland appellate courts have not directly ruled on the issue presented by the facts of this case, decisions from other jurisdictions support our holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">For example, in <em>Wise v. Gursky, </em>66 Ohio St.2d 241, 421 N.E.2d 150 (1981) plaintiff-appellant filed an action against defendant-appellee to recover damages for personal injuries received when, during a hayride, an automobile operated by the defendant knocked plaintiff off the haywagon. Defendant filed an answer and a third-party complaint against the owners and operators of the haywagon for indemnification or contribution as to any possible judgment which plaintiff might receive against defendant. The trial was bifurcated as between plaintiffs complaint and defendant\u2019s third-party complaint. In the trial of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, the jury-returned a verdict in favor of the defendant. The judgment entered on that verdict failed to adjudicate the third-party complaint or expressly determine that there was \u201cno just reason for delay\u201d pursuant to Ohio Civ.R. 54(B).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plaintiff noted an appeal to the Court of Appeals which affirmed the trial court. Thereafter, the trial court entered a judgment dismissing the third-party complaint and plaintiff noted a second appeal, claiming that since the trial court had not complied with Civ.R. 54(B) prior to the first appeal, the Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction to hear the original appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In ruling on appellant\u2019s contention that the judgment entered as to plaintiff\u2019s complaint was not final and appealable because it did not address and dispose of the third-party complaint, the Supreme Court of Ohio said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4y\">In the cause <em>sub judice, </em>the judgment on the jury verdict not only determined plaintiff\u2019s action against the defendant, but it also determined all the claims and issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>in defendant\u2019s third-party action as well. The claims set forth in the third-party complaint and the determination of the rights and liabilities of the parties to the third-party action were rendered moot by the judgment in favor of defendant as to plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-4\">Such an order meets the requirement of R.C. 2505.02 that an order is a final appealable order if the effect of the order \u201cdetermines the action and prevents a judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-5\">sH s)c $ <em>if </em>$ sf&lt;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">We hold that a judgment in an action which determines a claim in that action and has the effect of rendering moot all other claims in the action as to all other parties to the action is a final appealable order pursuant to R.C. 2505.02, and Civ.R. 54(B) is not applicable to such a judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">Such a judgment is <em>res judicata </em>as to any second appeal of that judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-8\"><em>Wise, </em>421 N.E.2d at 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\"><em>Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Landmark Air Fund I, </em>12 Ohio App.3d 117, 467 N.E.2d 573 (1983) discussed the <em>Wise </em>decision and set forth an analysis to be followed when determining whether a particular claim, not specifically ruled upon by the trial court, has been rendered moot:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-10\">In determining \u201cmootness,\u201d then, the analysis must focus on the parties to whom the unadjudicated issue relates, the primary judgment (e.g., summary judgment granted in favor of the defendant), and the nature of the particular issue or claim (e.g., a third-party complaint for indemnification or contribution) that is asserted to have been \u201cmooted\u201d by entry of the primary judgment in favor of a specific party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-11\"><em>Ford Motor Credit Co., </em>467 N.E.2d at 575.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-12\">Other courts have reached similar results. <em>See Wright v. Martin, </em>674 S.W.2d 238 (Mo.App.1984) (A review of the whole record compels the conclusion that the jury necessarily considered and denied defendant\u2019s counterclaim, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>though the verdict form for defendant\u2019s counterclaim was not completed.); <em>Twin City Fire Ins. Co. v. Brown, </em>602 S.W.2d 118 (Tex.Civ.App.1980) (In order to be final, judgment need not expressly dispose of all issues and parties in case if in considering all of its recitations and viewing them as a whole, judgment disposes of them by necessary implication.); <em>Kates Corp. v. Kirshenbaum, </em>122 R.I. 486, 409 A.2d 540 (1979) (Where interest of co-plaintiff in litigation was for all practical purposes identical to that of plaintiff, and final order in favor of defendant and against plaintiff precluded any recovery by co-plaintiff, order of trial court was sufficient to adjudicate the rights and liabilities of all parties and appeal was not barred.).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">As we have said, the judgments were properly entered on the docket as required by Rule 2-601. The docket entry for June 12, 1982 reads: \u201cDefendant Harlan Hadley\u2019s oral Motion for Directed Verdict as to Kathleen Estep, granted.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> One June 13, 1986 docket entry reads: \u201cVerdict: In favor of the Defendant, Georgetown Leather Design, Inc. Judgment entered.\u201d Another docket entry of June 13, 1986 reads: \u201cJudgment entered in favor of defendants and costs.\u201d A review of the transcript helps explain the meaning of this second docket entry of June 13. After the jury-had returned its verdict in favor of Georgetown, the clerk inquired of the jury: \u201cAs to the claim of Georgetown Leather Design against Harlan Hadley, for whom do you find, the Plaintiff or the Defendant?\u201d The court interrupted: \u201cI think the court will enter a verdict for the defendant in this case.\u201d We believe the court was referring to the third-party defendant and that the docket entry \u201cJudgment entered in favor of defendants and costs\u201d refers to the original defendant and the third-party defendant. But, we need not rest on this conclusion to support our holding. As we said earlier, we believe the verdicts in favor of George<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>town and Hadley, and the entry of these judgments on the docket, disposed of the third-party claim by Georgetown against Hadley. Therefore, appellant had thirty days from the date of the court\u2019s denial of her motion for new trial to file an appeal. Rule 1012d. Inasmuch as this appeal was not filed within that time, it is not properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED;</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b478-10\">.
