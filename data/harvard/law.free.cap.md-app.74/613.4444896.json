Ziegler against Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd., et al.,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (jointly referred to as \u201cKawasaki\u201d) in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City for the enhanced personal injuries he sustained as the result of an alleged design defect in a Kawasaki motorcycle.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Ziegler purchased a Kawasaki KZ 650 motorcycle in July 1980. Approximately two months later he was struck by an automobile which made a left turn into the side of the motorcycle. Ziegler sustained serious lower left leg injury requiring extensive medical treatment. The suit filed by Ziegler alleged that Kawasaki knew or should have known that \u201cstructural modifications to the frame of a motorcycle ... can be incorporated into the design of the motorcycle to prevent or lessen the severity of lower extremity injuries to the operator ... but failed to manufacture and/or sell motorcycles into which the design safety features have been incorporated.\u201d The Ziegler complaint contained four counts: (1) negligence; (2) a claim of breach of express and implied warranties; (3) an assertion of strict liability under \u00a7 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts (for the defective design); and (4) an alleged action of liability under \u00a7 402B of the Restatement (Second) of Torts (for misrepresentation in advertising).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">Prior to trial, Ziegler voluntarily dismissed counts 1 and 2 (negligence and breach of warranties). He further limited his claims to those injuries which he could show were enhanced by the alleged design defect. To remove from the case the joint tort-feasor, Barbara Wittig, the operator of the automobile that struck him, Ziegler settled his claim against her and executed a joint tort-feasor release.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">After Ziegler had concluded his evidence at trial, Judge Mary Arabian granted Kawasaki\u2019s motion for judgment as to count four but denied the motion as to count three, the claim of strict liability under \u00a7 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts. At the conclusion of all of the evidence, Kawasaki renewed its motion for judgment. Judge Arabian reserved ruling thereon and sent the case to the jury. When, after three days of deliberations, the jury was unable to render a unanimous verdict,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the trial court declared <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>a mistrial. By operation of Md. Rule 2-532(b), the motion for judgment was transformed into a motion for judgment <em>non obstante </em>veredicto.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Judge Arabian granted the motion, ruling that, as a matter of law, \u201creasoning minds could not differ as to the question of whether there was a defect in the design.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">Initially, Ziegler, in this Court, posited four issues, two of which related to alleged erroneous instructions to the jury, one averred error, on the trial judge\u2019s part, in not directing a verdict in Ziegler\u2019s favor, and a fourth charged that the judge erred in failing to submit to the jury the issue of the necessity of a warning to Kawasaki motorcyclists as to the risk of leg injury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">After the appellees\u2019 brief had pointed out defects in appellant's issues, Ziegler promptly restructured the issues in a reply brief. That reformation, reduced to its common denominator, results in the issue before us being: Did the trial court err in granting a judgment n.o.v. for the defendants? <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b643-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>We will focus on that question after we dispose of Ziegler\u2019s repeated allegation, at trial as well as on appeal, that the trial court erred in not submitting to the jury Kawasaki\u2019s \u201cfailure to warn\u201d Ziegler of the unreasonable danger in riding a motorcycle.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">\n<em>Defect Due to Failure to Warn</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">Count three, paragraph 27 of the complaint expressly limited the strict liability claim to one defect, <em>scilicet: </em>\u201cThat the aforedescribed motorcycle was defective at the time it was sold to the Plaintiff in that it contained a harmful defect <em>inasmuch as it did not include a design modification or other equipment </em>which would prevent or minimize lower extremity injuries to the operator in side impact collisions.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">During the trial, Ziegler attempted to expand his paragraph 27 averment to include a \u201cfailure to warn\u201d him of the dangerous and unsafe characteristics of the motorcycle. He maintained that the allegations contained in his negligence count which relate to failure to warn had been incorporated by reference into his strict liability count. We think Judge Arabian properly rejected appellant\u2019s reasoning. The judge correctly ruled that \u201cfailure to warn\u201d was not a matter to be considered in this case since it was a separate claim that had not been alleged as a defect in count 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>W. Keeton in <em>Prosser and Keeton on Torts </em>(5th ed.1984) states, at 645, that a product may be defective for any of the following three reasons: \u201c(1) a flaw in the product that was present in the product at the time the defendant sold it; (2) a failure by the producer or assembler of a product adequately to warn of a risk of hazard related to the way the product was designed; or (3) a defective design.\u201d <em>See generally </em>E.S. Digges &amp; J.G. Billmyre, <em>Product Liability in Maryland: Traditional and Emerging Theories of Recovery and Defense, </em>16 U.BaltL.Rev. 1, 11-19 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Count one of Ziegler\u2019s complaint contained allegations that Kawasaki acted negligently by failing \u201cto advise the Plaintiff of the dangerous and unsafe characteristics of the motorcycle designed, manufactured, distributed and/or sold by them.\u201d Although that and other allegations were incorporated by reference in count three, the allegations did ' not assert that failure to warn was a defect in the product which thereby made it unreasonably dangerous. What Ziegler actually averred was that the conduct of the manufacturer was unreasonable. Since the negligence claim was voluntarily dismissed before trial, the failure to warn issue was properly excluded from jury consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The purpose of pleadings is that the parties litigant may be appraised of the matters in controversy. <em>Pearce v. Watkins, </em>68 Md. 534, 13 A. 376 (1888). It is, therefore, necessary that the cause of action be alleged with reasonable accuracy, certainty, and clearness. <em>Campbell v. Welsh, </em>54 Md.App. 614, 460 A.2d 76 (1983). While the Maryland Rules provide that statements in a pleading may be adopted by reference, Rule 2-303(d), they make transpicuous that each averment of a pleading shall be simple, concise, and direct. Inasmuch as the only defect alleged in count three was that of a \u201cdesign defect,\u201d we decline to address the issue of the validity, <em>vel non, </em>of the claim of failure to warn. Adoption by reference is useful as a matter of convenience, but it may not be used to transform a negligence claim into one of strict liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>\n<em>The Design Defect</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">The question relating to design defect may be properly stated: Was the evidence adduced by Ziegler sufficient to generate a jury issue regarding the existence of a design defect in the motorcycle?</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The answer, of course, depends on what kind of evidence Ziegler was required to produce in order for the jury to determine the existence of a defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">For the first time in this State, the Court of Appeals in <em>Phipps v. General Motors Corp., </em>278 Md. 337, 363 A.2d 955 (1976), adopted strict liability as a basis for a product liability action. <em>See Singleton v. International Harvester Co., </em>685 F.2d 112 (4th Cir.1981). <em>See also </em>Gilbert, <em>Maryland Tort Law Handbook, </em>\u00a7 12.1 (1986). Specifically adopting the elements set out in \u00a7 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1965),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the <em>Phipps </em>Court commented that it is a simpler matter to apply \u00a7 402A in manufacturing defect cases than in those of design defect. <em>Phipps, </em>278 Md. at 344-45, 363 A.2d 955; <em>Singleton, </em>685 F.2d at 114. <em>See also generally </em>Gilbert, \u00a7 12.4.1 at 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">To recover under the authority of \u00a7 402A, a plaintiff need not prove any specific act of negligence on the part of the seller, but the plaintiff must prove that the product was in a defective condition <em>and </em>unreasonably dangerous at the time the product was sold. Gilbert, \u00a7 12.2 at 109. \u201cProof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>of one factor but not the other will defeat the plaintiffs claim.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">The two conditions are explained in terms of consumer expectations in the official comments to \u00a7 402A, Restatement (Second) of Torts (1965). Comment g explains that a \u201cdefective condition\u201d is present in those situations where the \u201cproduct is, at the time it leaves the seller\u2019s hands, in a condition not contemplated by the ultimate consumer, which will be unreasonably dangerous to him.\u201d Comment i defines an \u201cunreasonably dangerous\u201d product as one that is \u201cdangerous to an extent beyond that which would be [the contemplation of] the ordinary consumer who purchases it, with the ordinary knowledge common to the community as to its characteristics.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">When a defective condition is the result of an error in the manufacturing process, <em>ie., </em>if the product does not conform with the manufacturer\u2019s own standards, the consumer expectation test of \u00a7 402A is easier to apply. <em>Phipps, </em>278 Md. at 344, 363 A.2d 955. Section 402A is more difficult to apply when the alleged defect \u201cis the result of the design process so that the product causing the injury was in a condition intended by the manufacturer____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 344-45, 363 A.2d 955. Although the inquiry is concentrated on the product rather than the conduct of the manufacturer, in a design defect case, \u00a7 402A requires \u201ca weighing of the utility of risk inherent in the design against the magnitude of the risk.\u201d <em>Phipps, </em>278 Md. at 345, 363 A.2d 955. <em>See also Troja v. Black &amp; Decker Mfg. Co., </em>62 Md.App. 101, 107, 488 A.2d 516 (1985). The analysis used to determine whether the defect created an unreasonable danger retains the elements of a traditional negligence inquiry. <em>Phipps, </em>278 Md. at 345, 363 A.2d 955.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">\u201cThe question of whether a product is unreasonably dangerous is a balancing process\u2014weighing the public good against the individual occurrence.\u201d Gilbert, \u00a7 12.6 at 114. There are cases, however, where the risk is never \u201creasonable,\u201d and no balancing is required. <em>Phipps, </em>278 Md. at 345-46, 363 A.2d 955; <em>Troja, </em>62 Md.App. at 108, 488 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>516. Examples of \u201cinherently unreasonable risks\u201d include the steering mechanism of a new automobile causing the car to swerve off the road, the drive shaft of a new automobile separating from the vehicle when it is driven in a normal manner, or where the brakes of a new automobile suddenly fail. <em>Phipps, </em>278 Md. at 345, 363 A.2d 955. Digges and Billmyre explain that an \u201c \u2018inherently unreasonable risk\u2019 type of design defect is similar to a manufacturing defect because in both the product does not function as the manufacturer intended.\u201d 16 U.BaltL.Rev. at 13. <em>Phipps </em>held that, where an \u201cinherently unreasonable defect\u201d is involved, the defective condition and the unreasonably dangerous requirements are met if the condition causing the injury is not one that would be contemplated by an ordinary consumer. 278 Md. at 345-46, 363 A.2d 955. <em>See </em>Digges and Billmyre, 16 U.Balt.L.Rev. at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">In a design defect case that is not included in the limited category of inherently unreasonable risks, the issue turns into \u201cwhether a manufacturer, knowing the risks inherent in his product, acted reasonably in putting it on the market.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Singleton, </em>685 F.2d at 115. The question of the alleged defects then depends on \u201cthe balancing of the utility of the design and other factors against the magnitude of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>that risk.\u201d <em>Phipps, </em>278 Md. at 348, 363 A.2d 955. <em>See also Troja, </em>62 Md.App. at 108, 488 A.2d 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">The risk/utility test is the measure in the case at bar, rather than the \u201cconsumer expectation test.\u201d Ziegler asserts that the risk/utility test has not been adopted in Maryland, and Kawasaki contends that the absence of a \u201cmalfunction\u201d precludes the finding of any defect. Both parties rely on <em>Kelley v. R. G. Industries, Inc., </em>304 Md. 124, 497 A.2d 1143 (1985), to support their respective positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Since <em>Phipps </em>first approved the risk/utility test, Maryland has also adopted the balancing test for determining product defectiveness where the defect is not inherently unreasonable. <em>See Valk Mfg. Co. v. Radha Rangaswamy, et al., </em>74 Md.App. 304, 537 A.2d 622 (1988); <em>C &amp; K Lord v. Carter, </em>74 Md.App. 68, 536 A.2d 699 (1988), (Alpert, J.; Garrity, J., dissenting); <em>Troja, </em>62 Md.App. at 109, 488 A.2d 516; <em>Singleton, supra. See also </em>Digges &amp; Billmyre, 16 U.BaltL.Rev. at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">That balancing test was also recognized in <em>Kelley. </em>There, the Court rejected the plaintiffs argument that the handgun was defective, holding that simply because a product may be dangerous does not make it defective. \u201cFor the handgun to be defective, there would have to be a problem in its manufacture or design, such as a weak or improperly placed part, that would cause it to [mis]fire or otherwise malfunction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>[304 Md.] at 136, 497 A.2d 1143. <em>See also </em>16 U.Balt.L.Rev. at 13, n. 81. The <em>Kelley </em>Court reasoned that neither the \u201cconsumer expectation\u201d test nor the \u201crisk/utility\u201d test were applicable because the injuries complained of were the result of the gun\u2019s \u201cnormal function\u201d; nothing went \u201cwrong\u201d with the <em>product. Kelley, </em>304 Md. at 136-38, 497 A.2d 1143. The \u201cmalfunction\u201d requirement that the <em>Kelley </em>Court imposed as a prerequisite before either test is applicable must be read within the narrow context of handguns. <em>See C &amp; K Lord, Inc. v. Carter </em>[74 Md.App.] at 85, 536 A.2d 699. It is not the \u201cnormal function\u201d of most products, including a motorcycle, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>to bring about serious injury, <em>see Camacho v. Honda Motor Co., Ltd., </em>741 P.2d 1240, 1247 (Colo.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">Yet the <em>absence </em>of a safety device may clearly be a design defect, even in a product which does not \u201cmalfunction.\u201d Professor Wade has stated: \u201cUnder [the word] design is included the failure to provide proper safety devices. Design may include the parts of elements which do or do not go into the make-up of a product, if it is intended to be in that condition.\u201d Wade, 44 Miss.L.J. 825, 841 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">It was further commented by Wade that consumer expectations do not provide guidelines fully suitable to situations involving design defects, where \u201cthe consumer would not know what to expect, because he would have no idea how safe the product could be made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 829. <em>See also Barker v. Lull Engineering Co., Inc., </em>20 Cal.3rd 413, 143 Cal.Rptr. 225, 236, 573 P.2d 443, 455 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">As we have stated, the risk/utility test is applicable here. The failure of Kawasaki in the present case to equip the motorcycles with side impact protection is not an inherently unreasonable risk. The motorcycle operated exactly as intended by both the manufacturer and the plaintiff.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defect alleged in the matter <em>sub judice </em>is not one involving a part of a motorcycle that \u201cmalfunctioned\u201d because of either a manufacturing or a design defect. Rather, Ziegler charges unreasonableness on the part of the manufacturer, distributor, and seller because they placed a product on the market without a part that would function upon impact to reduce injury. One commentator has aptly stated, \u201cThe most important aspect of the design defect is that it is the result of a conscious and voluntary choice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>the form of quality of the product. The result of such a defect is that the plaintiff is injured while using the product in its ordinary and intended manner.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Comment, <em>Foreseeability in Product Design and Duty to Warn Cases\u2014Distinctions and Misconceptions, </em>1 Wis.L.Rev. 228, 231 (1968). <em>See also C &amp; K Lord </em>[74 Md.App.] at 85, 536 A.2d 699. The risk/utility test is therefore the only appropriate test to be applied in the instant case because it allows \u201cfull consideration of the relative merits of a product design.\u201d Digges &amp; Billmyre, 16 U.BalLL.Rev. at 16. <em>See also C &amp; K Lord, </em>at 85, 536 A.2d 699, and <em>see Shehan v.

From that testimony the jury could have inferred that the cure was worse than the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>When later confronted with a report stating that \u201csevere leg impacts occurred either because of, or in spite of, robust crash bars,\u201d Dr. Ezra abandoned his strong advocacy of robust crash bars and stated that he would not advocate crash bars because \u201creinforced fairings\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> are better. Although the doctor testified that the latter type of protective device had been successfully tested, the test results indicated that \u201cthe dummy would have had a broken neck ... and the left arm of the dummy was completely rotated at the shoulder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Expert opinion has \u201cno greater value than the facts on which it is based,\u201d <em>Bernstein v. Reforzo, </em>37 Md.App. 724, 379 A.2d 181 (1977). Dr. Ezra\u2019s testimony that a safer and practicable alternative design was available was not convincing. In sum, the evidence was insufficient to advance Ziegler\u2019s allegations of a defective design beyond the realm of sheer speculation. <em>See Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. v. McFarland, </em>21 Md.App. 501, 515-16, 319 A.2d 824 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">The testimony offered by Bruce Enz, another expert retained by Ziegler, was equally speculative and similarly unconvincing. Enz related to the jury that the injury to Ziegler\u2019s leg would have been less severe had the motorcycle been equipped with a robust crash bar, but he admitted that it was \u201ccertainly possible\u201d to have a fractured leg \u201cfrom the leg[\u2019s] hitting the [crash] bar rather than the car[\u2019s] crushing the leg.\u201d Enz\u2019s testimony was as unavailing as Dr. Ezra\u2019s with respect to other injuries which might have been sustained by Ziegler had a robust crash bar been in place on the motorcycle. On the other hand, Kawasaki\u2019s expert witnesses testified and illustrated what would have happened to Ziegler in the way of total injuries had the motorcycle been equipped with the protective device. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Kawasaki experts informed the jury that paralysis or death would have been the likely result.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">There was, we think, insufficient credible evidence produced at trial to show that the absence of a robust crash bar or other protective device constituted a design defect on the Kawasaki motorcycle. The evidence viewed in the light most favorable to Ziegler,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> fails to pass muster in that there was not sufficient evidence that the injuries sustained would have been lessened because of the presence of a protective device. Indeed, the overwhelming evidence was to the contrary. Even if we were to assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that the evidence was sufficient to create a <em>prima facie </em>case insofar as the leg injury, standing alone, was concerned, that evidence would not be sufficient to permit an inference that a motorcycle with robust leg bars would be safer with respect to the rest of the operator\u2019s body. One cannot eliminate the risk of injury to the leg at the expense of a significantly increasing risk of injury to other parts of the body. Phrased differently, Ziegler failed to produce evidence that the design alternative would meet the need and still permit the whole body to be safe. Having not satisfied the \u201crisk\u201d part of the two-fold risk/utility test, Ziegler fell short of producing sufficient evidence for the jury to make a determination regarding Kawasaki\u2019s reasonableness <em>vel non </em>in marketing a motorcycle without protective crash bars. Since the first prong of the risk test was not sated, we need not address other factors involved in the \u201cutility\u201d test.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b640-13\">.

The issues presented read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">\"1.

Did the trial court err by refusing to submit to the jury the issue of the necessity of a warning as to the risks of danger and injury on a motorcycle without lower leg protection?</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">3.

Professor Wade suggested that, when the issue of lack of \u201cdue safety\u201d (a term he preferred over \u201cdefective\u201d or \u201cunreasonably dangerous\u201d) is involved, the proper question for the jury\u2019s consideration is whether a product is so likely to be harmful</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkI\">\" \u2018that a reasonable prudent manufacturer [supplier], who had actual knowledge of its harmful character would not place it on the market. It is not necessary to find that this defendant had knowledge of the harmful character of the [product] in order to determine that it was not duly safe.\u2019 This language gives the tort flavor. It uses the familiar concept of a reasonable prudent man; which juries have always been able to handle; but it differentiates clearly between negligence and strict liability. It applies equally to manufacturing errors and bad designs. It is clearly objective in nature, giving no hint of depending on the subjective expectations of either party.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Wade, <em>On the Nature of Strict Tort Liability for Products, </em>44 Miss.LJ. 825, 839-40 (1973) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b649-7\">.
