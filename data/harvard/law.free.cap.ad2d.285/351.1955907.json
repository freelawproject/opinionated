Appeal from the order, unanimously dismissed, without costs, as subsumed in the appeal from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Given the fact that, for four years, the parties, by agreement, tried an identical action to judgment in favor of plaintiffs (later dismissed for lack of diversity jurisdiction) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, literally across the street from the New York County Courthouse, it was improvident to dismiss this action on forum non conveniens grounds. Despite the dispute\u2019s limited contacts with New York and defendant\u2019s disputed claims of alleged sharp practice and breach of the parties\u2019 September 27, 1995 agreement to agree to an alternate forum in the event of dismissal of the Federal action, defendant has not met its burden of proving that New York County is an inconvenient forum. There is no reason to believe that Rhode Island, where defendant\u2019s home office is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>located, would be a more convenient forum than New York.
