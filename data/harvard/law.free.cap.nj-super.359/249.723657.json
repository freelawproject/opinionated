We conclude that the statement, made immediately following administration of <em>Miranda</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>warnings and after an assurance from an officer that defendant could make a statement \u201coff-the-record,\u201d was not only obtained in violation of <em>Miranda </em>but was involuntary. We hold, as well, that a statement concerning the offense made by one of the victims to a physician who examined the victim at the request of investigating authorities was also inadmissible. Finally, we conclude that the admission of defendant\u2019s statement, either alone or in conjunction with the physician\u2019s testimony, cannot be deemed harmless in the circumstances of this case, which turned on defendant\u2019s credibility weighed against that of the victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">On September 21, 1998, a Middlesex County grand jury returned an indictment charging defendant Wayne Pillar with two counts of first degree aggravated sexual assault of P.T. and S.A.T., <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2a (counts one and six, respectively); three counts of second degree sexual assault, two involving P.T. and one, S.A.T., <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2b (counts two, three and seven); two counts of third degree endangering the welfare of a child involving P.T. and S.A.T., <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a (counts four and eight, respectively); and one count of second degree endangering the welfare <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>of a child, involving P.T., <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4b(4) (count five). P.T., was born on August 23, 1983. S.A.T., P.T.\u2019s sister, was born on May 7,1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The indictment alleged that defendant engaged in various acts of sexual abuse of P.T., between January 1, 1991 and August 22, 1996. The incidents allegedly took the form of fondling, digital and genital penetration, and oral sex. With respect to S.A.T., it was alleged that defendant sexually assaulted her sometime between May and September 1991 by touching her improperly when she was under the age of thirteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The jury acquitted defendant of count three, involving an allegation of sexual assault by penetration with P.T. between August and September 1996 when P.T. was over thirteen, as well as count six, an allegation of aggravated sexual assault by penetration with S.A.T. between May and September 1991 when she was under thirteen. He was convicted on the remaining counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">On October 13, 2000, defendant was sentenced to a twelve-year prison term on count one (aggravated sexual assault), a seven-year term on counts Iwo and seven (sexual assault), a four-year term on counts four and eight (endangering), and a five-year term on count five (endangering). The terms imposed on counts two, four, five, seven and eight were to run concurrent with the sentence on count one.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">In 1976, defendant, who was thirty-nine years old, befriended J.T. and M.T., the parents of P.T. and S.A.T. Shortly thereafter, M.T. and defendant began a sexual relationship. In fact, both M.T. and defendant believe that defendant is the biological father of S.A.T. Defendant was P.T.\u2019s godfather as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">In 1982, defendant moved to Florida. However, he would call M.T. and visit the family occasionally, staying at their household during these visits. Three years later, defendant returned to New Jersey and lived with the family for another three years. In 1988, defendant moved back to Florida but continued to visit the family <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>two or three times a year. When he did visit, he slept in P.T.\u2019s room, while P.T. slept on the couch.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Defendant would purchase gifts for P.T., a child who had attended a special school since she was four years old and was eventually classified as emotionally disturbed. When P.T. was seven years old, however, defendant began to touch \u201c[her] vagina and breasts ... underneath [her] clothing.\u201d These incidents would occur when P.T.\u2019s parents were at bingo, which was nearly every night, and mostly when S.A.T., P.T.\u2019s older sister, was out of the house, although several instances occurred with the sister present in the house. P.T. complained to M.T. about defendant\u2019s conduct, specifically that defendant was \u201churting her,\u201d but her mother did nothing. Defendant eventually forced P.T. to touch his penis. Defendant would also give alcohol to P.T. until she became intoxicated. The two would also watch pornographic movies together, during which defendant would begin masturbating himself and touching her. Defendant also forced P.T. to give him oral sex \u201ca couple of times,\u201d gave her drugs, and also took suggestive photographs of her in her underwear; pictures which defendant had developed and kept. Eventually, when P.T. was around ten or eleven, defendant penetrated P.T. with his penis, although P.T. yelled for him to stop. There were two incidents of vaginal penetration. On more than one occasion, defendant tied P.T.\u2019s hands and feet during the assaults.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">When defendant was not in New Jersey, he would call P.T. every Friday night or send her letters, both sexual in nature. On one occasion around Christmas, defendant sent P.T. a box of CDs with a letter noting that it was to be opened only by P.T., \u201cConfidential. For your eyes only. Top Secret.\u201d The letter stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-8\">[A]nd also a gift certificate for a pair of pants to cover your sweet little ass. This way you can get the style that you like and not one that I think looks best on you. That can wait until I get there, and take you shopping if your [sicj good to me____ I plan on eumming up at the end of March, so you can start getting ready now. I know you finally got [S.A.T.] thrown out, and I hope that you are not to [sic] lonely without someone to fight with____I\u2019m hoping that you and D. will throw me a little <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>tea party when I\u2019m there. I will bring a movie for us three to watch, and maybe all 3 of us can learn something and have fun doing it together.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Defendant also sent P.T. a letter indicating that he would give her certain things if she did certain things, such as \u201ca lap top computer which he said he might get [her] if [she] had sexual intercourse with him.\u201d This letter, which P.T. described as a \u201cprice list,\u201d stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">Just a short little letter about our phone call on Friday. You wanted to know about present values. So here is a price list. Under $5 lunch or snack money but be careful because they add up. $5 to $15 about the cost of the bra. This also should cover a CD. $15 to $30.00, this will buy a pair of pants and a shirt. Will also get dinner. $30 to $60 this is the almost everything price range. Should uncover everything and taste new experiences and one or two other small gifts over $60. This is the all the way gift, no stopping. Doing everything. It also includes a role of film for Mom\u2019s Polaroid camera.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-7\">P.S. $1300, new computer. Hey, I\u2019d have to fuck someone every night to buy one of those.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Defendant\u2019s behavior ceased when P.T. turned fourteen. The last incident involved defendant forcing P.T. to have intercourse and stating \u201cif [P.T.] tell[s] anybody, [she\u2019s] going to get it.\u201d Defendant allegedly fondled one of P.T.\u2019s. friends as well, although he was not charged for that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">In 1992, defendant also inappropriately touched P.T.\u2019s older sister, S.A.T. on several occasions. In one instance, when S.A.T. was twelve, defendant penetrated S.A.T.\u2019s vagina with his finger. S.A.T. told her mother, who did not believe her. Several days later, defendant began to rub her inner thigh while the two were driving to a mall. S.A.T. \u201cpushed his hand away,\u201d told him to stop and sat in the back for the trip home. S.A.T., who was dating a man twenty years older than her (whom she later married), moved out of the house in 1998 because she did not get along with her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">In 1997, C.L., a friend of the T.\u2019s, moved into the T.\u2019s residence upon being evicted from her own home. C.L. got along well with P.T. and S.A.T., eventually becoming J.T.\u2019s girlfriend. On March 19, 1998, while tucking P.T. in for bed, C.L. noticed a crumpled piece of paper on the floor of P.T.\u2019s bedroom. She picked up the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>paper and read it, noticing that the letter was from defendant. The next day, in response to questioning about the letter, P.T. told C.L. that \u201c[defendant] had touched her\u201d and asked her not to tell J.T., her father. C.L. then spoke with S.A.T., who also related defendant\u2019s conduct with her. C.L. then told J.T. of the allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">C.L. looked around the house and found other letters from defendant. On Monday, she called P.T.\u2019s school, and J.T. called the police. A week later J.T., S.A.T., and P.T., met at P.T.\u2019s school with Investigator Allan Bandies. Investigator Bandies took statements from both girls, in the presence of a school counselor, and Marcia Gonzalez, a representative from the Division of Youth and Family Services. Complaints were signed shortly thereafter and on July 12,1998, the next time defendant came to New Jersey from Florida, he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Prior to trial, the judge held an <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104(a) hearing to determine the admissibility of out-of-court statements made by defendant to the police following his arrest. The judge admitted the statements, finding them to have been made voluntarily. The judge also admitted, based on stipulated facts, out-of-court statements made by P.T. and S.A.T. to C.L., concerning the sexual acts allegedly committed upon them by defendant, under the \u201cfresh complaint\u201d rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">Both P.T. and S.A.T. testified at trial to the various acts of sexual abuse committed by defendant. In addition, the jury heard certain incriminating statements made by defendant, which we will discuss hereafter. The jury also reviewed the letters written by defendant to P.T.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">Defendant testified in his own behalf, denying that he had ever touched P.T. or S.A.T. in an inappropriate manner. He explained that the letters written to P.T. were meant as jokes, conceding that, in hindsight, they contained inappropriate language. He acknowledged that he had a habit of making coarse sexual jokes that people might find offensive and admitted engaging in such sexual banter with P.T. and S.A.T.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">We first address the admissibility of an incriminating statement made by defendant after his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">On July 12,1998, defendant was arrested as he arrived at P.T.\u2019s home on a visit from Florida. Investigator Bandies read defendant the charges contained in complaints signed by S.A.T. and J.T., P.T.\u2019s father, and verbally advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Defendant acknowledged that he understood his rights and asked no questions at that time. After transporting defendant to the police department, Bandies read the rights again, and defendant signed a <em>Miranda </em>warning card. Once again defendant acknowledged that he understood his rights and asked no questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">After being photographed and fingerprinted, defendant was escorted into a conference room where he was given the criminal complaints to read for himself. At that point, Bandies asked defendant if he wished to speak. Defendant responded that he was \u201cguilty of some of the things on here ... but not all of them.\u201d Defendant then stated that he would like to speak to the police, but would \u201clike to consult with an attorney first.\u201d Defendant asked what would happen to him next, and Bandies told him about the arraignment process, setting of bail and appointment of counsel, if necessary. When asked if he had any questions, defendant paused for a moment, and asked to \u201csay something \u2018off-the-record.\u2019 \u201d Both Bandies and Detective Zebrowski, who was also in the conference room, agreed to listen to an \u201coff-the-record\u201d statement. At this point, defendant stated \u201cthat he fondled these girls [referring to P.T. and S.A.T.] but did not penetrate them.\u201d Bandies testified that he was not sure what \u201coff-the-record\u201d meant, but he was \u201cunder the impression that [defendant] wanted to tell me something.\u201d Bandies conceded that in his mind once an individual receives <em>Miranda </em>warnings, \u201cthere really is no such thing as off-the-record.\u201d After defendant made the \u201cfondling\u201d admission, Bandies asked if \u201che wanted to talk about anything else.\u201d Defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>dant responded that he \u201cthought it would be best if he could speak to an attorney first.\u201d The conversation then ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Before the trial court, defense counsel argued that the police officers\u2019 consent to listen to \u201coff-the-record\u201d statements was misleading, which caused defendant\u2019s incriminating statements to be coerced, in violation of his Fifth Amendment rights. The State countered that defendant was well aware of his right to remain silent, and that he knew that he was entitled to confer with counsel. The State also argued that \u201coff-the-record\u201d was ambiguous to reasonable people such as the police officers to whom the comment was addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">The trial judge determined that defendant\u2019s first statement that he was guilty of some of the charges, was not a product of interrogation, and that, in any event, it was voluntarily made because defendant was cognizant of his constitutional rights when he made it. The judge also determined that the second statement, made after defendant requested to speak \u201coff-the-record,\u201d was voluntarily made for the same reason, and because the officers\u2019 conduct was \u201cnot unreasonable.\u201d Hence, the judge denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the statements, both of which were subsequently heard by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">On appeal defendant does not challenge the ruling with respect to his initial statement, but contends that the second, \u201coff-the-record,\u201d statement was not admissible because \u201cit was misleading and false.\u201d Although defendant primarily attacks the statement on the ground that it was involuntarily made, he also argues that the police conduct in obtaining the statement subverted the <em>Miranda </em>warnings themselves. Because the two arguments are \u201cintertwined,\u201d <em>Reynolds v. State, </em>327 <em>Md. </em>494, 610 A.2d 782, 785 (1992) , <em>cert. denied, </em>506 <em>U.S. </em>1054, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>981, 122 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>134 (1993) , we address the admissibility of defendant\u2019s statement both in terms of a <em>Miranda </em>violation, as well as on traditional grounds of voluntariness. However, we note, as did the court in <em>Reynolds, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number><em>supra, </em>at 785-86, that appellate counsel have an obligation to carefully isolate and identify the separate legal bases of their arguments and to include them in distinct point headings. <em>R. </em>2:6-2(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">As is now well known, in <em>Miranda, </em>the United States Supreme Court prescribed procedures that law enforcement must follow in an effort to protect a criminal suspect\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The <em>Miranda </em>rights \u201care ancillary to the fundamental right that is at the core of the Fifth Amendment.\u201d <em>State v. Burris, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>509, 518, 679 A.2d 121 (1996) (citing <em>Oregon v. Elstad, </em>470 <em>U.S. </em>298, 304, 105 <em>S.Ct. </em>1285, 1290, 84 L.Ed.2d 222, 229 (1985)). The <em>Miranda </em>warnings are not themselves rights protected by the Constitution but are, rather \u201cprophylactic measures that are necessary to safeguard the essential constitutional right against self-incrimination.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">Because the <em>Miranda </em>warnings are prophylactic measures designed to ensure that a suspect\u2019s decision to speak to the police is knowing and voluntary, a <em>Miranda </em>violation itself is not determinative of a Fifth Amendment violation of the privilege against self-incrimination. <em>[Michigan v. Tucker, </em>417 <em>U.S. </em>433, 444-45, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>2357, 2364, 41 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>182, 193 (1974)]. A voluntary, incriminating statement elicited without the <em>Miranda </em>warnings violates a defendant\u2019s ancillary rights, but does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation. <em>Id. </em>at 446, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2365, 41 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 194. A statement that is elicited after a <em>Miranda </em>right has been invoked, however, becomes a violation of constitutional dimension \u2014 a violation of the constitutional right itself. <em>Wainwright v. Greenfield, </em>474 <em>U.S. </em>284, 293, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>634, 639, 88 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>623, 631 (1986).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-8\">[Id at 519, 679 A.2d 121.]<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>The distinction between violation of a prophylactic rule and violation of a constitutionally guaranteed right is significant because of the consequences that flow from each. There is \u201ca qualitative difference between a failure to administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings in the first place, and a failure to honor, after they have been asserted, the constitutional rights that those warnings are designed to secure.\u201d <em>State v. Hartley, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>252, 272, 511 A.2d 80 (1986). Thus, a statement resulting from an in-custody interrogation without <em>Miranda </em>warnings may nevertheless be voluntary. <em>Ibid. </em>As a result, such a voluntary, though unwarned statement, while inadmissible in the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief, may be used for impeachment of the accused if he testifies. <em>State v. Burris, supra, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>at 529, 679 A.2d 121.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the other hand, an involuntary statement is inadmissible for any purpose. <em>Id. </em>at 534, 679 A.2d 121; <em>Mincey v. Arizona, </em>437 <em>U.S. </em>385, 397-98, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>2408, 2416, 57 <em>L. </em>Ed. 2d 290, 303-04 (1978); <em>United States v. Walton, </em>10 F.3d 1024, 1033 (3rd. Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">We first address the impact of an agreed to request to speak \u201coff-the-record\u201d following administration of <em>Miranda </em>warnings. There are two bases upon which such an agreement renders the resulting statement inadmissible. First, such a misrepresentation directly contradicts and thereby neutralizes the entire purpose of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Second, such misrepresentation, may, and in this case did, render the statement involuntary. We deal with the <em>Miranda </em>issue first.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>(D</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">In <em>People v. Braeseke, 25 </em>Cal.3d 691, <em>159 Cal.Rptr. </em>684, 602 P.2d 384 (1979)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>, the defendant was taken to a police station to be interviewed concerning the killings of his mother, father and grandfather. After an initial period of questioning, the police decided to reinterview defendant concerning inconsistencies between his story and that of another witness. <em>Miranda </em>warnings were administered and defendant indicated his willingness to speak with the officers. However, after some further inconsistency developed, the police told defendant that they believed he had committed the homicides. \u201cAt this point defendant said he did not want to discuss the matter further without an attorney present.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 386. Nevertheless, during subsequent booking procedure defendant asked if he could speak with one of the original interrogating officers alone and \u201coff-the-record.\u201d The officer agreed and defendant made certain incriminating statements, which led to a tape-recorded confession. <em>Id. </em>at 386-87. The court held that a request to speak \u201coff-the-record\u201d cannot constitute a knowing and intelligent waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights, specifically the advice that anything a suspect says can be used against him in a'court of law. <em>Id. </em>at 391. \u201cIndeed, defendant\u2019s request revealed a marked lack of understanding of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings. [The officers] then contributed to defendant\u2019s lack of understanding by agreeing to the request rather than informing defendant there could be no such thing as an \u2018off-the-record\u2019 discussion.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citations omitted) <footnotemark>5</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Similarly, in <em>United States v. Walton, supra, </em>10 F.3d at 1027, the court was also faced with a defendant who sought an off-the-record interview with federal agents the day following administration of <em>Miranda </em>warnings and the providing of a written statement. The officer, who defendant knew from high school, assured defendant that they could talk \u201coff the cuff,\u201d following which defendant provided inculpatory information. No <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given before this conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">At the outset, the court acknowledged that \u201c[t]his is not a <em>Miranda </em>case,\u201d since Walton was not in custody when his statement was made. As a result, the admissibility of the statement was to be evaluated under a voluntariness standard judged by the totality of the circumstances. <em>Walton, supra, </em>at 1028. Although we shall discuss the voluntariness of defendant\u2019s statement later in this opinion, it is of significance that in finding the statement involuntary the Third Circuit noted that \u201cthere was no reason for Walton to disbelieve [the officer] that nothing he said would be used against him, and to rely instead upon the <em>Miranda </em>warnings he had been given the previous day. Indeed the <em>Miranda </em>warnings of the previous day and [the officer\u2019s] assurances during the park bench meeting appear exclusive of, and inconsistent with, one another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1030. The officer\u2019s \u201cassurances that Walton could speak \u2018off the cuff created a situation in which Walton was deprived of the ability to understand the consequences of foregoing his privilege [against self-incrimination]. A <em>fortiorari, </em>he was deprived of the ability to make an intelligent choice between exercising and waiving that privilege.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1031.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>The same reasoning applies in the present case. Indeed, the infirmity here runs deeper. A police officer cannot directly contradict, out of one side of his mouth, the <em>Miranda </em>warnings just given out of the other. An acquiescence to hear an \u201coff-the-record\u201d statement from a suspect, which the officer ought to know cannot be \u201coff-the-record,\u201d totally undermines and eviscerates the <em>Miranda </em>warnings, at least with respect to a statement made, as here, in immediate and direct response to the misleading assurance. As the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said in <em>Commonwealth v. Gibbs, </em>520 <em>Pa. </em>151, 553 A.2d 409, 411(Pa.), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 <em>U.S. </em>963, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>403, 107 L.Ed.2d 369 (1989), \u201cMisleading statements and promises by the police choke off the legal process at the very moment which <em>Miranda </em>was designed to protect.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">Even if we accept the trial judge\u2019s conclusion that the officer did not know what defendant meant by \u201coff-the-record,\u201d a conclusion we consider implausible in light of the common usage of the expression, it was the officer\u2019s obligation to clarify what the statement did mean, especially in light of the officer\u2019s acknowledgment that in his mind there was no such thing as an \u201coff-the-record\u201d conversation. In the face of the <em>Miranda </em>warning just administered, there could not be a valid waiver of the right to remain silent without such a clarification. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>929 F.2d 96, 100 (2nd Cir.1991) (\u201caffirmative misrepresentations by the police may be sufficiently coercive to invalidate a suspect\u2019s waiver of the Fifth Amendment privilege\u201d); <em>see also Colorado v.

Fenton, </em>474 <em>U.S. </em>104, 110, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>445, 449, 88 L.Ed.2d 405, 411 (1985); <em>State v.

Although police misrepresentations are relevant in analyzing the totality of the circumstances surrounding a claim that a confession was involuntary, such \u201cmisrepresentations alone are usually insufficient to justify a determination of involuntariness or lack of knowledge.\u201d <em>State v. Cooper, </em>151 <em>N.J. 326, 355, </em>700 A.2d 306 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 <em>U.S. </em>1084, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>809, 145 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>681 (2000) (citations omitted). \u201cMoreover, a misrepresentation by police does not render a confession or waiver involuntary unless the misrepresentation actually induced the confession.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citation omitted). Nevertheless, it has been held that a promise of immunity in the form of an assurance by police that a statement would not be used against an accused, or would be considered confidential, without more, renders the statement involuntary. <em>United States v. Walton, supra; Ponticelli v. State, </em>593 So.2d 483, 488 (Fla.1991), <em>judgment vacated on other grounds by, </em>506 <em>U.S. </em>802, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>32, 121 L.Ed.2d 5 (1992); <em>State v.

Notwithstanding the implication in <em>Bram </em>that any promise taints a statement subsequently made, the more recent decisions consider a variety of factors, including the nature of the promise, <em>see, e.g., [United States v.

Watford, supra, </em>261 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 160-64, 618 A.2d 358, noting that in <em>Arizona v. Fulminante, </em>499 <em>U.S. </em>279, 285, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>1246, 1251, 113 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 302, 315 (1991), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>500 <em>U.S. </em>938, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>2067, 114 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>472 (1991), the Court expressly disavowed <em>Bram </em>as the standard for determining the voluntariness of a confession. Rather, the controlling test, the Court held, is that found in <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 <em>U.S. </em>218, 225-26, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>2041, 2046-47, 36 L.Ed.2d 854, 862 (1973), which asks whether, under the totality of circumstances, the confession is \u201cthe product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice by its maker\u201d or whether \u201chis will has been overborne and his capacity for self-determination critically impaired.\u201d <em>See also Green v.

Watford, supra, </em>261 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 163, 618 A.2d 358. And \u201c[w]hether a statement by the interrogating officer amounts to a promise must be viewed from the defendant\u2019s, not the [interrogator]^ perspective, applying a reasonableness standard.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Grades v. Boles, </em>398 F.2d 409, 412 (4th Cir.1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Nor does the process of determining the impact of a promise on the voluntariness of a statement involve a quantitative weighing of the various factors set out in <em>Schneckloth; </em>rather, it is a qualitative weighing in which even a single factor may result in a finding that the \u201csuspect\u2019s will was overborne and the confession was not therefore a free and voluntary act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 164, 618 A.2d 358 (quoting <em>Green v. Scully, supra, </em>850 F.2d at 902). In <em>Watford, </em>Judge Havey took note, <em>ibid., </em>of the statement in <em>Brady v. United States, supra, </em>397 <em>U.S. </em>at 754, 90 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1472, 25 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 759, where, in an effort to distinguish <em>Bram, </em>the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-6\"><em>Bram </em>dealt with a confession given by a defendant in custody; alone and unrepresented by counsel. In such circumstances, even a mild promise of leniency was deemed sufficient to bar the confession, not because the promise was an illegal act as such, but because defendants at such times are too sensitive to inducement and the possible impact on them too great to ignore and too difficult to assess.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">In the present case, we examine the particular statement given by defendant, in custody, alone and without counsel, in specific and immediate response to the officer\u2019s assurance that defendant could speak off-the-record. That promise, which defendant could reasonably believe meant that the statement would not be used against him, clearly had the likelihood of stripping defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>dant of his \u201ccapacity for self-determination,\u201d <em>Schneckloth, supra, </em>412 <em>U.S. </em>at 225-26, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2046-47, 36 L.Ed.2d at 862. \u201cA promise that statements made will not be used against the defendant purports to remove the specter of proving one\u2019s own guilt by making a statement. Such a promise is a truly powerful one, going to the heart of a declarant\u2019s reservations about giving a statement.\u201d <em>United States v. Conley, </em>859 <em>F.Supp. </em>830, 836 (W.D.Pa.1994). We agree with the court\u2019s statement in <em>Streetman v. Lynaugh, </em>812 F.2d 950, 957 (5th Cir.1987), <em>reh\u2019d denied, </em>818 F.2d 865 (1987), that \u201ccertain promises, if not kept, are so attractive that they render a resulting confession involuntary. A promise ... that any statement will not be used against the accused is such a promise.\u201d (citation omitted). As the Court said in <em>United States v. Walton, supra, </em>10 F.3d at 1031, an assurance that a statement would not be used against a suspect goes \u201cbeyond a direct promise of leniency.\u201d If defendant believed that his statement could not be used against him, despite the earlier <em>Miranda </em>warnings, his statement made as a result of that false assurance could not be a free and voluntary one. Stated differently, the improper promise \u201cactually induced\u201d the incriminating statement. <em>State v. Cooper, supra, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>at 355, 700 A.2d 306. In our view, the facts fail to establish that Pillar\u2019s statement was voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Miller, </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>392, 404-05, 388 A.2d 218 (1978).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The cases relied upon by the State are all readily distinguishable. In <em>State v. Henderson, </em>80 <em>Hawai'i </em>439, 911 P.2d 74, 77 (1996), although the defendant asked to make an \u201coff-the-record\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>statement after being advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, the officer told him that any statement he made would be \u201con the record.\u201d Nevertheless, defendant chose to speak. In the present case, rather than stating out loud that which was in his mind-that there could not be an off-the-record Statement-Detective Bandies acquiesced in the request. In <em>Carswell v. State, </em>268 <em>Ga. </em>531, 491 <em>S.E.2d </em>343 (1997), defendant\u2019s off-the-record denial of involvement in a murder came three hours before his ultimate confession at which point he had again received <em>Miranda </em>warnings. As the court said, \u201c[a]t that point, Carswell could not reasonably have expected that his interrogation was being conducted off-the-reeord. Thus, Carswell\u2019s confessions were quite remote from, and not prompted by, the investigator\u2019s claim that they were speaking off-the-record----\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 346.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Quite the contrary is true here. In <em>State v. McCray, </em>332 <em>S.C. </em>536, 506 <em>S.E.2d </em>301 (1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>526 <em>U.S. </em>1025, 119 <em>S.Ct. </em>1266, 143 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>362 (1999), the court found that the officer\u2019s statement to the defendant that he was going to have an \u201coff of the cup [sic] question and answer thing that we need to compile the evidence\u201d did not constitute \u201cpolice trickery\u201d but was, rather, \u201cclearly intended to convey the manner in which he planned to conduct his interview of [defendant].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Finally, in <em>State v. Little, </em>201 <em>W.Va. </em>523, 498 <em>S.E.2d </em>716, 718-19 (1997), the administration of <em>Miranda </em>rights was tape recorded, after which defendant indicated that he did not wish to make a statement. The police officer turned off the recorder and left defendant alone with his mother and brother. After speaking with his family, defendant said he wished to make a statement. He then made a statement \u2018off-the-record\u2019 \u201cto which [the officer] replied that if defendant was telling the truth, his actions could be construed as self-defense.\u201d The recorder was then turned on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>again and defendant was reread his <em>Miranda </em>rights after which he admitted to shooting the victim. The West Virginia Supreme Court held the confession to be voluntarily given.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Those facts are so far afield from the circumstances present in this case as to provide no support for the State\u2019s argument. Here, to repeat, defendant\u2019s statement was in direct and immediate response to Bandics\u2019s knowingly incorrect representation that he could speak \u201coff-the-record.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We do not hold that an off-the-record assurance continues indefinitely to render a statement made in response thereto involuntary. A statement made at a substantially later point in time might well be found voluntary notwithstanding the earlier false assurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">Despite finding that defendant\u2019s second statement was inadmissible, we must still determine whether the resulting error was harmless. <em>R. </em>2:10-2; <em>Arizona v. Fulminante, supra, </em>499 <em>U.S. </em>at 307-11, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1264-65, 113 L.Ed.2d at 329-33.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>To state the harmless error test, at least with respect to constitutional errors, is easier than to apply it. In <em>State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>325, 340-41, 273 A.2d 1 (1971), the Court adopted the <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 <em>U.S. </em>18, 24, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>824, 828, 17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710-11 (1967) test that for a constitutional error to be harmless, \u201cthe court must be able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d As Chief Justice Weintraub said in <em>Macon, supra, </em>at 340, 273 A.2d 1, \u201cwhat continues to defy articulation is the process which leads a judge to say there is a doubt and that the doubt is or is not a reasonable one. The circumstances are too infinite and the appellate judgment too laden with discretion to admit a formulary aid.\u201d Another judge has aptly referred to the \u201cchameleonic quality of harmless error methodology,\u201d <em>State v. Evans, </em>96 <em>Wash.2d </em>1, 633 P.2d 83, 88 (1981) (Brachtenbach, C.J., concurring), in apparent recognition of the distinct approaches employed by courts-and often by the same courts at different times-to determine if a given error is, or is not, harmless. The differing approaches appear to fall under two standards of review: \u201c[t]he first, the contribution test, focuses on whether the error contributed to the verdict, that is, whether the evidence was likely to have been considered by the jury in arriving at its decision____The second standard focuses on the remainder of the pie and permits a judicial finding of harmless error if the untainted evidence ... is so overwhelming that in the judgment of the reviewing court conviction was inevitable.\u201d Dennis J. Sweeney, <em>An Analysis of Harmless Error in Washington: A Principled Process, </em>31 <em>Gonz. L.Rev. </em>277, 286 (1996) (hereinafter Sweeney). <em>See also State v. Evans, supra, </em>633 P.2d at 86-87. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>contribution test is the \u201cstricter of the two,\u201d being more \u201cdeferential to the party asserting the error.\u201d Sweeney, <em>supra, </em>at 287. Under that test, harmless error is error \u201cwhich could not have \u2018contributed\u2019 to the verdict.\u201d Sweeney, <em>ibid. </em>However, under either test a reviewing court must be able to \u201cconclude that 12 jurors in a given case would have arrived at the same collective decision regardless of the error. To state this undertaking is also to state its impossibility.\u201d Sweeney, <em>supra, </em>at 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Even though <em>Chapman </em>and its progeny, such as <em>Macon, </em>would appear to have adopted the \u201ccontribution\u201d test, <em>Harrington v. California, </em>395 <em>U.S. </em>250, 89 <em>S.Ct. </em>1726, 23 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>284 (1969), decided just two years after <em>Chapman, </em>has been viewed by some as having adopted the \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d test. <em>See </em>Harry T. Edwards, <em>To Err is Human, But Not Always Harmless: When Should Legal Error Be Tolerated, 70 N.Y.U. L.Rev. </em>1167, 1186 (1996) (hereinafter Edwards); <em>State v. Evans, supra, </em>633 P.2d at 87. As a result, many appellate courts have adopted the analysis of the majority in <em>Harrington, </em>which looks to \u201cwhether the record evidence adequately demonstrates the appellant\u2019s guilt, rather than whether the error contributed to the verdict.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Notwithstanding, in <em>Arizona v. Fulminante, supra, </em>in finding that the coerced confession there was not harmless, the majority opinion on that issue appears to have reverted \u201cto the likely impact of the error on the jury verdict in assessing the claim of harmless error.\u201d Edwards, <em>supra, </em>at 1189-90. That view was strengthened by the decision in <em>Sullivan v. Louisiana, </em>508 <em>U.S. </em>275, 279-280, 113 <em>S.Ct. </em>2078, 2081-82, 124 L.Ed.2d 182, 189 (1993), where Justice Scalia, speaking for the Court, concerning the proper harmless error analysis, wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-7\"><em>Chapman </em>itself suggests the answer. Consistent with the jury-trial guarantee, the question it instructs the reviewing court to consider is not what effect the constitutional error might generally be expected to have upon a reasonable jury, but rather what effect it had upon the guilty verdict in the case at hand. Harmless-error review looks, we have said, to the basis on which \u201cthe jury <em>actually rested </em>its verdict.\u201d The inquiry, in other words, is not whether, in a trial that occurred without the error, a guilty verdict would surely have been rendered, but whether the guilty verdict actually rendered in <em>this </em>trial was surely unattributable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>to the error. That must be so, because to hypothesize a guilty verdict that was never in fact rendered-no matter how inescapable the findings to support that verdict might be-would violate the jury-trial guarantee, (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">And, finally, the Supreme Court confirmed its adoption of the contribution approach and its consequent rejection of the guilt-based analysis of harmless error in <em>O\u2019Neal v. McAninch, </em>513 <em>U.S. </em>432, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>992, 130 <em>L. </em>Ed.2d 947 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Our courts have likewise at various times employed language suggestive of both approaches. As noted, <em>Macon </em>rather clearly adopted the contribution analysis of <em>Chapman. See also Fahy v. Connecticut, </em>375 <em>U.S. </em>85, 86-87, 84 <em>S.Ct. </em>229, 230, 11 L.Ed.2d 171, 173 (1963) (\u201cThe question is whether there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction\u201d), discussed in <em>Macon, supra, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>at 339, 273 A.2d 1; <em>and State v. Johnson, </em>46 <em>N.J. </em>289, 291, 216 A.2d 392 (1966) (a <em>pre-Macon </em>decision, in which the Court said, with respect to an apparent non-constitutional error, \u201cthere must be an evaluation of its capacity for improper impact in the circumstances of a ease\u201d). In <em>State v. Bankston, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>263, 272, 307 A.2d 65 (1973), the Court spoke in terms of a contribution approach, noting that the trial court\u2019s instructions \u201cdid not remove the prejudicial effect of that testimony from the minds of the jury.\u201d Yet, only a few lines later the Court appeared to have conflated the two approaches, stating: \u2018We cannot say the proof was so overwhelming as to foreclose a real possibility that the jury gave decisive weight to the improper hearsay testimony.\u201d More recently, in addressing the cumulative impact of several instances of prosecutorial misconduct during trial, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-7\">Even if the evidence were overwhelming, that could never be a justifiable basis for depriving a defendant of his or her entitlement to a constitutionally guaranteed right to a fair trial. The impact of violating a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial cannot be measured by, or weighed against, the quantum of evidence bearing upon his or her guilt, (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-8\"><em>[State v. Frost, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>76, 87, 727 A.2d 1 (1999).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">Yet, later that same term, in <em>State v. Pepshi, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>490, 493, 745 A.2d 494 (1999), without any indication that it was consciously effecting a change in approach, the Court found certain non-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>constitutional error harmless \u201cin light of the overwhelming evidence of guilt and the innocuous nature of the testimony.\u201d <em>See also State v. Burton, </em>309 <em>N.J.Super. </em>280, 289, 706 A.2d 1181 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>407, 719 A.2d 639 (1998) (\u201cevidence of defendant\u2019s guilt was overwhelming\u201d); <em>State v. Guzman, </em>313 <em>N.J.Super. </em>363, 383, 712 A.2d 1233 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>156 <em>N.J. 424, </em>719 A.2d 1022 (1998) (Observing that \u201c[t]he State presented overwhelming evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt independent of [co-defendant\u2019s] statements [to police]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Despite the sometimes inconsistent language, we conclude that, at least for constitutional errors, the correct approach seeks a determination of \u201cwhat should have (as opposed to what did) or should not have (as opposed to what did not) influenced a jury in any given case. When so viewed, the analysis becomes less an exercise in judicial intuition, or second-guessing, and more of a reasoned application of a set of rules to a given fact pattern which ultimately results in the decision that the case will or will not be reversed.\u201d Sweeney, <em>supra, </em>at 282. We acknowledge that the contribution approach is not always an easy path to follow when, as here, there is overwhelming untainted evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt. \u201cIndeed, [o]nly through a determined adherence to principle do we look beyond the weight of the evidence to the likely impact of an error.\u201d Edwards, <em>supra, </em>at 1192.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Notwithstanding the strength of the State\u2019s evidence, and the implausibility of defendant\u2019s explanation concerning his sexually suggestive letter to P.T., this case still turned on credibility. Having made the determination to testify, defendant was entitled to have his credibility judged by the jury without any improperly received evidence weighting the scales against him. Defendant\u2019s admission that he \u201cfondled\u201d the girls was just this type of proof. It strongly corroborated the victim\u2019s testimony and may have been an important factor in the jury\u2019s findings of guilt. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Fulminante:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-8\">A confession is like no other evidence. Indeed, \u201cthe defendant\u2019s own confession is probably the most probative and damaging evidence that can be admitted against him ... [T]he admissions of a defendant come from the actor himself, the most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>knowledgeable and unimpeachable source of information about his past conduct. Certainly, confessions have profound impact on the jury, so much so that we may justifiably doubt its ability to put them out of mind even if told to do so.\u201d <em>[Fulminante, supra, </em>at 499 <em>U.S. </em>at 296, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1257, 113 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 322 (quoting <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 <em>U.S. </em>123, 139-40, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>1620, 1629-30, 20 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>476, 487 (1968) (White, J. dissenting)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">As one commentator has noted, confessions are known to have a \u201cprofound effect\u201d on juries, possessing \u201cthe potential to completely undermine the defense.\u201d Renfro, <em>supra, </em>at 590. \u201c[Ijnculpatory remarks by a defendant have a tendency to resolve jurors\u2019 doubts about a defendant\u2019s guilt to his detriment.\u201d <em>State v. McCloskey, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>18, 31, 446 A.2d 1201 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">Thus, we find ourselves unable to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant\u2019s admission did not contribute to his conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 32, 446 A.2d 1201; <em>State v. Bankston, supra, </em>63 <em>N.J. </em>at 273, 307 A.2d 65; <em>State v. Macon, supra, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>at 340, 273 A.2d 1; <em>United States v. Walton, supra, </em>10 F.3d at 1032-34. The fact that defendant was found not guilty on some counts, suggesting that the jury did not rush to judgment, does not undermine our conclusion. We do not know the basis for the not guilty findings and cannot speculate; the \u201cbottom line\u201d remains that defendant was found guilty on most charges and his damning admission likely played a part in his conviction. Indeed, the jury\u2019s attention was specifically directed to defendant\u2019s statements in the course of the instructions. Nor does defendant\u2019s vague statement, that he was guilty on \u201csome of the charges\u201d in the complaint but not others, eradicate the harm flowing from his specific admission of fondling, which the prosecutor emphasized in her summation as constituting strong corroboration of P.T.\u2019s testimony. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">On retrial, defendant\u2019s admission of \u201cfondling\u201d is deemed inadmissible and may not be used for any purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">Defendant attacks the admissibility of five segments of trial testimony relating what is claimed to be \u201cfresh complaint\u201d evidence on the part of P.T. of S.A.T. We agree that some of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>testimony was inadmissible, but conclude that it either did not rise to the level of \u201cplain error,\u201d <em>R. </em>2:10-2, or was harmless error under the circumstances of the case. <em>See State v. Macon, supra, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>at 337-39, 273 A.2d 1. We will address each area in turn and then deal with the impact of any improperly admitted evidence on the trial. First, however, we briefly discuss the parameters governing the admission of such testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The fresh complaint doctrine permits proof that a victim of sexual assault complained of the assault within a reasonable time to someone the victim would normally turn to for sympathy, protection and advice. <em>State v. Hill, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>150, 163, 578 A.2d 370 (1990); <em>State v. Tirone, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>222, 226, 314 A.2d 601 (1974); <em>State v. Scherzer, </em>301 <em>N.J.Super. </em>363, 419, 694 A.2d 196 (App.Div.) <em>certif. denied, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>466, 700 A.2d 878 (1997); <em>State v. J.S., 222 N.J.Super. </em>247, 252, 536 A.2d 769 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>589, 546 A.2d 514 (1988). The evidence is permitted to forestall the assumption that no assault occurred because no complaint was made. <em>State v. Balles, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>331, 338, 221 A.2d 1 (1966), <em>cert. denied and appeal-dismissed, </em>388 <em>U.S. </em>461, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>2120, 18 <em>L. Ed.2d </em>1321 (1967); <em>Scherzer, supra, </em>301 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 419, 694 A.2d 196; <em>J.S., supra, </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 252, 536 A.2d 769. Consistent with the rationale for its admissibility, which is to show only that a complaint was made, no details of the complaint are admissible. <em>Hill, supra, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>at 163, 578 A.2d 370. However, details of the complaint may be permitted to rehabilitate a witness after impeachment to show that statements were made after the incident consistent with the witness\u2019s trial testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 165, 578 A.2d 370; <em>N.J.R.E. </em>607; <em>see also, </em>Buinno, <em>Current N.J. Rules of Evid., </em>comment 4 to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>607 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">While statements about the sexual assault must be reasonably contemporaneous, that requirement has been given a flexible application when the victim is a minor. <em>State v. Bethune, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>137, 143, 578 A.2d 364 (1990). Thus, even a substantial lapse of time between the assault and the complaint may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>permissible if satisfactorily explainable by the age of the victim and the circumstances surrounding the making of the complaint. For example, in <em>State v. Hummel, </em>132 <em>N.J.Super. </em>412, 423, 334 A.2d 52 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>102, 335 A.2d 54 (1975), a period of three years between assault and complaint was allowed where the fifteen-year-old victim had been repeatedly raped over a three-year period and had just been removed from her abuser, thereby freeing her from the bonds of a paralyzing fear. The remoteness of the complaint from the abuse was found to affect only the probative value, not the competency, of the evidence. <em>Ibid.; see also State v. Balles, supra, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>at 341, 221 A.2d 1. Flexible application of the doctrine to children\u2019s complaints is recognized as a necessity since children are especially vulnerable to being cajoled or coerced by their abusers into remaining silent; they may be too frightened or embarrassed to reveal the abuse. <em>State v. Bethune, supra, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>at 143-44, 578 A.2d 364; <em>State v. Kozarski, </em>143 <em>N.J.Super. </em>12, 16, 362 A.2d 598 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>532, 366 A.2d 687 (1976); <em>Hummel, supra, </em>132 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 423, 334 A.2d 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">In addition to being reasonably contemporaneous, the complaint must be both spontaneous and voluntary, factors which may be negated if the complaint results from interrogation. <em>See State v. Bethune, supra, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>at 144, 578 A.2d 364; <em>State v. Tirone, supra, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>at 226-27, 314 A.2d 601; <em>People v. Hood, </em>59 Ill.2d 315, 319 <em>N.E.2d </em>802, 809 (1974) (complaint elicited by question from friends as to \u201cwhat had happened\u201d qualifies as excited utterance); <em>People v. Damen, </em>28 <em>Ill.2d </em>464,193 <em>N.E.2d. 25, </em>30 (1963) (complaint elicited by question \u201cwhat happened?\u201d held admissible); <em>People v. Evans, </em>173 <em>Ill.App.3d </em>186, 122 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>950, 527 <em>N.E.2d </em>448, 458 (1988) (complaint made in response to questions such as \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d and \u201cDid he do something to you?\u201d is admissible because the questions were non-eoercive); <em>State v. Stevens, </em>289 N.W.2d 592, 594-96 (Iowa 1980) (victim\u2019s complaint of having been raped, made in response to a friend\u2019s general inquiry about what was -wrong, was admissible).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Frequently, juvenile sexual assault victims do not spontaneously tell of the assault without, being prompted by questions. <em>See State v. Bethune, 121 N.J. </em>at 144, 578 A.2d 364. \u201cBecause the child has no clear understanding of what has been done to her, her \u2018original complaint\u2019 often consists of responses to the questioning of a patient, persistent adult who draws the child\u2019s story from her.\u201d <em>Ibid.; accord State v. D.R., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>348, 359-60, 537 A.2d 667 (1988); <em>State v. Kozarski, supra, </em>143 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 16-17, 362 A.2d 598. Thus, non-coercive questions do not rob a complaint of its admissibility under the \u201cfresh complaint\u201d rule. <em>See State v. Hill, supra, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>at 167, 578 A.2d 370; <em>Bethune, supra, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>at 144, 578 A.2d 364. To determine whether a statement is in response to non-coercive questioning, trial courts must consider the age of the child, the child\u2019s relationship with the interviewer, the circumstances under which the interrogation takes place, whether the child initiated the discussion, the type of questions asked, whether they were leading, and their specificity regarding the alleged abuser and the acts alleged. <em>See State v. Bethune, supra, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>at 145, 578 A.2d 364. <em>See also State v. Michaels, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>299, 308, 642 A.2d 1372 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">The first item challenged is P.T.\u2019s statement to C.L. after C.L. found defendant\u2019s highly suggestive letter in her room. The incident took place on either March 19 or 20, 1998, just a day or two after P.T.\u2019s mother had moved out of the house. At that point, C.L. had already become the paramour of P.T.\u2019s father. As C.L. testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">I was saying good night to [P.T.! down in her room. There was a piece of paper on the floor folded up and I picked it up and threw it on her dresser and I said next time pick your stuff off the floor and she said you can read it if you want to. I said no, it\u2019s not mine. She said but I want you to. I opened up the piece of paper and I read it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-8\">Q: And what was the piece of paper?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-9\">A: It was a page written by [defendant! to P.T.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-10\">Q: With regard to the letter what did you do after you read it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-11\">A: I closed my mouth, folded the piece of paper up and stuck it in my back pocket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>Q: What happened next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-5\">A: [P.T.] asked me if I was mad at her. She told me not to say anything to her father and I said we\u2019ll talk about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">Q: And did she then go to sleep at night or at least did you put her to bed? A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-7\">Q: Did you say anything to her father that evening?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-8\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-9\">Q: The next morning did you have a chance to speak with P.T.?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-10\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-11\">Q: When you spoke with P.T. the next morning, ... did she tell you that [defendant] had touched her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-12\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-13\">Q: After speaking with her what did you do next?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-14\">A: I sent P.T. to her friend\u2019s house. SA.T. and her boyfriend were at the house. I called S.A.T. up to the bedroom to ask her how to approach her father since she knew [him] better than I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-15\">Q: Who do you mean \u201capproach her father?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-16\">A: How to tell her father about this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-17\">Q: And you say you called S.A.T. upstairs. Was there anyone else with you other than you and S.A.T.?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-18\">A: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-19\">Q: What happened at that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-20\">A: I started asking her what she thought of [defendant] and she told me____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-21\">Q: What did S.A.T. say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-22\">A: She mentioned that [defendant] was touching her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-23\">P.T.\u2019s testimony about the incident was generally consistent. She stated that she told C.L. \u201cwhat [the letter] was about and what had happened and what\u2019s been going on.\u201d She told C.L. \u201cthat [defendant] had raped me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-24\">Although the exact dates are unclear, it appears that defendant\u2019s last act of sexual abuse on P.T. took place in close proximity to the date of the complaint, March 1998.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> P.T. had previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>spoken of defendant\u2019s conduct to her mother who had ignored her complaints, perhaps not unexpectedly since the mother had an ongoing sexual relationship with defendant. P.T. did not feel she could confide in her father since he had an explosive temper. C.L., on the other hand, had been living in the house with P.T. and had assumed a parental role. Significantly, it was almost immediately after P.T.\u2019s mother left the house that she confided in C.L. upon discovery of the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Under the circumstances, we conclude that P.T.\u2019s statement to C.L. fell within the fresh complaint doctrine even though it resulted from an inadvertent discovery and some non-coercive questioning. The statement was reasonably contemporaneous and was both spontaneous and voluntary, considering P.T.\u2019s age and the entire set of circumstances related above.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">We reach a contrai\u2019y conclusion, however, concerning S.A.T.\u2019s statement to C.L., the second of the challenged fresh complaint statements. The act of sexual abuse involving S.A.T. allegedly took place six years earlier, sometime in 1992. At the time the statement was made, S.A.T. was no longer living in the family residence and it does not appear that her relationship with C.L. was such as to promote a spontaneous confidential communication. Indeed, the statement was made in response to questioning about the letter from defendant to P.T. However, the statement made by S.A.T. was that defendant \u201cwas touching her,\u201d that she had experienced incidents similar to that of P.T. involving a \u201csexual assault, sexual abuse\u201d by defendant. In light of the timing and circumstances of this revelation, indeed the very same considerations that make it inadmissible, as well as the jury\u2019s acquittal of defendant on the most serious charge involving S.A.T., we conclude that the error in admitting S.A.T.\u2019s statement to C.L. in 1998 was harmless, not only as to the allegations involving S.A.T. herself, but as to P.T. as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">The third category of statements were those made by P.T. to her school counselor and to Investigator Bandies. P.T. testified that she spoke with the school counselor the day after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>talking with C.L. and \u201ctold her some of the story.\u201d Less than a week later, Bandies and an unnamed DYFS investigator came to P.T.\u2019s school and took a tape-recorded statement about the allegations. No details were provided. No objection was raised to this testimony, thus requiring a plain error analysis. <em>R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Clearly, the investigatory interview with Bandies could not constitute fresh complaint evidence. However, we fail to see how any prejudice came about as a result of this testimony. Everyone, including jurors, are aware that interviews of alleged victims by police are routine.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The discussion with the school therapist is a closer question, but one we need not resolve. Here again, we find any error to be harmless given its totally innocuous nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">The fourth area challenged as improper fresh complaint was testimony by S.A.T. as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-8\">I met with Allan Bandies and I gave him my statement and then I also met with [P.T.]\u2019s counselor \u2018cause [P.T.] had brought out everything that happened to her and I told [the school counselor], which was [P.TJ\u2019s counselor at the time, the incident with me so [P.T.] would feel comfortable giving her incidents to [the counselor].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-9\">Q: Did you have the occasion to speak with your sister, [P.T.], by yourself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-10\">A: After [C.L.] told me about it, after we met with [the counselor] that evening, we came home, she goes, you know, I didn\u2019t tell [the counselor] everything. I said why not. She said I was afraid to. I said when do you plan on bringing the rest out? If you come down to my bedroom with me I\u2019ll tell you. That\u2019s what I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-11\">Q: And the two of you talked about the thing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-12\">A: We talked about her incidents and then she says if you don\u2019t want to tell me you don\u2019t have to but did anything happen between you and [defendant] and I told her. I told her so it would make her feel more comfortable saying things.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-13\">Q: Did it appear to you that she did not know that something had happened to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-14\">A: She never knew. She said oh, I didn\u2019t know that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-15\">Q: What was her demeanor when she was telling you about the things that happened to her?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-16\">A: She was very shy, very quiet about it. I think she was scared to bring it out. It took her a while to bring out everything. You know, she leaked out a little <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>bit here, a little bit there, and finally I think once she met with Allan Bandies, the investigating prosecutor, she felt a little bit better. That\u2019s when everything came out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Even though the discussion between S.A.T. and P.T. was preceded by P.T.\u2019s revelation to C.L. and by S.A.T.\u2019s conversation with C.L., we are inclined to view the testimony as permissible fresh complaint, particularly in the absence of any detail. In this instance, as well, the jury\u2019s verdict of acquittal on the two counts, one involving P.T. and one dealing with S.A.T., persuades us that any error would not meet the plain error standard, and would, in any event, constitute harmless error, assuming there is a difference between the two concepts. <em>See State v. Macon, supra, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>at 335 341, 273 A.2d 1. Here again, our conclusion applies to the charges concerning both P.T. and S.A.T.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">The fifth and final segment of testimony challenged was that of Dr. Shaw who examined P.T., apparently at the request of DYFS. Dr. Shaw related P.T. \u201cindicated to me that the kind of sexual abuse she was alleging included penile to genital area touching.\u201d Defendant also did not object to this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">Dr. Shaw is the pediatric medical director of the Child Sexual Abuse program of the Dorothy B. Hirsch Child Protection Center, which serves seven counties in central New Jersey. She is also an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey and Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. In addition, Dr. Shaw is a consultant to the Division of Youth and Family Service and does \u201ca lot of telephone consultation and case consultation with DYFS workers when they call for help.\u201d She testified in court as an expert \u201conce every two months for the last ten years,\u201d the majority of times for the prosecution. Shaw examined P.T. in April 1998. As she explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-9\">[P.T.] was alleging that she had been sexually abused so that she was referred to us for our services. Our services generally include an assessment of whether the family is seeking counseling for themselves or their child, sort of crisis intervention, because most families are in crisis at the time this is being looked into and our purpose is to do medical visits to try to answer questions for kids or for the parents, try to address any concerns about pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, damage to the body.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>Shaw claimed that P.T. presented for \u201call three\u201d reasons and, as a result, was seen \u201cfor treatment and diagnosis.\u201d The medical history, including the sexual abuse allegation, was taken in furtherance of that purpose. As she stated, \u201cI asked some specific questions that I thought would help me to decide what I needed to do.\u201d P.T. told Shaw \u201cthat the kind of sexual abuse she was alleging included penile to genital area touching.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Shaw denied that the exam was undertaken for forensic purposes. The results of the examination revealed \u201cnothing abnormal,\u201d no \u201csuggestion either of a sexually transmitted infection, or any suggestion of something looking abnormal on the examination of the genital and the anal area.\u201d Nevertheless, the doctor testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-6\">Q: Based on your experience and in your opinion is that finding a normal finding consistent with her history that she had given to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-7\">A: Oh, yes. The majority of girls that I see that have said there\u2019s been some touching of them genital area by a penis have no sexually transmitted disease nor do they have any abnormal findings of the tissues of that area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-8\">Q: You say touching. Would that change if it was penile penetration?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-9\">A: Well, penile penetration just means that the penis is put between the outside genitals of the area so, no, that answer would not change by using the word penetration of the genital area or the girl\u2019s female area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-10\">Q: So in a sense the majority of girls them findings are not abnormal in the examination?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-11\">A: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-12\">Q: Would that change if I set up a hypothetical to you that sexual penetration or penile penetration occurred over many years approximately ten to fifteen times each year?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-13\">A: No. I often hear that and have examined many girls that have said they\u2019ve had ongoing penetration. They\u2019re not usually using that word but the word meaning that the penis has been placed in that vaginal area many times, and that doesn\u2019t necessarily change my opinion as to that looking normal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-14\">Q: How about with regard, and you mentioned this, to the last incident. Is that also a factor with regard to a finding of any abnormal finding so to speak?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-15\">A: As I mentioned if there had been acute sexual assaults, meaning acute sort of within the last couple of days, there might be some if someone had ejaculated, there might be a chance of finding something on the child\u2019s body. Perhaps if someone had rubbed that area vigorously and it were red that might last several days. If there had been something that had been sort of irritated and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>left it red or sort of like a minor abrasion of that area that might be present, so those are more likely to be seen closed in time to an act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-6\">Q: Okay. So if there was a period of a number of months you may not be able to find indications such as that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">A: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-8\">Q: How about with regard to the age of the victim, does that change the hypothetical? If these incidents happened over a period when the child was 8 and up until 13 or 14 years of age, and a number of months after the last incident the child sees you, would that change in the age of the child having to do with findings?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-9\">A: Well, children as they go through puberty, that is, as girls, for example, begin their menstrual period, prior to menstruating they have some changes of the tissue of the genital area called the hymenal tissue that shows the effect of estrogen and it changes pretty drastically so that many of us in this medical field believe that if there had been some very minor glitch or abnormality of the hymen that was there before they went through puberty it might be difficult to see after the hormonal changes of puberty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-10\">Q: Am I correct, and I\u2019ll let you answer this, it\u2019s normal for her examination to have been normal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-11\">A: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-12\">There was no objection to any of this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-13\">Defendant is correct that admission of Dr. Shaw\u2019s testimony cannot be sustained as fresh complaint evidence. Indeed, the State appears to agree, arguing that it was nevertheless admissible under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(4), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-14\">Statements for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment. Statements made in good faith for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment which describe medical history, or past or present symptoms, pain, or sensations, or the inception or general character of the cause or external source thereof to the extent that the statements are reasonably pertinent to diagnosis or treatment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-15\">There is no doubt that if the examination by Dr. Shaw was conducted for evidence gathering purposes, the hearsay statements contained in the medical history would be inadmissible as not falling within this rule. <em>State in Interest of C.A., </em>201 <em>N.J.Super. </em>28, 33-34, 492 A.2d 683 (App.Div.1985). The record is not entirely clear as to why P.T. was referred to Dr. Shaw for examination. On the present record, and in recognition of it being the State\u2019s burden to establish admissibility, we conclude that the doctor\u2019s testimony was not admissible under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(c)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>We also cannot conclude that the inadmissible testimony was harmless error, particularly when its impact is assessed together with defendant\u2019s erroneously admitted statement. The history taken and related by the doctor included P.T.\u2019s statement that she had been subjected to \u201cpenile to genital area touching.\u201d While the court instructed the jury that fresh complaint evidence does not constitute proof \u201cthat the sexual offense actually occurred or that [P.T.] or [S.A.T.] is credible or not credible,\u201d the instruction went on in some detail to explain the proper purpose for which fresh complaint evidence is admitted. The problem is that, as we have concluded, Dr.Shaw\u2019s testimony was not fresh complaint evidence. Indeed, there is no indication that the jury understood Dr. Shaw\u2019s testimony as being part of the fresh complaint evidence. Rather, the jury may have accepted her recitation of P.T.\u2019s history as being part and parcel of her expert opinion which the jury was instructed to evaluate on its own terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">In her summation, the prosecutor again stressed P.T.\u2019s statement to Dr. Shaw (mischaracterized as being that defendant \u201cput his penis inside of her\u201d), as constituting additional corroboration of P.T.\u2019s testimony, just as she had done with respect to defendant\u2019s fondling admission. In any event, we need not determine whether this evidence standing alone would warrant reversal since, as noted, we have determined that a new trial is required because of the improper admission of defendant\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">We do not rule that Dr. Shaw\u2019s testimony in its entirety was inadmissible, only that part relating to the specifics of the sexual abuse as alleged by P.T. Dr. Shaw\u2019s expert testimony as to whether her negative physical examination of P.T. was consistent with the abuse testified to by P.T. was and remains acceptable. Of course, as with any expert, the jury must be instructed that to the extent the expert\u2019s testimony depends upon other testimony or upon a hypothetical state of facts supported by the evidence, it is for the jury to decide if the predicate facts are true; if the underlying facts are not believed, then the expert\u2019s opinion based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>on those facts carries diminished weight. In fact, the trial judge gave such a standard expert witness charge in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">As a result of our disposition, there is no need to address defendant\u2019s arguments as to ineffectiveness of trial counsel, or with respect to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b285-11\"> <em>Miranda v.
