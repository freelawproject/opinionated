When the charge was investigated, Jones denied the allegations, stating: \u201cIt\u2019s all a fabrication. I never threatened him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">The required disciplinary hearing was convened on November 13, but was postponed when Jones invoked his right to confront and cross-examine his accuser, Panichelli, as well as his need for a witness statement from another correctional officer, Tyson, who, Jones asserted, had been an eyewitness to the incident. The hearing reconvened two days later, on November 15, but was postponed again, pending compliance with the hearing officer\u2019s requirement that Jones submit written confrontation questions for Panichelli. When the matter reconvened on November 16, it was postponed further, pending receipt of Panichelli\u2019s written responses to the questions submitted by Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">The merits of the matter were addressed on November 19. The hearing officer reviewed the written disciplinary charge that Panichelli had filed. The specifications alleged that, during a routine search of Jones\u2019s locker, Panichelli had found a tape dispenser and pink highlighter, which he \u201cseized as contraband.\u201d The written form went on to allege that Jones responded with an epithet and a threat of physical violence the next time Panichelli examined his locker. The charge also specified that Jones, about three feet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>away from Panichelli, raised his fists toward the officer\u2019s face. In addition to the written charge, the hearing officer also reviewed two reports bearing upon the \u201ccontraband,\u201d two others dealing with preliminary procedures, two \u201cescort reports,\u201d and a report from the prison nurse.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Jones presented a defense with the assistance of a \u201ccounsel substitute.\u201d Jones testified to a different version of events than Panichelli had reported. He argued, as well, that the various reports and statements considered by the hearing officer were inconsistent, and that Panichelli had filed a false report. The record and the hearing officer\u2019s \u201cadjudication of disciplinary charge\u201d disclose that the evidence Jones sought to elicit from Panichelli was presented in the form of written questions and answers, and that the evidence from Tyson was in the form of a written statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Relying on this evidentiary record, the hearing officer sustained the charge. She determined specifically that Panichelli\u2019s report was credible and that there \u201cwas no reason for [him] to fabricate [the] charge.\u201d The hearing officer recommended a sanction of detention for fifteen days with credit for time served, 180 days of administrative segregation, and loss of 180 days of commutation time. On internal review, the administrative segregation sanction was modified with a suspension of sixty days of the time initially ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">On appeal, Jones raises a single issue: that he \u201cshould have been afforded the opportunity to confront and cross-examine [the] officer filing a charge against him, and an opportunity to question the witness for him.\u201d He argues that when face-to-face confrontation and cross-examination were denied, he \u201cwasn\u2019t able to fully defend himself.\u201d The Department of Corrections (Department) argues in response that the hearing officer\u2019s decision should be affirmed because the procedure employed \u201ccomported with all procedural due process requirements and the finding of guilt is supported by substantial, credible evidence.\u201d We reject the Department\u2019s argument and reverse, remanding for a new hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>that reflects recognition of Jones\u2019s due process right to confrontation and cross-examination, and of his litigation right to witness access.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Where a party\u2019s opportunity to develop and present evidence supporting his challenge to charges filed against him has been unduly curtailed, there can be no determination that the requirements of the substantial evidence rule have been satisfied. Application of the substantial evidence rule presupposes an adequate opportunity by the party against whom a decision has been rendered to have marshalled and offered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">With allowances for the special rule that due process rights in prison disciplinary proceedings may be tailored to meet the needs of the institutional context in which such proceedings arise, prison inmates may not be deprived of basic due process protections. <em>See Avant v. Clifford, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>496, 525, 341 A.2d 629 (1975)(citing <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. </em>539, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">The opportunities to confront one\u2019s accusers and cross-examine them, and to develop one\u2019s own proofs, are basic protections in our system of adjudication, <em>Chambers v. Mississippi, </em>410 <em>U.S. </em>284, 294, 93 <em>S.Ct. </em>1038, 1045, 35 L.Ed.2d 297, 308 (1973), especially in matters with penal qualities, <em>State v. P.H., </em>353 <em>N.J.Super. </em>527, 537, 803 A.2d 661 (App.Div.2002), and specifically in prison inmate disciplinary proceedings. <em>See McDonald, v. Pinchak, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>188, 196-99, 652 A.2d 700 (1995); <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:4-9.13(a), -9.14(a). Although such basic rights may be waived, or limited in prison inmate disciplinary matters as compelling considerations of the specific case or legitimate institutional needs may suggest, they cannot be denied or limited in any way that dilutes them to the vanishing point. <em>See Wakefield v. Pinchak, </em>289 <em>N.J.Super. </em>566, 571-72, 674 A.2d 621 (App.Div.1996), <em>certif. denied, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>677, 762 A.2d 658 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">The purpose of the confrontation right is to guarantee \u201ca meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.\u201d <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number><em>Budis, </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>519, 531, 593 A.2d 784 (1991)(quoting <em>Crane v. Kentucky, </em>476 <em>U.S. </em>683, 690, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>2142, 2146, 90 L.Ed.2d 636, 645 (1986)). Likewise, the correlative right of cross-examination is designed to afford a party the opportunity to \u201cface [his] accusersQ and to cross-examine the State\u2019s witnesses.\u201d <em>Budis, supra, </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>at 530-31, 593 A.2d 784 (quoting <em>Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, </em>480 <em>U.S. </em>39, 51, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>989, 998, 94 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>40, 53 (1987)). And further, testimonial access to witnesses in the control of the opposing side, is a basic litigation right. <em>See State v. Varona, </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>474, 485, 577 A.2d 524 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>386, 585 A.2d 389 (1990)(citing <em>Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, supra, </em>480 <em>U.S. </em>at 56, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1001, 94 L.Ed.2d at 56-57).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">When Jones was denied in-person confrontation and cross-examination in respect of Paniehelli, his accuser, he was deprived of the fundamental opportunity to develop his defense by revealing the weaknesses in the accusation against him either on the basis of the accuser\u2019s credibility or otherwise. The hearing officer\u2019s decision was based on a credibility finding favorable to Paniehelli. It was a determination that could not be fairly reached without affording Jones the opportunity to address the credibility issue effectively. <em>See Avant, supra, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>at 530, 341 A.2d 629. And, the hearing examiner failed to make the findings mandated by rule before that right could be curtailed. <em>See N.J.AC. </em>10A:4-9.14(b) (requiring, as a prerequisite to denying confrontation and cross-examination, a finding that the exercise of these rights \u201cwould be unduly hazardous to correctional facility safety or goals\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">As a general matter in our system of adjudication, in-person confrontation and cross-examination have traditionally been regarded as the best ways to test credibility. <em>Miller v. Henderson, </em>41 <em>N.J.Super. </em>15, 25, 124 A.2d 23 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, 22 N.J. </em>229, 125 A.2d 441 (1956). We have previously applied that principle to inmate disciplinary proceedings, <em>see Decker v. Department of Corrections, </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>353, 359-60, 751 A.2d 1094 (App.Div.2000), and we now reaffirm that view. <em>See also Daley v. Department of Corrections, </em>331 <em>N.J.Super. </em>344, 751 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>A.2d 1089 (App.Div.2000). Nothing substitutes for the trier of fact\u2019s opportunity, in measuring truth or falsity, to view the witness\u2019s demeanor in presenting his allegations. <em>See State v. Smith, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>376, 385, 730 A.2d 311 (1999)(citing <em>Maryland v. Craig, </em>497 <em>U.S. </em>836, 846,110 <em>S.Ct. </em>3157, 3163, 111 L.Ed.2d 666, 678 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Moreover, when Jones was denied access to the testimony of an alleged eyewitness, Tyson, for the purpose of probing the accuracy of the charge, he was denied what every litigant is due. Here also, the hearing examiner failed to meet the requirements of governing regulations in denying that litigation right. <em>See N.J.A.C. </em>10A:4-9.13(a) (also requiring a finding that exercise of the opportunity \u201cto call witnesses and present documentary evidence ... will not be unduly hazardous to correctional facility safety or goals,\u201d and a specific statement of \u201cthe reasons for each such refusal ... on the Adjudication of Disciplinary Report form\u201d); <em>See also McDonald, supra, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>at 196-97, 652 A.2d 700. To the extent the \u201cevidence\u201d from Tyson, <em>ie., </em>his written statement, informed the findings and conclusion reached by the hearing <em>examiner, </em>those determinations are flawed. This is not to say that a hearing officer in a prison disciplinary proceeding may not rely on written reports in support of other evidence properly admitted. The residuum rule permits such use in administrative proceedings, <em>see N.J.A.C. </em>1:1-15.5(b), with the inherent reservation that some legally admissible evidence must be at the basis of every finding. <em>See Weston v. State, </em>60 <em>N.J. </em>36, 51, 286 A.2d 43 (1972). Nevertheless, where an inmate seeks access to an eyewitness in a reasonable attempt to rebut the charge made against him, that effort must be indulged. <em>See McDonald, supra, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>at 196-97, 652 A.2d 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">We have previously held that inmates in prison disciplinary proceedings, like other litigants, are entitled to \u201ca fair opportunity to prepare a defense,\u201d <em>Wakefield, supra, </em>289 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 571, 674 A.2d 621 (citing <em>Wolff </em>and Avant), and that every inmate has an enforceable \u201cinterest[] in a fair hearing,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 574, 674 A.2d 621 (citing <em>Avant). </em>We discern no basis rooted in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>special needs of this inmate\u2019s situation or any recognizable interests of the prison\u2019s authorities, and certainly none grounded on general principles, for considering this case to embody an exception to fundamental due process requirements and litigation standards applying to all. <em>See id. </em>at 570, 574, 674 A.2d 621. The hearing examiner provided no basis, as required by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10A:4-9.13 and 9.14, for any such conclusion. A proceeding in which the right of confrontation and cross-examination has been unduly curtailed, or the accused unreasonably limited in his access to witnesses in his favor, lacks both the form and substance of a fair hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The Department\u2019s inability to comply with its due process obligations as specifically defined by <em>Avant, McDonald, Wakefield, Daley, Decker, </em>and other cases is distressing. If that shortcoming is unremedied in the future, the result may come to be outright reversal of the matters at hand without any provision for remand for new hearings. We will not mandate so draconian a remedy at this time, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
