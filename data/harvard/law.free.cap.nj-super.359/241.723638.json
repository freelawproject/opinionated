Three involved cocaine, and three involved heroin. They were, with respect to each substance: possession, possession with intent to distribute, and possession within 1,000 feet of a school with intent to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">The charges were tried to a jury, which acquitted defendant of the school zone offenses and convicted him on the remaining four charges. After mergers were effected, defendant was sentenced, on February 9, 2001, to two concurrent four-year prison terms with 188 days of jail credit. The customary assessments, penalties and fines were ordered. Defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was suspended for twelve months.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-12\">On appeal, defendant raises the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-13\"><em>POINT I </em>THE PROSECUTOR\u2019S INTRODUCTION INTO EVIDENCE OF THE DEFENDANT\u2019S LACK OF EMPLOYMENT AND HER COMMENT IN SUMMATION WHICH INFERRED THAT THIS GAVE THE DEFENDANT A MOTIVE TO COMMIT THE CRIME, DENIED THE DEFEN<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>DANT HIS STATE AND FEDERAL CONSTITUTIONAL BIGHTS TO DUE PROCESS OF LAW AND A FAIR TRIAL. <em>(U.S. CONST. </em>AMENDS. V, VI AND XIV; <em>N.J. CONST </em>(1947), ART. I, PARS. 1, 9 AND 10) (Partially Raised Below).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-6\"><em>POINT II </em>THE HIGHLY PREJUDICIAL REMARK BY DETECTIVE MARTINEZ, TO WHICH THE TRIAL COURT SUSTAINED DEFENDANT\u2019S OBJECTION BUT FAILED TO DELIVER A CURATIVE JURY INSTRUCTION, VIOLATED DEFENDANT\u2019S DUE PROCESS RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL. <em>(U.S. CONST. </em>AMEND. XIV; <em>N.J. CONST </em>(1947), ART. I, PAR. 1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Because of unremediated prejudice in the evidence as presented to the jury, we reverse the two convictions for possession with intent to distribute. Because the evidence to which we refer did not bear upon the simple possession charges, we affirm as to those convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">The drugs and $965 in cash were discovered on defendant\u2019s person when he was searched incident to an arrest on a warrant. At the commencement of trial, before the jury was empanelled, defendant moved to suppress that evidence. An evidentiary hearing was held, and the trial judge determined that both the arrest and the search had been valid. Accordingly, he denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">The next day, the officer who had executed the warrant, Detective Nicholas Martinez of the East Orange Police Department, testified before the jury. He began, naturally, by establishing the circumstances. At the court\u2019s express behest after defense counsel had alerted a problem, the detective had been instructed by the assistant prosecutor assigned to the case to avoid mentioning in his testimony any particulars of the arrest warrant. Nevertheless, the detective testified that, as part of his duties, he was assigned to the F.B.I. Violent Crimes Fugitive Task Force and that one of his functions was to receive requests for assistance from \u201clocal detectives\u201d for locating \u201can individual who\u2019s wanted for a violent erime[.]\u201d Defense counsel objected, and, in a sidebar conference, the trial court, invoking <em>N.J.R.E. </em>403, ruled that the use of the term \u201cviolent crime\u201d was prejudicial to defendant with no offsetting probative value. The judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>... I will accept the objection----I would only highlight [the response to the last question] if I told the jury to disregard that nature of it. But at this time, ... I will instruct you not to ... ask the question and have him respond ... where he uses the [term] violence ... in regard ... to his previous arrest, warrant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-7\">... I don\u2019t want him to refer to violent crimes anymore.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">Defense counsel, apparently agreeing as a tactical consideration with the judge\u2019s evaluation that a curative instruction would only emphasize the inappropriate reference, did not request that such an instruction be given. If a request for curative action had been lodged, the judge would undoubtedly have acceded. In the circumstances, therefore, we regard the issue raised in this connection to furnish no adequate grounds for reversing the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">We have quite another sense with regard to the remaining issue and the manner in which it bears upon two of the convictions. When defendant was searched, twenty envelopes of heroin, ten vials of cocaine, and the $965 in cash were discovered. The cash consisted of two $100 bills,- twenty-eight $20 bills, eight $10 bills, fifteen $5 bills, and fifty $1 bills. At trial, the State made heavy weather of the quantity and packaging of the drugs, as well as the cash, as the predicates for the \u201cintent to distribute\u201d charges. Detective Martinez\u2019s testimony had established the seizure of the drugs and the cash, and the State\u2019s expert testified in support of the \u201cintent to distribute\u201d thesis.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">Not content with proofs of this quality, the assistant prosecutor introduced additional matter which had a clear capacity for undue prejudice. In cross-examining defendant\u2019s only witness \u2014 a close friend \u2014 the prosecutor, toward the end of her examination, asked the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-11\">Now, on May 3rd, 1999, from your relationship to knowing Rolando kind of like a neighborhood person, a brother, did he have a job?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">Defense counsel objected on relevance grounds and a sidebar conference ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-13\">THE COURT: ... [Wlhat\u2019s the relevancy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-14\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: The relevancy is that he had $965 in cash in his pocket when he was arrested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: But the inference is where did that cash come from ... \u2014 whether or not he\u2019s working.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-6\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: I mean, it\u2019s cross examination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-7\">THE COURT: ... I\u2019ll allow that on the basis of relevancy. $965 was being offered to show an intent to distribute or being a seller of drugs. Therefore, if she has knowledge of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Judge, ... I would just ask that she\u2019s restricted in the form of the question. I don\u2019t want the prosecutor testifying \u2014 the fact that he had $965 on him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-9\">[THE PROSECUTOR]: I\u2019m just going to ask this question. I can represent\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-10\">THE COURT: All right. All right. Fine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">The sidebar conference concluded; the question whether defendant was employed was repeated; it elicited a negative response; and no further questions were proffered to the witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-12\">In her summation, the prosecutor pressed the point of defendant\u2019s lack of a job, suggesting from that fact that the jury could draw an inference that the money found on defendant was the proceeds of drug sales. The prosecutor\u2019s argument included the following passage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-13\">* * * Why did Rolando Terrell possess these drugs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-14\">All the evidence shows that he possessed them with the intent to distribute as opposed to personal use. There\u2019s a lot of factors that you can consider when you think about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-15\">I would submit to you that first and primary foremost is money, nine hundred and sixty-five dollars is a lot of money for having in your pockets. <em>It\u2019s a lot of money to have in your pockets. You don\u2019t even have a job. </em>(emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-16\">He had nine hundred and sixty-five dollars in his pocket----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-17\">The facts, I submit your own common sense plus [the expert\u2019s] testimony shows that he was using it to sell it. The money is significant. The money is very, very significant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-18\">H[e] possessed illegal drugs, he possessed them with intent to distribute them, that\u2019s why he had them. That\u2019s why he had the money...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b273-19\">Both the question asked by the prosecutor and her use of the answer in making her arguments to the jury were violations of the principle of <em>State v. Mathis, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>455, 221 A.2d 529 (1966). We need say little more than to set out the pertinent excerpt from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Supreme Court\u2019s opinion containing its observations on the subject of questions about a defendant\u2019s employment or lack thereof where that is a collateral issue in the case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-5\">The prosecutor cross-examined defendant as to how much money he had and when he last worked. The examination suggested strongly that the State might be urging that defendant was in financial need, and hence was likely to commit a robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\">The court permitted the inquiry on \u201c[the prosecutor\u2019s] representation that the question goes to the credibility of the defendant and is not a part of a designed attempt to picture as one critically in need of funds.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-9\">[T]he State\u2019s rebuttal testimony had to mean that defendant lied when he said he had worked with his father, <em>ergo, </em>his financial needs must have been met in some other way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-10\">The State says, however, that despite its seeming change of direction, it was still pursuing a matter of \u201ccredibility\u201d and nothing more. If we understand the State, it says that it may cross-examine a defendant upon any topic, wholly unrelated to any issue in the case, and then rebut his answer, thus to enable the jury to decide whether the defendant is a believable witness. We know of no rule permitting the pursuit of a collateral or extraneous issue as some sort of a trial run upon credibility. On the contrary, if a collateral inquiry is pursued upon cross-examination, the answer given may not be disputed by extrinsic evidence unless such extrinsic evidence would be independently admissible upon a substantive issue in the case. In other words, if the testimony elicited on cross-examination is not relevant upon the issues in the case, or directly upon the witness\u2019s truthworthiness, <em>ie., </em>his knowledge, interest, bias, or criminal record, his answer must be accepted, lest the trial become the pursuit of sundry extraneous and distracting subjects which, to boot, the parties are probably unprepared to litigate. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-11\">Whether defendant did or did not work with his father was of course not an issue in the case. Nor would it directly bear upon credibility, for surely there is nothing about working with one\u2019s father, or not working with one\u2019s father, which suggests a man cannot be a truthworthy witness. Thus the rebuttal evidence was not germane to the ease, either with respect to the triable issues or as to defendant\u2019s reliability as a witness. His testimony therefore could not be contradicted. If no \u2022 more were involved than an infraction of the rules relating to collateral issues, the irregularity might be of no moment. But what emerged was something more than a mere trial of something extraneous. The point the State in truth made by its rebuttal witnesses was that defendant lied when he said he worked for his father, and hence he did not earn money that way, and being otherwise essentially unemployed, he must have been destitute and therefore he likely would rob. Thus, in ultimate effect, the State made the very point which the trial court said was impermissible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number><em>Undoubtedly a lack, of money is logically connected with a crime involving financial gain. The trouble </em>is <em>that it would prove too much against too many. </em>As said in 2 <em>Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed. </em>1940), \u00a7 392, <em>p. </em>341:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Au\"><em>\u201cThe. lack of money by A might be relevant enough to show the probability of </em>As <em>desiring to commit a crime in order to obtain money. But the practical re,suit of such a doctrine would be to put a poor person under so much unfair</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-7\"><em>suspicion and at such a relative disadvantage that for reasons of fairness this argument has seldom been countenanced as evidence of the graver crimes, </em>particularly of violence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-8\">... <em>[I]n general terms, there must be something more than poverty to tie a defendant into a criminal milieu. </em>Hence we are satisfied the trial court was correct in its approach to this subject. <em>The State, however, transgressed that ruling when, </em>by its cross-examination of defendant and its rebuttal testimony <em>it again projected before the jury the forbidden theme that defendant had no apparent means afinc\u00f3me and hence was likely to commit a, crime far dollar gain. This was improper and injurious.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-9\">[Id at 469-72, 221 A.2d 529 (emphasis supplied).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">The policies underlying the principle articulated in <em>Mathis </em>are too important to be limited <em>to the </em>questioning <em>o\u00ed </em>a defendant alone. <em>See State v. Copeland, </em>94 <em>N.J.Super. </em>196, 203-04, 227 A.2d 523 (App.Div.1967)(Conford, P.J.A.D., dissenting). The introduction of evidence regarding whether or not a defendant has a regular source of income is, when a collateral issue, prohibited in any form. It is of no consequence in terms of applying the principle of <em>Mathis </em>whether the offending reference to defendant\u2019s lack of means was based upon defendant\u2019s own testimony, as in <em>Mathis </em>itself, <em>State v. Farr, </em>183 <em>N.J.Super. </em>463, 444 A.2d 593 (App.Div.1982), and <em>State v. Stewart, </em>162 <em>N.J.Super. </em>96, 100, 392 A.2d 234 (App.Div.l978)(opining \u201con [the court\u2019s] own motion\u201d that \u201cit is generally improper to use a defendant\u2019s poverty to establish a criminal motive\u201d); whether on the testimony of other witnesses, as in <em>Mathis </em>also, <em>Copeland, supra, </em>94 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 202, 227 A.2d 523 (Foley, J.A.D., for the court), and <em>State v. Martini, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>176, 266, 619 A.2d 1208 (1993); or whether it was based on no testimony at all, as in <em>State v. Sherman, </em>230 <em>N.J.Super. </em>10, 17, 552 A.2d 621 (App.Div.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">Especially in retrospect, considering how the testimony was used in summation, the trial court was incorrect to overrule defendant\u2019s objection to the prosecutor\u2019s question whether defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>dant was employed. But, even without the benefit of hindsight, the rule of <em>Mathis </em>should have been applied more faithfully and fully to preclude the question. We do not hold that evidence of the money found on defendant\u2019s person should have been kept from the jury, only that it was improper to fortify the inferences which might properly be drawn from that fact with the additional element of defendant\u2019s lack of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The prejudice defendant suffered as a result went to the heart of his convictions for possession of the cocaine and heroin with intent to distribute. The State used the tainted testimony in an effort to persuade the jury that the money found on defendant\u2019s person must logically have been the proceeds of drug sales since he was unemployed and could not account for the sizeable sum. In addition to violating the <em>Mathis </em>rationale, it seems clear that the argument advanced also improperly shifted to defendant the burden of proving that the cash had a more innocent provenance. For all of these reasons, the convictions for possession with intent to distribute must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">None of the taint affected the convictions for simple possession, however. The proofs that defendant possessed the drugs were, after the denial of his motion to suppress, substantial. And, there is no logical basis upon which we could conclude that any spillover occurred from the tainted proofs and summation, along with their effects on the jury\u2019s consideration of the intent-to-distribute charges, to the convictions for simple possession. Accordingly, there is no basis to reverse those convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">The two convictions for possession of heroin and cocaine, respectively, are affirmed. The two convictions for possession of those substances with intent to distribute are reversed. The matter is remanded for resentencing and entry of an amended judgment of conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
