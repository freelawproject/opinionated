(ACCI) as a graphic designer from November 1, 1997, until she was fired in March 2001 for refusing to sign an employment agreement (Agreement) containing a covenant not to compete. The Agreement precluded, among other things, plaintiff from becoming employed by any competitor or customer of ACCI for a period of two years following the termination of her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-13\">Maw brought her claim under both the Conscientious Employee Protection Act (CEPA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-1 to -8, and the common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>law for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy. She appeals the Law Division\u2019s February 14, 2002, order dismissing her complaint pursuant to Rule 4:6-2(e). Because the judge found that a noncompete agreement does not per se violate public policy, she dismissed plaintiffs CEPA and common-law claims against both the corporate and individual defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Plaintiff argues that the restrictive covenant violates public policy because her employer had no legitimate business reason to require her to sign it; consequently, she asserts that her refusal to sign it is protected by both CEPA and common law. We agree that a noncompete agreement, such as the one plaintiff was required to sign, may, depending on the surrounding circumstances, violate the public policy necessary to support a cause of action under CEPA and at common law. Therefore, dismissal of plaintiffs claims before she had an opportunity to develop her ease through discovery was premature. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Because this case comes before the court on defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, the test is whether the alleged facts \u201csuggest\u201d a cause of action. <em>Craig v. Suburban Cablevision, Inc., </em>140 <em>N.J. 623, 625-</em>26, 660 A.2d 505 (1995). Plaintiff is entitled to all reasonable inferences in her favor and we must \u201c \u2018searchL ] the complaint in depth and with liberality to ascertain whether the fundament of a cause of action may be gleaned even from an obscure statement of claim.\u2019 \u201d <em>Printing Mart-Morristown v. Sharp Elecs. Corp., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>739, 746, 563 A.2d 31 (1989) (quoting <em>Di Cristofaro v. Laurel Grove Mem\u2019l Park, </em>43 <em>N.J.Super. </em>244, 252, 128 A.2d 281 (App.Div. 1957)). Given this standard, we take the facts directly from plaintiffs complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">ACCI provides marketing and educational services for the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries. It employs medical educators and clinical researchers to conduct educational programs for healthcare professionals. ACCI hired plaintiff on November 1,1997, as a graphic designer, to design written materials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>used by ACCI in its marketing and educational programs. She provided creative design concepts for written and graphic materials; prepared the design and layout of technical charts, graphs, and reports; and worked with vendors on design issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Plaintiffs job required knowledge and experience in graphic design and its related technologies. Knowledge of, or experience in, the pharmaceutical or healthcare industries was also viewed as beneficial, providing familiarity with the scientific and medical terminology used in the literature being produced. However, such knowledge and experience were not job requirements for ACCI\u2019s graphic designers. In plaintiffs final performance appraisal, only one of the seventeen rated \u201cmajor business objectives\u201d and \u201cperformance factors\u201d involved knowledge of the pharmaceutical industry, and that aspect of the appraisal focused on plaintiffs knowledge of scientific and medical terminology. Plaintiff had no training or education in any medical or pharmaceutical science, and understood little about the substantive content of the materials she produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">In January 2001, ACCI decided to require all employees, at the level of \u201cCoordinator\u201d and above, to sign an employee agreement. Defendants made no distinction between the employees in this category based on their job duties. Nor did defendants identify the nature of the legitimate business interests they were seeking to protect through execution of the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The Agreement states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-7\">B. Company wishes to expand Employee\u2019s responsibilities, expand Employee\u2019s opportunities for client contact and enhance Employee\u2019s compensation opportunities but only upon the terms and conditions, including, but not limited to, the restrictions as to use of confidential and proprietary information by Employee and Employee\u2019s undertaking not to compete with Company, all as set forth in this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">Section 7, captioned <em>CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION, </em>prohibited the employee from disclosing any confidential information, either during or after employment. It says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>7.1 The Employee understands that in the performance of her duties hereunder she shall observe and may obtain knowledge of, ... certain information relating to the business of the Company, that is confidential and proprietary (the \u2018Confidential Information\u2019). As used herein, \u2018Confidential Information\u2019 includes, but is not limited to any information, trade \u2018know-how\u2019, trade secrets, pricing policies, operational methods, methods of doing business, technical processes, formulae, designs and design projects, inventions, research projects, or other information that relates to the business affairs of the Company,____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">The Agreement contains a restrictive covenant, which states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">SECTION 8. <em>NONCOMPETE COVENANT</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-9\">8.1 During the Term and for a period of two (2) years after: ... termination of the Term ... without first obtaining the prior written consent of the Company which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, the Employee shall not directly or indirectly:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-10\">(i) enter the employment of or render any services to, or make any financial contribution whatsoever to any person, ... or any other entity (a \u2018Competitor\u2019) that solicits or otherwise engages in business with any \u2018Customer\u2019, as defined in Section 8.2, below; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-11\">(ii) solicit or encourage any employee to leave the employment of the Company ... or hire any employee who has left the employment of the Employer within one (1) year of the termination or expiration of such employee\u2019s employment; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-12\">(iii) become employed by a Customer of Company which employment relates directly or indirectly to any products, services or projects regarding which the Company has performed any service at any time during the period of two (2) years prior to the expiration or termination of Employee\u2019s employment under this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-13\">8.2 For purposes of this Section 8, a Customer shall mean any client or customer of Company for which Company or such affiliates has (i) performed services, (ii) performed research and proposal development under an agreement of confidentiality, or (iii) generated income for Company, within two (2) years of the date of the termination or expiration of the Employee\u2019s employment under this Agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-14\">The Agreement also informed the employee to \u201cobtain independent counsel\u201d to review the Agreement, and plaintiff did so, consulting with an attorney. Based on those discussions, plaintiff proposed certain changes to the Agreement. Plaintiff did not object to Section 7, but she did object to the noncompete covenant. She suggested certain changes, including, among others, limiting the duration of the noncompete period. She was told, however, by a company representative, that \u201cit is the President\u2019s [cjompany and that he is not going to make any exceptions.\u201d In other words, defendants would not consider any of plaintiffs proposed changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>When plaintiff refused to sign, by letter of March 15, 2001, ACCI terminated her employment. The letter said, in part, \u201cit is necessary that all employees, (Coordinator level and beyond) sign an Employee Agreement. We have not received your signed contract as of the March 15, 2001 deadline. Therefore, you are terminated based on noncompliance with company policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Plaintiff alleges the noncompete clause violated public policy because it had no legitimate business justification \u2014 it would not have protected any of defendants\u2019 legitimate business interests. Instead, she claims it was intended solely to stifle competition, and would have been unduly burdensome on her, by substantially limiting her employment opportunities if she left ACCI, hindering her ability to earn a living and support her family.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">While plaintiff admits she \u201cmay have had access to certain confidential material in the course of performing her designing duties,\u201d she claims her access to such material was no different from that of ACCI\u2019s administrative and clerical staff, who were not asked to sign the Agreement. Moreover, plaintiff asserts that much of the information contained in the literature she produced was already publicly available.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">The motion judge dismissed plaintiffs CEPA claim, finding that \u201cplaintiff, who is an at-will employee, enjoys no right to dictate the terms and conditions of her employment to the extent that she claims that the particular restrictive covenant is a violation of public policy.\u201d The judge was \u201cnot persuaded\u201d that the noncompete clause violated public policy. The court agreed with defendants\u2019 argument that \u201c[t]he reasonableness of the non-compete provisions of the defendants\u2019 proposed restrictive covenant can only be determined once plaintiff has signed the agreement, left, and attempted to work for some other entity. Under that scenario there is a factual framework against which the reasonableness of the restrict[ive] covenant may be tested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>On appeal, plaintiff maintains that as a graphic artist, she was a low-level employee, with no knowledge or understanding of the content of the writings with which she was working, and she had no contact with defendants\u2019 clients or customers. Therefore, a noncompetition agreement would serve only the unlawful purpose of binding her to her employment with ACCI, and restricting her post-ACCI employment opportunities. Plaintiff further argues that, as written, the Agreement\u2019s noncompetition clause is over-broad, unreasonable, and unduly oppressive. Based upon these arguments, plaintiff contends that the Agreement, as applied to her, violates New Jersey public policy, and termination of her employment for refusing to sign it creates valid CEPA and common-law claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">At common law, \u201can employee has a cause of action for wrongful discharge when the discharge is contrary to a clear mandate of public policy.\u201d <em>Pierce v. Ortho Pharm. Corp., </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>58, 72, 417 A.2d 505 (1980). \u201cAn employer\u2019s right to discharge an employee at will carries a correlative duty not to discharge an employee who declines to perform an act that would require a violation of a clear mandate of public policy.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>CEPA provides the employee with similar protection. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3c(3) prohibits employers from taking any retaliatory action against an employee, because the employee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At\">c. Objects to, or refuses to participate in any activity, policy or practice which the employee reasonably believes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">(3) is incompatible with a clear mandate of public policy concerning the public health, safety or welfare or protection of the environment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">To establish a <em>Pierce </em>claim, or a claim under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3c(3), a plaintiff must first articulate the existence of a clear mandate of public policy which, if the allegations are true, the employer\u2019s conduct would violate. <em>Kolb v. Burns, </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>467, 476, 727 A.2d 525 (App.Div.1999). Whether a plaintiff has adequately established the existence of a clear mandate of public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>policy is a threshold issue of law, to be decided by the court. <em>Mehlman v. Mobil Oil Corp., </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>163, 187, 707 A.2d 1000 (1998); <em>McLelland v. Moore, </em>343 <em>N.J.Super. </em>589, 600-01, 779 A.2d 463 (App.Div.2001), <em>certif. denied, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>43, 791 A.2d 221 (2002); <em>Kolb, supra, </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 476, 727 A.2d 525; <em>Fineman v. N.J. Dept. of Human Servs., </em>272 <em>N.J.Super. </em>606, 620, 640 A.2d 1161 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>267, 649 A.2d 1287 (1994). As sources of public policy, the court looks to federal and state constitutions, statutes, administrative rules and decisions, judicial decisions, and professional codes of ethics. <em>Mehlman, supra, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>at 188, 707 A.2d 1000; <em>Pierce, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 72, 417 A.2d 505. Although these sources are not exclusive, \u201c[a] salutary limiting principle is that the offensive activity must pose a threat of public harm, not merely private harm or harm only to the aggrieved employee.\u201d <em>Mehlman, supra, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>at 188, 707 A.2d 1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">\u201c[T]he Legislature has explicitly provided under section 3c(3) that an employee shall not be subject to retaliatory action when he or she objects to any activity that the employee \u2018reasonably believes ... is incompatible with a clear mandate of public policy concerning the public health, safety or welfare or protection of the environment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Estate of Roach v. TRW, Inc., </em>164 <em>N.J. </em>598, 609, 754 A.2d 544 (2000). Section 3c(3) was enacted \u201cto encourage conscientious employees to disclose or object to activities encapsulated in that section.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 611, 754 A.2d 544. CEPA\u2019s overriding policy is to protect society at large. <em>Cedeno v. Montclair State Univ., </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>473, 478, 750 A.2d 73 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">To meet the threshold showing that the activity in which the employee refuses to participate is incompatible with a clear mandate of public policy, it is sufficient that the court be able to identify \u201cthe law or public policy that might have been violated by the challenged conduct\u201d; <em>McLelland, supra, </em>343 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 600, 779 A.2d 463; it is not necessary that the conduct be'an actual violation of a law or regulation. <em>Estate of Roach, supra, </em>164 <em>N.J. </em>at 613, 754 A.2d 544. As the Court noted in <em>Mehlman, </em>\u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>object of CEPA is not to make lawyers out of conscientious employees but rather to prevent retaliation against those employees who object to ... conduct that they reasonably believe to be unlawful or indisputably dangerous to the public health, safety or welfare.\u201d 153 <em>N.J. </em>at 193-94, 707 A.2d 1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Here, plaintiff claims that by forcing her to sign what she claims to be an unenforceable noncompete covenant, her employer violated a clear mandate of public policy. Because no court in this State has addressed this issue, we first need to examine how noncompete agreements are viewed under New Jersey law.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Noncompetition agreements are looked upon unfavorably by the courts, as potential restraints on trade. <em>Laidlaw, Inc. v. Student Transp. of Am., Inc., </em>20 F.Supp.2d 727, 757 (D.N.J. 1998); and <em>see Whitmyer Bros., Inc. v. Doyle, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>25, 33-34, 274 A.2d 577 (1971) (citing to New Jersey\u2019s Antitrust Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:9-1 to -19, for proposition that employers have no legitimate interest in using such agreements solely to prevent competition). To be enforceable, a restrictive covenant must be reasonable under the circumstances. <em>Graziano v. Grant, </em>326 <em>N.J.Super. </em>328, 343, 741 A.2d 156 (App.Div.1999). A restrictive covenant is reasonable if it protects the legitimate interests of the employer, imposes no undue hardship on the employee, and is not injurious to the public. <em>Whitmyer Bros., supra, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>at 32-33, 274 A.2d 577; <em>Solan Indus., Inc. v. Malady, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>571, 576, 264 A.2d 53 (1970); <em>Schuhalter v. Salerno, </em>279 <em>N.J.Super. </em>504, 508, 653 A.2d 596 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>454, 663 A.2d 1361 (1995); <em>Coskey\u2019s Television &amp; Radio Sales and Serv., Inc. v. Foti, </em>253 <em>N.J.Super. </em>626, 633-34, 602 A.2d 789 (App.Div.1992); <em>Raven v. </em>A. <em>Klein &amp; Co., Inc., </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>209, 213, 478 A.2d 1208 (App. Div.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">\u201cThe first two parts of the <em>Solari </em>/ <em>Whitmyer </em>test focus on the protection of the legitimate interests of the employer and the extent of the hardship on the employee.\u201d <em>Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Ciavatta, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>609, 634-35, 542 A.2d 879 (1988). \u201c[T]he court must balance these competing interests.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 635, 542 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>A.2d 879. When an employer\u2019s interests are strong, as seen in cases involving trade secrets or confidential information, a court will enforce a restrictive covenant; however, when the employer\u2019s interests \u201cdo not rise to the level of a proprietary interest deserving of judicial protection, a court will conclude that a restrictive agreement merely stifles competition and therefore is unenforceable.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>A court will not enforce restrictive covenants \u201cprincipally directed at lessening competition.\u201d <em>Raven, supra, </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 213, 478 A.2d 1208.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">The third part of the <em>Solari </em>/ <em>Whitmyer </em>test relates to the public interest. <em>Ingersoll-Rand, supra, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>at 639, 542 A.2d 879. \u201c[T]he public has a clear interest in safeguarding fair commercial practices and in protecting employers from theft or piracy of trade secrets, confidential information, or, more generally, knowledge and technique in which the employer may be said to have a proprietary interest.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">Defendants urge, and the motion judge agreed, that no violation of public policy could be found because noncompete agreements are not per se invalid. As a general rule, they are correct. But, as is clearly established in the case law, a court must carefully scrutinize the interests asserted by the employer before the noncompete clause is determined to be reasonable and enforceable. The agreements may not be used merely to restrict competition, nor to bind particular employees to the employer. <em>Id. </em>at 639-40, 542 A.2d 879. \u201c \u2018A restraint on the employee is illegal when its purpose is the prevention of competition, except when the methods of competition ... are ... commonly regarded as improper or unfair.\u2019 \u201d <em>Whitmyer, supra, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>at 35-36, 274 A.2d 577 (quoting 6A <em>Corbin on Contracts </em>\u00a7 1394 (1962)).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Thus, to subject an employee to a noncompete covenant in the first instance, the employer must demonstrate that it has legitimate interests which require protection through such an agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 36-37, 274 A.2d 577. This requires an analysis of the employee\u2019s job, to determine whether the employee has access to information worthy of protection through a noncompeti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>tion agreement, such as highly confidential or proprietary business information, trade secrets, or customer relations information. <em>Ingersoll-Rand, supra, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>at 628, 542 A.2d 879. On the other hand, matters of general knowledge within an industry, the skills or experience an employee learned or developed during an employee\u2019s tenure with the employer, or the knowledge, skills, or abilities an employee brought with him to the employer, are not worthy of protection through a noncompetition agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 629-30, 642-43, 542 A.2d 879; <em>Coskey\u2019s, supra, </em>253 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 637-39, 602 A.2d 789; <em>Raven, supra, </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 213-14, 478 A.2d 1208.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">If the employee does not have access to trade secrets or other confidential or proprietary information, then a noncompetition agreement may not be enforced against the employee, regardless of its terms. Such an agreement will be viewed as serving no legitimate purpose, and as an unlawful and unenforceable restraint on trade. <em>Ingersoll-Rand, supra, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>at 635, 542 A.2d 879; <em>Whitmyer, supra, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>at 36-37, 274 A.2d 577. If, on the other hand, the employee does have access to trade secrets, or other confidential or proprietary information, warranting imposition of a noncompetition agreement, then consideration moves to the second and third elements of the three-pronged <em>Solari </em>/ <em>Whitmyer </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Here, focusing on the first prong \u2014 -protection of the employer\u2019s legitimate business interests \u2014 plaintiff contends that given her position within the company, she was not privy to any trade secrets, proprietary or otherwise confidential information, and had little or no interaction with the company\u2019s customers. Much of the information with which she worked was already public. While she admits she may have had access to some \u201cconfidential material,\u201d she claims her access was limited, and no greater than that of ACCI\u2019s administrative and clerical staff, who were not required to sign noncompetition agreements. Moreover, plaintiff alleges that she had little understanding of the substantive content of the documents she was creating. This latter allegation may become <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>significant because our law recognizes that human beings have a limited capacity for the retention of information they do understand, let alone information they do not, and employers cannot demand that its employees sign a noncompete agreement based on the presumption that employees will retain knowledge of every document they have ever viewed. <em>See Laidlaw, supra, </em>20 <em>F.Supp.</em>2d at 759 (recognizing that employee would have to be \u201cthe Rainman\u201d to be able to retain, recall, and make use of information contained in documents with which he worked while employed by defendant, where he did not take those documents with him when he left).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">The judge dismissed the complaint on a Rule 4:6-2(e) motion, based solely on the pleadings. At this stage of the litigation, plaintiff is entitled to all legitimate inferences which arise from her factual allegations. These facts and inferences show that plaintiff has neither access to trade secrets nor other confidential, proprietary information; or, to the extent that she has, she does not understand it; and her access is no different from those employees not required to sign the Agreement. Under these circumstances, we may infer that defendants do not have a proprietary interest vis-a-vis plaintiff which is worthy of judicial protection \u2014 that the noncompete covenant, as it applies to plaintiff, does not protect defendants\u2019 legitimate business interests. As a result, the noncompete covenant\u2019s effect may be principally directed at lessening competition, which the courts of this State have recognized as injurious to the public. <em>See Whitmyer, supra, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>at 32-33, 274 A.2d 577; <em>Solari, supra, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>at 585, 264 A.2d 53; <em>Raven, supra, </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 213-14, 478 A.2d 1208. Therefore, if plaintiffs allegations are proven, firing her for refusing to sign the Agreement may violate public policy and support a CEPA or <em>Pierce </em>cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">A review of the complaint also supports plaintiffs contention that the noncompete clause may be unduly burdensome to her. A restrictive covenant can cause undue hardship to an employee if it places substantial limitations on where an employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>may work or if it prevents an employee from engaging in his or her livelihood. <em>Platinum Mgmt., Inc. v. Dahms, </em>285 <em>N.J.Super. </em>274, 298-99, 666 A.2d 1028 (Law Div.1995). To determine whether the hardship is undue, consideration is given to the nature of the profession, the duration of the restriction, the geographic area of the restriction and the type of restriction. <em>Schuhalter, supra, </em>279 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 509-11, 653 A.2d 596. Factors include, but are not limited to, (1) the agreement\u2019s geographic and temporal scope; (2) whether the types of activities restrained are those which would place the employee in actual competition with the former employer; and (3) whether the covenant will unduly burden the employee in finding work in his or her field. <em>Karlin v. Weinberg, </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>408, 423-24, 390 A.2d 1161 (1978); <em>Coskey\u2019s, supra., 253 N.J.Super. </em>at 634-39, 602 A.2d 789; <em>Platinum Mgmt., Inc., supra, </em>285 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 293-300, 666 A.2d 1028.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">In this case, the noncompete clause includes provisions that may be unduly burdensome in time and geography. The agreement extends for two years after plaintiff leaves ACCI, but gives no explanation as to why such a lengthy period of time is necessary. It also contains no geographic limitation. Theoretically, this would prevent plaintiff from engaging in a similar type of employment anywhere in the world. Given these restrictions, the hardship on plaintiff may, on balance, outweigh the employer\u2019s competing business interests. <em>See Solari, supra, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>at 576, 264 A.2d 53. At this early stage of the litigation, that is enough to support plaintiffs claim to a viable cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">We recognize that no New Jersey case has previously addressed whether a CEPA or <em>Pierce </em>claim may arise in the context of an employee\u2019s refusal to sign a noncompete clause. But, for the reasons expressed, we find that New Jersey\u2019s strong prohibition against restraint of trade, and against unduly burdening employees by restricting their right to engage in their chosen field of employment, establishes the public policy necessary to support a CEPA and <em>Pierce </em>common-law cause of action. <em>See D\u2019Sa v. Playhut, Inc., </em>85 Cal.App.4th 927, 102 Cal.Rptr.2d 495, 497 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>(2000), <em>review denied </em>(Mai-. 21, 2001) (holding \u201cemployer cannot lawfully make the signing of an employment agreement, which contains an unenforceable covenant not to compete, a condition of continued employment,____ [A]n employer\u2019s termination of an employee who refuses to sign such an agreement constitutes a wrongful termination in violation of public policy\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">In rendering its decision, the Law Division concluded that the reasonableness of a noncompete provision may only be determined once an employee has signed the agreement, left employment, \u201cand attempted to work for some other entity.\u201d The judge was apparently referring to the line of cases where, after the employee leaves his or her employment, the validity of noncompete clauses generally arises in the context of the former employer attempting to enforce a noncompete agreement, or the former employee seeking to avoid the agreement, by pursuing injunctive relief. <em>Karlin, supra, </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>408, 390 A.2d 1161; <em>Solari, supra, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>571, 264 A.2d 53; <em>Caskey\u2019s, supra, </em>253 <em>N.J.Super. </em>626, 602 A.2d 789; <em>A.T. Hudson &amp; Co., Inc. v. Donovan, </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>426, 524 A.2d 412 (App.Div.1987); <em>Hogan v. Bergen Brunswig Corp., </em>153 <em>N.J.Super, </em>37, 378 A.2d 1164 (App.Div.1977); <em>Platinum Mgmt., supra, </em>285 <em>N.J.Super. </em>274, 666 A.2d 1028.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">However, we find no reason to require an employee with a reasonable belief that a noncompete clause violates public policy to have to wait until she leaves her employment to have her rights adjudicated. Upon signing the Agreement, plaintiff would be burdened with the Agreement\u2019s restrictions should she decide to seek another job, She would have to limit her job search. For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>two years, she could not accept a job from any of defendant\u2019s competitors or customers. And where could she look for a job in her field? The Agreement has no geographic limitations. If she wants to continue to work in her chosen field, she will be \u201cmarried\u201d to her employer. Alternatively, she could ignore the restrictive covenant, and wait for defendant to sue her. Neither choice fosters New Jersey\u2019s public policy of prohibiting restraints of trade and encouraging competition. We see no purpose to require an employee to sign what may be a legally unenforceable noncompete clause, under the threat of discharge, and then wait to litigate the agreement should the employer seek to enforce it at a later date.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">We next address whether CEPA allows for individual liability. The motion judge dismissed the claim against defendant Forte, ACCI\u2019s president, based on the same reasoning as she did the claim against the corporation \u2014 that plaintiff had not established a violation of public policy. She noted in passing, however, that CEPA does provide for individual liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">Although no New Jersey case directly addresses this issue,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> federal decisions have concluded that individual liability may be imposed under CEPA. <em>See Espinosa v. Conti Airlines, </em>80 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>297, 305-06 (D.N.J.2000) (individual defendants may be held individually liable under CEPA); <em>Palladino v. VNA of S.N.J., Inc., </em>68 F.Supp.2d 455, 474 (D.N.J.1999) (\u201cthe imposition of individual liability for offending conduct furthers CEPA\u2019s protective and remedial purposes\u201d). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">Under CEPA, an \u201cemployer\u201d is liable for retaliation against an employee. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3. An \u201cemployer\u201d is defined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>as \u201cany individual, partnership, association, corporation <em>or any person or group of persons acting directly or indirectly on behalf of or in the interest of an employer with the employer\u2019s consent.\u201d N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-2a (emphasis added). The underlined portion of the definition of \u201cemployer\u201d includes a business entity\u2019s employee. A fair reading of the statute therefore makes both the employer and the employee subject to CEPA\u2019s prohibitions. <em>See State v. Churchdale Leasing, Inc., </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>83, 101, 557 A.2d 277 (1989) (\u201cWhen a statute is clear on its face, a court need not look beyond the statutory terms to determine the legislative intent.\u201d). This interpretation is also consistent with CEPA\u2019s broad remedial purpose to afford prevailing plaintiffs all of the same remedies that are available \u201cin common law tort actions.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-5. We therefore also reverse the judgment insofar as it dismissed plaintiffs claim against Forte.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Finally, we turn to whether the court\u2019s dismissal of plaintiffs common-law claim for wrongful discharge was warranted. CEPA contains an exclusivity clause which provides that \u201cthe institution of an action in accordance with this act shall be deemed a waiver of the rights and remedies available under any other contract, collective bargaining agreement, State law, rule or regulation or under the common law.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-8. Thus, \u201c[parallel claims based on those rights, privileges and remedies are waived because they represent multiple or duplicative claims based on retaliatory discharge.\u201d <em>Young v. Schering Corp., </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>16, 29, 660 A.2d 1153 (1995). The waiver provision does not apply to claims that are substantially independent of the CEPA claim. <em>Id. </em>at 33, 660 A.2d 1153.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Here, the issue is not whether plaintiff ultimately may bring both a common-law claim and a CEPA claim \u2014 plaintiff acknowledges that she must elect one or the other \u2014 but rather at what point must plaintiff make the election.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Coxnmon-law claims of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy, which merely duplicate a CEPA claim, are routinely dismissed under CEPA\u2019s exclusivity provision, albeit, generally at later stages of the litigation. <em>Falco v. Cmty. Med. Ctr., </em>296 <em>N.J.Super. </em>298, 304, 318, 686 A.2d 1212 (App.Div.1997), <em>certif. denied, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>405, 709 A.2d 798 (1998); <em>Catalane v. Gilian Instrument Corp., </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>476, 492-93, 638 A.2d 1341 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>298, 642 A.2d 1006 (1994); <em>Flaherty v. The Enclave, </em>255 <em>N.J.Super. </em>407, 413, 605 A.2d 301 (Law Div.1992). Indeed, the Supreme Court has held that this was precisely the Legislature\u2019s intent in enacting CEPA\u2019s exclusivity provision. <em>Young, supra, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>at 27, 660 A.2d 1153 (\u201cwe are persuaded that the Legislature intended that the <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-8 waiver prevent an employee from pursuing both statutory and common-law retaliatory discharge causes of action\u201d and \u201ccurtail ... cumulative remedial actions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Although none of the cases cited specifically address at what point the election must be made, <em>Young </em>is instructive. The Court found the election needed to be made \u201conce a CEPA claim is \u2018instituted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29, 660 A.2d 1153. However, in discussing the meaning of \u201cinstitution of an action,\u201d the Court noted that \u201c[t]he meaning of \u2018institution of an action\u2019 could conceivably contemplate an election of remedies with restrictions in which the election is not considered to have been made until discovery is complete or the time of a pretrial conference contemplated by Rule 4:25-1. Another question is whether the statutory waiver is applicable if the CEPA claim is withdrawn or otherwise concluded prior to judgment on the merits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 32, 660 A.2d 1153. We take this language to mean that before electing remedies, a plaintiff should have an opportunity to complete discovery. Only after gaining access to all of the facts, will a plaintiff be in a position to make a knowing and meaningful election. Here, plaintiff was not given that opportunity. As such, we also reinstate plaintiffs common-law claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b466-10\"> Underlying the <em>D\u2019Sa </em>decision is a California statute that, with certain exceptions, renders void any contract that purports to restrain a person from \"engaging in a lawful profession, trade or business.\" <em>Cal.

Specifically, the issue is whether CEPA protects an employee who refuses to sign a confidentiality and noncompete agreement and is terminated by her employer. I would rule that the discharge does not violate CEPA because an employee\u2019s interest in freely moving from employer to employer is primarily a private interest beyond the protection provided by CEPA. Therefore, I would affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Plaintiff founds her claim on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3c(3).

Mobil Oil Corp., </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>163, 187-88, 707 A.2d 1000 (1998); <em>Smith-Bozarth v. Coalition Against Rape and Abuse, Inc., </em>329 <em>N.J.Super. </em>238, 244, 747 A.2d 322 (App.Div.2000). Sources of public policy include the federal and state constitutions, statutes, regulations, common law, judicial decisions and codes of ethics. <em>MacDougall v. Weichert, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>380, 391, 677 A.2d 162 (1996). Whether a plaintiff has identified a clear mandate of public policy is a question of law to be decided by the court before submission of any CEPA case to a jury. <em>Mehlman, supra, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>at 187, 707 A.2d 1000; <em>Smith-Bozarth, supra, </em>329 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 245, 747 A.2d 322. A policy which is vague, unsettled or controversial is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>not a clear mandate. <em>MacDougall, supra, 144 N.J. </em>at 392, 677 A.2d 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Plaintiff objected to her employer\u2019s decision to require her to execute a confidentiality and noncompetition agreement. A non-competition agreement is designed to protect the private interests of the employer. It is not per se illegal or contrary to public policy. It will be enforced if it protects the legitimate interests of the employer, imposes no undue hardship on the employee, and is not injurious to the public. <em>Whitmyer Bros., Inc. v. Doyle, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>25, 32-33, 274 A.2d 577 (1971); <em>Solari Indus., Inc. v. Malady, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>571, 576, 264 A.2d 53 (1970). Indeed, in <em>Whitmyer, </em>the Court observed that protection of trade secrets and other proprietary information is a legitimate interest of the employer and they have been protected by courts even in the absence of a noncompetition agreement. <em>Whitmyer, supra, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>at 33, 274 A.2d 577. The protection of customer relationships is also recognized as a legitimate employer interest. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">The public interest is usually identified as the public\u2019s right to foster fair commercial practices, to protect employers from theft of trade secrets or other proprietary information, and to discourage anti-competitive business activities. <em>Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. Ciavatta, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>609, 639, 542 A.2d 879 (1988). In certain situations, the public interest also includes the right of patients to continue a doctor-patient relationship upon the termination of the employment of a health care professional or the dissolution of a medical or dental practice. <em>Karlin v. Weinberg, </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>408, 424, 390 A.2d 1161 (1978). The patient\u2019s interest, however, may have to yield in whole or in part to private interests in certain situations. <em>See Graziano v. Grant, </em>326 <em>N.J.Super. </em>328, 344-45, 741 A.2d 156 (App.Div.1999) (a covenant not to compete ancillary to the sale of a medical practice may be entitled to broader protection than a covenant against competition in an employment agreement). This interest is obviously not implicated in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">Admittedly, an employment agreement which contains a non-competition agreement may be struck as unreasonable, <em>Solari, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number><em>supra, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>at 576, 579, 264 A.2d 53; <em>see also Ingersoll-Rand, supra, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>at 643, 542 A.2d 879 (Court found employee invention holdover agreement was unreasonable and unenforceable where invention was' not product of work done by former employee while employed at company nor incorporated company\u2019s trade secrets); it may be modified to achieve a reasonable agreement, <em>Coskey\u2019s Television &amp; Radio Sales &amp; Serv., Inc. v. Foti, </em>253 <em>N.J.Super. </em>626, 634, 602 A.2d 789 (App.Div.1992) (court modified overbroad agreement to preclude former employee from interfering with employer\u2019s successful contract bids that former employee had negotiated); or it may be enforced, <em>Schuhalter v. Salerno, </em>279 <em>N.J.Super. </em>504, 512, 653 A.2d 596 (App.Div.) (dissolving two partner accounting firm agreement restricting partners from servicing each other\u2019s clients for two years held reasonable and enforceable), <em>certif. denied, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>454, 663 A.2d 1361 (1995). Whether a non-competition agreement will be enforced is a fact-sensitive inquiry. <em>Graziano, supra, </em>326 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 343, 741 A.2d 156. The need to assess each agreement individually to foster and protect the interests of the employer, employee and the public strongly suggests that an employee\u2019s objection to the fact of a noncompetition agreement and/or the specific terms of an agreement does not implicate CEPA because the employer\u2019s actions do not transgress a clear mandate of public policy concerning the public health, safety or welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">The evolution of the law protecting employees from illegal or unethical employer conduct supports this view. Enacted in 1986, CEPA is designed to protect workers who are subjected to retaliation for reporting illegal, unlawful or unethical conduct. <em>Barratt v. Cushman &amp; Wakefield, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>120, 127, 675 A.2d 1094 (1996). The statute codified and elaborated on the rule announced in <em>Pierce v. Ortho Pharm. Corp., </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>58, 72, 417 A.2d 505 (1980), which recognized a tort action by an employee who suffers retaliatory action for refusing to perform an act in violation of a clear mandate of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>In 1989, CEPA was amended to expand the protections provided to employees by prohibiting employers from taking retaliatory action against an employee who discloses or threatens to disclose any activity, policy or practice of an employer with whom the employee\u2019s employer has a business relationship. \u201cThe aim of the [amendment] is to discourage collusion between employers for the purpose of inhibiting disclosure by their employees of violations of law committed by either employer.\u201d Assembly Labor Committee Statement, Assembly No. 661, <em>L. </em>1989, c. 220 \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Generally, \u201cthe purpose of CEPA is \u2018to protect and encourage employees to report illegal or unethical workplace activities and to discourage public and private sector employers from engaging in such conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mehlman, supra, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>at 179, 707 A.2d 1000 (quoting <em>Abbamont v. Piscataway Bd. of Educ., </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>405, 431, 650 A.2d 958 (1994)); <em>accord Barratt, supra, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>at 127, 675 A.2d 1094. As remedial legislation, CEPA is to be construed liberally. <em>Higgins v. Pascack Valley Hasp., </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>404, 420, 730 A.2d 327 (1999). Nevertheless, a cause of action which provides a remedy for employees who are wrongfully discharged or who suffer other adverse employment consequences for objecting to employer conduct must balance the interests of the employee, the employer and the public. <em>Pierce, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 71, 417 A.2d 505. In <em>Pierce, </em>the Court noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-7\">[e]mployees have an interest in knowing they will not be discharged for exercising their legal rights. Employers have an interest in knowing they can run then-businesses as they see fit as long as their conduct is consistent with public policy. The public has an interest in employment stability and in discouraging frivolous lawsuits by dissatisfied employees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-8\">[/&amp;\u00ab.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">I do not interpret CEPA as disturbing this balance. Rather, CEPA recognizes and honors this balance by requiring that the employer\u2019s conduct must violate a clear mandate of public policy. In other words, in order to be subject to CEPA, the employer\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>conduct must implicate the public interest and pose a threat to the public health, safety and welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">The Court has stated that the scope of CEPA is not unlimited and that a helpful limiting principle is that the offensive conduct must implicate the public interest. <em>Mehlman, supra, 153 N.J. at </em>187-88, 707 A.2d 1000. Justice Stein wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">\u25a0 The specific applications of the CEPA cause of action continue to evolve. But the core value that infuses CEPA is the legislative determination to protect from retaliatory discharge those employees who, \u201cbelieving that the public interest overrides the interest of the organization [they] serve[], publicly 'blow[] the whistle\u2019 [because] the organization is involved in corrupt, illegal, fraudulent or harmful activity.\u201d 'Ralph Nader et al., <em>Whistleblowing: The Report of the Conference on Professional Responsibility </em>(1972). We look generally to the federal and state constitutions, statutes, administrative rules and decisions, judicial decisions, and professional codes of ethics to inform our determination whether specific corrupt, illegal, fraudulent or harmful activity violates a clear mandate of public policy, but those sources are not necessarily exclusive. A salutary limiting principle is that the offensive activity must pose a threat of public harm, not merely private harm or harm only to the aggrieved employee. See <em>Littman </em>[v. <em>Firestone &amp; Rubber Co.], </em>[] 715 F.

The Court recognized that the activity which was the subject of the complaint effected the public interest because real estate brokerage is heavily regulated and unethical or illegal conduct left unredressed subverts voluntary compliance with regulations and public confidence in real estate brokers. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">In <em>Mehlman, </em>the Court held that plaintiffs opposition to the use of benzene in excess of recommended levels in various grades of gasoline sold by a subsidiary of its employer in another country implicated the public interest because of the recognized public health, safety and welfare concerns of the substance. <em>Mehlman, supra, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>at 192, 707 A.2d 1000. In <em>Abbamont, </em>a teacher\u2019s complaint that shop practices in the school violated OSHA regulations implicated the public health, safety and welfare. <em>Abbamont, supra, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>at 425, 650 A.2d 958. In <em>Higgins, </em>a nurse\u2019s complaint about the actions of co-employees in a mobile intensive care unit implicated the public health, safety and welfare. <em>Higgins, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 421, 730 A.2d 327. In <em>Estate of Roach v. TRW, Inc., </em>164 <em>N.J. </em>598, 613, 754 A.2d 544 (2000), the Court held that accusations that employees of a defense contractor engaged in fraudulent practices, such as arranging kickbacks and padding accounts, implicated more than the private interests of the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">In order to determine whether plaintiff states a claim under CEPA, the initial focus is on the employer\u2019s \u201c \u2018activity, policy, or practice\u2019 that triggers the employee\u2019s objection or refusal to participate.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:19-3c; <em>Cosgrove, supra, </em>356 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 525, 813 A.2d 591. In examining the employer\u2019s activity, we must remember that the CEPA standard of a \u201cclear mandate of public policy\u201d is designed to distinguish between legitimate practices, policies or actions fashioned to allow an employer to run its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>business in the manner best suited to accomplish its corporate purpose and protect its legitimate business interests, and illegitimate practices, policies and actions which are clearly recognized as incompatible with the public health, safety, and welfare.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Here, the dispute is essentially a private dispute between an employer and an employee. The dispute involves an attempt by the employer to protect business relationships and information belonging not only to the employer but also to clients. The employee has not been asked to do anything illegal or unethical. Plaintiffs complaint concerns a private harm rather than a public harm. Therefore, I would hold that the complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and affirm the order dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b473-10\"> The statute was further amended in 1997 to address issues related to health care workers. <em>L. </em>1997, <em>c. </em>98 \u00a7 2.
