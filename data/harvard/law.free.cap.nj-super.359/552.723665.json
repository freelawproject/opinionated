We reverse. <em>See Esposito v. Police and Fireman\u2019s Retirement System, </em>358 <em>N.J.Super. </em>112, 817 A.2d 340 (App.Div.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Following injury in circumstances that we will soon describe, Angiola filed an application with PERS for accidental disability retirement benefits. Although ordinary disability retirement benefits were awarded, PERS denied, Angiola\u2019s request for benefits available in cases of accidental disability. On appeal from that determination, PERS referred Angiola\u2019s application to the Office of Administrative Law for a hearing as a contested matter. There, cross-motions for summary decision upon stipulated facts, presented by way of a certification by Angiola, were filed with an administrative law judge (ALJ). The ALJ granted PERS\u2019 motion in a written decision that recommended that Angiola\u2019s application be denied because he had failed to demonstrate injury caused by a traumatic event, and PERS adopted that decision and recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">We reproduce in its entirety the certification of Angiola that sets forth the facts that formed the basis for the underlying motions and the present appeal.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-7\">I, PETER ANGIOLA of full age, hereby certify as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-8\">1. I am the Petitioner in the above matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-9\">2. On March 31, 1995 I was employed as a toll taker for the New Jersey Turnpike Authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-10\">3. On that date I was working in the tollbooth at Exit 9 on the New Jersey Turnpike.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-11\">4. The driver of an automobile approaching the tollbooth either lost control of his automobile, had a heart attack and died or had a heart attack, lost control of his automobile and died.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>5. The automobile went airborne, struck another automobile and then was coming directly towards my tollbooth. Instead of striking my tollbooth, the automobile struck the top left corner of a tractor-trailer, which was exiting the tollbooth and then landed a few inches in front of the tollbooth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-6\">6. The point of impact between the automobile and the tractor-trailer was approximately one foot from the tollbooth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-7\">7. The tollbooth was configured so that there was a metal counter to the front of the tollbooth and another metal counter in the rear of the tollbooth. There was a door on the left where I was handing out tickets. I would get the tickets from the front counter. I was facing the front counter handing out tickets with my left hand to vehicles, which were coming from my front.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-8\">8. When I saw the automobile in the air coming toward my tollbooth, I jumped to the rear to avoid being struck and my low back struck the counter in the rear of the tollbooth. The counter was three to three and one-half feet high.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-9\">9. The accident happened at approximately 3:00 p.m. The distance I jumped backwards to avoid being struck [by] the car was approximately two feet.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">The accidental disability retirement benefits sought by Angiola were available to him upon a showing of permanent and total disability, which in his case was uncontested, taking place \u201cas a direct result of a traumatic event occurring during and as a result of the performance of his regular or assigned duties....\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-43. A similar requirement that the disability result from a \u201ctraumatic event\u201d appears in connection with the statutes providing for accidental disability pension benefits under the State\u2019s other two public pension systems: the Police and Firemen\u2019s Retirement System (see <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A-7) and the Teacher\u2019s Pension and Annuity Fund (see <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:66-39). Precedent construing each of the three statutes is thus relevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">An explanation of our rejection of the interpretation accorded the term \u201ctraumatic event\u201d by the ALJ and PERS in Angiola\u2019s ease lands us in the syntactical swamp that has mired our courts ever since the Legislature, in apparent reaction to a previously generous interpretation of the requirement that disability be caused by an accident in a fashion consonant with workers\u2019 compensation precedent, substituted for the term \u201caccident\u201d the requirement that the disability be caused by a \u201ctraumatic event.\u201d <em>See Maynard v. Board of Trustees of the Teachers\u2019 Pension and Annuity Fund, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>169, 172-73, 549 A.2d 1213 (1988); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number><em>Cattani v. Board of Trustees, Police and Firemen\u2019s Retirement System, </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>578, 583-84, 355 A.2d 625 (1976) and <em>Russo v. Teachers\u2019 Pension and Annuity Fund, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>142, 151, 299 A.2d 697 (1973) (discussing legislative and judicial history).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">The inference logically to be drawn from this legislative amendment is that the Legislature sought to limit provision of accidental disability retirement benefits to more narrowly drawn circumstances and a smaller cohort than had previously been the case. However, the Legislature\u2019s linguistic formulation gave little clue as to the nature of the limits that it sought to impose.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">What from the outset is noteworthy is the significant difference in the amount of benefits available under ordinary and accidental retirement benefit schemes. Ordinary retirement benefits approximate forty percent of final average compensation <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-45), whereas accidental retirement benefits can reach two thirds of final compensation. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-46. That accidental disability retirement benefits are so much higher suggests, in part, a recognition by the Legislature that additional compensation is warranted in instances in which the precipitating cause of an injury is so far outside the normal scope of risks that accompany a particular employment that the employee-victim is deserving of additional compensation. Otherwise, in instances of total permanent disability from work-related causes, a disparity in compensation makes no sense. The task has thus been to provide a meaningful definition to those narrow classes of traumatic events that are so unbargained-for in their occurrence in workplace life that the necessity of substantial additional compensation must be recognized.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">In a decision in <em>Hillman v. Board of Trustees, Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, </em>109 <em>N.J.Super. </em>449, 460-61, 263 A.2d 789 (App.Div.1970), we required, among other things, that to constitute a \u201ctraumatic\u201d event, the event must be \u201cundesigned, unexpected and unusual.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>However, the Supreme Court rejected the <em>Hillman </em>formulation in <em>Cattani, supra, </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>at 585, 355 A.2d 625, finding it to be \u201ctoo broad\u201d and to \u201cfrustrated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>restriction which the Legislature intended to place on the granting of an accidental disability pension when it substituted the expression \u2018traumatic event\u2019 for the word \u2018accident.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The <em>Cattani </em>Court determined that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-5\">The phrase \u2018traumatic event\u2019 would ordinarily involve a mishap or accident involving the application of some kind of external force to the body <em>or </em>the violent exposure of the body to some external force.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-6\"><em>rId. </em>at 586, 355 A.2d 625 (emphasis supplied).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">By setting the standard in the alternative, the Court thus recognized that a traumatic event could occur either as the result of a contact or a noncontact situation. The <em>Cattani </em>Court also recognized that its definition was not exclusive, holding that \u201ca traumatic event may possibly be found in some situations which do not literally fall within the external force or violence concept but still might be regarded as having a traumatic origin.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">Since <em>Cattani, </em>a majority of the Supreme Court has reasonably focused its definitional efforts on the \u201cspeeding train\u201d type of external force or violence that is most frequently encountered in the workplace: those cases generated by catastrophic external events such as explosions, falling beams, and the like.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That focus led, in <em>Kane v. Board of Trustees, Police and Firemen\u2019s Retire</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number><em>ment System, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>651, 663, 498 A.2d 1252 (1985), to the following formulation, now imbedded in our jurisprudence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-4\">[T]o be eligible for accidental disability retirement allowance, a worker must demonstrate (1) that his injuries were not induced by the stress or strain of the normal work effort; (2) that he met involuntarily with the object or matter that was the source of the harm; and (3) that the source of the injury itself was a great rush of force or uncontrollable power.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-5\">\n<em>[Ibid,]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">By the first part of this definition, the Court has excluded from disabilities deserving of additional compensation those caused by workplace stress, even of extraordinary nature, acting upon preexisting latent conditions. <em>See Cattani, supra, </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>578, 355 A.2d 625. <em>See also Kane, supra, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>at 661, 498 A.2d 1252 (approving Cattani).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">By its second prong, the Court has excluded those disabilities occurring when \u201cthe injured party actually set in motion the object or source of his injury.\u201d <em>Gable v. Board of Trustees of the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>212, 224, 557 A.2d 1012 (1989), <em>citing Kane, supra, Maynard, supra, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>169, 549 A.2d 1213 and <em>Ciecwisz v. Board of Trustees, Police and Firemen\u2019s Retirement System, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>180, 549 A.2d 1218 (1988). For this reason, in <em>Kane, </em>a decision on three separate benefit applications, the Court denied accidental disability benefits to a police officer who applied too much force to his wrist while attempting to close a fire hydrant, thereby permanently injuring it. In contrast, in <em>Maynard </em>and <em>Ciecwisz, </em>slip and fall injuries were declared, by their nature, not to constitute voluntary occurrences (Ma<em>ynard, supra, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>at 175, 549 A.2d 1213), although initial denials of recovery were affirmed on other grounds. Similarly, in <em>Gable, </em>a decision on appeals by two corrections officers from denials of accidental disability benefits, the Court found that officers who sustained injuries in assaults by violent inmates had not met voluntarily with the source of their harm, despite the fact that their work posed a degree of risk. <em>Gable, supra, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>at 224, 557 A.2d 1012.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Finally, the Court has required that the \u201csource\u201d of the disabling injury be \u201ca great rush of force or uncontrollable power,\u201d a requirement that has led to considerable interpretational difficulty, even within the Supreme Court itself. <em>See Maynard, supra, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>at 177-79, 549 A.2d 1213 (Stein, J., concurring and O\u2019Hern, J., dissenting); <em>Ciecwisz, supra, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>at 182-192, 549 A.2d 1218 (O\u2019Hern, J. and Stein, J., dissenting). <em>See also Mazza v. Board of Trustees, Police and Firemen\u2019s Retirement System, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>22, 25-30, 667 A.2d 1052 (Handler, J. dissenting) (the Court holding in a <em>per curiam </em>opinion on narrow, standard of review grounds, that injuries sustained by a mounted park officer when his horse reared, causing the officer to twist and rupture several spinal discs, had not sustained an injury as the result of a traumatic event).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">In the present case, the ALJ and PERS found that Angiola had failed to meet both the second and third prongs of <em>Kane. </em>With respect to the second prong, the ALJ reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">Hero, petitioner was injured when he jumped back in response to seeing a car heading toward his tollbooth____[Pjetitioner acted voluntarily when he jumped in reaction to the car. However ... when petitioner jumped back, he did not intend to come into contact with the counter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-10\">In my view, and based upon the record, I FIND that the source of the harm was petitioner\u2019s action of jumping backward, not the counter. Thus the petitioner has not met the second prong of the test.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">We disagree with the ALJ\u2019s analysis and conclusion in this regard. We find error first in the ALJ\u2019s focus on the character of Angiola\u2019s own actions in response to the threat of the oncoming car. As our prior discussion of the second prong of the <em>Kane </em>test demonstrates, the Supreme Court\u2019s focus has not been on the voluntariness <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the defensive measures taken when confronted with a traumatic risk. Instead, it has been on whether the employee set that risk in motion. <em>Kane, supra, 100 N.J. at 663, </em>498 A.2d 1252. Here, Angiola did nothing that would have occasioned the car that flew at him to go out of control. He was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>not behind the wheel; he was merely performing his duties in the toll booth. He thus did not set in motion the source of his injury any more than did the corrections officers in <em>Gable </em>who were suddenly beset by inmate violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Turning to the third prong, the ALJ held in this case, and the Board agreed, that the source of Angiola\u2019s injury was not a great rush of force or uncontrollable power. In reaching this conclusion, the ALJ disregarded entirely the danger to Angiola posed by an oncoming, airborne automobile, and focused instead solely on Angiola\u2019s conduct in moving backward in response to that danger, which he had previously determined to be voluntary. Thus, the ALJ concluded that \u201c[tjhere was no external force at work.\u201d We find this view to be fatally myopic, since it considers only half of the continuum of events comprising Angiola\u2019s accident and disregards utterly the event that was the precipitating cause of all that followed: the loss of control of a vehicle under circumstances that caused it to be propelled through the air toward Angiola, landing just inches short of the booth in which he was working.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The error in the ALJ\u2019s approach was to break up this continuum into a series of \u201cincidents,\u201d with the last incident being Angiola\u2019s reflexive reaction. This hyper-technical approach is not justified either by the Legislature\u2019s use of the more definitionally expansive word \u201cevent,\u201d or by prior Supreme Court precedent. Here, the occurrence or noteworthy event was the airborne progress of the out-of-control Buick. By all accounts, this event lasted mere moments in time. We know from experience that any event can be \u201cslowed down\u201d by viewing it in small increments. Thus an event of a second can be viewed as a sequence of a million microseconds. However, it remains one event, even when analyzed serially. Whether Angiola was struck by the Buick or injured himself while attempting to escape its path does not alter the nature of the event. A focus on the latter half of the sequence does not mean that two events have taken place. The Legislature could not have intended that, in the former situation, accidental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>retirement benefits would be allowed but not in the latter. Such a result finds no support in the language or purpose of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">When we view the facts presented here in their entirety, we find that they fit comfortably within both the intent and the language of <em>Kane\u2019s </em>third prong, however parsed. If what the Legislature wished to do was to limit the incidence of cases warranting accidental disability retirement benefits to those in which the source of the injury was truly exceptional and thus beyond the scope of those occurrences to which workers must become enured, that purpose is not undermined here. New tolltakers do, and none should be required to confront the threat posed by flying vehicles. If they must, and permanent and disabling injury results, those injuries are just that narrow type of injury for which accidental disability retirement benefits should be available.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Moreover, no one can doubt that a vehicle propelled into the air as the result of an accidental occurrence constitutes a \u201cgreat rush of force or uncontrollable power.\u201d True, in this case the car did not hit Angiola. However, precedent does not impose that requirement, but merely provides that the force or power be \u201cthe source\u201d of the injury. <em>Kane, supra, 100 N.J. </em>at 663, 498 A.2d 1252. The \u201csteam engine\u201d can stop short, so long as the requisite causal relationship to reactive injury is shown. There is no indication that the Legislature intended exclusion of benefits in a case such as this in which a worker is injured as a result of being exposed to a rush of uncontrolled force, and the worker is unsuccessful in avoiding the consequences of the force. Indeed, the <em>Kane </em>Court has signaled as much by including explosion within those causative events that it deemed to be traumatic. <em>Id. </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>at 663, 498 A.2d 1252. Injury from an explosion, like the injury here, does not require a \u201chit\u201d <em>per se. </em>In this and other respects, we agree with the recent decision of another panel of our court, which determined that injuries sustained by a police officer in avoiding a speeding car were as much the result of a \u201ctraumatic event\u201d as they would have been if the officer\u2019s injuries had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>resulted from actual contact. <em>See Esposito, supra, </em>358 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 121, 817 A.2d 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">As a consequence, we find that in reaching its determination to deny accidental disability benefits, the Board clearly erred in its interpretation of the intent of the qualifying statutory term \u201ctraumatic event\u201d and its application of that language to the facts of this case. <em>Matter of Musick, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>206, 216, 670 A.2d 11 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Accordingly, the decision of the Board is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b585-9\"> The Court has included falls from high ladders within this category, without an accompanying description of the circumstances leading to such falls that would warrant recovery of accidental disability pension benefits. <em>See Kane v. Board of Trustees, Police and Firemen\u2019s Retirement System, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>651, 663, 498 A.2d 1252 (1985). As a result, in some cases, the gravitational force generated by the fall has been found to constitute the equivalent of the great rush of force required in <em>Kane </em>for recovery. <em>See, e.g. Quigley v. Board of Trustees, Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>211, 555 A.2d 642 (App.Div.1989) (granting benefits to applicants who negligently fell distances of five and four feet, respectively, on the basis of the <em>Kane </em>Court\u2019s ladder example). We suggest that cases involving falls from points located above ground level could be resolved in a fashion that is more consistent with the rationale of <em>Kane </em>by turning from a focus on the force with which the body hits the ground to a focus on what caused the fall. Despite its use of the ladder example, the substance of the <em>Kane </em>Court\u2019s opinion compels the conclusion that the originating source, not the mechanism of the injury, is implicated by the requirement that the injury have its source in a traumatic event.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b587-12\"> Although inessential to our point, we 1\u2019ind that Angiola's reflexive movement can not be considered voluntary in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
