We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-12\">The difficult issue raised by this appeal flows from an agreement reached by the claimant and her employer. The agreement was embodied in a letter sent to claimant by the employer\u2019s Director of Human Resources. It was dated January 4, 2001, but noted as \u201crevised\u201d on both February 5, 2001, and February 21, 2001. On February 22, 2001, claimant executed the agreement by signing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-13\">I acknowledge that I have read, understand and agree to all the terms of this Agreement and Release and further acknowledge that I have had the opportunity to review it with an attorney.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-16\">The letter agreement provides that claimant\u2019s \u201cemployment relationship that has existed will end effective March 23, 2001,\u201d but \u201cthat as consideration,\u201d she \u201cwill continue to be on active payroll status from March 26, 2001 through May 31, 2002, in lieu of separation pay.\u201d Her \u201cseparation date\u201d was acknowledged to be May 31, 2002. Under the agreement, claimant was to receive a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>gross amount of $69,511.30 in bi-weekly payments of $2,242.30. Her \u201cgroup health insurance\u201d was to be continued under COBRA for eighteen months after the \u201cseparation date or until the attainment of age 65, whichever occurs first.\u201d The agreement required claimant to continue to honor her \u201cconfidential duties under [the] Employee Secrecy Agreement\u201d she executed in 1994, and embodied the settlement of any possible claim she might have against the employer resulting from her termination about fourteen months before she was eligible for retirement and a full pension in May 2002. Accordingly, the letter contained a release of the employer and affiliate companies of all claims and \u201cspecifically ... any claims of illegal discrimination or retaliation ... breach of contract, breach of promise, wrongful discharge [and] unjust dismissal____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">A portion of the hearing before the Appeal Tribunal was not recorded, but when the tape was turned back on, the hearing officer noted, without dispute, what the evidence revealed. Claimant worked for respondent for twenty-three years, and \u201c[s]he would have been entitled to two weeks\u2019 earnings for every year that she worked if she accepted or been laid off and given that severance pay,\u201d together with five weeks vacation time, for a total of fifty-one weeks of pay under the severance package offered to other employees laid off at the same time. There may have been some dispute about additional entitlements. However, it was undisputed, as the appeals examiner noted during the hearing, that \u201cMs. Darby would receive the same amount [of] gross earnings under this agreement as she was [earning] when she went to work everyday and performed her job duty.\u201d Moreover, she did not pay for medical benefits while on the payroll, unlike the persons who were severed.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">On the employer\u2019s appeal from a Deputy Director\u2019s determination that claimant was entitled to benefits, the Appeal Tribunal held that the claim was \u201cinvalid\u201d and that she was \u201cineligible for benefits ... as she [was] receiving continuation wages in accor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>dance with <em>N.J.AC. </em>12:17-8.8(a).\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Board of Review affirmed on the record made by the Appeal Tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Claimant argues that she is not disqualified from the receipt of employment compensation because she was being paid for past services, not ongoing employment. The point is colorable because \u201c[t]he receipt of <em>severance or separation pay in periodic payments </em>or in a lump sum <em>shall not he a bar to eligibility </em>for unemployment benefits.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>12:17 \u2014 8.7(b) (emphasis added), and, under <em>N.J.AC. </em>12:17-8.7(a), \u201c \u2018severance or separation pay* shall mean any lump sum payment or periodic payment made to an individual by an employer at termination under contract or obligation or by custom which is based on past services performed for the employer.\u201d Pursuant to the agreement negotiated in this case, claimant was carried on respondent\u2019s books from March 23, 2001, to her \u201cseparation date\u201d of May 31, 2002, so that she qualified for an age and service pension at age fifty-five. Moreover, as we have noted, during this period, she did not have to pay COBRA, as the severed employees did, and she continued to receive the equivalent of her salary as well as medical and dental benefits. Claimant also continued to accrue time towards her pension.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">In essence, claimant had the best of both worlds: she was no longer in an \u201cemployment relationship\u201d but was on \u201cactive payroll <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>status.\u201d She could even find work elsewhere and earn additional income, subject to certain restrictions contained in the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\"><em>N.J.AC. </em>12:17-8.8(a), on which the Appeal Tribunal and Board of Review relied, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-7\">An employer may elect to continue wage or salary payments and forego the services normally performed by the employee through the date of termination provided for by contract or other agreement. A claim filed by an individual receiving such payments shall be invalid and he or she shall be ineligible for benefits through the date of termination of contract or other agreement. However, salary continuation payments may be used to establish a claim for benefits after the period for which the individual has received such payments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">We do not believe that claimant is entitled to unemployment benefits in these circumstances or that the unemployment compensation system was designed to benefit someone who, though formally being paid for work previously performed or for \u201cpast services,\u201d is continued on \u201cactive payroll status\u201d and receives his or her same pay and benefits in order to achieve a vested pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">This case is unlike <em>Western Elec. Co. v. Hussey, </em>35 <em>N.J. </em>250, 251, 172 A.2d 645 (1961), in which the receipt of \u201ca \u2018lay-off allowance\u2019 equivalent to five weeks wages under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement\u201d did not disqualify the claimant from unemployment compensation benefits \u201cfor the five weeks immediately following the layoff.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Hussey considered the wording of a particular collective bargaining agreement and did not refer to the wording of the governing statute at the time. Moreover, <em>Hussey </em>was decided before the adoption of the Administrative Procedure Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:14B 1 et seq., and there were no controlling regulations. <em>See also Butler v. Bakelite Co., </em>32 <em>N.J. </em>154, 158, 160 A.2d 36 (1960) (claimant entitled to unemployment benefits when injured within two weeks of \u201clay off,\u201d notwithstanding he \u201cwas entitled to a two weeks vacation with pay at the time of the lay off\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">In this case claimant\u2019s \u201cseparation date\u201d was not until May 31, 2002, and we conclude that the Board of Review\u2019s interpretation of its regulation, <em>N.J.AC. </em>12:17-8.8, is not arbitrary, unreasonable or inconsistent with either the statute which governs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>\u201cdisqualification for benefits,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>43:21-5, or the regulation which permits unemployment benefits to one receiving \u201cseverance or separation pay.\u201d <em>N.J AC. </em>12:17-8.7. After all, \u201c[t]he purpose of the [Unemployment Compensation] Act is to provide some income for the worker earning nothing, because he is out of work through no fault or act of his own.\u201d <em>Brady v. Board of Review, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>197, 212, 704 A.2d 547 (1997), quoting <em>Yardville Supply Co. v. Board of Review, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>371, 375, 554 A.2d 1337 (1989) (quoting cases; part of sentence de-emphasized). In any event, we find no basis for disturbing the determination of the Board of Review given the fact that that claimant was disqualified for benefits for the period prior to her \u201cseparation date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b510-7\">We will hereinafter quote the regulation in full during our analysis of the issue before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b510-8\"> The Appeal Tribunal found that, between March 26, 2001 and May 31, 2002, \u201cthe claimant continued to pay her 401K program and she received the same benefits had she continued working'.\u201d Claimant does not expressly challenge this finding, and it appears that the time and contributions were added to claimant's pension, given her acknowledged receipt of \u201cthe same amount of gross earnings ... as she was [earning] when she went to work everyday.\u201d Moreover, although the purpose of the agreement was \u201cto get her to retirement\u201d at age fifty-five, not to obtain service credits, according to the employer's testimony, \u201c[s]he's been earning retirement benefits or accruing towards retirement vesting.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
