In the complaint,' plaintiffs Mayor Sharpe James and the City of Newark (hereinafter referred to collectively as the City) name twenty-eight gun manufacturers, two trade associations and two distributors or retailers as party defendants. The complaint is in nine counts, advancing the following causes of action: defective and negligent design by defendant-manufacturers (count one); defendant-manufacturers\u2019 failure to include safety devices (count two); all defendants\u2019 failure to provide adequate warnings that guns were unreasonably dangerous (count three); negligent marketing and distribution by all defendants (count four); defendant-trade associations\u2019 negligence in failing to develop safer guns (count five); all defendants\u2019 creation of a public nuisance (count six); unjust enrichment of all defendants (count seven); punitive damages (count eight); and all defendants\u2019 liability under the New Jersey Products Liability Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:58C-1 to -11 (count nine).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Seventeen of the gun manufacturers and a distributor/ retailer, defendant Navy Arms Company, Inc., moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>R. </em>4:6-2(e). The two trade associations, defendants National Shooting Sports Foundation, Inc. and Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturing Institute, Inc., filed a separate motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>R. </em>4:6-2(b) and -2(e). By order dated January 8, 2002, Judge Minuskin dismissed the counts sounding in strict liability and unjust enrichment (counts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>one, two, three, seven and nine). However, he denied the motion as to the City\u2019s negligence, public nuisance and punitive damage claims (counts four, five, six and eight).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">By leave granted, sixteen of the twenty-eight gun manufacturers and two distributors/retailers have appealed from the order denying their motion to dismiss. The City has not cross-appealed dismissal of the strict liability and unjust enrichment counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">We affirm. At this posture of the case we are not concerned with the City\u2019s ability to prove the facts alleged in its complaint. <em>Printing Mart-Morristown v. Sharp Elecs. Corp., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>739, 746, 563 A.2d 31 (1989). Our role is to decide whether, indulgently read, \u201c \u2018the fundament of a cause of action may be gleaned\u2019\u201d from the pleadings, <em>ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Di Cristofaro v. Laurel Grove Mem. Park, </em>43 <em>N.J.Super. </em>244, 252, 128 A.2d 281 (App.Div.1957)), giving the City the benefit of all reasonable factual inferences that the allegations support. <em>F.G. v. MacDonell, </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>550, 556, 696 A.2d 697 (1997). Applying that standard, we agree with the trial judge that the City should be permitted to go forward with its claims of negligence, public nuisance and punitive damages. We reject defendants\u2019 arguments that, based on the pleadings, the City\u2019s alleged damages are too remote from defendants\u2019 conduct to satisfy the proximate cause requirement as a matter of law. We also reject their argument that the City\u2019s pleadings do not set forth a cognizable claim of public nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">We first set forth the allegations in the complaint supporting the City\u2019s claim of negligence against defendants. It charges defendants with encouraging an alleged illegal gun market, which foreseeably has fueled crime in Newark and caused the City to expend significant government funds on \u201cpolice protection, overtime, emergency services, coroner and morgue services, pension benefits, health care, social services and other necessary facilities and services ... due to ... the ... distribution, promotion and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>sale of guns.\u201d In the portion of the complaint labeled \u201cFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS,\u201d the City states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-5\">86. For many years, Defendants knew or should have known that by distributing firearms without adequate supervision and regulation they were creating, maintaining, or supplying the unlawful market in firearms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">87. For many years, Defendants knew or should have known that they were producing and selling substantially more firearms than could be justified by the legitimate gun market, and that a substantial portion of their guns would end up in the hands of criminals and other irresponsible persons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">The City adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-8\">Defendants knew or should have known that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-9\">(a) they were producing, selling and distributing handguns in the United States without adequate or reasonable supervision, regulations, restraints or limitation,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-10\">(b) they were producing, selling and distributing handguns in the United States with the knowledge that many of their guns could not be expected to be lawfully acquired, possessed and used by responsible persons, and would come into the possession of criminals and other irresponsible persons;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-11\">(c) they were distributing, promoting, advertising, and marketing handguns in a manner such that it was reasonably foreseeable that handguns would be acquired by unauthorized and irresponsible persons, and/or that they would be used and/or stored irresponsibly;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-12\">(d) the production, marketing, and distribution of handguns, without such adequate or reasonable supervision, regulation, restraints, or limitations, created, maintained, with the foreseeable result being that this would supply the unlawful market in handguns;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-13\">(f) a substantial portion of the handguns they produced, sold and distributed ended up in criminal hands, and were used for criminal purposes;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-14\">(g) as a result of the foregoing, many people would be killed and injured with handguns, and others, including the City, would suffer damages as a result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-15\">As to the City\u2019s public nuisance claim, it alleges that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-16\">134. Defendants intentionally and recklessly design, market, distribute and sell firearms to persons whom Defendants should know will bring those firearms into Newark, causing these firearms to be possessed and used in Newark illegally, which results in increased crime, injury and death to Newark citizens, as well as a higher level of fear to the residents of Newark. This conduct therefore creates an unreasonable interference with the exercise of the common rights of the health, safety and welfare to the citizens of Newark.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>140. Defendants\u2019 conduct in designing, marketing, distributing and selling firearms to persons whom Defendants\u2019 know will cause those firearms to end up in Newark is of a constant and continuing nature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">141. Defendants\u2019 conduct constitutes a nuisance as thousands of the firearms produced by Defendants will be illegally trafficked into Newark, illegally possessed and illegally used in Newark and will remain illegally in the hands of persons until the illegal possession of these firearms is detected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">142. The Defendants know that their actions interfere with the citizens of Newark\u2019s public health, safety and welfare and the public\u2019s right to be free from unnecessary danger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">144. The Defendants\u2019 conduct is a direct and proximate cause of violence, injury, and death to Newark residents as well as an unreasonable interference with the safety, health and welfare of the citizens of Newark as well as the public\u2019s right to be free from danger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-9\">145. Defendants\u2019 conduct, if not stopped, will continue to pose an interference to the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Newark.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-10\">146. The actions and inactions of the Defendants have resulted in numerous incidents of violence and death further resulting in significant costs to the City of Newark in order to enforce the laws and to treat the victims of crimes facilitated through the use of Defendants\u2019 firearms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">In a thoughtful and comprehensive written opinion, Judge Minuskin first rejected defendants\u2019 argument that they owed no duty of care to the City. In finding that a duty exists, the judge considered pertinent policy factors, including the inherent dangerousness of handguns, as well as the public\u2019s concern about gun safety, as evidenced by the \u201cminute and careful statutory regulation\u201d of the gun industry. Citing actions against gun manufacturers in other jurisdictions, the judge observed that \u201con the precise facts involved, a substantial number of courts have determined that a cause of action in negligence passed muster.\u201d As to the public nuisance claim, the judge adopted the definition set forth in <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 821B (1979), and concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-12\">The allegations of the Complaint come precisely within the |R]estatement definition. A nuisance may exist even though the creator conducted an entirely lawful enterprise. A municipality may institute an action to abate a nuisance or for damages. Defendants argue that nuisance actions are predicated on misuse of land and not on a factual context of this kind. Defendants\u2019 brief asserts that a very large number of cases were examined without finding a single case such as this. However, while this may be accurate, there are no cases which hold that a plaintiffs nuisance action such as this may not be brought. Clearly, the action fits within the general principles of nuisance actions herein, and applying the rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>against dismissal of causes of action at their inception, the Defendants\u2019 motion as to the nuisance claim must be denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">[Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">Acknowledging that the City must prove \u201ccontrol\u201d over the offending conduct, the judge nevertheless concluded that \u201ccontrol\u201d is a fact-sensitive issue and must be resolved by the fact finder.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Finally, the judge addressed defendants\u2019 standing, proximate cause and remoteness arguments, and concluded that the City had a sufficient, direct pecuniary interest to have standing, and that the proximate cause and remoteness issues were fact-sensitive and must be left for resolution by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">\n<em>PROXIMATE CAUSE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b336-11\">Defendants argue that the City\u2019s claims fail as a matter of law because its damages are too remote from defendants\u2019 alleged conduct to establish proximate cause. They contend that this principle of \u201cremoteness\u201d applies where the conduct complained of \u201cis at most an indirect cause of the alleged harm\u201d; that is, where: (1) the harm is not the \u201cnatural and proximate result\u201d of the alleged tortious conduct; or (2) plaintiffs harm flows merely from the harm visited upon a third person. For this proposition, defendants cite <em>Camden County, supra, </em>123 F.Supp.2d 245, <em>City of Philadelphia, supra, </em>126 F.Supp.2d 882; and <em>Ganim, supra, </em>258 <em>Conn. </em>313, 780 A.2d 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-12\">In <em>Camden County, </em>the District Court addressed the \u201cremoteness\u201d defense under the rubric of standing. <em>See Steamfitters Local Union No. 420 Welfare Fund v. Philip Morris, Inc., </em>171 F.3d 912, 921 (3rd Cir.1999) (\u201cthe standing analysis ... is drawn from common-law principles of proximate cause and remoteness of injury ...\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 <em>U.S. </em>1105, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>844, 145 L.Ed.2d 713 (2000). As in this case, the County alleged generally that defendant gun manufacturers purposefiilly or negligently produced and distributed more handguns than they reasonably expected to sell to law-abiding purchasers, thereby feeding a known, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>illegal secondary market. <em>Camden County, supra, </em>123 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>at 250-51.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">In granting defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss pursuant to <em>Fed. R.Civ.P. </em>12(b)(6), the federal analog to our <em>Rule </em>4:6-2(e), the <em>Camden County </em>court reasoned that the standing analysis required an inquiry as to the causal connection between the County\u2019s injuries and defendants\u2019 conduct. <em>Id. </em>at 256-57 (citing <em>Holmes v. Securities Investor Prot. Corp., </em>503 <em>U.S. </em>258, 268, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>1311, 1317, 117 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>532, 544 (1992)). Observing that, because of the \u201csheer number of links in the causal chain\u201d between the County\u2019s injuries and the defendants\u2019 conduct, it was \u201chelpful\u201d to apply the six-factor, proximate-cause analysis utilized by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Associated Gen. Contractors of California, Inc. v. California State Council of Carpenters, </em>459 <em>U.S. </em>519, 537-45, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>897, 908-12, 74 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>723, 737-43 (1983). <em>Id. </em>at 258. The six factors identified by <em>Associated, </em>a federal antitrust case, were condensed by the Third Circuit in <em>Steamfitters:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">(1) the causal connection <em>between </em>defendant\u2019s wrongdoing and plaintiffs harm; (2) the specific intent of defendant to harm plaintiff; (3) the nature of plaintiffs alleged injury (and whether it relates to the purpose of the antitrust laws, i.e., ensuring competition within economic markets); (4) \u201cthe directness or indirectness of the asserted injury\u201d; (5) whether the \u201cdamages claim is ... highly speculative\u201d; and (6) \u201ckeeping the scope of complex antitrust trials within judicially manageable limits,\u201d i.e., \u201cavoiding either the risk of duplicate recoveries on the one hand, or the danger of complex apportionment of damages on the other.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-8\">[171 F.3d at 924 (quoting <em>Associated, supra, </em>459 <em>U.S. </em>at 537-38, 540, 542-44, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 908-09, 74 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 737-39, 740-42).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">Applying the six factors, the <em>Camden County </em>court concluded that \u201cproximate cause is lacking____\u201d 123 F.Supp.2d at 264. In reaching that conclusion, it made the following findings relevant to the standing/proximate cause issue: (1) the \u201ccausal connection\u201d was \u201cweak\u201d because of the multiple, intervening links between defendants\u2019 manufacturing of guns and the use of the guns by the criminal element, <em>id. </em>at 259; (2) all of the damages suffered by the County were \u201cindirect\u201d and derivative of the injuries suffered by the victims of gun violence and, even if part of the damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>claimed by the County were for \u201cdirect\u201d injuries, the County could not separate with reasonable certainty the cost of normal crime prevention and the costs attributable to the conduct of defendants, <em>id. </em>at 262; and (3) the County\u2019s damages were speculative and difficult to measure, and any attempt to allocate fault and damages among the defendants would require undue expenditure of judicial resources. <em>Id. </em>at 263.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">In <em>City of Philadelphia, supra, </em>126 <em>F.Supp.</em>2d at 903-05, the District Court,.again applying the antitrust standing analysis, also found that the negligence-based claim of the City failed for lack of proximate cause because its alleged injuries were too remote from defendants\u2019 alleged conduct. In <em>Ganim, supra, </em>780 A.2d at 121-30, the Connecticut Supreme Court reached a similar result in the City of Bridgeport\u2019s action against various gun manufacturers and trade associations.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">We are of the view that the antitrust analysis applied by the federal and Connecticut courts does not fit squarely in a case, as here, involving application of traditional tort concepts under New Jersey law. As the Court observed in <em>Holmes, </em>one of the \u201ccentral\u201d elements of proximate cause under federal antitrust law has been the \u201cdireet[ness]\u201d of the relationship between \u201cthe injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\u201d <em>Holmes, supra, </em>503 <em>U.S. </em>at 268-69, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1318, 117 L.Ed.2d at 544-45. Measuring \u201cdirect[ness]\u201d in the context of anti-competitive conduct and damages does not necessarily square with contemporary tort doctrine, one objective of which \u201cis to ensure that innocent victims have avenues of legal redress, absent a contrary overriding policy.\u201d <em>People Express Airlines, Inc. v. Consolidated Rail Corp., </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>246, 254-55, 495 A.2d 107 (1985). This policy reflects our State\u2019s overarching policy \u201cthat wronged persons should be compensated for their injuries and that those responsible for the wrong should bear the cost of their tortious conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 255, 495 A.2d 107. Nevertheless, we address defendants\u2019 remoteness argument in the context of the antitrust analysis they claim is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>We start by considering the standard applicable to a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under <em>Rule </em>4:6-2(e). The issue here is whether this case is one of the \u201crarest of instances,\u201d <em>Printing Mart-Morristown, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 772, 563 A.2d 31, meriting dismissal of the complaint on the pleadings. If so, we must be persuaded that the allegations as to cause-in-fact contained in the complaint, giving the City the benefit of all reasonable factual inferences that those allegations support, <em>F.G., supra, </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>at 556, 696 A.2d 697, are insufficient as a matter of law to set forth a negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">As a general proposition, plaintiff must prove \u201ccausation in fact\u201d; that is, the result complained of would not have occurred \u201cbut for\u201d the negligence of defendant. <em>Conklin v. Hannoch Weisman, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>395, 417, 678 A.2d 1060 (1996). \u201cA proximate cause need not be the sole cause of harm. It suffices if it is a substantial contributing factor to the harm suffered.\u201d <em>Perez v. Wyeth Labs., Inc., </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>1, 27, 734 A.2d 1245 (1999). In other words, a tortfeasor will be held accountable if its negligent conduct was a substantial factor in causing the injury even when there are other \u201cintervening causes which were foreseeable or were normal incidents of the risk created.\u201d <em>Rappaport v. Nichols, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>188, 203, 156 A.2d 1 (1959). This substantial factor test \u201caccounts for the fact that there can be any number of intervening causes between the initial wrongful act and the final injurious consequence and does not require an unsevered connecting link between the negligent conduct and the ultimate harm.\u201d <em>Conklin, supra, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>at 420, 678 A.2d 1060. Consequently, the fact that there may be, as defendants assert, multiple links between defendants\u2019 conduct and the ultimate harm suffered by the City does not necessarily cancel out cause in fact as a matter of law, given our settled rules respecting foreseeability and concurrent causes.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">For example, the defendants\u2019 remoteness argument is framed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-8\">|T]he City alleges that defendant manufacturers produce guns, and then lawfully sell them to licensed independent wholesalers, who in turn lawfully sell them to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>licensed retail dealers, who in turn sell them to individual customers whose purchase has been approved by federal or state authorities. Only after all these transfers are the guns allegedly acquired by criminals or others who cause actual or threatened harm to members of the public which, in turn, harms the City. The manufacturer at one end of the causal chain is far separated from the alleged harm to the City at the other end of the chain. This causal chain becomes even more attenuated where, for example, there are several lawful or unlawful transfers after the retail dealer sells a gun to the first purchaser or where, within this chain of transfers, the gun is stolen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">This analysis might be dispositive if the City had claimed that defendants in fact control, or reasonably could control, the criminal conduct of the ultimate user. The issue under such a scenario would be whether one or all of the intervening steps cited by defendants severed the causal link between defendants\u2019 conduct and plaintiffs harm, sufficient to negate proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"pAEA\">However, based on the City\u2019s pleadings, the multiple \u201clinks\u201d that form defendants\u2019 remoteness argument in fact fold into a single link. The City alleges that defendants purposely or negligently flood the gun market, knowing that their steady supply of guns will feed or facilitate the illegal sale of weapons to criminals and other unlawful users. Indulgently read, its allegations further charge that defendants individually and collectively failed to develop and in fact discourage the development of reasonable safeguards over the distribution scheme, and that defendants refuse to oversee or supervise the control of handgun distribution in order to prevent the foreseeable channeling of guns to such an illegal market. This conduct, the City asserts, is a natural and proximate cause of its injury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">As noted, at this posture of the case, we are not concerned with the City\u2019s ability to prove the facts as alleged in the complaint. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number><em>Printing Mart-Morristown, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 746, 563 A.2d 31. The City, of course, is left to its proofs to establish <em>not </em>only the truthfulness of its factual allegations, but also that defendants\u2019 conduct individually or in consort was a substantial factor in causing its economic injuries. Whether or not the City survives summary judgment or a motion for judgment of involuntary dismissal at trial will depend on the quality of its proofs adduced through discovery and its trial evidence. As Judge Minuskin observed in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-5\">With no more than paper allegations and a complete absence of discovery, it would be manifestly unfair to bar [the CityJ from attempting to present appropriate evidence to bridge the gap between breach of duty and damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">Defendants further argue that \u201cremoteness defeats proximate cause where the alleged harm to [the City] flows merely from harm to a third person.\u201d Defendants reason that, \u201c[a]part from the \u2018tortured path\u2019 from conduct to harm, all of the alleged harm to the City is derivative. It is not the City who is shot. It is the \u2018citizens\u2019 and \u2018residents\u2019 of the City.\u201d For this proposition, defendants cite <em>Laborers Local 17 Health &amp; Benefit Fund v. Philip Morris, Inc., </em>191 F.3d 229 (2nd Cir.1999), <em>cert. denied, </em>528 <em>U.S. </em>1080, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>799, 145 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>673 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">In <em>Laborers, </em>labor union health and welfare trust funds (Funds) brought suit against several tobacco companies and their agents, advancing a RICO<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> claim, and various common-law claims. <em>Id. </em>at 232-33. The gravamen of the complaint was that the tobacco companies had engaged in deceptive practices and misled the public and the Funds specifically as to the true extent of the dangers that smoking poses to good health. <em>Id. </em>at 233. The Funds charged active concealment by defendants of defendants\u2019 own ability to produce a safer product. <em>Ibid. </em>The Funds\u2019 damage claim was for the millions of dollars they had expended for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>medical treatment given to thousands of their participants who suffer from tobaeco-related disease. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">In resolving the issue of proximate cause, the <em>Laborers </em>court quoted <em>Holmes, </em>which observed that \u201c \u2018a plaintiff who complaints] of harm flowing merely from the misfortunes visited upon a third person by the defendant\u2019s acts [is] generally said to stand at too remote a distance to recover.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 235 (quoting <em>Holmes, supra, </em>503 <em>U.S. </em>at 268-69, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1318, 117 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 544). The <em>Holmes </em>Court articulated three policy factors to guide a court\u2019s standing/proximate cause analysis in RICO cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-5\">First, the less direct an injury is, the more difficult it becomes to ascertain the amount of a plaintiffs damages attributable to the violation, as distinct from other, independent, factors. Second, quite apart from problems of proving factual causation, recognizing claims of the indirectly injured \u2022would force courts to adopt complicated rules apportioning damages among plaintiffs removed at different levels of injury from the violative acts, to obviate the risk of multiple recoveries. And, finally, the need to grapple with these problems is simply unjustified by the general interest in deterring injurious conduct, since directly injured victims can generally be counted on to vindicate, the law as private attorneys general.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">[Id at 269-70, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1318, 117 <em>L.Ed.2A </em>at 545 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Applying the <em>Holmes </em>\u201cindirect\u201d injury test, the <em>Laborers </em>court concluded that the Funds\u2019</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-8\">damages are entirely derivative of the harm suffered by plan participants as a result of using tobacco products. Without injury to the individual smokers, the Funds would not have incurred any increased costs in the form of the payment of benefits, nor would they have experienced the difficulties of cost predication and control that constituted the crux of their infrastructure harms. Being purely contingent on harm to third parties, these injuries are indirect. Consequently, because defendants\u2019 alleged misconduct did not proximately cause the injuries alleged, plaintiffs lack standing to bring RICO claims against defendants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-9\"><em>[Laborers, supra, </em>191 F.3d at 239.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">Other federal courts applying this analysis have reached the same result in other labor fund cases. <em>See Service Employees Int'l Union Health &amp; Welfare Fund v. Philip Morris, Inc., </em>249 <em>F.3d </em>1068, 1071 n. 2 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>534 <em>U.S. </em>994, 122 <em>S.Ct. </em>463, 151 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>380 (2001); <em>Steamfitters, supra, </em>171 F.3d at 933.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">In our view, <em>Laborers </em>is distinguishable. Here, the City is not alleging that it has suffered economic damages for the medical treatment of injuries arising out of illegal gun use. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>City\u2019s entire claim is bottomed on the cost of governmental services. Those costs are entirely distinct and separate from the medical expenses incurred in the treatment of the victims of gun violence. Indeed, the City\u2019s direct expenditures in investigating a gun-related crime occurring within its jurisdiction may involve no injury at all. <em>Accord Cincinnati, supra, </em>768 <em>N.E.</em>2d at 1148-49 (holding that even if no one was shot by defendants\u2019 guns, the City may sustain damages resulting from increased law enforcement, security and other related services, all resulting from defendants\u2019 alleged fueling of an illegal weapons market).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Moreover, the governmental cost of <em>deterring </em>illegal use of firearms is unrelated to the injuries that may ultimately occur to victims, when the deterrent efforts of the City are unsuccessful. Expenditure of public funds to police public schools and the City\u2019s streets in accordance with a deterrence policy is hardly an \u201cindirect\u201d injury. Indeed, deterrence, investigation of gun crimes, and other related services are governmental activities the City is compelled by law to undertake in order to protect the welfare of its citizens. This public service cannot fairly be compared to the \u201cservice\u201d provided by the union funds to their participants, who presumably pay in some fashion for the services rendered.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">We find support for our conclusion in <em>Cincinnati, supra, </em>768 <em>N.E.2d </em>at 1136. In <em>Cincinnati, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court reversed an order dismissing for failure to state a claim the City\u2019s cause of action against gun manufacturers, trade associations and a distrib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>utor. The Court held that the allegations in the City\u2019s complaint had set forth a negligence-based cause of action and rejected defendants\u2019 argument that the City\u2019s alleged harm was too remote and wholly derivative of harm to others. <em>Id. </em>at 1149. The Court treated this issue as one of standing, and it ruled that Cincinnati had standing because it alleged harm to itself \u2014 in the form of increased costs \u2014 as opposed to harm that was merely derivative of injuries to others. <em>Id. </em>at 1147-48. It noted that, even if no one was shot by the defendants\u2019 guns, the city could sustain the kind of damages it claimed \u2014 increased law enforcement, security, prison costs, social services \u2014 all resulting from the defendants\u2019 alleged fueling of an illegal weapons market. <em>Id. </em>at 1148. The Court further perceived no difficulty with respect to proving damages, as the City \u201cis seeking recovery, in part, for police expenditures and property repairs, which can be easily computed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1149.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Similarly, in <em>White v. Smith &amp; Wesson, </em>97 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>816 (N.D.Ohio 2000), the District Court held that the City of Cleveland had alleged an \u201cinjury in fact\u201d to itself that was not too remote and derivative, and that the injury was \u201cfairly traceable\u201d to alleged misconduct by the defendant gun manufacturers. <em>Id. </em>at 824-25. Framing the remoteness argument in the context of duty, rather than proximate cause, the <em>White </em>court held that it was for the jury to decide whether the gun manufacturers breached a duty of care to protect against injuries that were foreseeable. <em>Id. </em>at 828-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Finally, we are not persuaded that the policy reasons advanced by <em>Holmes </em>support a finding of remoteness in this case. <em>See Holmes, supra, </em>503 <em>U.S. </em>at 269-270, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1318-19, 117 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 544-45. By examining the City\u2019s complaint \u201cwith a generous and hospitable approach,\u201d <em>Printing Mart-Morristown, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 746, 563 A.2d 31, we must give the City the benefit of the doubt and allow it to establish through discovery that its damages are, to a degree of reasonable probability, attributable to defendants\u2019 violations \u201cas distinct from other, independent factors.\u201d <em>Holmes, supra, </em>503 <em>U.S. </em>at 269, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>1318, 117 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 545. Further, unlike <em>Holmes, </em>this ease does not involve complicated apportionment of damages among <em>plaintiffs. Ibid. </em>Here, the only plaintiff is the City. Indeed, in this case there is no other party available to seek redress for the loss of public monies suffered by the City. Finally, while this case may ultimately raise complicated apportionment of damage issues among the <em>defendants, </em>that impediment should be the subject of pretrial or trial motions, not a basis to dismiss the City\u2019s claim on its pleadings as a matter of law. We note parenthetically that in other contexts, our courts have articulated apportionment methodologies involving multiple defendants. <em>See James v. Bessemer Processing Co., </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>279, 312-13, 714 A.2d 898 (1998); <em>Sholtis v. American Cyanamid Co., </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>8, 26-28, 568 A.2d 1196 (App.Div.1989). We express no view as to whether the approach taken in those cases should apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">In rejecting an analysis of causation in the context of antitrust law, we do not suggest that resolution of the cause-in-fact and \u201cindirect\u201d injury issues is the end of the matter. There remains the question whether defendants\u2019 conduct, based on considerations of fairness and policy, may, as a matter of law, be considered a proximate cause of the City\u2019s injury. <em>See Griesenbeck v. Walker, </em>199 <em>N.J.Super. </em>132, 139, 488 A.2d 1038 (App.Div.), citing <em>Brown v. United States Stove Co., </em>98 <em>N.J. </em>155, 173, 484 A.2d 1234 (1984) (\u201c[w]hile proximate cause is generally defined as the natural and probable effect of the wrongdoing, fairness and policy also enter into an assessment of the causal relationship between the conduct and the accidental harm\u201d), <em>certif. denied, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>264, 501 A.2d 932 (1985). At bottom, the generic label \u201cproximate cause\u201d is a judicial tool used to limit a party\u2019s responsibility based on notions of fairness and policy. Our Supreme Court in <em>Caputzal v. The Lindsay Co., </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>69, 222 A.2d 513 (1966), articulated this point by quoting Dean Prosser and the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-7\">\u201cAs a practical matter, legal responsibility must be limited to those causes which are so closely connected with the result and of such significance that the law is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>justified in imposing liability. Some boundary must be set to liability for the consequences of any act, upon the basis of some social idea of justice or policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-5\">This limitation is sometimes, although rather infrequently, one of the fact of causation. More often it is purely one of policy, of our more or less inadequately expressed ideas of what justice demands, or of administrative possibility and convenience, none of which have any connection with questions of causation at all.\u201d (Prosser, op. cit. <em>supra, </em>pp. 240-41).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">Thus, the current Restatement contains this qualification, very appropriate in this case:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-7\">\u201cThe actor\u2019s conduct may be held not to be a legal cause of harm to another where after the event and looking back from the harm to the actor\u2019s negligent conduct, it appeal's to the court highly extraordinary that it should have brought about the harm.\u201d <em>Restatement, Torts </em>2d, \u00a7 435(2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-8\">[Id at 78, 222 A.2d 513.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">New Jersey courts have declined to impose liability where there were \u201chighly extraordinary\u201d consequences resulting from defendant\u2019s conduct. In <em>Caputzal, supra, </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>at 79, 222 A.2d 513, for example, the Court held in a product liability case that, even if a defective water softener caused the rusty discoloration of water, defendant was not liable as a matter of law for plaintiffs \u201chighly extraordinary\u201d and idiosyncratic heart attack brought on by anxiety at the sight of the water. However, in <em>J.S. v. R.T.H., </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>330, 352, 714 A.2d 924 (1998), the Supreme Court rejected defendant\u2019s argument that a wife\u2019s failure to prevent or warn others of her husband\u2019s proclivity or propensity for sexual abuse was not a proximate cause of the physical and emotional injuries suffered by his sex abuse victims. Citing the \u201chighly extraordinary\u201d standard under the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts, supra, </em>at \u00a7 435(2), the Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-10\">It does not seem highly extraordinary that a wife\u2019s failure to prevent or warn of her husband\u2019s sexual abuse or his propensity for sexual abuse would result in the occurrence or the continuation of such abuse. The harm from the wife\u2019s breach of duty is both direct and predictable. There is little question, here, that the physical and emotional injuries allegedly suffered by the girls are hardly an extraordinary result of [the husband\u2019s] acts of molestation and that their victimization is not an extraordinary consequence of [the wife\u2019s] own negligence. [The wife\u2019s] negligence could be found to be a proximate cause of plaintiffs\u2019 injuries. <em>See Hill v. Yaskin, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>139, 147, 380 A.2d 1107 (1977).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-11\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Here, as well, accepting the truthfulness of the City\u2019s pleadings, it does not seem \u201chighly extraordinary\u201d that defendants\u2019 alleged purposeful or negligent \u201cfeeding\u201d of guns to an illegal secondary gun market through their manufacturing, advertising and distribution scheme would yield the criminal use of the firearms in Newark, and result in substantial harm to the City itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The question then becomes whether policy considerations compel a finding of no liability as a matter of law. <em>See Perez, supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 27, 734 A.2d 1245 (\u201c[w]e have described proximate cause as an expression as much of policy as it is an expression of the effect of sequential events\u201d); <em>J.S., supra, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 351, 714 A.2d 924 (same). Our Supreme Court addressed that question in <em>Perez, supra, </em>161 <em>N.J. </em>at 21, 734 A.2d 1245, where it held that the \u201clearned intermediary doctrine\u201d does not apply to the direct marketing of drugs to consumers. An issue in <em>Perez </em>was whether, as a matter of law, the intermediary role of the physician, who writes the prescriptions for the drugs, breaks the chain of causation between the manufacturer\u2019s deceptive advertising and the consumer\u2019s injury. <em>Id. </em>at 26, 734 A.2d 1245. The Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AA\">On balance, we believe that the patient\u2019s interest in reliable information predominates over a policy interest that would insulate manufacturers. \u201cProducts liability law is based on concepts of fairness, feasibility, practicality and functional responsibility. We have always stressed the public\u2019s interest in motivating individuals and commercial entities to invest in safety to protect workers.\u201d <em>Zaza v. Marquess and Nell, Inc., </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>34, 64, 675 A.2d 620 (1996).

Culhane and Jean Macchiaroli Eggen, <em>Defining A Proper Role for Public Nuisance Law in Municipal Suits Against Gun Sellers: Beyond Rhetoric and Expedience, 52 S.C.L.Rev. </em>287, 288 n. 2 and n. 3 (2001). No one can seriously debate the issue. New Jersey has a strong public interest in protecting the public from the violence and social cost associated with the criminal misuse of firearms. In our view, such a policy would be undermined by concluding that, solely on the basis of the pleadings, defendants should be insulated from liability as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">\n<em>STANDING</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">As noted, the Courts in <em>Camden County </em>and <em>Ganim </em>addressed plaintiffs\u2019 standing in the context of proximate cause. <em>Camden County, supra, </em>123 <em>F.Supp.2A </em>at 256-65; <em>Ganim, supra, </em>780 A.2d at 118-29. For the reasons we have already expressed, we decline to apply the antitrust standards utilized by the federal courts in resolving the standing issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">In deciding a question of standing, New Jersey courts must \u201cbalance conflicting considerations and weigh questions of remoteness and degree.\u201d <em>Walker v. Stanhope, </em>23 <em>N.J. </em>657, 661, 130 A.2d 372 (1957). <em>See also Interchange State Bank v. Veglia, </em>286 <em>N.J.Super. </em>164, 177, 180-81, 668 A.2d 465 (App.Div.1995) (applying the federal antitrust remoteness analysis in finding plaintiff had no standing to assert a state RICO claim because federal courts have so held under federal RICO statute), <em>certif. denied, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>377, 676 A.2d 1092 (1996). However, \u201cNew Jersey cases have historically taken a much more liberal approach on the issue of standing than have the federal cases.\u201d <em>Crescent Park Tenants Ass\u2019n v. Realty Equities Corp., </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>98, 101, 275 A.2d 433 (1971) (and cases cited therein).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Our courts have deemed \u201cthe threshold for standing to be fairly low.\u201d <em>Reaves v. Egg Harbor Township, </em>277 <em>N.J.Super. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>360, 366, 649 A.2d 904 (Ch.Div.1994); <em>see also Triffin v. Somerset Valley Bank, </em>343 <em>N.J.Super. </em>73, 81, 777 A.2d 993 (App.Div.2001) (same). Standing \u201cinvolves a threshold determination which governs the ability of a party to initiate and maintain an action before the court.\u201d <em>Triffin, supra, </em>343 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 80, 777 A.2d 993 (citing <em>In re Adoption of Baby T., </em>160 <em>N.J. </em>332, 340, 734 A.2d 304 (1999)). New Jersey courts confer standing in those cases where the party\u2019s concern with the subject matter of litigation evidences \u201ca sufficient stake and real adverseness.\u201d <em>Crescent Park Tenants Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>at 107, 275 A.2d 433. <em>See also New Jersey Chamber of Commerce v. New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Comm\u2019n, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>57, 67, 411 A.2d 168 (1980) (same). In making that determination, we give \u201cdue weight to the interests of individual justice, along with the <em>public interest, </em>always bearing in mind that throughout our law we have been sweepingly rejecting procedural frustrations in favor of \u2018just and expeditious determinations on the ultimate merits.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crescent Park Tenants Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>at 107-08, 275 A.2d 433 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Tumarkin v. Friedman, </em>17 <em>N.J.Super. </em>20, 21, 85 A.2d 304 (App.Div.1951), <em>certif. denied, </em>9 <em>N.J. </em>287, 88 A.2d 39 (1952)). A financial interest in the outcome of litigation is ordinarily sufficient to confer standing. <em>Associates Commercial Corp. v. Langston, </em>236 <em>N.J.Super. </em>236, 242, 565 A.2d 702 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>225, 570 A.2d 979 (1989). However, a litigant does not have standing to assert a right of a third party. <em>Jersey Shore Med. Ctr. v. Estate of Baum, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>137, 144, 417 A.2d 1003 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Applying these principles, we conclude that the City has standing to prosecute this action. The City is not asserting the right of a third party; it clearly has a \u201csufficient stake\u201d in seeking redress for damages to it directly attributable to defendants\u2019 conduct. In fact, no other party has a more direct interest in protecting the public fisc than the City itself. Moreover, as previously noted, the expenses incurred by the City are \u201cdirect\u201d and independent of the costs of treating the victims of gun violence. Indeed, even the District Court in <em>Camden County, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number><em>supra, </em>which dismissed the County\u2019s complaint on remoteness grounds, held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-4\">the harm alleged by the County \u2014 the governmental costs of preventing, prosecuting and punishing handgun crimes \u2014 would exist to some extent even if no individual had been injured, and that the County\u2019s alleged injury is distinguishable from that of its citizens. For instance, there are some cases where a gun-related charge is prosecuted even though no shots have been fired. The alleged costs of combating illegal gun possession do not flow solely from harm visited upon a third party; they are alleged to exist as a result of separate and direct harm defendants have visited upon the County itself. Accordingly, the County has properly alleged that it has suffered an \u201cinjury in fact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">[123 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>at 256.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The <em>Cincinnati </em>court is in accord. <em>See Cincinnati, supra, </em>768 <em>N.E.2d </em>at 1148.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">\n<em>DUTY</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">Defendants argue that no duty of care is owed to the City because it attempts to hold defendants liable for the conduct of third parties. In such a case, defendants add, no duty exists absent a special relationship between the tortfeasor and injured party. Defendants conclude \u201c[t]his principle precludes liability on the part of firearm manufacturers for the criminal misuse of their products by third parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">The determination of the existence of a duty is ultimately a question of fairness and policy. <em>J.S., supra, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 339, 714 A.2d 924 (citing <em>Clohesy v. Food Circus Supermarkets, Inc., </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>496, 502, 694 A.2d 1017 (1997)). Resolution of the issue requires the court to balance several factors, \u201cincluding the nature of the underlying risk of harm, that is, its foreseeability and severity,\u201d defendants\u2019 ability to exercise care to prevent the harm, the relationship of the parties, and the public interest in the proposed solution. <em>J.S., supra, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 337, 714 A.2d 924. <em>See also Hopkins v. Fox &amp; Lazo Realtors, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>426, 439, 625 A.2d 1110 (1993). Of all these factors, \u201c[floreseeability of the risk of harm is the fundamental element____\u201d <em>J.S., supra, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 337, 714 A.2d 924. The foreseeability factor is predicated on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>\u201cdefendant\u2019s knowledge of the risk of injury and is susceptible to objective analysis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 338, 714 A.2d 924 (citing <em>Weinberg v. Dinger, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>469, 484-85, 524 A.2d 366 (1987)). Ultimately, whether or not a duty exists implicates the \u201c \u2018fundamental question whether the plaintiff\u2019s interests are entitled to legal protection against defendant\u2019s conduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Weinberg, supra, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>at 481, 524 A.2d 366 (internal quotations and citations omitted)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-5\">The imposition of a duty thus requires an evaluation and a balancing of the conflicting interests of the respective parties. <em>Portee v. Jaffee, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>88, 101, 417 A.2d 521 (1980). That assessment necessarily includes an examination of the relationship between and among the parties. Also implicated in this analysis is an assessment of the defendant\u2019s \u201cresponsibility for conditions creating the risk of harm\u201d and an analysis of whether the defendant had sufficient control, opportunity, and ability to have avoided the risk of harm. <em>Kuzmicz v. Ivy Hill Park Apts., Inc., 147 N.J. 510, 515, </em>688 A.2d 1018 (1.997); <em>Carvalho[ v. Toll Bros. &amp; Developers], </em>supra, 143 <em>N.J. </em>[565] at 573, 675 A.2d 209 [1996].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 338-39, 714 A.2d 924.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">In <em>City of Philadelphia, </em>126 F.Supp.2d at 898-902, the District Court held that gun manufacturers owed no duty under Pennsylvania law to the City to protect its citizens from the unlawful use of firearms by third parties. In affirming, the Third Circuit agreed. 277 F.3d 415, 425-26 (3rd Cir.2002). However, other courts addressing the duty issue have held to the contrary. <em>Cincinnati, supra, </em>768 N.E.2d at 1144-45; <em>White, supra, </em>97 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>at 828-29. We agree with the courts in <em>Cincinnati </em>and <em>White.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">Based on the City\u2019s pleadings, it charges that defendants know or reasonably should foresee the risk of harm, and severity of the harm, associated with illegal use of their products. <em>J.S., supra, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 337, 714 A.2d 924. As Judge Minuskin observed, the dangerous propensity of handguns is self-evident, and the consequence of their misuse is well documented. It takes no undue leap of logic to conclude that defendants should reasonably foresee the resulting governmental costs associated with such misuse. <em>Ibid,.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">Although vigorously disputed by defendants, the City claims that defendants know of the existence of the illegal gun market, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>and have the ability to exercise care to prevent the resulting harm by imposing a more supervised scheme of distribution. The societal interest in the proposed solution is self-evident; defendants will have the incentive to diminish the potential harm to the City and its inhabitants if liability is imposed. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Finally, we reject defendants\u2019 argument that no duty exists because there is no special relationship between the City and defendants. In <em>Clohesy, supra, </em>the Court held that, when the risk of harm is that posed by third parties, plaintiff may be required to demonstrate that defendant was in a position to \u201c \u2018know or have reason to know, from past experience, that there [was] a likelihood of conduct on the part of third persons in general which was likely to endanger the safety \u201d of another. 149 <em>N.J. </em>at 507, 694 A.2d 1017 (quoting <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts, supra, </em>at \u00a7 344 comment (f)). <em>See also J.S., supra, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 338, 714 A.2d 924. In our view, the Citys pleadings satisfy that test.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">\n<em>ARGUMENTS OF AMICUS CURIAE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">Amicus Product Liability Advisory Council, Inc. (PLAC) argues that: (1) the City lacks statutory authority to sue to abate a public nuisance, since an action can be brought only by the State; and (2) the City\u2019s claim for damages is barred by the so-called \u201cMunicipal Cost Recovery Rule,\u201d also known as the \u201cFree Public Services Doctrine.\u201d Neither of these contentions was asserted by defendants as part of their motion to dismiss in the trial court, nor are they advanced or discussed in defendants\u2019 appellate briefs. \u201cAn <em>amicus curiae </em>may not interject new issues, but must accept the issues as framed and presented by the parties.\u201d <em>Federal Pacific Elec. Co. v. New Jersey Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot., </em>334 <em>N.J.Super. </em>323, 345, 759 A.2d 851 (App.Div.2000). Nevertheless, we address the issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">PLAC cites <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:54A-1 for the proposition that public nuisance litigation must be in \u201cthe name of the state.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>statute cited refers to the Attorney General\u2019s or prosecutors\u2019 powers to institute a civil action to abate a nuisance as defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-12. That section of the Criminal Code refers to conduct \u201cwhich engenders the safety or health of a considerable number of persons.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:33-12a. However, neither statute expressly precludes a municipality from filing an action to abate a public nuisance of any nature within its own territory.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">A municipality\u2019s right to abate a nuisance is derived from its \u201cpolice power.\u201d <em>See Township of Andover v. Lake, </em>89 <em>N.J.Super. </em>313, 319, 214 A.2d 870 (App.Div.1965) (it is an entirely proper exercise of police power to protect the health, safety and welfare of local residents by abatement of nuisances); <em>see also N.J.S.A. </em>40:48-2 (vesting in municipalities legislative police power to adopt ordinances in order to protect the general welfare); <em>Mayor &amp; Council of Borough of Alpine v.

This rule holds that a public body cannot recover the cost of governmental emergency services necessitated by a tortfeasor\u2019s conduct, absent legislative authority. <em>In re Oil Spill by the Amoco Cadiz, </em>954 F.2d 1279, 1310 (7th Cir.1992); <em>City of Flagstaff v. Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co., </em>719 <em>F.</em>2d 322, 323-24 (9th Cir.1983). The policy underpinning to the rule is that the government has chosen to bear the cost of such expenditures, and any change in that \u201cfiscal policy\u201d should be addressed by the Legislature, rather than the courts. <em>Flagstaff, supra, </em>at 719 <em>F.</em>2d at 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">In support of invoking the \u201cMunicipal Cost Recovery Rule\u201d in this case, amicus, cites <em>Township of Cherry Hill v. Conti Constr. Co., </em>218 <em>N.J.Super. </em>348, 527 A.2d 921 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>681, 532 A.2d 253 (1987). In <em>Cherry Hill, </em>the Township brought an action to recover expenses of $4,220.80 it had incurred in providing emergency evacuation services after the defendant ruptured a gas main while engaged in widening a highway. <em>Id. </em>at 349, 527 A.2d 921. We affirmed dismissal of the complaint, observing that \u201c[g]overnment has traditionally assumed the ultimate cost of providing basic emergency services that protect the community.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The court relied on the public policy expressed by the \u201cfireman\u2019s rule\u201d cases of spreading the risk of certain losses \u201cby shifting from a negligent tortfeasor to the taxpayers the financial responsibility for a fireman\u2019s or policeman\u2019s economic loss resulting from an injury incurred while responding to an emergency[.]\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Krauth v. Geller, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>270, 274, 157 A.2d 129 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">We respectfully question the continued vitality of <em>Cherry Hill\u2019s </em>holding, since it was bottomed on the policy of \u201cspreading the risk\u201d as expressed by the fireman\u2019s rule cases. The fireman\u2019s rule has now been abrogated by statute <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:62A-21. In any event, <em>Cherry Hill </em>involved a single incident, resulting in a nominal expense to the municipality. We do not accept the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>proposition that its reasoning should apply in a ease such as this, where the City claims a repeated course of conduct on defendants\u2019 part, requiring the City to expend substantial governmental funds on a continuous basis. Finally, there is authority for the proposition that the Municipal Cost Recovery Rule does not apply to cases, as here, where a municipality seeks to recover damages for the cost of abating a nuisance. <em>Flagstaff, supra, </em>719 F.2d at 324. <em>See also </em>David C. McIntyre, <em>Tortfeasor Liability for Disaster Response Costs: Accounting for the True Cost of Accidents, </em>55 <em>Fordham L.Rev. </em>1001, 1023 n. 129 (1987) (and cases cited therein).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Further, the rule has been subject to recent criticism, given the economic realities faced by cities, and the unfairness of the notion that taxpayers must subsidize the conduct of industrial tortfeasors. Timothy D. Lytton, <em>Should Government Be Allowed to Recover the Costs of Public Services From Tortfeasors?: Tort Subsidies, the Limits of Loss Spreading, and the Free Public Services Doctrine, </em>76 <em>Tulane L.Rev. </em>727, 728 (2002). The rule \u201cshould be eliminated\u201d because it \u201cshields industrial tortfeasors from liability ..., constitutes a tort subsidy to industry and functions as an insurance scheme for industrial accidents paid for by taxpayers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 730. The commentator ultimately focuses on fairness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak\">First, [the rule] unjustifiably favors tortfeasors who harm government as compared to those who harm private parties. Second, it imposes the losses caused by this favored class of tortfeasors on taxpayers. In many instances, the doctrine lets industrial tortfeasors off the hook for forest fires, oil spills, and airline crashes and makes taxpayers pay the cleanup costs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\"><em>[Id </em>at 759.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-9\"><em>See also </em>David C. McIntyre, <em>supra, </em>55 <em>Fordham L.Rev. </em>at 1005-06 (the rule \u201cmay not be the most equitable solution to the problem ... in modern society,\u201d given the \u201crecent cuts in federal revenue-sharing programs\u201d and \u201clocal municipalities ... facing very tight budgets\u201d). Finally, without eliminating the rule, industrial tortfeasors have no incentive to purchase general liability insurance to cover the cost of the public services. Timothy D. Lytton, <em>supra, </em>76 <em>Tulane L.Rev. </em>at 766.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-10\">We endorse the reasons expressed by the commentators. Here, if the City has a worthy claim, application of the Municipal Cost <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Recovery Rule leaves it without a remedy. If tortious conduct exists, the consequence is that the gun manufacturers are subsidized for their wrongful acts, and the cost of the governmental services must be borne by the taxpayers of the City. This result is fundamentally unfair, given the City\u2019s limited resources and strained ability to provide other essential services to its citizens. Application of the rule also serves as a disincentive; if culpable, the insulated defendants have no reason to obtain liability insurance to cover the cost of their conduct, or to take reasonable measures to eliminate, or at least reduce, the harm resulting from the use of their product.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Amicus, National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) argues that the complaint should be dismissed for an additional reason not offered by defendants: in reality the complaint states causes of action that sound in products liability, which, therefore, must be decided under the Products Liability Act. Thus, NAM reasons, plaintiffs were required to show that the handguns were not reasonably fit for their intended purpose, and the judge erred in allowing the City\u2019s claim to proceed on a public-nuisance theory instead. We reject the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">As we have noted, all of the counts in the City\u2019s complaint sounding in strict liability were dismissed by the trial judge. The remaining claims, negligence and public nuisance, do not focus on the design defects of defendants\u2019 product or defendants\u2019 failure to warn of its dangerous propensities. Rather, the negligence-based and nuisance claims are predicated on defendants\u2019 <em>conduct; </em>their purposeful or negligent \u201cfeeding\u201d of their product to an illegal gun market. Whether or not the City establishes a prima facie case based on these theories will not, in any way, be based on product liability law.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">\n<em>NUISANCE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Defendants argue that cases cited under New Jersey law limit public nuisance claims to instances involving: (1) a nexus with, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>a defendant\u2019s use or effect upon real property; or (2) violations of statutes or ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">A <em>private </em>nuisance involves interference with another\u2019s interest in the private use and enjoyment of land. <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts, supra, </em>at \u00a7 822; <em>Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts, </em>\u00a7 91 at 652 (5th ed.1984). \u201cUnlike a private nuisance, a public nuisance does not necessarily involve interference with use and enjoyment of land.\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts, supra, </em>at \u00a7 821B comment h; <em>Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts, supra, </em>\u00a7 90 at 643 (a public nuisance \u201cencompasses much conduct other than the type that interferes with the use and enjoyment of private property\u201d). For example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-7\">there are those activities that are a \u201cpublic nuisance\u201d because the defendant is engaged in a continuing course of conduct that is calculated to result in physical harm or economic loss to so many persons as to become a matter of serious coneem. Such activities as practicing law or medicine without a license would be included in this category.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-8\"><em>[.Prosser &amp; Keeton, supra, </em>\u00a7 90 at 651-52.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">Defendants have cited no New Jersey case that holds to the contrary. Indeed, in the context of actions against gun manufacturers, even the Court in <em>Camden County, </em>although rejecting the County\u2019s nuisance claim on other grounds, observed that \u201c[a] claim for public nuisance \u2018may lie even though neither the plaintiff nor the defendant acts in the exercise of private property rights.\u2019\u201d <em>Camden County, supra, </em>123 <em>F.Supp.</em>2d at 264 (quoting <em>Philadelphia Elec. Co. v. Hercules, Inc., </em>762 F.2d 303, 315 (3rd Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>474 <em>U.S. </em>980, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>384, 88 L.Ed.2d 337 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">Defendants contend that, absent a nexus with the use of land, public nuisance claims are limited to a violation of statutes or ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-11\">Section 821B of the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-12\">(1) A public nuisance is an unreasonable interference with a right common to the general public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-13\">(2) Circumstances that may sustain a holding that an interference with a public right is unreasonable include the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>(a) Whether the conduct involves a significant interference with the public health, the public safety, the public peace, the public comfort or the public convenience, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-4\">(b) whether the conduct is proscribed by a statute, ordinance or administrative regulation, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-5\">(c) whether the conduct is of a continuing nature or has produced a permanent or long-lasting effect, and, as the actor knows or has reason to know, has a significant effect upon the public right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">By its very terms, \u00a7 821B does not confine \u201cunreasonable\u201d interference to conduct that is proscribed by statute or other legislative act. <em>See id. </em>at \u00a7 821B comment e (the three categories under \u00a7 821B(2) of \u201cunreasonable\u201d interference are listed in the disjunctive; any one may warrant a holding of unreasonableness).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">We agree with defendants\u2019 additional argument that, in addition to a violation of a statute, regulation or ordinance, a public nuisance may exists if the conduct complained of involves a \u201csignificant interference\u201d with the public welfare <em>or </em>\u201cis of a continuing nature or has produced a permanent or long-lasting effect, and, as the actor <em>knows or has reason to know, </em>has a significant effect upon the public right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 821B(2)(a) and (c) (emphasis added). The comments to \u00a7 821B suggest that each of the categories of \u201cunreasonable\u201d interference must implicate tortious conduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-8\"><em>the defendant is held, liable for a public nuisance if his interference with the public right was intentional or was unintentional and otherwise actionable under the principles controlling liability for negligent or reckless conduct </em>or for abnormally dangerous activities. Liability was not normally imposed for a pure accident that did not fall into one of the three traditional categories of tort liability. <em>In each of these categories, some aspect of the concept of unreasonableness is to be found. </em>If the interference with the public right is intentional, it must also be unreasonable. If the interference was unintentional, the principles governing negligent or reckless conduct, or abnormally dangerous activities all embody in some degree the concept of unreasonableness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-9\">[Id at \u00a7 821B comment e (emphasis added) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">We agree with Judge Minuskin that it is premature to dismiss the nuisance count in light of the definition of public nuisance under \u00a7 821B. Applying the <em>Restatement </em>analysis, the City\u2019s allegations at the very least plead an unreasonable interference with a right common to the general public. The pleadings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>clearly implicate the concept of \u201cunreasonableness.\u201d Finally, they charge that defendants\u2019 conduct was of a \u201ccontinuing nature\u201d and had a \u201clong-lasting effect,\u201d and that defendants knew or had reason to know the \u201csignificant effect\u201d their conduct would have upon the City and its inhabitants.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Defendants add \u201c[f]or good reason, courts are loath to declare as a public nuisance legal commercial conduct which complies with a \u2018comprehensive set of legislative acts or administrative regulations governing the details of [ ... that] kind of conduct,\u2019 as in the case of firearms.\u201d The Ohio Supreme Court rejected this argument in <em>Cincinnati, </em>stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-7\">Even though there exists a comprehensive regulatory scheme involving the manufacturing, sales, and distribution of firearms, see, e.g., Section 922, Title 18, U.S.Code; Part 178, Title 27, C.F.R., the law does not regulate the distribution practices alleged in the complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\"><em>[City of Cincinnati, supra, </em>768 <em>N.E.2d </em>at 1143.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">Indeed, the <em>Ganim </em>court, which dismissed the City\u2019s nuisance claim on other grounds, agreed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-10\">We acknowledge that the definition of a common-law public nuisance is, without more, capacious enough to include the allegations of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. One might well say that the harms alleged by the plaintiffs to have been caused by the defendants\u2019 conduct are harms that injure the citizens of Bridgeport who may be so circumstanced as to come within the influence of that conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-11\"><em>[Ganim, supra, </em>780 A.2d at 132.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">Moreover, a recent commentator has addressed and rejected this immunity claim advanced by the gun manufacturers as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-13\">[T]he government\u2019s power to civilly prevent, ameliorate, and abate a public nuisance has always extended to lawful conduct. Further, there is no basis for manufacturers, or any particular type of manufacturers, to claim immunity. Handgun manufacturers, like the rest of us, can be held civilly liable for then-conduct even if it falls within the framework and regulations of statutory law. The Restatement makes this point emphatically: \u201ctraveling at less than the speed limit may still be negligence if traffic conditions indicate that a lesser speed is required.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj\">[David Kairys, <em>The Governmental Handgun Cases and the Elements and Underlying Policies of Public Nuisance Law, </em>32 <em>Conn. L.Rev. </em>1175, 1182 (2000) (quoting <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts, supra, </em>\u00a7 821B comment f).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-14\">The commentator adds that while it is true that some aspects of gun sales are regulated, \u201cthe reality is that their [the gun indus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>try\u2019s] marketing and distribution policies and practices exist in a regulatory vacuum,\u201d in that \u201cthere is generally no regulation of the quantity, frequency, or purpose of firearm purchases or sales nor is there any national registration of purchasers or firearms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1183. Thus the specific conduct alleged to constitute the public nuisance \u2014 fostering an illegal secondary gun market \u2014 is not closely regulated. <em>Id. </em>at 1183-84. <em>Accord </em>John G. Culhane and Jean Macchiaroli Eggen, <em>supra, </em>52 <em>S.C. L.Rev. </em>at 291 (\u201cInasmuch as gun sale and ownership is legal, terming the conduct of gun sellers a public nuisance might seem at odds -with legislative decisions. Certain practices, however, amount to public nuisances by subverting the intent of the law\u201d). A municipality\u2019s inherent police powers would be vitiated by requiring that the offending conduct violate some specific statute. <em>Id. </em>at 297.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">Finally, defendants argue that there is no liability for public nuisance because they do not control the tortious conduct constituting the nuisance. <em>See State, Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot. v. Exxon Corp., </em>151 <em>N.J.Super. </em>464, 483, 376 A.2d 1339 (Ch.Div.1977) (\u201ca person is not civilly liable for a nuisance caused or promoted by others over whom he has no control____\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Defendants misinterpret the City\u2019s pleadings. As previously noted, the City does not claim that defendants have control over, or the capacity to control the illegal use of the firearms. The City charges that defendants\u2019 intentionally or negligently created and fueled an illegal gun market, thereby unreasonably interfering with the public welfare, knowing, or having reason to know, that their conduct has a significant effect upon a public right. <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts, supra, </em>at \u00a7 821B. The \u201cinstrumentality\u201d defendants \u201ccontrol\u201d is the creation and supply of this illegal market.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">There is no requirement that a defendant have the kind of control defendants suggest \u2014 actual control over the instrumentality of the nuisance at the time and place it does harm. Contributing to a public nuisance through or with the conduct of others is sufficient for liability if the defendant knew or should have known the consequences. In any event, the manufacturers do have control of the products at the pertinent time and place: they use a distribution system they established and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>maintain which they know or should know facilitates easy access for crime and by persons prohibited to purchase. Their public nuisance liability stems from their marketing and distribution policies and practices, over which they have complete control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-5\">[David Kairys, <em>supra, </em>32 <em>Conn. L.Rev. </em>at 1185 (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Another commentator addressed the issue as follows: \u201cTo the extent that gun manufacturers have actual or constructive knowledge that the weapons they produce and sell are being used to fuel an illegal, secondary market, and the manufacturers take no remedial action, they contribute to the evasion of laws designed to limit the dissemination and use of firearms.\u201d John G. Culhane and Jean Macchiaroli Eggen, <em>supra, 52 S.C. L.Rev. </em>at 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">We endorse these views, reject defendants\u2019 \u201ccontrol\u201d argument, and conclude that Judge Minuksin properly denied defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the nuisance claims on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b331-10\"> <em>Recovering the Costs of Public Nuisance Abatement: The Public and Private City Sue The Gun Industry, </em>113 <em>Harvard L.Rev. </em>1521, 1522 n. 2 and n. 4 (2000).
