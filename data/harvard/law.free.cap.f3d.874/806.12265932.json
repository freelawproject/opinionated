CABRANES, Circuit Judge:</author> <p id=\"b835-10\" pgmap=\"835\">The question presented in this appeal is whether the plaintiffs have plausibly alleged \u201ca domestic injury\u201d to their business or property within the meaning of Section 1964(c) of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201cRICO\u201d), the provision commonly referred to as civil RICO.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This question is one of first impression\u2014in this (or any) Court of Appeals\u2014arising from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in RJR Nabisco, Inc. v. European Community.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b835-11\" pgmap=\"835\"> In RJR Nabisco, the Supreme Court held, among other things, that Section 1964(c) of the RICO statute, which gives a private right of action to \u201c[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of [RICO\u2019s substantive provisions, codified in Section 1962],\u201d does not apply extraterritorially.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Supreme Court explained that \u201cSection 1964(c) requires a civil RICO plaintiff to allege and prove a domestic injury to business or property and does not allow recovery for foreign injuries.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Supreme Court did not explain, however, how to determine whether an alleged injury is domestic or foreign.</p> <p id=\"b835-18\" pgmap=\"835\">Plaintiff-appellant Jorge Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n, a citizen and resident of Chile, brought an action under civil RICO in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (George B. Daniels, Judge) against his cousin, defendant-ap-pellee Daniel Elsaca, also a citizen and resident of Chile. Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n alleged that Elsaca, who had power of attorney over Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n\u2019s finances, stole millions of dollars from Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n through several fraudulent financial schemes.</p> <p id=\"b835-19\" pgmap=\"835(78) 836(75)\">In the District Court, Elsaca moved to dismiss Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n\u2019s complaint on the ground that he failed to allege a domestic injury as required by RJR Nabisco. The District Court granted the motion and, characterizing Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n\u2019s injury broadly as a $64 million \u201ceconomic loss,\u201d held that, because individual plaintiffs suffer economic injuries at their place of residence and because Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n was a resident of Chile, Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n alleged only foreign injuries. Its holding set forth, in sum and substance, the following rule: a foreign plaintiff who suffered an \u201ceconomic loss\u201d due to a RICO violation cannot, absent extraordinary circumstances, allege a domestic injury. On appeal, Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n argues that the District Court erred in relying exclusively on his place of residence to determine that he alleged only foreign injuries. He asserts that, because he alleged injuries to property located within the United States, .he satisfied civil RICO\u2019s domestic injury requirement. We agree.</p> <p id=\"b836-4\" pgmap=\"836\">While Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n claims \u2022 a total loss of $64 million, he alleged, in part, the misappropriation of specifically identifiable property that was located in the United States when it was stolen. In particular, he alleged the misappropriation of about $3 million held in a bank account in New York, and the theft of bearer shares, worth roughly $40 hiillion, from a safety\u2019 deposit box also in New York. Because this property was located within the United States when it was stolen, we conclude that Bas-cu\u00f1\u00e1n has plausibly alleged a dom\u00e9stic injury notwithstanding the fact that he is a citizen and resident of Chile.</p> <p id=\"b836-5\" pgmap=\"836\">To be clear, we do not hold that a plaintiffs place of residence is never relevant to the domestic injury inquiry required by RJR Nabisco. Nor do we hold that any contact with the United States suffices to make an injury domestic. Indeed, with respect to Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n\u2019s alleged injuries involving property located outside of the United States, the fact that Elsaca or his co-defendants transferred those stolen funds to (or through) the United States fails to transform an otherwise foreign injury into a domestic one. As noted, however, Bascu-\u00f1\u00e1n has alleged two injuries that have a sufficient relationship to the United States to qualify as \u201cdomestic\u201d under the circumstances presented here.</p> <p id=\"b836-9\" pgmap=\"836\">Accordingly, we REVERSE the District Court\u2019s order granting Elsaca\u2019s motion to dismiss, we VACATE the District Court\u2019s order denying Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n\u2019s motion for leave to file a second amended complaint, and we REMAND the cause to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p> <p id=\"b836-10\" pgmap=\"836\">BACKGROUND</p> <p id=\"ave-dedup-0\" pgmap=\"836\">I. Factual Overview</p> <p id=\"b836-11\" pgmap=\"836\"> We review de novo the grant of a motion to dismiss, \u201caccept[ing] all factual allegations in the complaint as true and draw[ing] inferences from those allegations in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The relevant facts, as presented in Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n\u2019s -Amended Complaint, are as follows:</p> <p id=\"b836-12\" pgmap=\"836(97) 837(9)\">Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n, an only child, inherited a substantial fortune (the \u201cEstate\u201d) from his parents after their deaths in the 1990s. The Estate includes various companies and assets owned (directly and indirectly) by Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n, including shares in Banco de Cr\u00e9dito e Inversiones (\u201cBCI\u201d), the third-largest bank in Chile, of which his father had been president.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the time of his parents\u2019 death, and for years afterward, Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n, who was afflicted with a number of emotional and physical ailments including depression and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (\u201cAIDS\u201d), was unable to manage his own finances. He relied instead on a financial manager originally hired by his parents.</p> <p id=\"b837-4\" pgmap=\"837\">In 1999, Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n appointed his cousin Elsaca as a new financial man\u00e1ger to oversee the Estate. Elsaca, who was eight years Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n\u2019s senior, was a trusted family member with a master of business administration (\u201cMBA\u201d) degree from the London School of Economics and extensive financial experience. According to Bascu-\u00f1\u00e1n\u2019s complaint, Elsaca was \u201ca licensed accountant, prominent Chilean economist, and [formerly] the head of the Superinten-dencia de Valores y Seguros (de Chile), Chile\u2019s equivalent to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n ultimately granted Elsaca a broad power of attorney, which included the power to engage in self-dealing transactions without Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n\u2019s prior authorization.</p> <p id=\"b837-5\" pgmap=\"837\">Over the next ten years, and until Bas-cu\u00f1\u00e1n fired him in 2010, Elsaca and his co-defendants<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> allegedly engaged in a number of fraudulent financial schemes against Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n, illegally transferring about $64 million from the Estate to entities and accounts under their own control. Specifically, Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n claimed that Elsaca perpetrated four schemes: (1) the New York Trust Account Scheme; (2) the General Anacapri Investment Fraud Scheme; (3) the BCI Share Theft; and (4) the Dividend Scheme. We describe each scheme in turn, focusing on the injuries purportedly caused by each.</p> <p id=\"b837-8\" pgmap=\"837\">A. The New York Trust Account Scheme</p> <p id=\"b837-9\" pgmap=\"837\">In 1998, before he hired Elsaca to manage his finances, Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n established the so-called Afghan Trust with money from the Estate. The Afghan Trust, a vehicle for Baseu\u00f1\u00e1n\u2019s charitable giving, was organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands and is administered by the New York office of J.P. Morgan. Importantly, its funds are held in New York in a J.P. Morgan bank account.</p> <p id=\"b837-10\" pgmap=\"837\">In 2001, Elsaca, then in control of Bas-cu\u00f1\u00e1n\u2019s finances, created a second trust: the Capri Star Trust. According to Bascu-\u00f1\u00e1n, the Capri Star Trust\u2014the stated purpose of which was also to finance Bas-cu\u00f1\u00e1n\u2019s charitable goals\u2014was entirely redundant of the already-existing Afghan Trust, and \u201cserved no purpose other than to generate sham fees\u201d, for his cousin.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The only difference between the two trusts was that the Capri. Star Trust named Elsaca as an \u201cInvestment Advis- or,\u201d which entitled him to receive an \u201cInvestment Advisor\u201d fee of 1% of the total value of the Capri Star Trust\u2019s assets each year, notwithstanding the fact that UBS (not Elsaca) actively managed the Trust.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> According to Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n, Elsaca transferred funds from the Afghan Trust\u2019s New York bank account into the Capri Star Trust solely to earn sham investment fees ($2.7 million in total), and to. .pay sham legal fees ($390,000 in total) to Jos\u00e9 Pedro Silva Prado, Elsaca\u2019s personal attorney and alleged co-conspirator.</p> <p id=\"b838-3\" pgmap=\"838\">Like the Afghan Trust, the Capri Star Trust was established in the Cayman Islands and administered by the New York office of a banking and financial services institution (in this instance, UBS AG).</p> <p id=\"b838-4\" pgmap=\"838\">B. The General Anacapri Investment Fraud Scheme</p> <p id=\"b838-5\" pgmap=\"838\">The next purported scheme, which Bas-cu\u00f1\u00e1n dubbed the Anacapri Investment Fraud Scheme, involved several byzantine sub-schemes and resulted in Elsaca, and others, illegally transferring at least $60 million from the Estate to accounts and entities under their control. Simply put, Elsaca created a private investment fund in Chile\u2014the Anacapri Fund (or \u201cthe Fund\u201d)\u2014that took in a substantial amount of money from the Estate and paid back very little: it returned to the Estate only $7.5 million of the approximately $48 million it had under management. According to Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n, Elsaca and his associates simply pocketed most of the Estate assets controlled by the Anacapri Fund; that is, they transferred large sums of money to themselves several times during the Fund\u2019s eight-year existence and retained most of the assets after they liquidated the Fund in 2009.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Estate also paid Elsa-ca investment management fees amounting to approximately 30% of the total value of the assets contributed to the Anacapri Fund, or about $16 million.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b838-6\" pgmap=\"838\">The Anacapri Fund was financed with assets contributed by three foreign entities controlled by the Estate. The Amended Complaint does not describe where the money belonging to those foreign entities was held. Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n did allege that, after misappropriating assets from the Anacapri Fund, Elsaca laundered those assets through bank accounts in New York and elsewhere.</p> <p id=\"b838-9\" pgmap=\"838\">C. Theft of BCI Shares</p> <p id=\"b838-10\" pgmap=\"838\">One of the Anacapri sub-schemes\u2014the BCI Share Theft\u2014requires a somewhat more detailed description. As mentioned above, the Estate included a 1.47% stake in BCI. An entity called Tarascona Corp. (\u201cTarascona\u201d) directly controlled the shares comprising that stake, and Tarasco-na was itself wholly owned by Hofstra Corp. (\u201cHofstra\u201d), an entity belonging to the Estate. Both Tarascona and Hofstra were corporations organized under the laws of the British Virgin Islands (\u201cBVI\u201d) and Hofstra\u2019s interest in Tarascona was represented by bearer shares stored in a J.P. Morgan safety deposit box in New York.</p> <p id=\"b838-11\" pgmap=\"838\">In 2007, Elsaca, or an agent acting on his behalf, traveled to New York and, using the authority granted him in the power of attorney, removed the bearer shares from the safety deposit box. Elsaca then arranged for a Panam\u00e1nian law firm to cancel Hofstra\u2019s bearer shares and re-register them in the name of a new entity created and controlled by him, Nueva T Corp. (or \u201cNew Tarascona\u201d), a BVI corporation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This maneuver effectively transferred control of Tarascona and its only asset, the BCI shares, from the Estate to Elsaca.</p> <p id=\"b839-4\" pgmap=\"839\">At the last step of the BCI Share Theft sub-scheme, Elsaca caused the Anacapri Fund to use Estate assets to purchase New Tarascona, and thus (re)purchase the BCI shares, from him for $43 million.</p> <p id=\"b839-5\" pgmap=\"839\">D. The Dividend Scheme</p> <p id=\"b839-6\" pgmap=\"839\">Finally, Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n alleged that Elsaca stole over $1.8 million in dividend payments earned by the Estate on its BCI shares. Between 2007 and 2010, a Tarasco-na account held at BCI in Chile received over $3.5 million in dividend payments. Elsaca diverted a portion of those funds from the Tarascona account to his personal investment accounts at Morgan Stanley in New York. This purported scheme was rather crude by comparison with the others: Elsaca withdrew funds derived from the dividend payments by writing checks out of the Tarascona account, he endorsed those checks in his own name, and then he deposited the funds into his own accounts.</p> <p id=\"b839-7\" pgmap=\"839\">II. Procedural History</p> <p id=\"b839-8\" pgmap=\"839\">On March 17, 2015, Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n filed an initial complaint, followed by an amended complaint on August 24, 2015, accusing Elsaca and his co-defendants of violating RICO by continuously and systematically breaching the mail fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud, anti-money-laundering, and Travel Act statutes through their actions involving the Estate. On December 22, 2015, the defendants moved to dismiss Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n\u2019s action on several grounds, including for failure to state a claim upon which relief ean be granted under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).</p> <p id=\"b839-16\" pgmap=\"839\">Six months later, after the District Court heard oral argument on the defendants\u2019 fully-briefed motion, the Supreme Court issued its decision in RJR Nabisco, which for the first time required a plaintiff bringing a private action under RICO to allege a \u201cdomestic injury.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In response to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n sought leave to file a second amended complaint.</p> <p id=\"b839-17\" pgmap=\"839\">The District Court denied as futile his motion for leave to amend and simultaneously granted the defendants\u2019 pending motion to dismiss, solely on the ground that Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n failed to meet civil RICO\u2019s new \u201cdomestic injury\u201d requirement.</p> <p id=\"b839-18\" pgmap=\"839\">In determining whether Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n\u2019s complaint set forth a domestic injury, the District Court characterized \u201c[t]he RICO injury alleged [as] an economic loss of approximately $64 million.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It did not consider whether each of the four fraudulent schemes alleged by Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n caused separately cognizable RICO injuries to property or business, but concluded instead that Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n suffered a single \u201ceconomic loss.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b839-19\" pgmap=\"839(53) 840(56)\">Then, in order to decide where in geographic terms it should locate that \u201ceconomic loss,\u201d the District Court drew an analogy to the tort claim accrual rules under Section 202 of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules (\u201cNYCPLR\u201d), New York State\u2019s so-called \u201cborrowing statute.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It observed that, \u201c[w]hen applying this statute to determine where an economic injury accrued, courts typically ask two common-sense questions: [1] who became poorer, and [2] where did they become poorer.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> That inquiry, according to the District Court, \u201cusually focuses upon where the economic impact of the injury was ultimately felt,\u201d which \u201cis normally the state of plaintiffs[\u2019] residence.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b840-4\" pgmap=\"840\">In reliance on that analogy, the District Court held that \u201c[a]ll of the funds at issue ... were purportedly owned by Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n,. and thus, he is the person that-ultimately suffered the loss. And as a Chilean citizen- and resident, he suffered the losses.in Chile.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> It then dismissed Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n\u2019s RICO action for failure to allege a domestic injury. \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0</p> <p id=\"b840-5\" pgmap=\"840\">The District Court favored this residency-based- -test primarily because it \u201cfo-cuse[d] on fhe \u2019 plaintiff\u2022 and where the alleged injury was suffered,\u201d as opposed to focusing on the defendant\u2019s conduct.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> It read RJR Nabisco as standing for the proposition that \u201cthe location' where the plaintiff suffered the alleged injury dictates whether the plaintiff may pursue a private right of action under \u00a7 1964(c).\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b840-11\" pgmap=\"840\">DISCUSSION</p> <p id=\"b840-12\" pgmap=\"840\"> The sole question on appeal, subject to our de novo review, is whether Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n plausibly alleged \u201ca domestic injury to business or property.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> No Court of Appeals has yet to consider how to determine whether a civil RICO injury is \u201cdomestic\u201d or \u201cforeign.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b840-13\" pgmap=\"840(127) 841(13)\">As explained more fully below, we hold, as an initial matter, that where a civil RICO plaintiff alleges separate schemes that harmed materially distinct interests to property or business, each' harm\u2014that is to say, each \u201cinjury\u201d\u2014should be analyzed separately for purposes. of this inquiry. Next,' we hold, contrary to the District Court, that a plaintiff who is a foreign resident may nevertheless allege a civil RICO injury that is domestic. At a minimum, when a foreign plaintiff maintains tangible property in the United States, the misappropriation of that property constitutes a domestic injury. With respect to some of the schemes in the Amended Complaint, Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n has alleged the misappropriation of tangible property located in the United States and thus, to that extent, has alleged a domestic injury. We therefore reverse the judgment of the District Court.</p> <p id=\"b841-5\" pgmap=\"841\">I. RICO\u2019s Statutory Framework</p> <p id=\"b841-6\" pgmap=\"841\">In enacting RICO, which is Title IX of the Organized Crime Control Act of 19.70, Congress \u201cestablish[ed] new penal prohibitions, and ... provided] enhanced sanctions and new remedies\u201d in order to thwart and punish individuals seeking to use illegal means and ends \u201cto infiltrate and corrupt legitimate business.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Although commonly associated with the national effort to eradicate organized crime in America, \u201cCongress drafted RICO broadly enough to encompass a wide range of criminal activity, taking many different forms and likely to attract a broad array of perpetrators operating in many different ways.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b841-7\" pgmap=\"841\"> Specifically, RICO created \u201cfour new criminal offenses involving the activities of organized criminal groups in relation to an enterprise.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Those offenses are \u201cfounded on the concept of racketeering activity,\u201d which \u201c[t]he statute defines ... to encompass dozens of state and federal offenses, known in RICO parlance as predicates.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> A party commits a RICO violation when he engages in a \u201cpattern of racketeering activity\u2014a series of related predicates that together demonstrate the existence or threat of continued criminal activity\u201d\u2014in order to \u201cinfiltrate, control, or operate a[n] enterprise which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b841-13\" pgmap=\"841\">Those four specific prohibitions, which are set forth in Section 1962 of RICO, were authoritatively summarized as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b841-14\" pgmap=\"841\">Section 1962(a) makes it unlawful to invest income derived from a pattern of racketeering activity in an enterprise. Section 1962(b) makes it unlawful to acquire or maintain an interest \u215b an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity. Section 1962(c) makes it unlawful for a person employed by or associated with an enterprise to conduct the enterprise\u2019s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity. Finally, Section 1962(d) makes.it unlawful to conspire to violate any of the other three prohibitions.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> </blockquote> <p id=\"b841-15\" pgmap=\"841(70) 842(20)\">'In addition, Section 1963(a) of RICO makes any violation of those four prohibitions subject to criminal penalties. Sections 1964(a) and (b) authorize the Attorney General of the United States to bring civil proceedings to enforce those prohibitions.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> And Section 1964(c) of RICO, which is the focus of this appeal, permits \u201c[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962\u201d to bring a private civil suit in federal district court and authorizes the recovery of treble damages, attorney\u2019s fees, and costs.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b842-4\" pgmap=\"842\">II. RICO and Issues of Extraterritoriality</p> <p id=\"b842-5\" pgmap=\"842\">A. The Supreme Court\u2019s Decision in RJR Nabisco</p> <p id=\"b842-6\" pgmap=\"842\">In RJR Nabisco, the Supreme Court considered whether the RICO statute applies extraterritorially. The Court determined, as an initial matter, that \u201c[t]he question of RICO\u2019s extraterritorial application really involves two questions\u201d: (1) \u201cdo RICO\u2019s substantive prohibitions, contained in \u00a7 1962, apply to conduct that occurs in foreign countries?\u201d and (2) \u201cdoes RICO\u2019s private right of action, contained in \u00a7 1964(c), apply to injuries that are suffered in foreign countries?\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> In answering both questions, the Court' applied the presumption against extraterritoriality: a canon of statutory construction that requires courts to construe federal laws \u201cto have only domestic application\u201d unless there is a clear and unmistakable indication that Congress intended the law to apply abroad.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b842-7\" pgmap=\"842\">With respect to the first question, the Court held that \u201cRICO applies to some foreign. racketeering activity,\u201d explaining that \u201c[a] violation of \u00a7 1962 may be based on a pattern of racketeering that includes predicate offenses committed abroad, provided that each of those offenses violates a predicate statute that is itself extraterritorial.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b842-13\" pgmap=\"842\">On the second question, the one directly relevant to this appeal, the Court concluded that Section 1964(c), the civil RICO provision, \u201c[ijrrespective of any extraterritorial application of \u00a7 1962,\u201d does not overcome the presumption against extraterritoriality and, consequently, a plaintiff must allege a domestic injury.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b842-14\" pgmap=\"842(90) 843(89)\">In answering the second question, the Court made a point of separately applying the presumption against extraterritoriality to Section 1964(c). It concluded that the presumption against extraterritoriality applies not just to \u201cthe question of what conduct falls within a statute\u2019s purview\u201d but also to a statute\u2019s creation of a private light of action, because \u201cproviding a private civil remedy for foreign conduct creates a potential for international friction beyond that presented by merely applying U.S. substantive law to that foreign conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> For instance, drawing a comparison to antitrust law\u2019s treble damages remedy, the Court noted that it had previously been told by foreign governments that applying U.S. civil remedies to foreign conduct \u201cwould unjustifiably permit [foreign] citizens to bypass their own [nation\u2019s] less generous remedial schemes.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the Supreme Court stated that the \u201cdomestic injury\u201d requirement of Section 1964(c)\u2014more specifically, the fact that RICO\u2019s private right of action lacks language expressly providing recovery for injuries to foreign persons\u2014\u201cdoes not mean that foreign plaintiffs may not sue under RICO.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b843-5\" pgmap=\"843\">Ultimately, because the plaintiffs had stipulated that they waived their damages claims for any domestic injuries, the Court did not explain how to identify a \u201cdomestic injury\u201d and noted only that \u201c[t]he application of this rule in any given case will not always be self-evident, as disputes may arise as to whether a particular alleged injury is \u2018foreign\u2019 or \u2018domestic.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b843-6\" pgmap=\"843\">B. The \u201cDomestic Injury\u201d Determination</p> <p id=\"b843-7\" pgmap=\"843\">The guidance from the Supreme Court in RJR Nabisco regarding what constitutes a domestic injury is admittedly sparse. The Court held that \u201c[s]ection 1964(c) requires a civil RICO plaintiff to allege and prove a domestic injury to business or property,\u201d but it did not indicate what factors a court should examine to determine whether a plaintiffs alleged injury is foreign or domestic.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> We will now turn to the schemes alleged here and their accompanying injuries.</p> <p id=\"b843-15\" pgmap=\"843\"> Before doing so, however, we note that the District Court erred in its preliminary approach to discerning Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n\u2019s injuries. The District Court\u2019s generic characterization of Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n\u2019s alleged injuries as \u201can economic loss of approximately $64 million\u201d is not helpful in determining whether, for purposes of the presumption against extraterritoriality, his particular injuries were foreign or domestic.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> All civil RICO injuries are, by the terms of the statute itself, economic losses of one kind or another. A plaintiff bringing a civil RICO claim must allege an injury to his \u201cbusiness or property\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark>; he cannot, for example, recover for \u201cpersonal injuries.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> As we have explained, \u201c[t]he requirement that the injury be to the plaintiffs business or property means that the plaintiff must show a proprietary type of damage,\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> or, in other words, an \u201ceconomic injury.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b843-16\" pgmap=\"843(51) 844(90)\"> In order to determine where the economic losses alleged by a civil RICO plaintiff are located geographically, courts must examine more closely the specific type of injuries alleged. It is not enough simply to label the business or property injuries, tautologically, as \u201ceconomic\u201d injuries. Because, as the Supreme Court explained, \u201c[t]he application of th[e domestic injury] rule in any given case -will not always be self-evident,\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> this analysis will, as a general matter, depend on the particular facts alleged in each. case. In addition, if a plaintiff alleges more than one injury, courts should separately analyze each injury to determine whether any of the injuries alleged are domestic. If one of the' alleged injuries is domestic, then the plaintiff may recover for that particular injury even if all of the other injuries are foreign.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b844-4\" pgmap=\"844\">Accordingly, we begin our analysis with the schemes that are easiest to analyze: the Dividend Scheme, and the General Anacapri Investment Fraud Scheme. We then examine the more complex issues raised by the New York Trust Account Scheme and the BCI. Share Theft, in turn.</p> <p id=\"b844-5\" pgmap=\"844\">C. Elsaca\u2019s Alleged Use of Domestic Bank Accounts</p> <p id=\"b844-6\" pgmap=\"844\"> We conclude that both the Dividend Scheme, and the General Anacapri Investment Fraud Scheme failed to allege a \u201cdomestic\u201d injury. With respect to the Dividend Scheme, Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n alleged that Elsaca stole funds that were legally owned by a foreign corporation (and beneficially owned by Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n himself, a foreign citizen and resident) and held in a foreign bank account. The only domestic element alleged is that Elsaca transferred these foreign funds to his own accounts in New York. Similarly, the only domestic elements of the General Anacapri Investment Fraud Scheme pertain to Elsaca\u2019s laundering of stolen money using bank accounts in the United States and elsewhere.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b844-13\" pgmap=\"844(51) 845(48)\">That is not enough to allege a domestic injury. Indeed, one could argue that such allegations aie insufficient under a straightforward application of RJR Nabisco, as allegations similar to Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n\u2019s were levied in RJR Nabisco itself.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Bascu-\u00f1\u00e1n does not even expressly argue that transferring money to (or through) the United States makes his alleged injuries \u201cdomestic.\u201d Instead, he seems to argue only that \u201cwhere the alleged RICO injury is the misappropriation of property located within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States, [plaintiffs] have plainly alleged a domestic RICO injury to .their business or property.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> -</p> <p id=\"b845-5\" pgmap=\"845\"> We ultimately conclude that an injury to tangible property is generally a domestic injury only if the property was physically located in the United States, and that a defendant\u2019s use of the U.S. financial system to conceal or effectuate his tort does not, on its own, turn an otherwise foreign injury into a domestic one. We thus hold that the use of bank accounts located within the United States to facilitate or conceal the theft of property located outside of the United States does not, on its own, establish a domestic injury. To hold otherwise would subvert the intended effect of the \u201cdomestic injury\u201d requirement articulated by the RJR Nabisco Court. Because of the primacy of American banking and financial institu-turns, particularly those in New York, a transnational RICO case is often likely to involve in some way, however insignificant, financial transactions with American institutions. Holding that a defendant\u2019s mere use of a domestic bank account could transform an otherwise foreign injury into a domestic one might well effectively eliminate the effect of the domestic injury requirement in a large number of cases.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> In addition, and importantly, .the only domestic connections alleged here were acts of the defendant. Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n and his relevant property always remained abroad, and these injuries did not arise from any preexisting connection between Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n and the United States., To allow such a plaintiff to recover treble damages would thus \u201cunjustifiably permit [foreign] citizens to bypass their own [nation\u2019s] less generous remedial schemes.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark>.</p> <p id=\"b845-11\" pgmap=\"845\"> Accordingly, at -least insofar as they are pleaded in the Amended Complaint, these schemes fail to allege a domestic injury.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b846-3\" pgmap=\"846\">D. Foreign-Owned Property Located Within the United States</p> <p id=\"b846-4\" pgmap=\"846\">The New York Trust Account Scheme and the BCI Share Theft, on the other hand, allege that certain property\u2014although belonging to a foreign owner\u2014-was located within the United States when it was stolen. As explained below, we conclude that the District Court erred in holding that these schemes caused only foreign injuries.</p> <p id=\"b846-5\" pgmap=\"846\">1. The New York Trust Account Scheme</p> <p id=\"b846-6\" pgmap=\"846\"> We start with the New York Trust Account Scheme, in which Elsaca misappropriated funds held in a New York bank account at J.P. Morgan. This alleged injury is an injury to property; money, as has been observed in a variety of other contexts, is property.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Moreover, this injury is analogous to an injury to tangible property, by which we mean property that can be fairly said to exist in a precise location.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> While money is, of course, ultimately fungible, the money allegedly stolen as a result of this scheme was situated in a specific geographic location at the time of injury such that we can treat it as tangible property for purposes of this inquiry.</p> <p id=\"b846-9\" pgmap=\"846(42) 847(26)\"> Accordingly, we consider this scheme to have involved the misappropriation of tangible property located within the United States.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Where the injury is to tangible property, we conclude that, absent some extraordinary circumstance, the injury is domestic if the plaintiffs property was located in the United States when it was stolen or harmed, even if the plaintiff himself resides abroad.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Several considerations support such a rule.</p> <p id=\"b847-5\" pgmap=\"847\">First and foremost, this rule accords with RJR Nabisco and furthers the principles animating the presumption against extraterritoriality. The principal justification for the domestic injury requirement, according to RJR Nabisco, is the need to avoid \u201cinternational friction.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Foreign persons and entities that own private property located within the United States expect that our laws will protect them in the event of damage to that property. That modest expectation is entirely justified, especially when we consider that a foreign resident\u2019s property located in the United States is otherwise subject to all of the regulations imposed on private property by American state and federal law. We see no reason, in the text of the RICO statute or in the RJR Nabisco decision, why we should exclude private property of this kind from the remedial benefits conferred by RICO\u2019s private right of action.</p> <p id=\"b847-11\" pgmap=\"847(146) 848(23)\">Few things could be more destructive to the comity underlying the international system than legal rules that penalize international economic cooperation and deter foreign investment simply because such activity involves \u201cforeign\u201d counterparties. Indeed, the majority in RJR Nabisco took care to make plain that its opinion should not be taken to \u201cmean that foreign plaintiffs may not sue under RICO.\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> That, of course, is exactly the effect of the District Court\u2019s residency-based test. Our rule, on the other hand, does not discriminate against foreigners who own property in the United States: it ensures that both foreign and domestic plaintiffs can obtain civil RICO\u2019s remedy for damage to their property, but only if their property was located within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> In so doing, it protects the interest each sovereign has in regulating the private property situated in its own territory without extending the reach of American law or discriminating against' foreign plaintiffs.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Accordingly, our holding reduces the possibility of international discord.</p> <p id=\"b848-4\" pgmap=\"848\">We also draw guidance from the approach taken by the Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Laws in resolving substantive choice-of-law issues in the context of trans-jurisdictional torts, specifically torts' involving \u201cInjuries to. Tangible Things.\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> The Second ' Restatement\u2019s presumptive choice-of-law rule regarding \u201cInjuries to Tangible Things\u201d directs \u25a0 that \u201cthe local law of the state where the injury occurred to the tangible thing will usually be applied to determine most issues involving the tort ... on the rare occasions when conduct and the resulting injury to the thing occur in different states.\u201d<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Our holding, treating injuries involving tangible property located, within the jurisdiction of the United States as \u201cdomestic,\u201d accords with that presumptive rule.</p> <p id=\"b848-5\" pgmap=\"848\">We consider that rule to be an appropriate reference for determining the location of Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n\u2019s alleged injuries because the interests considered by the Second Restatement mirror the concerns underlying the presumption against extraterritoriality. The Second Restatement explains that \u201c[t]he rights and liabilities of the parties with respect to an issue in tort are determined by the local law of the state which, with respect to that issue, has the-most significant relationship to the occurrence and the parties under the principles stated in \u00a7 6.\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Those principles include, among others, \u201cthe needs of the ... international system[],\u201d \u201cthe relevant policies of other interested states and the relative interests of those states in the determination of the particular issue,\u201d and \u201cthe protection of justified expectations.\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> .</p> <p id=\"b848-10\" pgmap=\"848\">Elsaca\u2019s principal counterarguments are unpersuasive.</p> <p id=\"b848-11\" pgmap=\"848(128) 849(39)\">First, Elsaca argues that our rule is inappropriate here because Bascu\u00f1\u00e1ris alleged injuries are a special type of property injury: an .injury to financial property. He argues that \u201cdifferent rules may apply in cases involving damage to a business or non-financial property, such as real-estate or chattels,\u201d than apply when the alleged damage is to financial property.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> This suggested distinction between financial and non-financial property is unhelpful in the circumstances - presented here. The fact that the property at issue was money, rather than real property or chattels, is of no moment. Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n plausibly alleged that the funds stolen were held in a specific and' identifiable bank \u00e1ceount in New York. In that sense, the Afghan Trust resembled real property or chattels in the only way relevant to our decision\u2014that is, the trust funds could be located within the jurisdiction of the United States at all times relevant to the complaint. Elsaca cannot change that critical fact simply by labeling Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n\u2019s injury \u201cfinancial.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b849-5\" pgmap=\"849\">Next, Elsaca relies on Atl\u00e1ntica Holdings to argue that \u201ca residence-based rule [] conforms with-this Court\u2019s approach to determining where a plaintiff has allegedly suffered a financial injury for purposes of other federal statutes.\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> Based on the circumstances presented here, however; we hold that our Atl\u00e1ntica Holdings decision is inapposite.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b849-6\" pgmap=\"849\">In that case, U.S. plaintiffs brought securities fraud claims against entities from Kazakhstan, alleging that the defendants drastically misrepresented the value of shares that the plaintiffs had purchased.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> In considering whether the plaintiffs had alleged a direct effect for purposes of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, we relied there, too, on choice-of-law rules for torts (albeit the First Restatement), and held that there was a \u201cdirect effect\u201d in the United States because that was where the plaintiffs resided.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> Although we looked to the plaintiffs\u2019 residence in Altantica Holdings, we do not think'a similar method is appropriate here because of the different property interests at issue. The injury alleged in Atl\u00e1ntica Holdings involved the diminished value of ownership interest in a company, for which the clear locational nexus was the shareholder\u2019s place of rest: dence. On the contrary, Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n alleged an. injury\u2014-the theft of specific assets from bank accounts located in New York\u2014for which the locus of the injury is .clearly domestic. ,</p> <p id=\"b849-15\" pgmap=\"849\">Finally, Elsaca argues that conflict-of-laws rules, of which New York\u2019s borrowing statute is a part and on which the District Court relied, provide an appropriate framework for analyzing civil RICO\u2019s domestic injury requirement precisely because \u201cthey serve the same policies as the presumption against extraterritoriality.\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> We agree with the general proposition that the \u201cmost important function\u201d of conflict-of-laws rules, like the presumption against extraterritoriality, \u201cis to make the interstate and international systems work well,\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> but the particular conflict-of-law rule relied on by Elsaca and the District Court is inapposite.</p> <p id=\"b849-16\" pgmap=\"849(69) 850(82)\">. New York\u2019s \u201cborrowing statute\u201d\u2014part of that state\u2019s choice-of-law rules regarding claim accrual\u2014is designed to protect defendants fi\u2019om suits that would, be barred by shorter statutes of limitations in other jurisdictions where a plaintiff could have brought suit.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> It does not account for the interest a foreign sovereign may have in the application (or not) of a particular jurisdiction\u2019s substantive or remedial law.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> In contrast, the substantive choice-of-laws rules set forth in the Second Restatement, the goal of which is to select the law with the most significant relationship to the legal issues and parties before the court, consider a range of factors to identify the appropriate law.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> Those conflict-of-laws rules do protect the interest of foreign jurisdictions. That is, in part, why we considered the substantive conflict-of-laws rule applicable to \u201cInjuries to Tangible Things\u201d to be helpful in determining whether Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n\u2019s alleged injuries were foreign or domestic.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b850-4\" pgmap=\"850\">To be clear, we do not hold that a plaintiffs place of residence is never relevant to the domestic injury inquiry required by RJR Nabisco. A plaintiffs residence may often be relevant\u2014perhaps even disposi-tive\u2014in determining whether certain types of business or property injuries constitute a domestic injury. But with respect to the particular type of property injury alleged here\u2014the misappropriation of Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n\u2019s trust funds from a specific bank account located in the United States\u2014we conclude that the location of the property and not the residency of the plaintiff is the disposi-tive factor.</p> <p id=\"b850-5\" pgmap=\"850\">2. The BCI Share Theft</p> <p id=\"b850-6\" pgmap=\"850\"> In light of the foregoing, the question presented with respect to the BCI Share Theft is whether the misappropriation of the bearer shares, located in a safety deposit box in New York, also constitutes the misappropriation of tangible property. We conclude it does.</p> <p id=\"b850-10\" pgmap=\"850\">Importantly, Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n does not allege that Elsaca\u2019s RICO activity caused a drop in the economic value of these shares.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> He contends instead that these shares were, in effect, stolen\u2014physically stolen\u2014from a safety deposit box in New York. Bearer shares are a form of stock \u201cthat has no recorded ownership information.\u201d<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> As a result, \u201cthe physical bearer of the stock certificate is presumed to be the owner.\u201d<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> It is thus fair to say that, by fraudulently taking possession of the bearer shares (ie., by taking them from the New York safety deposit box), Elsaca defrauded Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n out of his interest in BCI. At the motion to dismiss stage, that is enough to plausibly allege an injury to tangible property within the United States, and thus a \u201cdomestic injury\u201d within the meaning of the civil RICO statute.</p> <p id=\"b850-11\" pgmap=\"850\">CONCLUSION</p> <p id=\"b850-12\" pgmap=\"850\">To summarize, we hold:</p> <blockquote id=\"b850-13\" pgmap=\"850\">(1) The fact that a defendant used bank accounts located within the United States to facilitate or conceal the theft of property located outside of the United States, on its own, does not establish that a civil RICO plaintiff has suffered a domestic injury;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b850-14\" pgmap=\"850(50) 851(41)\">(2) The misappropriation of tangible property located in the United States, on the other hand, causes a \u201cdomestic injury\u201d for purposes of civil RICO, even if the owner of the property resides abroad. Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n\u2019s alleged injuries involving the misappropriation of trust funds held in a bank account in New York, and the theft of bearer shares from a safety deposit box also located in New York, were domestic. The District Court thus erred in dismissing Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n\u2019s Amended Complaint on the grounds that he alleged only foreign injuries;</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b851-4\" pgmap=\"851\">(3) Because it was based on the same legal error, the District Court\u2019s order denying Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n\u2019s motion for leave to file a second amended complaint must be vacated. In the event that Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n seeks leave to file another amended complaint, the District Court should determine, in light of our ruling, whether any such amendment is futile.</blockquote> <p id=\"b851-5\" pgmap=\"851\">For the reasons set out above, we REVERSE the District Court\u2019s order granting Elsaca\u2019s motion to dismiss, we VACATE the District Court\u2019s order denying Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n\u2019s motion for leave to file a second amended complaint, and we REMAND the cause for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p> <footnote label=\"1\"> <p id=\"b835-13\" pgmap=\"835\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c).</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"2\"> <p id=\"b835-14\" pgmap=\"835\">. \u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 2090, 195 L.Ed.2d 476 (2016).</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"3\"> <p id=\"b835-16\" pgmap=\"835\">.

After .the Supreme Court issued its decision in RJR Nabisco, Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n sought leave to file a second amended, complaint (the \u201cSAC\u201d). The SAC -alleged an additional scheme not otherwise mentioned in the Amended Complaint, the \"Tarascona Laundering Scheme,\u201d and added more detail to the allegations regarding the four schemes already pleaded: Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n argues on appeal that the allegations contained in the SAC (in combination with those set forth in .the Amended Complaint) plausibly alleged the existence of several domestic injuries because they asserted that Elsaca stole assets out of accounts located in New York. See Plaintiff's Brief 30. However, the District Court denied Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n\u2019s motion for leave to file the SAC as futile, at the same time as it granted Elsaca\u2019s motion to dismiss, because it too failed to allege a domestic injury, presumably for the same reason. See Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n, 2016 WL 5475998, at *6 n.16 (stating only that \"the proposed Second Amended Complaint also fails to sufficiently allege a domestic RICO injury\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b845-13\" pgmap=\"845(16) 846(250)\">As we have already stated, we conclude that the District Court committed a legal error in relying on Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n\u2019s place of residence to determine whether or not Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n plausibly alleged a domestic injury under the circumstances presented here. We also conclude that, when examined under the proper legal framework, Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n's Amended Complaint sets forth domestic injuries. Because we find it necessary to reinstate Bascu\u00f1\u00e1n\u2019s Amended Complaint, we do not consider the allegations set forth in the proposed SAC to be before us at this time. Instead, because it was based on the same legal error, we go only so far as to vacate the District Court's denial of Bascu-\u00f1\u00e1n\u2019s motion to amend his complaint and leave it to the District Court to determine, in the first instance, whether any further amended complaint is futile in light of our ruling.
