In the accident that led to these proceedings, Volk was inspecting a moored barge when he slipped on some loose stone and fell, injuring himself. He asserted claims against the barge company as his employer, the owner of the barge, and the operator of the rock processing facility, under the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 30101-30106, the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (the \u201cLHWCA\u201d), 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-950, general maritime law, and New York state law.</p> <p id=\"b387-5\" pgmap=\"387\">The principal question presented is whether Volk was a \u201cseaman\u201d within the meaning of the Jones Act. The district court (Sharpe, J.) held that Volk was not a seaman and dismissed his claims under the Jones Act. It also dismissed Volk\u2019s remaining claims.</p> <p id=\"b387-6\" pgmap=\"387\">We affirm the dismissal of Volk\u2019s Jones Act claims because we agree with the district court that Volk does not qualify as a \u201cseaman\u201d within the meaning of the Jones Act. We hold, however, that the district court erred in dismissing certain of Volk\u2019s remaining claims against the owner of the barge and the operator of the rock processing facility. We therefore affirm in part and vacate in part and remand for the district court to conduct further proceedings consisten! with our rulings below.</p> <p id=\"b387-7\" pgmap=\"387\">BACKGROUND</p> <p id=\"AzU\" pgmap=\"387\">I. The Facts</p> <p id=\"b387-8\" pgmap=\"387\">The facts are largely undisputed and are summarized in the light most favorable to Volk, against whom summary judgment was granted.</p> <p id=\"b387-9\" pgmap=\"387\">Volk worked for petitioner-counter-defendant-appellee Buchanan Marine, L.P. (\u201cBuchanan\u201d) at the Clinton Point quarried rock processing facility on the Hudson River, in Dutchess County, New York, as a \u201cbarge maintainer\u201d from 1999 until his accident on May 19, 2011.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the Clinton Point facility, claimant-counter-claimant-appellee Tilcon New York, Inc. (\u201cTilcon\u201d) processes quarried rock for use in, e.g., construction work, and loads the rock onto barges supplied by Buchanan. Buchanan then transports the loaded barges, using its tugboats, down the Hudson River to Tilcon\u2019s customers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b387-12\" pgmap=\"387\">The loading process has three steps. First, before an empty barge is loaded, and while it is tied to the dock, it is inspected by a Buchanan barge maintainer. The barge maintainer checks the barge for damage and excess water and repairs any damage so that the barge is in acceptable condition for loading. Second, the barge is moved to the loading facility by Tilcon, where it is loaded with quarried rock. Third, after the barge is loaded, it is moved back to the dock by Tilcon, where a Buchanan barge maintainer conducts a final inspection. During the first and third steps of the loading process, the barge is in the water and secured to the dock, either tied directly to the dock or to barges already tied to the dock. Moored barges may be three or four barges deep, with the closest barge tied to the dock and the outward barges tied to one another. When a barge was tied to other barges\u2014 rather than tied directly to the dock-barge maintainers would climb over the barges to get to the one they needed to inspect.</p> <p id=\"b387-13\" pgmap=\"387(54) 388(43)\">When Volk was inspecting a barge, he would walk along the perimeter of the barge on the \u201cmargin decks,\u201d which ran the length of the barge. App\u2019x at 185. The margin decks were \u201cso narrow [that] they were difficult to walk on or stand on,\u201d id., lacked guard or hand rails, and were often wet and soiled with excess gravel that spilt over from the loading process. When a barge required repairs, Volk would sometimes stand on a pontoon work boat\u2014a flat floatable device powered by a motor\u2014on the barge\u2019s water side, to do the work.</p> <p id=\"b388-4\" pgmap=\"388\">Volk was not assigned to any specific barge; rather, he worked on all Buchanan barges that arrived for loading at the Til-con facility. Volk was not a crewmember of any of Buchanan\u2019s tugboats that transported the barges down the Hudson River. He worked an hourly shift, went home at the end of each work day, and did not take meals or sleep on any barge. He was a member of the International Union of Operating Engineers, which represents equipment operators. He did not belong to a maritime union or hold a maritime license.</p> <p id=\"b388-5\" pgmap=\"388\">On.May 19,. 2011, Volk was walking along , the margin decks of Barge B-252 (the \u201cBarge\u201d), which had been loaded with stone, when he slipped on excess wet stone and injured his right arm and shoulder on the side of the Barge. He filled out an incident report with his dock supervisor, Timothy Conn, the same day. The next day, Conn drove Volk to the local medical clinic, where Volk was diagnosed with a sprained arm and prescribed pain medication. Later that day, Volk saw a chiropractor, who advised him that he could not work. Volk has not worked since the accident and has been receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits under the LHWCA.</p> <p id=\"b388-8\" pgmap=\"388\">II. The Proceedings Below</p> <p id=\"Aoz\" pgmap=\"388\"> On October 16, 2012, Volk and his wife Karen Volk commenced a personal injury action against Buchanan and Tilcon in New York State Supreme Court, Ulster County. On April 15, 2013, A.P. Franz, Jr., the owner of the Barge, and Buchanan, as bareboat charterer of the Barge,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> commenced this action in the district court pursuant to the Limitation of Liability Act of 1851, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 30501-30512, seeking exoneration from or limitation of liability.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In accordance with Rule F of the Supplemental Rules for Admiralty or Maritime Claims and Asset forfeiture Actions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the court approved a $47,420.77 security bond, representing Franz and Buchanan\u2019s interest in the Barge, directed issuance of notice to all persons asserting claims affected by the limitation proceeding, ordered that any claim related to the incident be filed with the court within a specified time period, and enjoined the filing or prosecution of any suits related to the incident.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> </p> <p id=\"b389-4\" pgmap=\"389\">. Tilcon and the Volks answered the complaint and. asserted counterclaims. Tilcon asserted claims against Franz and Buchanan for indemnification or contribution. The Volks asserted claims against Franz, Buchanan, and Tilcon under the Jones Act, the LHWCA, general maritime law, and New York state law..</p> <p id=\"b389-5\" pgmap=\"389\">The Volks filed a motion to dismiss on August 16, 2013. The district court denied the motion on March 28, 2014. The parties thereafter cross-moved for summary judgment. On March 10,2016, the district court granted the motions of Franz, Buchanan, and Tilcon, denied the Volks\u2019 cross-motion, and granted Franz and Buchanan\u2019s complaint for exoneration from liability. The court exonerated Franz, Buchanan, and Tilcon from liability for Volk\u2019s injury, except for Buchanan\u2019s liability for workers\u2019 compensation. The court concluded that Volk\u2019s Jones Act claims fail because he is not a \u201cseaman\u201d under the Jones Act. The court also concluded that all'of Volks\u2019 remaining claims under the LHWCA, general maritime law, and state law fail.</p> <p id=\"b389-6\" pgmap=\"389\">This appeal followed,</p> <p id=\"b389-7\" pgmap=\"389\">DISCUSSION</p> <p id=\"b389-8\" pgmap=\"389\"> \u201cWe review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to determine whether the district court properly concluded that there was no genuine dispute as to any material fact, such- that the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Myers v. Patterson, 819 F.3d 625, 632 (2d Cir. 2016).</p> <p id=\"b389-9\" pgmap=\"389\">I. Overview</p> <p id=\"b389-10\" pgmap=\"389\"> Maritime workers injured in the course, of their employment may proceed, depending on their status and the status of the responsible party, on four possible the-ones or sets of theories: the Jones Act, the LHWCA, general maritime law, and state law. See generally O\u2019Hara v. Weeks Marine, Inc., 294 F.3d 55, 61-62 (2d Cir. 2002).</p> <p id=\"b389-14\" pgmap=\"389\">The Jones Act confers a cause of action in hegligence to any \u201cseaman injured in the course of employment.\u201d 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 30104. Prior to the passage of the Jones Act, general maritime law entitled seamen only to \u201cmaintenance and cure\u201d from their employer, and to damages \u201cfrom the vessel\u2019s owner for [any] injuries received ... in consequence of the unseaworthiness of the ship.\u201d Chandris, Inc. v. Latsis, 515 U.S. 347, 354, 115 S.Ct. 2172, 132 L.Ed.2d 314 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). Suits to recover for injuries caused by their employers\u2019 negligence, however, were barred. Id. The Jones Act changed this by creating \u201can express -right of action in tort.\u201d O\u2019Hara, 294 F.3d at 61-62.</p> <p id=\"b389-15\" pgmap=\"389\"> The LHWCA is a workers\u2019 compensation system, which provides scheduled compensation for injury to a broad range of land-based maritime workers. Chandris, 515 U.S. at 355, 115 S.Ct. 2172. It covers \u201cany person engaged in maritime employment, including any longshoreman or other person engaged in longshoring operations, and.any harbor-worker including a ship - repairman, - shipbuilder, and ship-breaker,\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(3), but does not include \u201ca master or member of a crew of any vessel,\u201d id. \u00a7 902(3)(G).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The scheduled no-fault compensation structure is the exclusive remedy for injured workers against their employers. Id. \u00a7 905(a).</p> <p id=\"b389-16\" pgmap=\"389(37) 390(156)\">The\u2019LHWCA-does not, however, affect an employee\u2019s right to sue the owner or charterer of the vessel .on .which he or she was injured for negligence. Id. \u00a7 933(a); see also Gravatt v. City of N.Y., 226 F.3d 108, 115 (2d Cir. 2000) (noting that, under LHWCA, employee \u201cmay sue negligent third parties in tort, notwithstanding his entitlement to no-fault compensation provided by the employer\u201d). Pursuant to \u00a7 905(b), a claimant retains the right to bring an action for damages \u201ccaused by the negligence of a vessel, ... against such vessel as a third party.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(b). A claimant is not required to elect between statutory compensation from the employer and an action for damages against another, as he \u201ccan both accept compensation and file a civil action against a third party tortfeasor.\u201d Thomas J. Schoenbaum, 1 Adm. &amp; Mar. Law \u00a7 7-10 (5th ed. 2016). A cause of action under \u00a7 905(b) against the vessel owner is for negligence in maritime tort, id., and \u201c[t]he remedy provided in this subsection shall be exclusive of all other remedies against the vessel except remedies available under this chapter,\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(b).</p> <p id=\"b390-3\" pgmap=\"390\"> In some cases, the vessel owner is also the employer, and a different analysis will be required. Gravatt, 226 F.3d at 118-20; 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(b). In these dual-capacity situations, \u201c[ijnsofar as the employer-vessel is negligent in its stevedore-employer capacity, it is immune from suit under section 905(a), [but,] insofar as it is negligent in its vessel capacity, it will be liable under section 905(b) in the same manner as a third party.\u201d Gravatt, 226 F.3d at 120.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See generally Schoenbaum \u00a7 7-10.</p> <p id=\"b390-4\" pgmap=\"390\"> In short, \u201c[t]he Jones Act allows seamen to recover for negligence against their employers; the LHWCA authorizes maritime workers other than seamen to recover for negligence, but only against parties other than their employers.\u201d O\u2019Hara, 294 F.3d at 62. The two remedies are mutually exclusive. Chandris, 515 U.S. at 355-56, 115 S.Ct. 2172 (\u201c[T]he Jones Act and the LHWCA are mutually exclusive compensation regimes.\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b390-8\" pgmap=\"390\">The Jones Act does not define \u201cseaman,\u201d but, as noted above, the LHWCA excludes from coverage \u201ca master or member of a crew of any vessel.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(3)(G). Thus, courts have recognized that a worker is a seaman if he or she is \u201ca master or member of a crew of any vessel.\u201d Id.; see O\u2019Hara, 294 F.3d at 62 (\u201cIt is ... \u2018odd but true that the key requirement for Jones Act coverage now appears in another statute.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Chandris, 515 U.S. at 356, 115 S.Ct. 2172)). We discuss the elements of \u201cseaman\u201d status more fully below.</p> <p id=\"b390-9\" pgmap=\"390\"> Maritime workers may also have common law remedies available to them, including, as noted, general maritime remedies for \u201cmaintenance and cure\u201d and \u201cunseaworthiness.\u201d Chandris, 515 U.S. at 354, 115 S.Ct. 2172 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Jones Act\u2014unlike the LHWCA\u2014does not eliminate pre-existing common law causes of action. See Miles v. Apex Marine Corp., 498 U.S. 19, 29, 111 S.Ct. 317, 112 L.Ed.2d 275 (1990) (\u201cThe Jones Act evinces no general hostility to recovery under maritime law.\u201d); see also Atl. Sounding Co. v. Townsend, 557 U.S. 404, 429, 129 S.Ct. 2561, 174 L.Ed.2d 382 (2009) (Alito, J., dissenting). And while the LHWCA eliminates common law claims against the employer, it permits harbor workers to sue third-party vessel owners for negligence under federal common law standards that establish certain duties of care. See O\u2019Hara, 294 F.3d at 64-65.</p> <p id=\"b390-10\" pgmap=\"390(26) 391(201)\"> In Scindia Steam Navigation Company v. De Los Santos, 451 U.S. 156, 101 S.Ct. 1614, 68 L.Ed.2d 1 (1981), the Supreme Court set forth standards to guide judicial determinations of liability-under the LHWCA and general maritime law. It identified three duties of care. First, as we have noted, the \u201cturnover duty\u201d imposes on the vessel owner a duty to \u201cexercise ordinary care under the circumstances to have the ship ... in such condition that an ... experienced stevedore will be able by the exercise of reasonable care to carry on its cargo operations with reasonable safety\u201d and \u201ca duty to warn stevedores ... of hazards of which the [owner] know[s] or should know and which are unknown or would not be obvious to the stevedore.\u201d O\u2019Hara, 294 F.3d at 65 (citing Scindia, 451 U.S. at 167, 101 S.Ct. 1614). Second, the active control duty imposes liability on an owner \u201cif it actively involves itself in [the vessel\u2019s] operations and negligently injures\u201d the employee. Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Third, the duty to intervene requires the vessel owner to \u201cintervene if it acquires actual knowledge that (1) a condition of the vessel or its equipment poses an unreasonable risk of harm and (2) the stevedore ... is not exercising reasonable care to protect its employees from that risk.\u201d Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).</p> <p id=\"b391-4\" pgmap=\"391\">Finally, in some circumstances, maritime workers may assert claims under state law. Id. at 68 (discussing claims under New York Labor Law \u00a7\u00a7 200 and 241(6)).</p> <p id=\"b391-5\" pgmap=\"391\">II. Jones Act Claims</p> <p id=\"b391-6\" pgmap=\"391\">The district court dismissed Volk\u2019s Jones Act claims because it concluded that Volk did not qualify as a \u201cseaman\u201d within the meaning of the Jones Act. We agree.</p> <p id=\"b391-7\" pgmap=\"391\">A. Applicable Law</p> <p id=\"b391-8\" pgmap=\"391\"> Congress enacted the Jones Act in 1920 to provide \u201cheightened legal protections to seamen because of their exposure to the perils of the sea.\u201d O\u2019Hara, 294 F.3d at 61 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). It \u201cgives seamen an express right of action in tort because of their status as \u2018wards of the admiralty\u2019 who \u2018are by the peculiarity of their lives liable to sudden sickness from change of climate, exposure to perils, and exhausting labour.\u2019\u201d Id. at 61-62 (quoting Chandris, 515 U.S. at 354-55, 115 S.Ct. 2172). \u201c[T]o qualify as a seaman under the Jones Act, a maritime employee must have a substantial employment-related connection to a vessel in navigation,\u201d Chandris, 515 U.S. at 373, 115 S.Ct. 2172 (emphasis omitted), or \u201cto an identifiable group of such vessels,\u201d id. at 368, 115 S.Ct. 2172.</p> <p id=\"b391-11\" pgmap=\"391(205) 392(14)\"> To have an \u201cemployment-related connection\u201d to a vessel, \u201cthe worker\u2019s duties must contribute to the function of the vessel or to the accomplishment of its mission.\u201d O\u2019Hara, 294 F.3d at 63 (internal quotation marks omitted). This standard is liberal: \u201c[t]he putative seaman need not aid in the navigation or contribute to the transportation of the vessel, but a seaman must be doing the ship\u2019s work.\u201d Id. (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Harbor Tug &amp; Barge Co. v. Papai, 520 U.S. 548, 554, 117 S.Ct. 1535, 137 L.Ed.2d 800 (1997) (noting this prong focuses on whether the worker \u201ccontributed to the function of the vessel or the accomplishment of its mission\u201d). Moreover, \u201cthe worker\u2019s connection to the vessel must be \u2018substantial in both its duration and its nature.\u2019 \u201d O\u2019Hara, 294 F.3d at 63 (quoting Tonnesen v. Yonkers Contracting Co., 82 F.3d 30, 32 n.2 (2d Cir. 1996)). This inquiry \u201cfocuses on whether the [worker] derives his livelihood from sea-based activities.\u201d Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cLand-based maritime workers do not become seamen because they happen to be working on board a vessel when they are injured, and seamen do not lose Jones Act protection when the course of their service to a vessel takes them ashore.\u201d Chandris, 515 U.S. at 361, 115 S.Ct. 2172.</p> <p id=\"b392-4\" pgmap=\"392\"> Nevertheless, the \u201crecognized [ ] distinction between land-based and sea-based maritime workers\u201d does not mean \u201cthat a maritime employee must work only on board a vessel to qualify as a seaman under the Jones Act.\u201d Id. at 363, 115 S.Ct. 2172. Rather, \u201cthe ultimate inquiry\u201d is whether, in light of 'the totality of the' circumstances, \u201cthe worker in question is a member of the vessel\u2019s crew or simply a land-based employee who happens to be working on the vessel at a given time.\u201d Id. at 370, 115 S.Ct. 2172; see also Harbor Tug &amp; Barge Co., 520 U.S. at 555, 117 S.Ct. 1535 (\u201cFor the substantial connection requirement to serve its purpose, the inquiry into the nature of the employee\u2019s connection to the vessel must concentrate on whether the employee\u2019s duties take him to sea.\u201d). \u201cWhether [a worker] qualifies as a seaman \u2018is a mixed'question of law and fact.\u2019 \u201d O\u2019Hara, 294 F.3d at 63-64 (quoting Harbor Tug &amp; Barge Co., 520 U.S. at 554, 117 S.Ct. 1535).</p> <p id=\"b392-5\" pgmap=\"392\"> The Supreme Court has emphasized that it is important \u201cto focus upon the essence of what it means to be a seaman and to eschew the temptation to create detailed tests to effectuate the congressional purpose.\u201d Chandris, 515 U.S. at 369, 115 S.Ct. 2172. \u201cThe Jones Act remedy is reserved for sea-based maritime employees whose work regularly exposes them to \u2018the special hazards and disadvantages to which they who go down to sea in ships are subjected.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 370, 115 S.Ct. 2172 (quoting Seas Shipping Co. v. Sieracki, 328 U.S. 85, 104, 66 S.Ct. 872, 90 L.Ed. 1099 (1946) (Stone, C.J., dissenting)). The key is whether the individual \u201c \u2018had a sufficient-relation to the navigation of vessels and the perils attendant thereon.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Wallace v. Oceaneering Int\u2019l, 727 F.2d 427, 435 (5th Cir. 1984)).</p> <p id=\"b392-8\" pgmap=\"392\">B. Application</p> <p id=\"b392-9\" pgmap=\"392\"> In weighing \u201cthe total circumstances\u201d of Volk\u2019s employment, we -conclude as a matter of law that Volk does not qualify as a seaman under the Jones Act. See id. As a reasonable. factfinder could only conclude, his work on the barges did not regularly expose him to the special hazards and disadvantages of the sea. See id. at 369-70, 115 S.Ct. 2172.</p> <p id=\"b392-10\" pgmap=\"392(124) 393(134)\">Volk did not \u201cderive[] his livelihood from sea-based activities.\u201d O\u2019Hara, 294 F.3d at 64 (internal quotation-marks omitted). Volk never, operated a barge and only-worked aboard the barges when they were secured to the dock. See Harbor Tug &amp; Barge Co., 520 U.S. at 555, 117 S.Ct. 1535 (\u201cFor the substantial connection requirement to serve its purpose, the inquiry into the nature of the employee\u2019s connection to the vessel must concentrate on whether the employee\u2019s duties take him to sea.\u201d). The barges Volk worked on were moved to the loading dock by Tilcon workboats and Tilcon employees, and transported down the Hudson River by Buchanan tugboats.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Volk was not a crew member of and did not serve on the Buchanan tugboats.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Indeed, Volk reported to the dock foreman, not a ship\u2019s officer,.-and it was the dock foreman who brought him to the medical clinic after his accident. Volk belonged to a union that represents equipment operators. He did not belong to a maritime union and did not hold a maritime license or other \u201cseaman\u2019s papers.\u201d O\u2019Hara, 294 F.3d at 64. Finally, Volk never spent the night aboard a barge; he worked an hourly shift and went home every night after his shift ended. In contrast, a traditional Jones Act seaman normally serves for voyages or tours of duty. See, e.g., Aguilar v. Standard Oil Co., 318 U.S. 724, 731-32, 63 S.Ct. 930, 87 L.Ed. 1107 (1943) (voyages); Sellers v. Dixilyn Corp., 433 F.2d 446, 447-48 (5th Cir. 1970) (tours of duty).</p> <p id=\"b393-5\" pgmap=\"393\">In O\u2019Hara, we concluded that a dockworker who was injured while repairing the Staten Island pier aboard a barge was not a \u201cseaman\u201d as a matter of law because he had, at most, \u201ca transitory or sporadic connection\u201d to the barges \u201cin their capacity as vessels in navigation,\u201d 294 F.3d at 64 (emphasis omitted). Key to our holding was that the dock worker (1) belonged to a dock workers union rather than a maritime union, (2) lacked a maritime license, (3) never spent the night aboard a barge, and (4) never operated a barge or assisted in its navigation and only worked aboard the barges when they were fully secured to the pier that the dock worker was employed to repair. Id. We emphasized that, although the worker \u201cspent more ' than half his working hours ... aboard the barges, ... he spent all of that time performing tasks related to the repair of the Staten Island pier while the barges were secured to the pier.\u201d Id. This case is not substantially different from O\u2019Hara.</p> <p id=\"b393-8\" pgmap=\"393\">' Volk seeks to rely on the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision in Naquin v. Elevating Boats, LLC, 744 F.3d 927 (5th Cir. 2014), cert. denied - U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 1397, 191 L.Ed.2d 359 (2015). There,' a shipyard worker \u201cspent approximately 70 percent of his total' time working aboard\u201d so-called \u201clift-boats\u201d that \u201cwere moored, jacked up or docked iii [the] shipyard canal.\u201d Id. at 930. His duties included \u201cinspecting [the lift-boats] for repairs, cleaning them, painting them, replacing defective or damaged parts, performing engine repairs, going on test runs, securing equipment, and operating the vessels\u2019 marine cranes and jack-up legs.\u201d Id. The worker was occasionally \u201cdispatched ... to repair a vessel or fill in as a vessel crane operator while the vessel was operating in open water.\u201d Id. at 931. The Fifth Circuit affirmed the, jury verdict in favor of the shipyard worker awarding Jones Act damages, finding that the shipyard worker was exposed to the perils of a maritime work- environment such that he was a seaman. Id. at 935.</p> <p id=\"b393-11\" pgmap=\"393(97) 394(79)\">The Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision is not controlling on us, and it is in any event distinguishable. The- shipyard worker there clearly had a more substantial connection to seafaring vessels than Volk does. For example, the shipyard worker operated \u201cthe vessels\u2019 marine cranes and jack-up legs\u201d and worked aboard the vessels in open water, even if only \u201coccasionally.\u201d Id. at 930. Volk did none of these things; Volk worked \u25a0 on barges that were moored, directly or indirectly, to the Tilcon dock and did not operate the Tilcon workboats or Buchanan tugboats that transported the barges. See Schultz v. Louisiana Dock Co., 94 F.Supp.2d 746, 750 (E.D. La. 2000) (\u201cPlaintiffs duties were limited to inspecting and repairing barges moored at the facility. He did not go to sea or face the perils of the sea in the manner associated with seaman status. Plaintiff ate meals ashore and went home every night. He admitted that with respect to the vessels used to transport him around the facility he did not serve as a deckhand.\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b394-4\" pgmap=\"394\">In sum, none of Volk\u2019s work was of a seagoing nature. Volk\u2019s duties were limited to inspecting and repairing barges that were secured to the dock at the Clinton Point facility. Volk did not go to sea and he was not exposed to the \u201cperils of the sea\u201d in the manner associated with seaman status. See Denson v. Ingram Barge Co., 5:07-cv-00084-R, 2009 WL 1033817, at *3 (W.D. Ky. Apr. 16, 2009) (\u201cThe hazards Denson states he faced do not rise to the level of the special hazards and disadvantages faced by seamen; they are hazards that longshoremen commonly encounter. Therefore, Denson was an intended beneficiary of the LHWCA.\u201d). Accordingly, considering the total circumstances of Volk\u2019s employment, we conclude as a matter of law that Volk does not qualify as a \u201cseaman\u201d within the meaning of the Jones Act, and we affirm the dismissal of his Jones Act claims.</p> <p id=\"b394-5\" pgmap=\"394\">III. Other Claims</p> <p id=\"b394-6\" pgmap=\"394\">Volk also asserted claims under the LHWCA, general maritime law, and New York law against all three appellees: Buchanan, Franz, and Tilcon. The district court dismissed all these claims. We conclude that the district court should have permitted certain of these claims to proceed.</p> <p id=\"b394-7\" pgmap=\"394\">A. Buchanan</p> <p id=\"b394-8\" pgmap=\"394\"> The district court correctly dismissed all the remaining claims against Buchanan. Buchanan is Volk\u2019s employer and ordinarily would be immune from suit under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(a). As bareboat charterer of the Barge, however, Buchanan is a dual capacity employer-vessel owner. See Reed v. S.S. Yaka, 373 U.S. 410, 412, 83 S.Ct. 1349, 10 L.Ed.2d 448 (1963) (\u201cIt has long been recognized in the law of admiralty that for many, if not most, purposes the bareboat charterer is to be treated as the owner.\u201d). Therefore, if Buchanan were negligent in its vessel capacity in relation to Volk\u2019s injury, Buchanan would be liable under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(b) in the same manner as a third party. Gravatt, 226 F.3d at 119. The district court ruled that Buchanan was not acting in a capacity as vessel owner in relation to Volk\u2019s injury, and therefore is liable exclusively for Volk\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation payments under the LHWCA. See 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(a) (stating that employer is liable exclusively for scheduled no-fault compensation). Volk does not challenge that ruling on appeal. Because the statutory, no-fault compensation payments under the LHWCA are Volk\u2019s exclusive remedy as to Buchanan, his general maritime law and state law claims against Buchanan were properly dismissed. See id.</p> <p id=\"b394-10\" pgmap=\"394\">B. Franz</p> <p id=\"b394-11\" pgmap=\"394\"> As vessel owner, Franz was subject to suit for negligence under the LHWCA. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(b). Although the district court correctly noted that Franz was not an employer or bareboat charterer of the Barge and therefore was only responsible for his \u201cturnover duty,\u201d see O\u2019hara, 294 F.3d at 65, the district court did not properly analyze the LHWCA claims. While he could not be responsible for the presence of excess stone, Franz arguably had a duty, as owner, to address the condition of the Barge before turning it over to Buchanan.</p> <p id=\"b395-4\" pgmap=\"395\">As the district court itself recognized, Volk\u2019s negligence claim could have been based on the condition of the vessel, not just the presence of excess stone on the margin deck. See Special App\u2019x at 27 (\u201cThe alleged negligence which caused W. Volk\u2019s injury could plausibly originate from one of two sources. The first is where the stones reached the margin deck of the B-252 from a barge weeper, which is a drainage hole on the side of a barge. The second is where the stones could have been overloaded by Tilcon and spilled onto the margin deck.\u201d (citation omitted and emphasis added)). On remand, the district court shall consider whether there is a viable claim under \u00a7 905(b) of the LHWCA against Franz as owner based on the condition of the vessel. See Gravatt, 226 F.3d at 115 (\u201c[T]he employee may sue negligent third parties in tort.\u201d); see also Pellegrino v. A.H. Bull S.S. Co., 309 F.Supp. 839, 842 (S.D.N.Y. 1969) (\u201cThe shipowner owes an absolute and non-delegable duty to ... longshoremen properly aboard its vessel to provide a seaworthy ship.\u201d). As that statute is the sole basis under which Volk can recover against Franz, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905(b), the general maritime and state law claims otherwise must be dismissed. See Norfolk Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Corp. v. Garris, 532 U.S. 811, 818, 121 S.Ct. 1927, 150 L.Ed.2d 34 (2001) (noting that the LHWCA preempts all other claims against a vessel owner).</p> <p id=\"b395-5\" pgmap=\"395\">C. Tilcon</p> <p id=\"b395-6\" pgmap=\"395\"> The district court correctly held that Tilcon, the operator of the rock processing facility, has no LHWCA liability because it did not employ Volk or own the Barge. See 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905. The district court also correctly held that the general maritime claims asserted against Til-con fail because Tilcon is not an owner of the Barge and because Volk is not a seaman. Tilcon had no duty to provide a seaworthy vessel or to provide maintenance and cure because it did not own the Barge. See Oxley v. City of New York, 923 F.2d 22, 24-25 (2d Cir. 1991) (noting that a vessel owner has a duty to supply a seaworthy vessel); Lewis v. Lewis &amp; Clark Marine, Inc., 531 U.S. 438, 441, 121 S.Ct. 993, 148 L.Ed.2d 931 (2001) (\u201cA claim for maintenance and cure concerns the vessel owner\u2019s obligation to provide food, lodging, and medical services to a seaman injured while serving the ship.\u201d). Further, Volk is not entitled to maintenance and cure because he is not a seaman. See 1B-IV Benedict on Admiralty \u00a7 44 (2015) (\u201cLongshoremen, of course, have never been entitled to maintenance and cure.\u201d).</p> <p id=\"b395-8\" pgmap=\"395(197) 396(28)\"> The district court erred, however, in dismissing Volk\u2019s New York state law claims against Tilcon for negligence, gross negligence, and violations of N.Y. Labor Law \u00a7 200. The district court determined that these claims failed because the alleged hazard\u2014the presence of excess stone on the margin deck of the Barge\u2014 was open and obvious. The district court\u2019s holding in this regard was based on an error of law. New York law utilizes a comparative negligence scheme, meaning the doctrines of contributory negligence and assumption of risk are not complete defenses as a matter of law. See Integrated Waste Servs., Inc. v. Akzo Nobel Salt, Inc., 113 F.3d 296, 300 (2d Cir. 1997) (\u201c[W]hen New York, by statute, adopted comparative negligence, it abolished not only contributory negligence as a complete defense, but also assumption of risk. Under the statute, liability is split between plaintiffs and defendants based on the relative culpability and causal significance of their conduct.\u201d (citing N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 1411)); see also Payne v. United States, 359 F.3d 132, 138 (2d Cir. 2004) (\u201c[U]nder New York law the open and obvious nature of a dangerous condition ... does not absolve the landowner of its general duty of care.\u201d)- Even assuming the condition was open and obvious, a factual question exists as to the relative fault of the parties.</p> <p id=\"b396-4\" pgmap=\"396\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Tilcon on these state law claims was error.</p> <p id=\"b396-5\" pgmap=\"396\">CONCLUSION</p> <p id=\"b396-6\" pgmap=\"396\">To summarize, we conclude as follows:</p> <blockquote id=\"b396-7\" pgmap=\"396\">1. The district court correctly dismissed: (a) the Jones Act claims against all three appellees; (b) the LHWCA, general maritime law, and state law claims against Buchanan; and (c) the LHWCA and general maritime claims against Tilcon; and</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b396-14\" pgmap=\"396\">2. The district court erred in dismissing: (a) the LHWCA claim against Franz to the extent it is based on the alleged breach of Franz\u2019s duty, as owner, to turn over a reasonably safe vessel; and (b) the state law claims against Tilcon for negligence, gross negligence, and violation of N.Y. Labor Law \u00a7 200.</blockquote> <p id=\"b396-15\" pgmap=\"396\">Accordingly, the case is AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, and REMANDED for such further proceedings as may be appropriate.</p> <footnote label=\"1\"> <p id=\"b387-10\" pgmap=\"387\">.
