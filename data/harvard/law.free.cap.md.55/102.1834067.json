To these pleas the plaintiff demurred. Held :</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b116-6\">1st. That the plea first mentioned was not sufficient; and that a plea to this action should have alleged under Art. 38, sec. 1, and Art. 18, sec. 32, of the Code, that the sheriff was unable to collect the fees, because the persons against whom such fees were chargeable required the accounts to be made out in words at length, of which the plaintiff had notice, and that he had failed within a reasonable time to furnish such accounts as required by law.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b116-7\">2nd. That the other plea would be good under Art. 57, sec. 12, in a suit against a fee debtor; but that as a plea to this action it was defective, as it should have averred not only that the fees did not accrue within three years, but that the parties against whom they were charged refused to pay the same, because they were barred by the statute.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b116-8\">Appeal from the Circuit Court for Garrett County.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-9\">The case is stated in the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-10\">The cause was submitted to Bartol, C.

Code.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">The object of the law was to enable all persons against whom fees were charged by the several officers of the State, to understand precisely the nature and character of such charges, and also to prevent such officers from charging improper and illegal fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-10\">The several statutes were passed in the interest and for the protection of the <em>fee debtor. </em>If such accounts are not made out as prescribed by law, the debtor may object to the payment of the same on that ground, and if such objection he made, the officer must \u201c in as short a time as may he convenient, make out the account in words at length.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>This is a privilege however which the debtor may waive, and he may pay the account although it is not made in the manner prescribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Here the action is against the sheriffs bond, on the ground that he did not enforce the payment of the fees placed in his hands by the plaintiff according to law, and the plea should have alleged that the sheriff was unable to collect the same, because the persons against whom such fees were charged, required the accounts to be made out in words at length, of which the plaintiff had notice, and that he failed within a reasonable time to furnish such accounts as required by law. Merely saying he was unable to collect the fees mentioned in the declaration, because they were not made out in words at length is not sufficient, because the law contemplates that upon such objection being made by the debtor, the officer shall have a reasonable time within which to make out his account in the manner prescribed by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">The ninth plea is also defective. It alleges that the said fees \u201c did not accrue within three years before the same were placed in the sheriff's hands for collection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">The Code provides, it is true, that officers\u2019 fees shall be collected within three years from their date, and not. after. <em>Article </em>57, <em>sec. </em>12.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">If this were a suit against the fee debtor, this would be a good plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">This statute was also passed for the protection of the fee debtor, and he has the right to rely upon the plea of limitations if he sees proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">But this is a suit on the bond of a sheriff, and although the fees placed in his hands for collection did not accrue within three years, it by no means follows that he could not, and did not collect the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">The plea should have averred not only that the fees .did not accrue within three years, but that the parties against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>\u2022whom they were charged refused to pay the same, because they were barred by the Statute.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b119-7\">(Decided 16th December, 1880.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">For these reasons the judgment below will he affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
