It requires the husband\u2019s death to occur before it becomes a vested right. The wife\u2019s inchoate right is not such a right as may be bargained and sold. Her deed does not pass any title. It operates only by way of estoppel or release, and any words of release would be as effectual as words of grant. She cannot convey it to a stranger. It is only released to the owner of the fee.

The wife had previously united with H. in several mortgages of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>real estate, one of them being to the same parties .afterwards trustees in the deed of trust; there was, however, one piece of land not mortgaged which passed by the deed of trust.

After the cause was remanded, the final report of sales made hy Israel Reiff and John Horst, surviving trustees, was filed the 12th November, 1879, and on the 17th December, 1879, account No 2, mentioned in-the report in 52 <em>Md., </em>was re-stated, and also special auditor\u2019s accounts, as per the instructions of the solicitor of Reiff and Horst as creditors, were stated. To these accounts exceptions were filed hy Anna Horst, and hy Reiff and Horst, as creditors, and others. Finally on the 7th June, 1880, the Court, (Mooter, J.,) ordered, upon consideration of the exceptions of Anna Horst, and of Reiff and Horst and others, to the audits, official and special, filed in the cause the 13th December, 1879, that the said audits, and each of them, he rejected, and the papers he remanded to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>the auditor to state a new account and accounts, in conformity with the views of the Court\u2019s opinion, filed 7th June, 1880.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-5\">Whereupon on the 10th July, 1880, the auditor stated an account, which so far as the same concerns the present appeal, was as follows : He charged the trustees with the entire proceeds of the real estate sold by them, as per their final report filed the 12th November, 1879. He credited them with commissions \u2014 the same costs, expenses, &amp;c., allowed in his official audit in the preceding account, as per order of the Court, and also with the costs of this account. He then allowed to Mrs. Anna Horst the one-twelfth of the gross proceeds of sale, as he considered it to be provided in the deed of trust. He then distributed the net residue of the proceeds of sale, interest thereon and proceeds of crops in the priorities allowed in his official audit, filed the 13th December, 1879. The result was, that after the allowance of the inchoate right of dower to Anna Horst, as in his opinion it was provided in the deed of trust, Mary W. Miller was paid her judgment in full, and a balance distributed to one Michael Horst, in part payment of his mortgage. The auditor did not follow strictly the order of the Court as to the manner of stating the account, but suggested that the result was the same as if the order had been literally pursued. He did not ascertain the amount to which Mary W. Miller was entitled under the decision of the Court of Appeals, allowing to Mrs. Horst only the value of her inchoate right of dower, instead of the one-twelfth of the gross proceeds of sale, because it was already ascertained, (as per preceding official audit,) that after allowing to her the value of her. inchoate right of dower in the surplus remaining, after paying the mortgages in which she united, the judgment of Mary W. Miller was paid in full, and a balance was distributed to Michael Horst, the next lien holder, in part payment of his mortgage. The audi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>tor reported that, if the first account, -directed by the Court, was stated, Mary W. Miller was entitled to receive full payment of her judgment, free from the incumbrance of the inchoate right of dower of Anna Horst, an amount she would have been entitled to, if Anna Horst had not joined in the deed of July, 1816; and that it appeared, she received the same amount by this account, and from the second account directed by the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-5\">The auditor further stated that, as he understood the opinion of the Court and its order, he was directed to allow one-twelfth of the gross proceeds of sale to Mrs. Horst, in lieu of her inchoate right of dower, reserved in the deed of trust, except in so far as Mary W. Miller was concerned; and that it was shown that her judgment was not affected by the claim for inchoate right of dower, there being sufficient funds to pay the same, after the allowance of inchoate dower in the surplus remaining after payment of mortgages in which Mrs. Horst united.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-6\">This account was finally ratified by order of Court, passed the 26th July, 1880.

By section 22 of Article 5 of the Code of Public General Laws, it is provided, that \u201c on an appeal from a final order all previous orders which may have passed in the cause shall he open for revision in the Court of Appeals, unless an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>appeal under the next preceding section may have been previously taken to such order.\u201d In the 21st section, which is \u201c the next preceding section \u201d referred to, one of the things from which an appeal may be taken and for which that section provides, is \u201c an order determining a question of right between the parties, and directing an <em>account to be stated </em>on the principle of such determination.\u201d The prayer for appeal in this case is not only from the order of ratification of the auditor\u2019s account stated July 10th, 1880, under the order of the Court, passed June Yth, 1880, but also \u201cfrom all action had herein respecting the said account and the distributions therein made, and all proceedings subsequent to the remanding of the cause by the Court of Appeals of Maryland.\u201d This prayer of appeal therefore by its express terms is sufficient to embrace an appeal from the order of the Court, whereby the exceptions to the former audit were passed upon, and the audit stated in accordance with the instructions of the appellant\u2019s counsel was set aside, and the opinion of the Court establishing the principles by which the audit was to be controlled and the question of right between the parties was settled. All these were proceedings had in the cause after the same was remanded from this Court on the former appeal. In disposing of the questions raised on the other audits, the Court determined the question adverse to the view of the appellant, and by its order directed an account to be stated, in accordance with the principle so fixed by the Court. Under such circumstances therefore it was not indispensable to the consideration of the objection now made to this audit, which has been finally ratified, that a formal exception should have been made thereto. The audit appears to have been made in pursuance of an order' directing its mode of statement, which order was the determination of a question already before the Court, and was the subject of appeal, and is, by the prayer of appeal, appealed from. In our opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>therefore there is no ground for dismissing the appeal. The only question made and relied on by the appellant is, that in the order directing the account to he stated, and in the account accordingly stated, Mrs. Horst has been allowed a sum in lieu of her inchoate right of dower in the property sold and being distributed, which was not warranted by the principles established hv this Court on the former appeal, and which was directed by the opinion remanding the cause to he observed in the statement of the account. The interest of the wife in her husband\u2019s real estate is <em>inchoate only </em>during his life, it requires the husband\u2019s death to occur before it becomes a vested right. As this Court defines it in <em>Buchanan vs. Deshon, 1 H. &amp; Gill, </em>280, <em>\u201c </em>she has no vested right, it is altogether contingent, depending upon her surviving her husband.\u201d In <em>Hawley vs. </em>Bradford, 9 <em>Paige, </em>201, the Chancellor says: \u201c Strictly speaking, the wife has no interest or estate in the lands of her husband <em>during his life, </em>which is capable of being mortgaged or pledged for the payment of his debt. Her joining in a mortgage therefore merely operates by way of release or extinguishment of her future dower as against the <em>mortgagor, </em>if she survives her husband, hut without impairing her contingent right of dower in the equity of redemption. If the mortgage he foreclosed in the life-time of the husband, she has no claim on the surplus proceeds of sale; hut if her husband he dead when foreclosure takes place her dower right in the equity of redemption having then become consummate, she would he endowed of the surplus proceeds.\u201d 1 <em>Scribner on Dower, </em>478; 5 <em>Johnson\u2019s Ch. Rep., </em>452. In the last cited case, Chancellor Kent says, it is very clear this is the law. It results from these authorities that the wife\u2019s inchoate right is not such a right as may he bargained and sold. Her deed does not pass any title. It operates only by way of estoppel or release. And any words of release would he as effectual as words of grant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>She cannot convey it to a stranger. It is only released to the owner of the fee. 1 <em>Washburn on Real </em>Estate, 247 and 301, and the authorities there cited. The decision of this case on the former appeal, was not intended to conflict with these well established principles; nor, as the opinion in that case was intended to he understood, does it establish for the settlement of the equities in this case any rule not in harmony with those principles. This Court decided that having united in the several mortgages mentioned in the record, she had released her interest in the lands conveyed by these mortgages, and was therefore against the mortgagees and judgment creditors, entitled to no allowance except as against the appellants Reiff and Horst. They were held to have waived their mortgage by the acceptance of the deed of trust, by the terms of which they were hound, and Mrs. Horst was entitled as against them in equity to the one-twelfth of the sum allowed them for their mortgage claim. This allowance to her was regarded by the Court as a consideration which they agreed should he paid to her for signing that deed. So far as Mary W. Miller and all other persons having claims in like condition, (regarding Mrs. Miller as a representative creditor,) it was held that so far as they had claims which could he enforced as liens on the lands which were mortgaged, and in which mortgages Mrs. Horst had joined, those claims would not he affected by any supposed right of Mrs. Horst in lieu of inchoate dower. There was however one piece of land not covered by any mortgage which did pass by the deed of trust, in which the reservation of one-twelfth of the proceeds was made to Mrs. Horst; and this Court thought that inasmuch as Mrs. Horst had manifestly joined in that deed under the supposition that she would receive compensation for so doing, according to the terms fixed by the deed, it was equitable not to hold her to the consequences of signing that deed without doing equity by her according to some fair rule. Regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>her right, as the law does, during the husband\u2019s life, as having no present value, as it is not the subject of sale, hut only of release to the owner of the fee, we have no scale or standard for ascertaining its present worth. As a rule a wife could not he held as binding the creditors of her husband to pay her from his estate, for her contingent right of dower, just such sum as she may have stipulated with her husband or his trustees should be paid for uniting in the deed, and which was accordingly reserved in the deed; and we repeat what was said in the former opinion delivered in this case, that to so hold \u201c would be opening a wide door to abuse, if not fraud.\u201d It is very certain that only such creditors as might he parties to the agreement ought to be hound by it, under ordinary circumstances. In this case however, looking to its peculiar circumstances, wherein the wife had barred herself in the larger part of the estate by joining in the mortgages, and had finally united in the deed of trust, with manifest expectation that she was to receive an allowance from the whole estate; and considering the very small value of the parcel which alone is subject to the charge, we think the twelfth part of the proceeds of sale of that parcel, after paying its proportion of the costs of the case, would not he an unreasonable allowance to her as a <em>consideration </em>for her release of expectant right in that parcel. Though not the subject of grant, her right, peculiar as is its character, is the subject of contract for release. The parcel, which was not included in any of the mortgages, and which was intended by the former opinion and decision to he charged with allowance to her, and which is now directed to he so charged, is that piece of mountain land purchased by Mrs. Horst, and is so designated by the auditor in the first audit contained in the record considered by this Court on the former appeal. Viewing the auditor\u2019s report, made and stated in accordance with the opinion and direction of the Court below, in the light of the principles herein <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>announced, it is very evident that the learned Judge did not clearly apprehend the meaning of this Court in its former opinion on the subject. Luthat audit Mrs. Horst is allowed the one-twelfth part of the proceeds of sale, amounting to the sum of $1102.90 ; whereas, according to the true construction of the opinion, and the law of the case, she should only have been allowed the one-twelfth part of the sum awarded to the mortgage of Cearfoss, Reiff and Horst; and the additional sum of one-twelfth of the net proceeds of sale of the piece of mountain land not embraced in any of the mortgages signed by her. There being no other matter before us on this appeal except the allowance to Mrs. Horst, the order ratifying the audit will not he disturbed in any particulars except those specified in this opinion. The order ratifying the audit will be reversed, and the cause will be remanded, to the end that the audit may be corrected in accordance with the directions of this opinion; and that so much of the money erroneously allowed to Mrs. Horst, in that audit, may be awarded to the claimants who would and should have taken it, if the error had not been committed.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b64-7\">(Decided 9th December, 1880.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">\n<em>Order reversed with costs, and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
