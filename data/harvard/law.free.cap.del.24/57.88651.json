The Mayor and Council of Wilmington, by its duly authorized agents, has control of the streets of the city of Wilmington, and it must use reasonable care, proportionate to the danger liable to ensue from its omission to do so, to keep its streets safe for persons driving or walking thereon.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b69-6\">2. If a traveler, in the exercise of reasonable care, does not see or know that a street is in a dangerous condition, he may assume that the corporation has done its duty to keep the street in a reasonably safe condition.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b69-7\">3. If a defect in a street was not caused by an authorized agent of the corporation, it is not liable for injuries resulting therefrom, unless it had actual notice thereof, or by the exercise of reasonable care should have known of it, but if the defect was caused by an agent of the corporation no notice whatever is required.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b69-8\">4. If the agents of the corporation had notice of the condition of a street with respect to drainage before a ditch was dug, which was subsequently filled, by the agents of the corporation, the jury may take such condition into consideration in determining whether the ditch was negligently filled and packed.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b69-9\">5. If the defect in a street, where an accident occurred, was caused by an extraordinary rainfall which could not reasonably have been foreseen, the corporation is not liable for injuries resulting therefrom, because the damage in such event, it is said, resulted from an act of God, and not from the negligence of the corporation.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b69-10\">6. Negligence is never presumed; the burden of proving it rests upon the plaintiff.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b69-11\">7. In a civil action, the verdict should be for that party in whose favor is the preponderance of evidence.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b69-12\">8. In an action to recover for injuries to property, alleged to have been caused by negligence, the measure of damages is such a sum as will compensate the plaintiff for the injury or destruction of his property, including such reasonable sum as he may have expended incident to the accident, as shown by the evidence.</syllabus>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b69-13\"><em>(November </em>9, 1909.)</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b70-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>Judges Conrad and Hastings sitting.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b70-5\"><em>David J.

The care and diligence required of the defendant is reasonable care and diligence, proportioned to the danger or mischief liable to ensue from such omission, and if the traveler, exercising due care, does not see or know that the street is in a dangerous condition, he has a right to assume that the defendant has done its duty and that the street is in a safe and passable condition for travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">Where the obstruction in the street was not caused by one of the agents of the defendant, such as The Board of Water Commissioners of Wilmington, it cannot be held liable unless the plaintiff shows that it had actual notice, or by the exercise of reasonable care and caution should have had notice, but if it is shown that the obstruction complained of was caused by one of the defendant\u2019s own agents, no notice whatever is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">The contention here is whether the trench or ditch was properly and not carelessly filled by the agents of the defendant. This is for your consideration, and in coming to your conclusion you are to determine whether the defendant corporation did its work in a careful and prudent manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">In so determining, if you are satisfied that the defendant corporation had notice of the condition of the street with respect to drainage before the trench or ditch was dug, you should take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>such condition into consideration, and you should also bear in mind its duty to the public, as we have just stated it to you.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">If the bad condition of the street where the actiident occurred was caused by an extraordinary rainfall, which the defendant by the use of reasonable care and caution could not forsee, then the plaintiff cannot recover because the damage in that event resulted from an Act of God and not from the negligence of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Negligence is not presumed and the burden of proving it is upon the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">The verdict should be for that party in whose favor is the preponderance or greater weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">If your verdict should be for the plaintiff, it should be for \u25a0such sum as will compensate him for the injury or destruction of his property, including therein such reasonable sum as he may have expended incident to such accident, as the same may appear from the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-8\">Verdict for plaintiff for $336.08.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
