The petitioners then pray for a rule in the language above quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Counsel for the petitioners stated in their argument that the defendant Gatti was the leader of a band and engaged with the Peoples Railway Company to furnish music during the summer season; that the petitioners were employed by him as musicians and they seek now by this proceeding to make the wages due them by Gatti a lien upon the balance due Gatti by the Peoples Railway Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">The first question that arises with reference to this petition, is whether the petitioners, not being parties to the judgment and having no interest in it except a claim for wages against the defendant, have a sufficient interest to be entitled to an issue to be framed and tried by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>We conclude that they have not. While we are not prepared to say that only parties to the judgment can obtain the rule and have the issue granted, as is laid down in <em>Woolley on Delaware Practice at Section </em>843, and supported by the case of <em>Budd vs. Union Bank, </em>1 <em>Houston </em>455, there cited, yet we are very clear that the party obtaining the rule and asking for the issue must at least be a judgment creditor of the defendant in the judgment and not a mere claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The counsel for the petitioners further contend that <em>Chapter </em>147, <em>Volume </em>16, <em>Laws of Delaware, (Rev. Code, </em>1893, p. 817) being \u201c An Act to prefer wages of employees in case of execution and assignment,\u201d applies in this case and makes the claim of the petitioners for wages preferred. The language of said statute is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">\u201cThat from and after the passage of this act, all debts or claims that may become due or growing due for labor or services rendered by any mechanic, laborer, clerk or other employee of any person or persons, chartered company or association employing laborers, clerks or mechanics in any manner whatsoever, shall be a first lien on all the real and personal property of such employer or employers, and shall be the first to be satisfied out of the proceeds of the sale of such property, whether made by an officer or an assignee of such employer or employers or otherwise etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">It is contended that the words \u201cpersonal property\u201d contained in the clause \u201cshall be a first lien on all the real and personal property of such employer,\u201d being broad enough to include choses in action, should be so construed as to make it applicable to a case of this kind. It will be observed that the statute provides that the claim for wages \u2018 \u2018 shall be the first tobe satisfied out of the proceeds of the sale of such property.\u201d The statute further provides how the claim shall be filed with the officer conducting the sale, and how it shall be made a lien on real estate. While a chose in action is personal property, generally speaking, yet this statute seems to contemplate a sale and makes no provision for making the lien effective on a fund like the one now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>in question. Being satisfied that the parties have not sufficient interest to be entitled to the issue prayed for, it would indeed be difficult to determine how any such lien as contended for in this case could be enforced even if we admitted it to be a lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">For these reasons the rule is discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
