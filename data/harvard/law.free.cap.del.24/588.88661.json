Co., </em>6 <em>Penn. </em>29, 32), the Court sees no distinction either in the general principles of law or in the rules of pleading that govern this case and those that govern the case of <em>Campbell vs. Walker </em>decided on demurrer at the present term.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-12\">The averment of negligence in this case is like that in <em>Campbell vs. Walker, </em>in so far as it states a fact of collision without stating the acts of negligence that caused the collision, and is different from the averment in <em>Campbell vs. Walker, </em>in that it makes two averments of negligence, and contemplates either two acts of negligence resulting in the one collision that caused the injury, or one act of negligence resulting in two collisions. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>other words, as the first averment does not show by what acts or in what respect the defendant \u201cnegligently and carelessly operated and ran one of its cars,\u201d when the car struck the horse and wagon, and as the second averment does not show by what acts or in what respect the defendant was negligent when he declares that \u201cthrough the negligence and carelessness of the defendant\u201d the car thereafter dragged the horse and wagon into contact or collision with the plaintiff\u2019s cart, it is quite impossible, in the absence of a statement of any facts of negligence that contributed to either collision, for the defendant to know or for the Court to determine, first, what act of negligence caused either collision, and second, whether there was one act of negligence that caused the first collision and another act that caused the second collision, or whether the act of negligence that caused the first collision, was continuing in its nature and was the same act that caused the second collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Following the rule in <em>Campbell vs. Walker </em>and supported by the cases there cited, the Court sustains the demurrer to the third count of the declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">The fourth count of the declaration avers that the defendant \u201cso negligently and carelessly omitted and\u2022 neglected to use proper care and caution in operating and running one of its cars\u201d that the first collision occurred, and \u201cthereupon and after the said collision had occurred, did, through the negligence and carelessness of the said defendant, carry and drag the said horse and wagon along * * * whereby the said wagon or dearborn was pushed violently against\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s cart, etc. The same ground of objection in principle, was made by demurrer to this count as to the former one, and the same defect appearing therein, the demurrer is sustained.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
