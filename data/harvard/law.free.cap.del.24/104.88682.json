Therefore the only parties who can hold a license to sell intoxicating liquors in the Siate of Delaware are persons who are capable of being of full age and also capable of possessing a good moral character.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-6\"><em>Third. </em>The law also requires that the applicant for a Liquor Merchant\u2019s License shall obtain the same on complying with the same conditions required of persons applying for a license to keep an Inn or Tavern which makes it necessary to present the same certificate required for an Ordinary, Inn or Tavern License. The law requires that the said \u201ccertificate shall clearly state that the applicant is a person of full age, that he is a <em>man </em>of sobriety and good moral character,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-7\"><em>Vol. </em>14, <em>Chapter </em>418, <em>Section </em>3, <em>Laws of Delaware, Revised Code page </em>412.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-8\">The word \u201cman\u201d in the certificate removes all doubt as to the fact that a natural person is the only person given the authority to hold a Liquor Merchant\u2019s License. The signers to the certificate could not certify that a corporation is a <em>man </em>of sobriety. A corporation cannot fall within the description of the word \u201cman.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b117-9\"><em>Ward, </em>for applicant, replied, contending:</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b117-10\"><em>First </em>That the word \u201cperson\u201d applied to corporations as well as to natural persons;</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b117-11\"><em>Second. </em>That such licenses had been granted to corporations by the Court for so many years that it was now <em>stare decisis, </em>which should not be set aside.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b117-12\">Hastings., J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AHa\">delivering the opinion of the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-13\">In the matter of the application of D. W. Lynch Company, a corporation, for approval of license to sell intoxicating liquors, the following objections have been filed and urged against it:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b117-14\">\u201cWe are informed and believe that the said D. W. Lynch Company is a corporation existing under the laws of the State of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>Delaware, and is not a person of full age and good moral character who may be licensed to sell intoxicating liquors under the license designated as a \u2018Liquor Merchant\u2019s License,\u2019 as provided in the statutes of the State of Delaware.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-6\"><em>Chapter </em>5 <em>of the Revised Code, </em>43, being an Act entitled \u201c Rules of Construction of Statutes,\u201d at <em>Section </em>1, <em>paragraph X, </em>provides: \u201cThe word \u2018person\u2019 may extend to and include bodies politic and corporate, as well as individuals.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\"><em>Chapter </em>418, <em>Volume </em>14, being an Act entitled \u201cAn Act Regulating the Sale of Intoxicating Liquors,\u201d was passed April 10, 1873.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">An examination of the records shows that the Court has for years been approving applications of corporations to sell intoxicating liquors under this law. It has therefore become the settled practice, and we must assume that this Court has passed upon this very question, and in the absence of legislation excluding corporations, we do not now feel justified in reversing the decision and practice of the Court, and refuse to approve an application where the only objection urged is that the applicant is a corporation.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
