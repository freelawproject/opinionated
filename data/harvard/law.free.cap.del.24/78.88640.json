My sister and I crossed the track as near together as we could. We might have been a step or two apart, all of us. We looked down toward the ground as' we crossed. The condition of the crossing was very rough. It was filled in between the tracks with sharp broken stone, which was the only footway across the railroad track. The stones were just put in there carelessly between the planks and rails, being just spread around loosely. The first I knew anything about a train of cars having crossed Lodge\u2019s Lane crossing, was when we turned within two or three feet of the east rail of the easternmost track, after crossing over the tracks and found that mother was gone. I did not feel- any wind from a passing train. We had then just stepped off of the last track, the one next to the Delaware River, and when we looked we could not see her. She was gone, and we looked up the track and could see her body, which I judge was a half square away from Lodge\u2019s Lane crossing towards Chester or towards the north. Her body was on the left side of the train between the tracks. I saw the rear end of the train, it was going very fast. When we turned and found mother was gone, the train was almost out of sight.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-7\"><em>(Margaret Edwards, </em>the sister of the preceding witness, testified to substantially the same facts as above set forth.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b92-8\"><em>Frederick C.

You say you cannot see a train before it gets around the curve. Have you any idea how far down you can see a train from Lodge\u2019s Lane crossing towards Wilmington? A. Well, there is another lane below there they call Fairmont Avenue Lane; you can just about commence to see it then,\u2014the engine. Q. That is on the northbound track towards the south? A. The northbound track, yes, sir\u2014no; I mean on the southbound track when you are coming across Lodge\u2019s crossing you can see the northbound train then just below the station. I should judge that would be about two hundred or three hundred yards towards Wilmington, this way, you could see the engine coming up the northbound track. Q. I show you \u201cDefendant\u2019s Exhibit No.l\u201d being a photograph taken 38 feet west of the western rail of the track nearest the river; that is No. 1 track, on which the northbound trains approach, that being toward the river side, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>and that is taken looking towards Wilmington. Do you see the locomotive there coming around the curve ? A. Yes, sir. Q. Do you see Binstead Station? A. Yes, sir. Q. Do you know how far Binstead Station is from Lodge\u2019s Lane? A. I understand it is about two hundred yards, something like that. Q. How far beyond Binstead Station can you see that approaching locomotive on that No. 1 track nearest the river? A. From the station? Q. No, from Lodge\u2019s Lane crossing., where this photograph was taken\u2014how far below Binstead Station can you see the locomotive in this photograph here ? A. Between two hundred and three hundred yards. I cannot tell exactly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-8\">Re-direct Examination.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-9\">\n<em>By Mr Whiteman:</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-10\">R.

Yes, sir.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-15\">When the plaintiff rested, counsel for defendant moved for a nonsuit, upon two grounds; <em>first, </em>that there had been no negligence shown on the part of the defendant company, and, <em>second, </em>that there was contributory negligence shown upon the part of the decedent which was operating at the time of the accident and produced the accident.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-16\">After hearing argument of counsel on both sides upon the above motion, the Court rendered the following decision:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-17\">Boyce, J.:\u2014We have given the arguments of counsel for and against the motion for a nonsuit, as well as the evidence pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>duced by the plaintiff, very careful consideration; and we think, under all the facts and circumstances attending this case, the motion for a nonsuit should prevail.
