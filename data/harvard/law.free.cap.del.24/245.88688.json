D. 1907 and 1908 * * * which said rent is still in arrear and unpaid.\u201d The plaintiff demurred, assigning as cause the insufficieny of the cognizance, in that it does not state any certain term or period, nor the beginning or ending of any certain term or period for which the said plaintiff was, or is supposed to be in arrear for rent to his said landlord.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>Under the statute, the defendant may avow, or make cognizance, as may be required, generally, without setting out the lease or agreement under which the rent is claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\"><em>King\u2019s Admr. vs. Lambden, et al, </em>4 <em>Harr. </em>283.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">And generally the particularity of statement previously required is dispensed with, yet, we think, the plaintiff should be reasonably apprised by some certain dates of the time or term for which the rent in arrear is demanded by the landlord. In view of the fact that the renting year, in this county, was then from March 25th to March 25th, in the absence of a special letting, there is some vagueness and uncertainty as to what is meant by the words \u201cfor the years A. D. 1907 and 1908.\u2019\u2019 And, we think, the plaintiff is entitled to a more certain statement as to the dates of the time or term for which the said rent is in arrear.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">There are two selected forms in 2 <em>Woolley, Sections </em>1553 and 1554, which are good examples of the kind of statement which should be made, though less particularity might be sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The demurrer is sustained for the reasons assigned.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
