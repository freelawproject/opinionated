The railroad tracks at the crossing, where the deceased was killed, and for about a quarter of a mile southward, in the direction from which the train approached, were straight.

She was in good health, in possession of her faculties of sight and hearing and familiar with the crossing.

J.:\u2014The Court feel that if this testimony which is now sought to be introduced, stood alone and there was no other testimony, it would be perfectly immaterial and not admissible, but taken in connection with all the other testimony which has been admitted, respecting the speed of the train, we hardly see how the Court would be justified in excluding it, and we overrule the objection.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-11\">Motion for Nonsuit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-12\">| At the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s testimony, counsel for defendant moved for a nonsuit, upon the following grounds: (1) That the plaintiff had failed to prove any negligence on the part of the ) defendant. (2) That the evidence of the plaintiff showed that plaintiff\u2019s decedent was guilty of contributory negligence. In of the motion, counsel for the defendant urged upon the Court the following:\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-15\">It is necessary that the plaintiff should have both alleged and proved negligence, on the part of the defendant, to entitle him to a recovery; for the burden of proving negligence rests upon the plaintiff.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-16\"><em>R.

And because of the danger, there is imposed upon such person the duty of reasonable care and caution, and the reasonable and ordinary use and exercise, of his senses of sight and hearing for his own and other\u2019s safety and protection; and he is required, at least, to look and listen for an approaching engine or train before venturing to cross the track. And, if, as it has been said, he fails to exercise such ordinary care, whatever danger he could thereby have discovered and avoided he incurs the peril thereof, if he proceeds for an injury arising under such fault, he is left without a remedy.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b578-6\"><em>Queen Anne\u2019s R. R. vs. Reed, </em>5 <em>Penn. </em>226 <em>(234)\u2014Superior Court.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-7\">\u201cA person approaching a railway crossing with which he is familiar, is bound to avail himself of his knowledge of the locality and act accordingly. If, as he approaches the crossing, his line of vision is obstructed, he is bound to look for approaching cars in time to avoid a collision with them, and if he does not look, and for this reason does not see an approaching car until it is too late to avoid a collision, and he is thereby injured, he is guilty of negligence and could not recover therefor. When the view at the crossing is obstructed, greater care is necessary than in places where the view is un\u00f3btstructed.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-8\"><em>Knopf vs. Ry.

Co., </em>4 <em>Penn. </em>527.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-9\">Among her other duties it was incumbent on Florence E. Evans to look for the approaching train <em>\u201cin time to avoid a collision\u201d </em>with it. If she had looked in the direction from which the train came, as it was incumbent on her to do, she would have seen the train approaching in time to have avoided the accident by simply stopping.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b578-10\"><em>Bates vs. R.

Unlike a person who is driving a horse, which would be upon the track when the driver would still be several feet from it, she was in perfect safety until she came within the line of the engine. Until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>she arrived within the line of the engine she could instantly have stopped and allowed the train to pass and then proceeded uninjured. This she failed to do, and did not stop when she was in a place of safety, and where, if she looked, she must have seen the train.</p>\n<p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b579-5\"><em>Elston vs. R.

If she looked in the direction from which the train came she must have seen it and if she listened she must have heard it. If she saw or heard it, and took her chances on crossing before its arrival, she assumed the risk of the accident, and was guilty of contributory negligence, and therefore the plaintiff cannot recover. If she did not look and listen she was equally guilty of contributory negligence, and the plaintiff cannot recover.</p>\n<p data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Counsel for the plaintiff resisted the motion for nonsuit, claiming that it had been shown the defendant company was negligent (1) in failing to give the statutory warning to persons at or near the Broad Street Crossing in Wyoming, that its train was approaching the said crossing; (2) by the reckless running of its train at seventy miles per hour across the public streets in said town; and (3) in failing to ring bell, sound the whistle, or slacken speed as the train dashed from behind the standing freight train headed north when dangers at the said crossing were, and must have been, apparent to the servants on the approaching train causing the accident.</p>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-6\">It was urged, on behalf of the plaintiff, that the deceased had a right to expect that the defendant company would perform its legal duty by giving due and timely warning of its approach to the crossing, and that the negligence of the defendant was the proximate cause of the death of the plaintiff\u2019s wife.</p>\n<p data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-7\">It was claimed that the alleged contributory negligence of the deceased was a question of fact for the jury, and not of law for the Court.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b580-8\">Pennewill, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AsZr\">delivering the opinion of the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-9\">We have very carefully considered the motion made for a nonsuit in this case and the arguments of counsel for and against the same.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-10\">There is no doubt about the law; in this State that must control the Court in the decision of questions like the one before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-11\">In order that the plaintiff may recover in a case of such a character as this, there are two important things to be considered and determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-12\">(1) Was the death, for which damages are sought to be recovered, caused by the negligence of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-13\">(2) Did the negligence of the deceased contribute proximately to the accident in which she was killed.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-14\">The negligence of the defendant must be shown by some testimony adduced by the plaintiff, otherwise the case will not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>be permitted to go to the jury; and a nonsuit will be granted. If it appears from the testimony presented by the plaintiff that the deceased was herself guilty of negligence at the time of the accident, and that such negligence proximately contributed to her death, the case will not be permitted to go to the jury, and a nonsuit will be granted, even though the defendant was also guilty of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">These principles are well settled in this State and binding upon the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">We will assume that the defendant was negligent and that the evidence of the plaintiff establishes that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">The important question then in determining the motion before us, is, does the evidence of the plaintiff show that there was contributory negligence on the part of the deceased?</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Such evidence clearly establishes these facts:\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-9\">(1) That the railroad tracks, at the place of the accident and for about a quarter of a mile southward, were straight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-10\">(2) That there was at the time of the accident, no obstruction, or anything in the way, of such a character as to prevent the deceased seeing the approaching train in time to avoid the danger, and there was nothing that occurred at or about the time of the accident in any of the surrounding circumstances to prevent her from seeing or hearing the approaching train if she had looked and listened as it was her duty to do before attempting to cross the tracks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-11\">(3) That the deceased at the time of the accident was in good health and in the possession of her faculties of sight and hearing; she was familiar with the crossing where the accident happened and the conditions surrounding the same\u2014having lived very near the crossing for more than twenty years, she was bound to know that the crossing was a place of danger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-12\">(4) That the deceased was walking on foot as she approached the crossing, and had therefore full control of her movements; yet she walked fast and continued to do so without stopping until she was struck by the engine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-13\">(5) That the whistle of the train was blown at Hale\u2019s Crossing, which several of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, who were at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>the time, very near the place of the accident, distinctly heard, and it was in fact, the whistle, and the rumble or noise made by the movement of the train which first attracted their attention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Such being the facts shown by the plaintiff, must we not conclude that the deceased was guilty of such contributory negligence as will prevent the plaintiff recovering in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">It does seem to us from the facts stated, that the only reasonable and rational conclusion must be that if the deceased had exercised due care, the accident would not have happened. Even though the defendant was negligent in running the train at an unusually high and dangerous rate of speed and in failing to blow the whistle again, ring the bell or give other proper and timely warning, the deceased was not thereby relieved from exercising due care to avoid the accident. It was her duty to use reasonable diligence, and she was bound to the reasonable use of her sense of sight and hearing, in order to see and know that she could safely cross over the tracks before she stepped upon them or got so close as to be in danger of being struck by any part of the passing train.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">If she did look and listen before she stepped upon the crossing she must have seen or heard the approaching train. If she did see or hear it she must be supposed to have taken the risk of being able to get over the crossing in time. If she did not look and listen, then unfortunately, she failed to exercise the care and caution of an ordinarily prudent person and such as under the law she was required to exercise.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">The track for a considerable distance was straight; there was nothing of such a character as to prevent or obstruct a reasonably fair view of the approaching train in time to avoid the accident; the train was making so much noise by reason of its great speed, and the whistle blown at or near Hale\u2019s crossing as to attract in an unusual way the attention of a number of persons in Wyoming even before it reached the town.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">We do not forget the principle of law clearly recognized in this State, that the deceased is presumed to have been in the exercise of due care at the time of the accident. But it is equally well settled that such presumption may be rebutted by testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>and by the testimony adduced on the part of the plaintiff; and when it is rebutted the rule of contributory negligence applies just as in any other case to which it is applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">We are not unmindful of another well recognized rule which is that a nonsuit should not be granted and the case taken from the jury unless the evidence produced on the part of the plaintiff makes it clearly the duty of the Court to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">We regret always the necessity of taking a case from the jury, but our action must be governed in every case by what we believe to be the law. We are clearly of the opinion that under the well settled law of this State, assuming that the defendant was negligent in the operation of its train at and just before the time of the accident, still the deceased was also guilty of negligence and of such negligence as was operative at the time of the accident and contributed thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Being clearly of such opinion our duty is plain and unavoidable, viz.: to grant the motion, and direct that a nonsuit be entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\"><em>Mr. </em>Daly:\u2014If the Court please, I decline to take the nonsuit.</p>\n<author id=\"b583-9\">Pennewill, C.
