And he relies upon the case of <em>Miller vs. Hart, </em>3 <em>Pennewill </em>279, in which this Court held that an affidavit of demand could not be made prior to the institution of the suit in which it is filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-6\">We think that that case is not at all analogous to the present one. Certainly the reason upon which it was based does not exist in the case now before us. It is admitted here that the affidavit could be made prior to the docketing of the <em>scire facias </em>provided it was within the thirty days within which such <em>scire facias </em>could be issued. We can see no reason why an affidavit could not be made at any time after the completion of the work or delivery of materials, for the recovery of the value of which the <em>scire facias </em>is brought. The plaintiff then had a right of action against the defendant although the time had not yet arrived for his invoking the special remedy of <em>scire facias </em>provided by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-7\">We decline to quash the <em>scire facias </em>sur le mechanics\u2019 lien upon the ground of the insufficiency of the affidavit filed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
