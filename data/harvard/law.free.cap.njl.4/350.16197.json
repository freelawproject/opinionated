The defendant was a tenant, the landlord not having been made a party on the record. A rule for a view had been taken by the plaintiff at the preceding term of the court, and the view had. At the circuit, the landlord came in and made affidavit, that the tenant had not given him notice of the view, nor did he take any part in it; which he would have done, if he had been informed of it, as he considered his rights materially affected by it. That he lived at a great distance from the court, and had a very late notice of trial. Upon this affidavit the court postponed the trial, upon payment of the usual costs; and it was referred to the court at bar, whether to these costs, should be added, the costs of the view.</summary>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AXU\">Trial postjy1.1^ view,</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AoX\">vjew\u2018j)aid by pariy appiy- ^ or</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-9\">It wTas insisted by <em>White </em>and <em>Armstrong, </em>that the landlord being no party on the record, had no right to be present at the view, or take part in it; and that the favour of postponing the cause on his account, ought to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>been granted only on such terms as should not injure the \u2014plaintiff.
