The plaintiff required him to be sworn on his <em>voir dire, </em>alleging that he was interested. <em>M\u2019Murtry </em>swore that he considered that the raft of logs were his own, having received them from the plaintiff himself, for money which he owed him. Upon this evidence, the justice would not permit him to be sworn in chief, upon the trial.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A07h\">*By the Court.</author>\n<p id=\"Aa9\">The justice erred in rejecting <em>M\u2019Murtry </em>as a witness. He had no interest in the event of the cause. Its determination in favour of the plaintiff or defendant, could in no way affect him. It was competent, in a suit of this nature, for the defendant to prove that the property in the logs was not in the plaintiff, and if this was what he intended to prove by <em>M\u2019Murtry, </em>he was a proper and competent witness for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"AqkQ\">Judgment reversed-</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
