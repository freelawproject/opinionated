The carrier for the plaintiff delivered the goods with steamboat tickets, which showed on their face that LeRoy &amp; Co. were the consignees of each and every shipment, and Brown &amp; Co. issued their warehouse receipts in strict accordance with the face of the steamboat tickets which were delivered to them by the agent of the plaintiff; and with the warehouse receipts thus procured LeRoy gets $5,000 from the Warehouse Company. There is nothing upon the face of these warehouse receipts to indicate anything else than that LeRoy &amp; Co. held those goods in their own right. Now, then, if the plaintiff shipped those goods to Baltimore, in accordance with the steamboat tickets that were issued upon their arrival, then, of course, the plaintiff could not possibly complain, that is, if the plaintiff consigned these goods generally to LeRoy &amp; Co. as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>ordinary consignees; then, if LeRoy made any improper use, took any advantage of the position in which he was placed by the act of the plaintiff, the defendants acting in good faith, that is a matter between LeRoy and the plaintiff; if, however, on the other hand, the plaintiff shipped those goods by the Steamboat Company with special instructions, with instructions that LeRoy &amp; Co. were not the consignees, but that they were to be consigned to themselves, to their own order, or with any other limitation, and the common carrier failed to observe those instructions, then the common carrier simply made a misdelivery of the goods, and in that case would be liable to the plaintiff for having delivered the goods in Baltimore contrary to instructions. The question therefore would be, on such a state of facts, a question between the plaintiff and the Steamboat Company, the common carrier, for such misdelivery of the goods. With these views, I will reject all the prayers of the plaintiff and I will grant the first prayer of the defendant; that first prayer, I think, sufficiently and properly puts the case before the jury, and-the others, I think, are not necessary; I will therefore reject the other prayers of the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-5\">The cause was submitted to the jury with leave to bring in a sealed verdict. They delivered a signed and sealed verdict to their foreman and then separated. On the assembling of the Court the next morning, the jury being placed in the box, their sealed verdict was then handed to the Court by their foreman ; said verdict being in the words following :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-6\">\u201cWe,the undersigned,jurors duly impanneled and sworn to try the issues joined in the above-entitled case, upon our oaths before separating, do say, that we find our verdict for the defendants in the sum of six thousand dollars <em>($6,000), </em>and damages at one cent.

Ireland Elliott </em>and <em>Frederick T. Dorton, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-17\">The theory of the plaintiff\u2019s prayers was that if the jury should find from the evidence that the goods replevied belonged to the plaintiff, and had been shipped to Baltimore for the purpose of being stored here and not for sale, so that nobody was authorized to sell or dispose of them, and if the appellees either knew or could have discovered by reasonable inquiry that Percival LeRoy &amp; Co. were brokers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>and that they did not own the goods in question, then there was no authority to them, the appellees, to issue negotiable warehouse receipts in the name of Percival LeRoy &amp; Co., and that the fact that such negotiable warehouse receipts were issued, and subsequently got into the hands of the Baltimore Warehouse Company, even if in good faith and for value, did not deprive the plaintiff of the right to repossess itself of its own goods, because the Act'of 1876, chapter 262, does not protect the holder of warehouse receipts given for goods which have been stolen. The plaintiff\u2019s case proceeded upon the further theory that even if the appellees (Alexander Brown &amp; Sons) had been justified in originally issuing the warehouse receipts in the name of Percival Le-Roy &amp; Co. and in making them negotiable, still the plaintiff has a right to replevy the goods, especially in view of the fact that the appellees claimed no property in them whatever, and the practical effort to defeat the plaintiff was rested upon the alleged pledging of those warehouse receipts to the Baltimore Warehouse Company. Our theory was and is that if, when Percival LeRoy fraudulently pledged those warehouse receipts to the Baltimore Warehouse Company, its president, Colin A. Foote, had reason to suspect that the goods did not belong to Percival LeRoy &amp; Co., no pledging of those warehouse receipts could' pass any title to the pledgee. On the subject of such notice the testimony \u2022of William H. Earp is conclusive, and it was not contradicted. The theoiy of the appellees and of the lower Court seemed to be that the possession of the warehouse receipts in the name of Percival LeRoy &amp; Co. was conclusive proof of their ownership, in spite of any and all reasonable cause which anybody, and particularly the Baltimore Warehouse Company, might have had to suspect the fact of such ownership. The Court is respectfully referred to the following cases: <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>Insurance Company, </em>44 Md. 386; <em>Levi </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>58 Md. 305; <em>Ruhl v.

There was no evidence in the case to show the value of the goods. The appraisement was not given in evidence and the sealed verdict as rendered shows that conclusively, because the jury made no attempt to find the value of the goods until the Clerk-, under the instruction of the Court, took the verdict in the manner recited in the record. The verdict was not such as to support the judgment rendered in the case. <em>Gaither </em>v. <em>Wilmer, Trustee, </em>71 Md. 361; <em>Redenour v. Beatman, 68 Ind. </em>236; <em>Handfor v.

The defendants pleaded property in themselves and property in the Baltimore Warehouse Company. To these pleas a replication was filed and upon issue joined the case was tried, which resulted in a verdict for the defendants. At the trial there were eight exceptions reserved, and these form the basis of this appeal. We will pass upon them in their regular order, in so far as it may be necessaiy to the determination of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>The plaintiff is a corporation, engaged among other things, at Easton, Talbot County, in canning and packing corn. The defendants are general agents and engaged in the warehouse business at Brown\u2019s wharf, Baltimore. It appears from the record that the appellant during the month of September, 1894, shipped by steamboat to Baltimore five thousand cases of canned corn. When this corn reached Baltimore, Percival LeRoy &amp; Co., who were dealers in canned goods and supplies, were notified by a shipping ticket from the Steamboat Company of its arrival. This ticket showed upon its face that LeRoy &amp; Co. were the consignees of the corn. It was then taken to Brown\u2019s warehouse for storage, and upon the faith of the tickets issued by the carrier, the Steamboat Company, the receipts of the Warehouse Company were issued in the name of Percival LeRoy &amp; Co. And on the 29th of September, 1894, LeRoy &amp; Co., the consignees, obtained from the Baltimore Warehouse Company a loan of $5,000 upon these warehouse receipts which had been previously issued in their name, and which were in their possession. The property now in dispute was replevied by the appellants on the 31st of October, 1894, and the judgment below being for the defendants, the plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">Now it is clear that since the Act of 1876, chapter 262 (Code, Art. 14, sec. 1), all warehouse, elevator or storage receipts whatsoever for goods, chattels or commodities of any kind stored or deposited in any warehouse are declared to be negotiable instruments and securities, unless it be provided in express terms to the contrary on the face thereof, in the same sense as bills of exchange and promissory notes, and full and complete title to the property mentioned therein shall vest in each and every <em>bona fide </em>holder thereof for value, altogether unaffected by any rights or equities whatsoever between the original or any other prior holders of w'hich such <em>bona fide </em>holder for value shall not have had actual notice at the time he became such. And by section 3 of Art. 2, it is provided that any person <em>intrusted with </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>and in possession of any bill of lading, storekeeper\u2019s or inspector\u2019s certificate, order for the delivery of goods, or other document showing possession, shall be deemed the true owner of the goods, wares or .merchandise described therein, so far as to give validity to any contract thereafter to be made by such person, with any other person or body corporate for the sale or disposal of the said goods, or for the pledge or deposit thereof as a security for any money or negotiable instrument advanced or given on the faith of such documents, provided that such person or body corporate shall not have notice by such document or otherwise, that the person so intrusted is not the actual and <em>bona fide </em>owner of such goods, wares and merchandise. These statutes have been recently before this Court and received its construction. <em>Tiedeman v. Knox, </em>53 Md. 620; <em>Ruhl </em>v. Corner, 63 Md. 182; <em>Seal </em>v. <em>Zell, </em>63 Md. 356. Looking then to the law as settled by the decisions of this Court, and as applicable to the facts and circumstances of this case, we are of opinion that it was correctly stated in the defendant\u2019s instruction, which was granted by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">\u201c The defendants pray the Court to instruct the jury that if they find from the evidence that the Farmers\u2019 Packing Company, the plaintiff, during the month of September, 1894, shipped from Easton,-consigned to Percival LeRoy and Company, in Baltimore, the 5,000 cases of canned corn which were afterwards replevied in this suit. And if the jury find that the said goods were shipped in various lots, and received from the 15 th to the 28th of September, inclusive, and that said goods reached Baltimore by water, and that on the arrival of each shipment at the wharf of the respective steamers transporting the same, the said respective shipments were by direction of Percival LeRoy and Company, the consignees, transported for delivery to Brown\u2019s wharf, and that on each delivery of said shipments of canned goods a receipt prepared in duplicate by the Steamboat Company delivering the same, for the goods so delivered, indicating thereon that Percival LeRoy and Company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>were the consignees of said goods, was presented to the wharfinger of defendants to be signed on behalf of Percival LeRoy &amp; Co., the consignees ; and if the jury further find that said goods were so received and receipted for and by direction of Percival LeRoy and Compay were stored in Brown\u2019s warehouse, and that the warehouse receipts offered in evidence were issued for said goods to Percival LeRoy &amp; Co., by defendant\u2019s warehouseman, on the faith of said shipment receipts, and without any notice to him or to the defendants from said shipment receipts or otherwise that Percival LeRoy &amp; Co. were not the actual and <em>bona fide </em>owners of the goods mentioned therein respectively; and if the jury further find that thereafter the Baltimore Warehouse Company, upon presentation and endorsement to it, of the said warehouse receipts by Percival LeRoy &amp; Co., in good faith, and without notice that Percival LeRoy &amp; Co. were not the actual and <em>bona fide </em>owners of the goods specified therein respectively, advanced to the said Percival Le-Roy &amp; Co., on the faith of said warehouse receipts and of the goods specified therein, the sum of $5,000; and if they further find that the said advance is still due and unpaid, then the verdict of the jury must be for the defendants on the issue of property in the Baltimore Warehouse Company.\u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">It follows then from this view of the law that there was no error in the refusal of the appellant\u2019s prayers, because they proceeded upon an entirely different view of the law, and were not supported by the facts of the case. They were also unnecessary and calculated to mislead the jury, as the law of the case had been accurately submitted by the appellee\u2019s prayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">There were four exceptions taken at the trial on the part of the appellants to the admission of evidence. We have carefully examined these exceptions and discover no error of which the appellants have a right to complain. As to the first exception, it is only necessary to say that it does not appear from the bill of exception that the evidence ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>jected to was submitted to the jury. The witness, Brainard, who was freight agent of the common carrier, in answer to the question allowed by the Court, seems only to have testified as to the usual course of business of his company in reference to the receiving, carrying and delivery of freight. There was no error in the admission of this evidence. The second exception was to the allowing of the following question to be asked the witness, Brainard: \u201cIn reference to the goods, what directions did you receive from LeRoy,\u201d the answer being \u201cWell, in all cases of the Farmers\u2019 Packing Company, take them to Brown\u2019s wharf.\u201d This testimony, we think, was material and relevant, for the purpose of showing under what authority the canned corn had been delivered by the Steamboat Company to Brown\u2019s wharf, thus showing the possession of the goods by the appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The third and fourth exceptions will be considered together <em>; </em>the first is an exception to the admission in evidence of the warehouse receipts issued by the appellees in the name of Percival LeRoy &amp; Co., and the second to the admission of testimony as to the usual course of business between the appellees and Percival LeRoy &amp; Co., the consignees. The warehouse receipts were clearly admissible under the plea of property in the Baltimore Warehouse Company. These receipts were in the possession of C. A. Foote, the president of the company, who testified that they were for the corn replevied in this case. The testimony objected to in the fourth bill of exception was admissible under the rulings of this Court in the cases of <em>Busby </em>v. <em>The North American Life Insurance </em>Company, 40 Md. 572; <em>Levi </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>58 Md. 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">The remaining exception relates to the manner of taking the sealed verdict. It is objected that the sealed verdict as found by the jury did not ascertain separately the value of the goods and the damages as required by section 11 x of Article 75 of the Code. But assuming this to be true, it further appears that the verdict was properly corrected by the jury before its record, so when delivered by the jury and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>recorded by the Court it fully complied with the statute. A verdict can be varied from by the jury at any time before it is recorded. <em>Edelin </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>2 H. &amp; G. 31; <em>Gaither v. Wilmer, </em>71 Md. 365.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b46-7\">(Decided January 4th, 1898)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Finding no error the judgment will be affirmed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
