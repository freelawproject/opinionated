The <em>Flannel </em>court stated if the defendant produces evidence sufficient to deserve consideration by the jury, \u201cA trial court should not, however, measure the substantiality of the evidence by undertaking to weigh the credibility of the witnesses, a task exclusively relegated to the jury.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The <em>Flannel </em>court further warned \u201cthat \u2018Doubts as to the sufficiency of the evidence to warrant instructions should be resolved in favor of the accused.\u2019\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 685.)

The necessary \u201cwrongful intent\u201d is not the intention to violate the law but the intent to commit the forbidden act. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dillon </em>(1926) 199 Cal. 1, 7 [248 P. 230].) Where the charge is rape, the forbidden act consists of two elements: (1) sexual penetration, and (2) overcoming the will of the victim by force or fear. Thus, the \u201cwrongful intent\u201d is the intent to sexually penetrate the victim and the intent to accomplish that act by force or fear. It is the latter aspect of wrongful intent with which we are concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Mayberry, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 143 held: \u201cIf a defendant entertains a reasonable and bona fide belief that [his rape victim] voluntarily consented ... to engage in sexual intercourse, it is apparent he does not possess the wrongful intent that is a prerequisite under Penal Code section 20[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] to a conviction of . . . rape . . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 155.) <em>Mayberry </em>concluded it was prejudicial error, <em>when requested by the defendant </em>and when supported by substantial evidence, to fail to give the \u201cmistake of fact\u201d instruction, i.e., an instruction which directs the jury to acquit the defendant if the jury has a reasonable doubt as to whether or not the defendant believed reasonably and in good faith the victim freely consented. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 157-158; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1983) 144 Cal.App.3d 55, 62-63 [192 Cal.Rptr. 409].)</p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number>Because <em>Mayberry </em>addressed only the issue of the duty of the court to give a requested instruction, we must address what factors trigger the duty of a court to instruct the jury on the <em>Mayberry </em>defense without a request to do so. On this issue there is disagreement among the reported decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">Division Three of the First Appellate District addressed this question in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hampton </em>(1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 324 [173 Cal.Rptr. 268], After reviewing <em>People </em>v. <em>Mayberry </em>regarding reasonable belief, and the general principles set forth in <em>People </em>v. <em>Flannel, supra, 25 </em>Cal.3d 668, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Sedeno, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d 703, the <em>Hampton </em>court stated: <em>\u201cMayberry </em>compels the conclusion that, by itself, the testimony of a defendant in a rape case that the prosecutrix consented can be sufficient to require the giving of the reasonable belief instruction. Moreover, the reasonable belief in consent defense is not inconsistent with the defense of actual consent; to the contrary, the defendant who relies on the defense of consent necessarily also relies on the defense that he had a reasonable and good faith belief that there was consent. <em>We conclude that in every case wherein consent is offered as a defense to a charge of rape or unlawful oral copulation, the court must instruct the jury in the language of CALJIC Nos. 10.23 and 10.40.1.\u201d (People </em>v. <em>Hampton, supra, </em>118 Cal.App.3d at pp. 329-330, italics added.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">Division Two, also of the First Appellate District, addressed the same issue in <em>People </em>v. <em>Romero </em>(1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 1149 [215 Cal.Rptr. 634], and stated: \u201cHowever, while we agree that the defense of consent and the <em>Mayberry </em>defense are compatible and often will be raised together, we cannot agree with the holding in <em>Hampton </em>that the two defenses are inseparable <em>nor do we feel that the raising of consent necessarily compels a sua sponte instruction on the Mayberry defense.\u201d (Id., </em>at p. 1154, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">Before discussing the <em>Hampton/Romero </em>conflict, it is important to distinguish between the threshold issue of whether the <em>Mayberry </em>instruction must be given sua sponte, and the issue of whether the defendant can prevail on the <em>Mayberry </em>defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">For the affirmative defense to prevail, the defendant has the burden of proving \u201che had a bona fide and reasonable belief\u201d the victim consented. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mayberry, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at p. 157.) The belief must be \u201creasonable\u201d (CALJIC Nos. 10.23, 10.40.1, 10.50.1 and 4.35).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> That is, even</p>\n<p id=\"b886-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>though the defendant actually believed the victim consented, was that belief reasonable under the circumstances? Also, it must be \u201cbona fide\u201d <em>(ibid.)\u2019, </em>in other words, honestly held. \u201cIn <em>People </em>v. <em>Mayberry [supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 143] . . ., the Supreme Court used the terms \u2018good faith,\u2019 \u2018genuinely,\u2019 and \u2018bona fide\u2019 interchangeably to require the belief be honestly held.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Trapps </em>(1984) 158 Cal.App.3d 265, 269 [204 Cal.Rptr. 541].) The concepts of a reasonable and a bona fide belief are not totally separate, for a defendant may be \u201caware of contrary facts which rendered such a belief wholly unreasonable, and hence in bad faith.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stewart </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 133, 140 [127 Cal.Rptr. 117, 544 P.2d 1317].) Penal Code section 26<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> does not refer to either reasonableness or good faith, but the Supreme Court requires these two elements to coexist for the defense of mistake of fact to prevail. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hernandez </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 529, 534-536 [39 Cal.Rptr. 361, 393 P.2d 673, 8 A.L.R.3d 1092]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mayberry, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at pp. 155-157.) As to the degree of proof necessary to prevail, the defendant is \u201conly required to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether he had such a belief.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 157.) It is the exclusive province of the jury to determine whether the defendant had a reasonable and good faith belief the victim consented.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Regarding the threshold issue of whether the mistake of fact instruction should be given in the first instance, it is appropriate to deal with the Attorney General\u2019s contentions on appeal which directly address this question. It is contended the appellant admitted giving a severe beating to his wife on February 11 ;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> therefore, \u201cAs a matter of law, appellant could not have a reasonable belief that [his wife] consented to sexual intercourse after she was almost killed by the appellant on February 11, 1981.\u201d The other contention is similar, namely, the charge of attempted penetration with a foreign object (a canine penis)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is such a \u201cdepraved, degrading type of assault\u201d that it is \u201cinherently incredible\u201d to believe that after the severe beating the appellant reasonably believed his wife \u201cconsented to this re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1143\">*1143</page-number>volting abuse.\u201d During trial appellant repeatedly asserted that his wife was a willing participant in all the charged offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">The answer to the Attorney General\u2019s contentions is contained in <em>People </em>v. <em>Modesto </em>(1963) 59 Cal.2d 722 [31 Cal.Rptr. 225, 382 P.2d 33]: \u201c <em>\u2018However incredible the testimony of a defendant may be he is entitled to an instruction based upon the hypothesis that it is entirely </em>true.\u2019\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 729, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Carmen </em>(1951) 36 Cal.2d 768, 772-773 [228 P.2d 281], italics original.) We agree with the Attorney General\u2019s assertion that \u201creasonableness\u201d is judged by objective standards and, in this case, the appellant\u2019s testimony concerning his wife\u2019s alleged consent could be characterized as unreasonable or incredible. Nevertheless, as stated above, reasonableness and good faith are questions the jury must resolve, and resolve in defendant\u2019s favor if he is to prevail. On the threshold issue of whether the <em>Mayberry </em>instruction shall be given, the court would err by relegating the responsibility of determining the reasonableness, good faith or credibility of defendant\u2019s assertions exclusively to itself. Again, as stated in <em>Modesto, \u201c\u2018The fact that the evidence may not be of a character to inspire belief does not authorize the refusal of an instruction based thereon. </em>\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Modesto, supra, </em>59 Cal.2d at p. 729, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Carmen, supra, </em>36 Cal.2d at pp. 772-773, italics original.) The Attorney General\u2019s contention that we should declare, as a matter of law, the appellant\u2019s assertions are unreasonable is, in reality, a request that we declare the appellant\u2019s assertions to be incredible as a matter of law. The fact that evidence may be incredible, or is not of a character to inspire belief, does not authorize the refusal of an instruction based thereon, for that is a question within the exclusive province of the jury. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Flannel, supra, </em>25 Cal.3d at p. 684.)</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">As to the Attorney General\u2019s argument the court may \u201cas a matter of law\u201d determine appellant\u2019s testimony in this case was so inherently unreasonable the sua sponte duty to instruct did not arise, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 539 [205 Cal.Rptr. 265, 684 P.2d 826], we disagree. Indeed, a court properly may determine as a matter of law there was no \u201c \u2018 \u201cmaterial issue\u201d \u2019 \u201d presented by the evidence, because there was not \u201c \u2018 \u201cany evidence deserving of any consideration whatsoever\u201d \u2019 \u201d or there was \u201c\u2018no evidence worthy of consideration to the contrary.\u2019\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 556, quoting in part from <em>People </em>v. <em>Thornton, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at pp. 768-769, fn. 20.) The <em>Garcia </em>decision also cites <em>People </em>v. <em>Cantrell </em>(1973) 8 Cal.3d 672 [105 Cal.Rptr. 792, 504 P.2d 1256], along with <em>Thornton, </em>as the two decisions which relax the rigidity of the <em>Modesto </em>per se reversal rule. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garcia, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d at p. 555.) The holdings of these cases are commonly referred to as the <em>\u201cCantrell-Thornton </em>exception.\u201d (I<em>d., </em>at p. 556.) The <em>Cantrell-Thornton </em>exception, however, does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1144\">*1144</page-number>provide that evidence may be disregarded because it appears to be unreasonable or incredible. The concept of <em>no </em>evidence worthy of consideration in <em>Thornton </em>is entirely different from the concept in the case at bar of <em>substantial </em>evidence. Where there is substantial evidence of a <em>Mayberry </em>defense, the court cannot \u201cas a matter of law\u201d reject this theory simply because it appears to be unreasonable or incredible. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Ramos </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 136, 149 [207 Cal.Rptr. 800, 689 P.2d 430].)</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">In addition to the existence of substantial evidence, the other prong of the threshold issue in determining whether to give the <em>Mayberry </em>instruction sua sponte, is a determination that the instruction is not \u201cinconsistent with the defendant\u2019s theory of the case.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sedeno, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d at p. 716.) For example, if the defendant\u2019s theory is one of mistaken identity, the giving of an instruction concerning the defendant\u2019s belief in the victim\u2019s consent sua sponte, much less over the defendant\u2019s objection, clearly would constitute \u201cpotential prejudice.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>This is not the situation below. Appellant never denied his active participation in the offenses; hence, mistake of fact was not inconsistent with his theory of defense, namely, consent. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hampton, supra, </em>118 Cal.App.3d at p. 329.)</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">With regard to this threshold issue, it is significant that in <em>People </em>v. <em>Rivera </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 736 [203 Cal.Rptr. 842], and in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hampton, supra, </em>118 Cal.App.3d 324, it Was held there was a sua sponte duty to give the <em>Mayberry </em>instruction. In both <em>Hampton </em>and <em>Rivera, </em>as in the instant case, the defendant himself testified the victim voluntarily consented to the sexual advances. A precise understanding of why the defendant\u2019s \u201cconsent\u201d testimony is significant is helpful in analyzing this threshold issue. In a rape trial where the defendant himself testifies, his \u201cconsent\u201d testimony normally will fall into two categories; out-of-court statements of the victim and the defendant\u2019s observations of the victim\u2019s conduct. When a defendant testifies the victim said \u201cI consent,\u201d the evidence is relevant for the specific nonhearsay purpose of proving the defendant had reason to believe the victim consented (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Duran </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 282, 295 [127 Cal.Rptr. 618, 545 P.2d 1322, 90 A.L.R.3d 1]) and for the additional purpose of proving the victim consented.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> When a defendant de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1145\">*1145</page-number>scribes noncommunicative conduct by the victim from which consent is inferred, the testimony is relevant to prove actual consent and, also, to prove the defendant had reason to believe the victim consented. The effect of either of these two categories of evidence is to raise two theories of defense simultaneously: the defense of actual consent, and the defense of defendant\u2019s belief the victim consented.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">If it is a defense to a crime the defendant entertained a good faith and reasonable belief the victim consented, and the defendant testifies the victim consented, then unless the relevant inference derived from that testimony, namely, the defendant believed the victim consented, is not deserving of any consideration whatever, the court must give the <em>Mayberry </em>instruction to the jury sua sponte, provided that instruction is not inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s theory of defense. This is true even though the defendant\u2019s testimony appears unreasonable or does not inspire belief.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">Keeping in mind the foregoing discussion, we return now to the <em>Romero/ Hampton </em>conflict. The <em>Romero </em>opinion correctly notes the <em>Mayberry </em>court never addressed the sua sponte issue because in <em>Mayberry </em>the mistake of fact instruction was requested. Likewise, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra, </em>144 Cal.App.3d 55, where we held it was prejudicial error to fail to give the <em>Mayberry </em>instruction, the sua sponte issue was not addressed, because the <em>Mayberry </em>instruction was requested.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Romero, supra, </em>171 Cal.App.3d 1149, the defendant did not testify. It was stipulated, however, that \u201cat the time of his [the defendant\u2019s] arrest [he] told the police he had not forced Mrs. M. to engage in sex with him, \u2018we just had oral sex and drank a beer. She said it was good.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1153.) The appellate court noted the record was \u201cdevoid\u201d of evidence which might have caused the defendant \u201cto mistakenly believe that she [the victim] consented to have sex with him.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1156.) In addition, we note there was no express statement by the defendant the victim consented; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1146\">*1146</page-number>rather, his statement was \u201che had not forced\u201d the victim to have sex with him. The <em>Romero </em>court correctly held, in the context of such evidence, that a <em>Mayberry </em>instruction was not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">We agree with <em>Romero </em>that <em>Hampton </em>must be viewed in its factual setting. In <em>Hampton </em>(as in Rivera) there arose a sua sponte duty to instruct pursuant to <em>Mayberry, </em>because there was substantial evidence of the mistake of fact defense. As in <em>Romero, </em>there are indeed instances in which the defense of consent is raised, but the defense of mistake of fact does not merit consideration by a jury. In <em>Romero, </em>the introduction of a stipulated out-of-court statement deprived the jury of its ability to judge the credibility of the defendant by his demeanor on the witness stand; the jury could not judge the character and quality of his testimony, or his ability to remember or to communicate. (See CALJIC No. 2.20.) Thus, the <em>Romero </em>jury was deprived of essential tools by which it could determine whether the defendant\u2019s alleged belief was honestly held or reasonable. Furthermore, in <em>Romero </em>the defendant\u2019s statement was so equivocal it was impossible to determine what, if anything, the defendant actually believed.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\"><em>Romero </em>stresses the importance of equivocal<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> conduct by the victim which \u201creasonably could be misunderstood by the defendant.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Romero, supra, </em>171 Cal.App.3d at p. 1156.) We agree that equivocal conduct by the victim is an example of the type of evidence which may give rise to the <em>Mayberry </em>defense. But insofar as <em>Romero </em>states \u201cA defendant relying on a <em>Mayberry </em>defense <em>must </em>produce some evidence of equivocal conduct by the victim which led him to reasonably believe that there was consent where in fact there was none\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Romero, supra, </em>171 Cal.App.3d at p. 1156, italics added), we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\"><em>People </em>v. <em>Mayberry, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d at page 156 stated \u201cIn addition\u201d the victim herself provided testimony supporting the requested instruction, namely, her behavior was \u201cequivocal.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Hampton, supra, </em>118 Cal.App.3d at page 329 interprets this to mean that in <em>Mayberry </em>there was evidence of equivocal behavior which \u201cprovided <em>additional </em>support\u201d for the giving of the mistake of fact instruction. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 329-330.) In this respect we agree with the <em>Hampton </em>analysis of <em>Mayberry. </em>If it is asserted that equivocal conduct is the sine qua non for determining whether there is \u201csome evidence \u2018deserving of . . . consideration\u2019 \u201d for the jury, we find no support for that position in case law. In fact, the adoption of such a rule would lead to error.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1147\">*1147</page-number>For example, if the defendant testifies the victim unequivocally consented, that is, there was nothing uncertain, undecided or misleading regarding the victim\u2019s alleged consent, and assuming this was the only evidence before the court, pursuant to the <em>Romero </em>rule a court would not give the <em>Mayberry </em>instruction because there was not some evidence of equivocal conduct. Clearly this would constitute error.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">The question is whether there is substantial evidence to support the defendant\u2019s <em>belief </em>the victim consented. Proof of unequivocal consent by the victim actually constitutes stronger evidence in support of a defendant\u2019s belief, and the reasonableness of that belief, than evidence of equivocal conduct. We would agree, however, with the <em>Romero </em>opinion\u2019s insistence on at least some evidence of equivocal conduct by the victim where, in the context of that case, there was no evidence of unequivocal consent, much less evidence of what, if anything, the defendant believed.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">The answer to the threshold question of whether the mistake of fact instruction must be given sua sponte is not found in any specific formula, such as whether \u201cconsent is offered as a defense\u201d <em>(Hampton) </em>or there is \u201cequivocal conduct\u201d by the victim <em>(Romero), </em>or whether the defendant does or does not take the stand, etc. In the search for certainty it is misleading to suggest there is some touchstone which determines the presence of substantial evidence which, in turn, triggers a sua sponte duty to instruct. In some cases, as in <em>Romero, </em>there will be evidence not \u201cdeserving of . . . consideration.\u201d This is not solely because of a lack of evidence of equivocal conduct, but because, for the reasons indicated above, the evidence in the particular case did not rise to the level of \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">Similarly, we choose not to follow the language in <em>Hampton </em>that in \u201cevery case\u201d wherein consent is \u201coffered\u201d as a defense, the court must instruct the jury pursuant to <em>Mayberry. </em>The mere offer of the defense of consent clearly is not synonymous with substantial evidence of mistake of fact. This point is illustrated by <em>People </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, supra, </em>141 Cal.App.3d 786, which held CALJIC No. 10.23 need not be given sua sponte where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1148\">*1148</page-number>the defendant did not testify and the \u201conly \u2018evidence\u2019 concerning his belief was his counsel\u2019s theory [mistake of fact] in closing argument.\u201d <em>(Id.., </em>at p. 793.)</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">In the case at bar appellant\u2019s reasonable belief in the victim\u2019s consent<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> was supported by substantial evidence. It is clear nothing more than the testimony of a defendant may be sufficient to trigger the duty to instruct sua sponte on the defense of a bona fide belief in the victim\u2019s consent. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hampton, supra, </em>118 Cal.App.3d 324, 329, interpreting <em>People </em>v. <em>Mayberry, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 143; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rivera, supra, </em>157 Cal.App.3d 736, 741.) In the instant case appellant never denied the events, which formed the crux of the state\u2019s charges, took place. Rather, appellant consistently contended that his wife consented or agreed to each act. Appellant testified throughout his direct examination that his wife said \u201cI\u2019m willing to,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m willing to continue doing it,\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about it ... I can handle it,\u201d and \u201cShe agreed to it.\u201d Appellant described conduct by his wife indicating consent. The testimony of appellant clearly supported the inference he believed his wife consented to the acts of intercourse and to the act of penetration by a foreign object. That inference, in turn, constituted evidence deserving of consideration by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">In addition to appellant\u2019s testimony, there was circumstantial evidence from which the jury could infer appellant believed his wife consented. There was testimony appellant\u2019s wife sent approximately 18 letters to appellant reiterating a theme of love for appellant and a fear that appellant would leave her. There was testimony on many occasions appellant\u2019s wife orally professed her love for appellant. There was testimony appellant\u2019s wife carried a loaded pistol in her purse at all times (and, presumably, could have threatened appellant with it and made her way to neighbors or the police). Three witnesses testified, in effect, appellant\u2019s wife was sexually promiscuous.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">Accordingly we must conclude, under these facts, there was evidence worthy of consideration by a jury that appellant believed his wife consented. Therefore, the trial court was required to give the mistake of fact instruction in the language of CALJIC No. 10.23 sua sponte. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hampton, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number><em>supra, </em>118 Cal.App.3d 324; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rivera, supra, </em>157 Cal.App.3d 736.)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">\n<em>(b) Was it reversible error?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">Having determined that the failure to instruct pursuant to CALJIC No. 10.23 was error, we turn to the question of whether or not that error requires a reversal of the convictions on counts I through V.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">In determining whether the error in omitting a required instruction on an affirmative defense is prejudicial, we must apply the rule of <em>People </em>v. <em>Sedeno, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d at page 720.

Such error denies the defendant the constitutional right to a jury trial on a material issue, and the denial of such a right constitutes a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d within the meaning of article VI, section 13 of the California Constitution.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>(People </em>v. <em>Modesto, supra, 59 </em>Cal.2d at p. 730.)</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">Despite the fact that our review of the record establishes the evidence against the appellant was overwhelming, and despite the fact that we might be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that instructing the jury pursuant to CALJIC No. 10.23 would not have resulted in a more favorable verdict, we are required by the doctrine of stare decisis to follow the decisions of our Supreme Court when those decisions have given us clear and unequivocal rules to follow. <em>(Auto Equity Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 450, 455 [20 Cal.Rptr. 321, 369 P.2d 937].) Thus, we are not free to examine the entire cause and determine if the error \u201cwas harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 711, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065], where there is error in a criminal case of federal constitutional dimensions.) Much less are we free to determine, under a more forgiving standard, whether it was reasonably probable the error was harmless. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836-837 [299 P.2d 243], where the wrong instruction is given.)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b894-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>In the absence of the defendant conceding the issue, the only formula available on appeal to cure an error arising from failure to instruct on an affirmative defense supported by substantial evidence is set forth in <em>People </em>v. <em>Stewart, supra, </em>16 Cal.3d 133, 141, quoting in part from <em>Sedeno: </em>\u201c[A] failure to instruct where there is a duty to do so can be cured if it is shown that \u2018the factual question posed by the omitted instruction was necessarily resolved adversely to the defendant under other, properly given instructions.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">In this case, no other instruction was given concerning the defense of appellant\u2019s reasonable and good faith belief in the victim\u2019s consent, although the defense of actual consent was presented to the jury and rejected as indicated by the verdict. As stated by this court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson, supra, </em>144 Cal.App.3d 55, 63: \u201cThe only analysis permitted is to determine if the omitted issue was decided adversely to appellant by the jury in another context.

The issue was whether evidence of convictions for two prior sex offenses was admissible. The Supreme Court held they were not, because they were not relevant to any issue in the case.
