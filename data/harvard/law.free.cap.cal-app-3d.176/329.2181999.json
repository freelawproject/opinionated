It is only when a party is \u201caggrieved\u201d by a judgment or order that he or she may appeal. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 902.) For a valid appeal one must be injuriously affected by the court\u2019s ruling in an immediate and substantial manner, and <em>not </em>as a nominal or remote consequence. <em>(Simac Design, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alciati, </em>92 Cal.App.3d 146, 153 [154 Cal.Rptr. 676]; <em>Winter </em>v. <em>Gnaizda, </em>90 Cal.App.3d 750, 754 [152 Cal.Rptr. 700].)  And the rule that an appeal may be taken only by an aggrieved party is \u201cstrictly applied by reviewing courts.\u201d <em>(Kunza </em>v. <em>Gaskell, </em>91 Cal.App.3d 201, 206 [154 Cal.Rptr. 101].)</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Here the \u201creferenced,\u201d or suggested, Civil Code section 232 action may never be filed, and if filed, may result favorably to Ms. S. No immediate or substantial prejudice is discerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">From its reading of the entire record of the case involving Candy, this court suggests that it would probably be in the interest of justice and of her sisters, if the Sonoma County Juvenile Court authorities were to investigate the conditions under which Wendy and Sandy are now living, and take such action, if any, as might be deemed appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">The orders dated December 12 and 17 are, and each is, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Racanelli, P. J., and Newsom, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b292-14\">See footnote <em>ante, </em>page 329.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
