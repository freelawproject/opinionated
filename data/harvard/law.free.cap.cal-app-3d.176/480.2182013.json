(Merrill Lynch) appeals from an order made after judgment (Order) in favor of plaintiffs and respondents John A. McConnell, Marguerite McConnell and Caroline W. Barrie, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated (the Class). Merrill Lynch alternatively petitions this court for a writ of mandate modifying the Order from which it appealed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>The petition for writ of mandate was deferred to be considered with the appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Class has requested that sanctions be imposed on Merrill Lynch for prosecuting a frivolous appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the Order, deny the petition for a writ of mandate, and impose sanctions for a frivolous appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Statement of Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">This case is a class action originally filed in 1973 alleging that Merrill Lynch violated the California Usury Law by charging interest on its margin accounts in excess of the 10 percent limit then permitted. This cause of action was subsequently dismissed. The complaint was amended in 1975 to allege that Merrill Lynch charged compound interest on its margin accounts in violation of section 2 of the California Usury Law (Deering\u2019s Ann. Uncod. Measures \u00cd919-1 (1973 ed.) p. 40; 10 West\u2019s Ann. Civ. Code (1985 ed.) foil. \u00a7 1916.12 at p. 173.). Section 2 prohibits the charging of compound interest (i.e., interest on interest) \u201cunless an agreement to that effect is clearly expressed in writing and signed by the party to be charged therewith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">The trial court sustained Merrill Lynch\u2019s demurrer to the compound interest cause of action on the ground that Merrill Lynch\u2019s customer agreement on its face complied with section 2. The California Supreme Court reversed the decision of the trial court in <em>McConnell </em>v. <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 365 [146 Cal.Rptr. 371, 578 P.2d 1375, 18 A.L.R.4th 1050] holding that the customer agreement was not sufficient on its face to comply with section 2 of the Usury Law. On remand the trial court decertified the class based on its view that it would be necessary to receive the testimony of each class member as to his or her understanding of the customer agreement. Subsequently, the California Supreme Court in <em>McConnell </em>v. <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 816 [191 Cal.Rptr. 458, 662 P.2d 916] ruled that parol evidence was not admissible to explain the meaning of the customer agreement concerning the issue of compound interest and the written disclosure provided by Merrill Lynch to its customers regarding the charging of compound interest on margin accounts did not satisfy section 2 because the written disclosure was not signed by the customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">Beginning in late 1983, the parties began settlement negotiations resulting in a settlement agreement in January of 1984. This settlement agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>provided that Merrill Lynch would pay up to $7 million for payments to class claimants, attorneys fees, and administrative costs. The agreement further provided that if claimants submitted valid claims totaling more than $4.8 million, payments would be reduced pro rata; any part of the $7 million not paid to claimants, for attorneys fees, or for administrative costs would be returned to Merrill Lynch.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The settlement agreement was submitted to the trial court for its approval. The trial court indicated that it would approve the agreement with the following changes;</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">1. The settlement fund would be increased to $10 million;</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">2. The trial court would have the authority to increase payments to class claimants in the event the total claims (including attorneys fees and administrative costs) were less than the $10 million settlement fund; and</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">3. Merrill Lynch would forfeit the entire $10 million even if all the deposited funds were not required to effectuate its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">Merrill Lynch agreed to increase the fund to $10 million, but it initially refused to forfeit unused funds. Subsequently, Merrill Lynch agreed to give the trial court absolute discretion to increase or decrease payments to class claimants and to determine what amount, if any, of the settlement fund would be returned to Merrill Lynch. The parties agreed to waive the right to appeal the exercise of that discretion. A revised settlement agreement was entered into by the parties on February 29, 1984. That agreement provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-10\">\u201c8. If the valid claims filed by class members are such that payments in accordance with the schedule set forth in paragraph 4, in addition to the payment of the attorneys\u2019 fees and litigation costs of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel as fixed by the Court and the costs of administration of this settlement as provided in paragraph 12, would exceed the amount of money in the escrow account, the amounts to be paid to class claimants will be decreased as the Court, in its absolute discretion, directs so that the total amount to be paid by Merrill Lynch will not exceed the amount in the escrow account. If the valid claims filed by class members are such that the payments in accordance with the schedule set forth in paragraph 4, in addition to the payment of the attorneys\u2019 fees and litigation costs of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel as fixed by the Court and the costs of administration of this settlement as provided in paragraph 12, would be less than the amount in the escrow account, the amounts to be paid to class claimants may be increased as the Court, in its absolute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>discretion, directs. After such time as the amounts due to class members in accordance with the schedule set forth in paragraph 4, together with the amounts necessary for payment of the attorneys\u2019 fees and litigation costs of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel as fixed by the Court and the costs of administration of this settlement as provided in paragraph 12, are paid or reserved for payment, Merrill Lynch shall have the right to petition the Court for the return of the excess funds, if any, in the escrow account to Merrill Lynch, and the decision of the Court after a full hearing at which the Court has had full opportunity to exercise its discretion to increase the amounts to be paid the class claimants, as aforesaid, shall not be appealable by any of the parties to this Settlement Agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">On April 17, 1984, the revised settlement agreement was approved by the trial court and judgment was entered on April 19. The trial court expressly reserved jurisdiction to effectuate the terms of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">On December 13, 1984, the trial court, after a hearing, entered an Order increasing the payments to class claimants by approximately 200 percent. Merrill Lynch appeals from this Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">Merrill Lynch contends that:</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">1. The December 13, 1984, Order is an appealable order pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 904.1, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">2. The trial court did not have jurisdiction to require Merrill Lynch to waive its right to appeal as a condition of approving a settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">3. The trial court erred by inappropriately inserting itself on behalf of the class into the negotiations for a settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-12\">4. The trial court abused its discretion by increasing the amount to be paid to claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-13\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b420-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b420-15\">\n<em>The December 13, 1984, Order Is an Appealable Order Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 904.1, Subdivision (b)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b420-16\">Section 904.1 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides in pertinent part: \u201cAn appeal may be taken from a superior court in the following cases: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>(a) From a judgment . . . . (b) From an order made after a judgment made appealable by subdivision (a).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">However, an order made after a judgment is not appealable under subdivision (b) if the appeal from the order presents the same questions as would have been presented on appeal from the judgment. (See, <em>Hilliker </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees </em>(1928) 91 Cal.App. 521 [267 P. 367].) The rationale for this rule is to preclude the possibility of two appeals from the same decision, or to preclude an unwarranted extension of time to appeal starting from the subsequent order if the aggrieved party failed to take a timely appeal from a judgment. (See <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Holy Cross Hospital </em>(1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 1007 [148 Cal.Rptr. 273]; 6 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1971) Appeal, \u00a7 91, p. 4098.)</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Judgment was entered in this action on April 19, 1984. No appeal was taken from that judgment. The Order here appealed from was entered December 13, 1984, and a notice of appeal was filed on the same date. It is clear that the judgment of April 19 was a final appealable judgment under section 904.1, subdivision (a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the December 13 Order is appealable pursuant to section 904.1, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">However, the appeal from the Order presents many of the same issues that could have been raised on an appeal from the judgment. Accordingly, those issues may not now be raised in this appeal. We conclude that the following issues are, therefore, not appealable:</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">1. Whether or not the trial court erred by inappropriately inserting itself on behalf of the class into the negotiations for a settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">2. Whether or not the trial court had jurisdiction to require Merrill Lynch to waive its right to appeal as a condition of approving a settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">The sole issue pending in this appeal is whether the trial court abused its discretion by increasing the amounts to be paid to claimants. We are of the opinion that the Order is appealable pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 904.1, subdivision (b) only to this extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">\n<em>Merrill Lynch Expressly Waived Its Right to Appeal the Exercise of Discretion as Evidenced by the Order Appealed</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">It is well-settled that a party may expressly waive its right to appeal subject to only a few conditions: 1. The attorney must have the authority to waive a party\u2019s right to appeal. 2. The waiver must be express and not implied. 3. The waiver must not have been improperly coerced by the trial judge. (See 6 Witkin, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>Appeal, \u00a7 133, p. 4121.)</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">Merrill Lynch does not contend that its attorneys did not have the authority to waive its right to appeal. Nor does it contend that the waiver was not express. Its sole contention in this regard is that the trial court improperly coerced Merrill Lynch into waiving its right to appeal, by requiring it to waive such right as a condition to approving a settlement agreement in a class action suit. To support this contention it relies primarily on <em>Wuest </em>v. <em>Wuest </em>(1942) 53 Cal.App.2d 339 [127 P.2d 934],</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">In <em>Wuest </em>v. <em>Wuest </em>the trial judge coerced plaintiff\u2019s counsel into a stipulation waiving findings and thus precluding an appeal by threatening to deny a divorce to his client if he failed to stipulate. In <em>Wuest </em>the attorney clearly was not authorized to waive his client\u2019s right to appeal nor was the waiver express, since the waiver flowed from the waiver of findings. In addition, the trial court <em>during a trial </em>improperly made the waiver of appeal the price to be paid for a judgment to which the plaintiff was entitled by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">This case is not even remotely similar to <em>Wuest. </em>Here, the trial court initially indicated that it would not approve the settlement agreement unless Merrill Lynch agreed to forfeit the entire $10 million settlement fund. This Merrill Lynch declined to do. Subsequently, it was suggested as a compromise that the trial court be given the <em>absolute </em>discretion to increase or decrease the amount of claims to be paid to class claimants and to determine the amount of the fund, if any, to be returned to Merrill Lynch. The parties would waive their right to appeal this exercise of discretion. Merrill Lynch agreed to this compromise.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">The waiver of the right to appeal was, therefore, not improperly coerced by the trial court, but was part of complicated negotiations concerning a settlement agreement. If Merrill Lynch was not satisfied with the arrangement, the parties could have noticed a formal settlement hearing on their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>initial settlement agreement (in the face of the court\u2019s probable disapproval of the terms) and appealed (or sought a writ) if the court in fact rejected the proposed terms. Merrill Lynch did not choose to pursue this alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">We conclude, therefore, that the waiver was a valid waiver of appeal rights and that Merrill Lynch has no right to appeal from the Order. Moreover, the issue of the existence of a valid waiver of the right to appeal is an issue which could have been raised on an appeal from the judgment and so is not cognizable in the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Sanctions</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">We now address the question as to whether sanctions should be imposed under Code of Civil Procedure section 907 and rule 26(a) of the California Rules of Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">In its brief on appeal and its brief in support of a motion to dismiss appeal, respondent Class requested that this court award sanctions for attorneys\u2019 fees and interest on the loss of use of the money on the grounds that the contentions on appeal were frivolous. Appellant Merrill Lynch argued against the imposition of sanctions in its brief in opposition to the motion to dismiss appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">On September 13, 1985, we issued an order to show cause why sanctions should not be assessed against Merrill Lynch and its counsel. The order to show cause stated in full as follows: \u201cGood cause appearing therefor, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. and its attorneys Rogers &amp; Wells and McDonald, Halsted &amp; Laybourne, are hereby ordered to appear before this court in its courtroom at 3580 Wilshire Boulevard, on September 19, 1985, at 10:30 a.m., to show why sanctions should not be assessed against you in the above appeal. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 907, Cal. Rules of Court, rule 26, subd. (a). <em>In re Marriage of Flaherty </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 637, 649.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">The date set for the hearing on the order to show cause was the same date set for oral argument on the appeal and the petition for a writ of mandate. On that date both parties appeared by counsel and the issue of sanctions was argued extensively and vigorously by both sides.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">\u201cFree access to the courts is an invaluable aspect of our system of jurisprudence. A party possessing a colorable claim must not be chilled from asserting it by fear of unwarranted sanctions. [Citations omitted.] However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>where an appeal is frivolous . . . Code of Civil Procedure section 907 and California Rules of Court, rule 26(a), authorize the court to impose penalties and damages.\u201d <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>R.K.A. Management Corp. </em>(1979) 99 Cal.App.3d 460 [160 Cal.Rptr. 164].)</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">An appeal is frivolous when it has no merit, when any reasonable attorney would agree that the appeal is totally without merit. (See <em>Menasco </em>v. <em>Snyder </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 729, 734-735 [203 Cal.Rptr. 748].)  The uncontradicted facts in this case demonstrate the lack of any merit in this appeal. As part of a settlement agreement, Merrill Lynch expressly and unconditionally waived its right to appeal any decision of the trial court regarding increases of payments to class claimants and amounts to be returned, if any, to Merrill Lynch from the settlement fund.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Judgment was entered on April 19, 1984, and no appeal was taken therefrom. After taking advantage of all the benefits of the settlement agreement, Merrill Lynch now asks this court to find that it was coerced into one portion of the settlement agreement, a portion which it only found objectionable after it was applied to Merrill Lynch\u2019s detriment.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">This case has been litigated for twelve years, has been the subject of two California Supreme Court opinions, as well as one opinion and three unreported writ proceedings in this court, and was settled only after substantial negotiations involving both the parties and the trial court. Merrill Lynch at this late date is using this appeal to attempt to renege on the express terms of a settlement agreement it freely entered into. We cannot sanction such an abuse. This appeal and its accompanying petition for a writ of mandate are frivolous in nature and deserving of appropriate sanctions. We must now determine the amount of such sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Respondent Class requests this court to assess sanctions in the form of compensatory damages\u2014attorneys fees and interest on the loss of use of the money.  The purposes of imposing sanctions for a frivolous appeal are to discourage such appeals and to compensate the respondents for the loss which results from delay. (See <em>Huber </em>v. <em>Shedoudy </em>(1919) 180 Cal. 311, 316-317 [181 P. 63].)  In a case involving a $10 million settlement fund, a nominal sanction would do nothing to discourage such appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>in the future. Moreover, as a consequence of the frivolous appeal, payments to Class claimants have been delayed approximately one year. Therefore, we assess Merrill Lynch and its counsel Rogers &amp; Wells<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as sanctions for prosecuting this frivolous appeal an amount equal to the actual interest earned by the settlement fund from the date the notice of appeal was filed to the date this opinion is filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The Order is affirmed.  The petition for writ of mandate is denied.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Respondent Class is awarded its costs and attorneys fees on appeal. In addition, sanctions are imposed upon Merrill Lynch as set forth above to be recovered as costs by the respondent Class.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">Klein, P.

Merrill Lynch cannot obtain by extraordinary writ the right to appeal which it validly waived.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
