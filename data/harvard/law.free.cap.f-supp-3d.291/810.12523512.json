Wilhoit, Jr., United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter is before the Court upon Owners Insurance Company's and Frontier Housing, Inc.'s cross motions for summary judgment [Docket Nos. 22 and 24]. The motion has been fully briefed by the parties [Docket Nos. 24-1, 25, 26, 27 and 28] and for the reasons stated herein, the Court finds that Owners Insurance Company is entitled to summary judgment and does not owe Frontier Housing Inc. a duty to defend or indemnify as to the claims asserted against Frontier Housing Inc. by Stephen Burton and Pamela Burton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case arises from a construction contract between Defendants Frontier Housing, Inc. (\"Frontier\") and Stephen and Pamela Burton (\"The Burtons\") for the construction of their home in West Liberty, Kentucky. The original contract set the price of constriction around $200,000. However, a result of alleged change orders and upgrades, the legitimacy of which are hotly contested by the Burtons, the ultimate price of the construction was upwards of $400,000. According to Frontier, the Burtons owe it $250,000. According to the Burtons, they owe Frontier about $17,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The matter resulted in litigation. On December 10, 2014, Frontier filed a mechanics lien against the Burton's property. Subsequently, Frontier filed its breach of contract action in the Morgan Circuit Court against Stephen Burton and Pamela Burton, styled\n   <em>\n    Frontier Housing Inc., v. Stephen Burton and Pamela Burton\n   </em>\n   , Commonwealth of Kentucky, Morgan Circuit Court, Civil Action No. 15-CI-0062.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In response to the Complaint filed against them, the Burtons asserted a counterclaim against Frontier, alleging breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, negligent infliction of emotional distress, fraud, forgery, intentional misrepresentation, intentionally filing Mechanics and Materialman's Lien based on false information, the intentional infliction of emotional distress, intentional violations of the Kentucky Consumer Protection Act KRS \u00a7\u00a7 367.110, et. seq., the tortuous breach of contract and abuse of process and slander of title.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Owners Insurance Company (\"Owners\") issued a commercial policy of general liability insurance Policy No. 52454382, (\"Policy\") to Frontier, which was in effect from October 2014 to October 2015. [Docket No. 24-3].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 10, 2015, counsel for Frontier, John Ellis, sent a letter to Plaintiff giving notice of the Burtons' claim against Frontier presented in Counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On August 18, 2015, Owners advised Frontier that it intended to provide a defense\n   under a reservation of rights but also advised that some or all of the allegations contained in the Counterclaim may not be covered under the policy. Specifically, Owners asserted that the alleged misrepresentations by Frontier, as well as other intentional acts, are not covered under the policy it issued to Frontier.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Pursuant to that policy, Owners filed this declaratory judgment action, seeking a judicial determination as to whether it owes a duty of defense or indemnity to Frontier for the Burtons' counterclaim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Both Owners and Frontier seek summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Whether a defense or coverage is owed under an insurance policy is a question of law. The basic principles governing the interpretation of an insurance policy as well established. Clear an unambiguous terms must be construed according to the \"plain and ordinary\" meaning. Ambiguities are to be construed in favor of the insured, yet there is no requirement that every doubt be resolved against the insurer. Further, a court may not enlarge or restrict coverage under the guise of contract construction; exceptions and exclusions should be construed to make insurance effective, unless they run afoul public policy.\n   <em>\n    See generally,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ky.

However, Kentucky law precludes coverage in this instance because the Burtons have not provided medical evidence in support of their claim. Without expert medical proof of the alleged emotional distress, their claim fails. See\n   <em>\n    Osborne v.

[Docket Nos. 24-4 and 24-5, Deposition of Pamela Burton, p. 106, 1. 7-15, and Deposition of Stephen Burton, p. 148, 1. 6-10]. Nor have experts been retained in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The clear terms of the Policy limit coverage to either \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\", neither which is alleged against Frontier. Therefore, there is no coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In addition, the Policy explicitly excludes intentional acts from coverage:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   This insurance does not apply to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Expected Or Intended Injury\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \"Bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.

Specifically, the policy provides that no coverage is provided for intentional acts and likewise no coverage is provided for criminal acts. These exclusions are clearly stated in the policy and are unambiguous; therefore, they must be enforced as written.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In its dispositive motion, Frontier makes vague and somewhat puzzling arguments. First, it contends that the Policy should be interpreted so as to favor the insured the insured. However, this misstates the law which requires that there be an ambiguity in policy language, before any favoritism is permitted.\n   <em>\n    See generally,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bituminous Casualty Corp. v. Kenway Contracting, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8362654\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/240/633/\">\n    240 S.W.3d 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ky. 2007). In the absence of an ambiguity, the terms of the policy will be construed according to their \"plain and ordinary meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Nolan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11473509\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/10/129/#p131\">\n    10 S.W.3d 129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 131-32 (Ky. 1999). The Policy at issue is not ambiguous, in any light.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Frontier also appears to contend that it may be entitled to coverage under the Employee Dishonesty Coverage form in the policy. Yet, there is no basis for coverage in this regard. The Employee Dishonesty Coverage form provides coverage for Frontier's losses of Frontier's property caused by the act of Frontier's employees\n   <em>\n    against\n   </em>\n   Frontier. The Burtons' Counterclaim, on the other hand, concerns only Frontier's actions against the Burtons and the Burtons' property. By its own terms, this form does not apply to these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Nor is Frontier entitled to a defense or coverage for an \"advertising injury,\" as it suggests in its dispositive motion. Frontier's Motion for Summary Judgment cites a section of the policy providing coverage for an \"advertising injury\" and specially references the following definition: \"oral or written publication, in any manner, of material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a persons or organizations goods, products or services in your \"advertisement.\" Frontier's Motion fails, however, to note the following definition of \"advertisement\" found in policy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   \"Advertisement\" means a notice that is broadcast or published to the general public or specific market segments about your goods, products, or services, for the purpose of attracting customers or supporters. For purposes of this definition:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   a. notices that are published include material placed on the internet, or similar electronic means of commutations; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   b. regarding websites, only that part of website that is about your goods, products or services for the purpose of attracting customers or supporters is considered an advertisement.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   [Docket No. 24-3].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Nothing in the Burton's Counterclaim references a Frontier Housing advertisement. There is no evidence, allegation, or even suggestion that any Frontier advertisement ever or in any way slandered or libeled the Burtons or disparaged the Burton's goods, products or services. Because there is no viable claim under the advertising injury coverage found in the policy, there is no duty to indemnify or defend Frontier pursuant to that coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Court is mindful that the primary purpose of a general liability policy is to provide comprehensive insurance.\n   <em>\n    See generally,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown Foundation Inc. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9972298\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/814/273/\">\n    814 S.W.2d 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Ky. 1991).
