Frank was an \"insured\" under a Homeowners Policy and a Personal Liability Umbrella Policy issued by State Farm, but the company disputes coverage. The parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Dkt. Nos. 20, 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Frank's violent assault on Kogler occurred during the \"Bay to Breakers\" event in San Francisco on May 20, 2012. Kogler alleges that Frank consumed LSD and alcohol in an amount that caused him to \"black out,\" in which state he attacked Kogler at the race event.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 1-1. Kogler sued Frank in San Francisco Superior Court for negligence, negligent infliction of emotional distress, false imprisonment, and violation of Health and Safety Code Section 11700.\n   <em>\n    Kogler v. Frank\n   </em>\n   , Case No. CGC-13-531536. That case ended in a $5 million judgment against Frank and an agreement to assign his coverage claims to Kogler. Dkt. No. 1-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   State Farm declined to provide coverage or a defense in the state court action. This case addresses the propriety of State Farm's decisions. Standing in the shoes of Frank as his assignee, Kogler asserts seven claims against State Farm: breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (under the Homeowners Policy and the Personal Liability Umbrella Policy); breach of contract (again for both policies); and under California Insurance Code Section 11580. Dkt. No. 1-1. The summary judgment motions involve all of these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I. \"ACCIDENT\" COVERAGE UNDER THE HOMEOWNERS AND UMBRELLA POLICIES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Coverage under the Homeowners Policy is triggered by an \"occurrence,\" which in turn requires an \"accident.\" Dkt. No. 20-2 \u00b6 1; Dkt. No. 20-3, Ex. 1 at 16, 2. The Umbrella Policy also requires an \"accident\" in some circumstances. That policy promises to pay on behalf of the insured\n   \"damages because of a loss\" that exceed the retained limit, as well as to \"provide a defense\" if a \"suit is brought against any insured for damages because of a loss....\" Dkt. No. 20-2 \u00b6 2; Dkt. No. 20-3, Ex. 2 at 6. \"Loss\" is defined in two disjunctive ways, and the first definition requires \"an accident.\" Dkt. No. 20-3, Ex. 2 at 2 (\u00b6 7(a) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Kogler has failed to meet her burden of establishing a potential of coverage under these provisions.

No. 20-3, Ex. 4 \u00b6 7. Frank \"lifted plaintiff up off the ground by her hair and began pulling plaintiff through the grass towards a grove of trees. Plaintiff immediately felt immense pain and attempted to remove Frank's grasp of her hair, but was unable to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=211%20P.3d%201083\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff alleged that as a result of this encounter, she suffered the \"immediate loss of 20 large chunks of hair, permanent loss of hair, and severe emotional distress.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   That is the gravamen of plaintiff's complaint against Frank, and those facts are not disputed. For purposes of summary judgment, the parties have stipulated that Daniel Frank \"grabbed plaintiff Carly Kogler by the hair and deprived her the freedom of moving away and/or escaping, which plaintiff Carly Kogler did not consent to. Daniel then pulled plaintiff's hair from behind with sufficient force to lift her from the ground and began dragging her, which caused him to rip out chunks of her hair.... Plaintiff suffered physical and emotional injuries as a result of the attack.\" Dkt. No. 20-2 \u00b6 4. Nor does plaintiff dispute that these were the very same facts known by State Farm at the time defense of the suit was tendered and refused.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 22 at 4 (at the time it declined coverage, State Farm was aware that Frank \"grabbed and pulled plaintiff by the hair without her consent and deprived her the freedom of moving away and/or escaping, which plaintiff did not consent to.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Under\n   <em>\n    Delgado\n   </em>\n   , these facts taken together establish that plaintiff's injuries \"were not as a matter of law accidental, and consequently there is no potential for coverage under the policy\" provisions here which require an \"accident.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3899435\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/47/302/#p311\">\n    47 Cal. 4th at 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20298\">\n    97 Cal.Rptr.3d 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=211%20P.3d%201083\">\n    211 P.3d 1083\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. \"PERSONAL INJURY\" COVERAGE UNDER THE UMBRELLA POLICY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   One relevant portion of the Umbrella Policy does not require an \"accident.\" The second definition of \"loss\" under the Umbrella Policy makes no mention of an \"accident,\" and instead refers only to \"the commission of an offense which first results in personal injury during the policy\n   period.\" Dkt. No. 20-2 \u00b6 2; Dkt. No. 20-3, Ex. 2 at 2. The definition of \"personal injury\" includes \"injury other than bodily injury arising out of ... false imprisonment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=211%20P.3d%201083\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Here, plaintiff's underlying complaint alleged false imprisonment against Frank, Dkt. No. 20-3, Ex. 4 \u00b6\u00b6 29-31, and he also pled guilty to a criminal misdemeanor charge of false imprisonment as against Kogler. Dkt. No. 20-5, Exs. 12-14.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   So for this portion of the Umbrella Policy, Kogler has met her burden of establishing a potential for coverage, and the burden consequently shifts to the insurer to negate that possibility of coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   To meet that burden, State Farm relies on both the exclusionary language in the policy itself as well as the statutory exclusion in California Insurance Code Section 533 that is implied into every insurance contract. Plaintiff herself acknowledges that the exclusion for \"willful acts\" in Insurance Code Section 533 likely applies and precludes indemnification for the alleged false imprisonment at issue here. Dkt. No. 22 at 1. That conclusion has some support.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State Farm Gen. Ins. Co. v.

No. 20-3, Ex. 2 at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   State Farm has met its burden of proving the applicability of this exclusion. Three key cases show why.\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez v.

The exclusion in that case was very similar to this one in foreclosing coverage for damages that are \"either expected or intended from the standpoint of an insured.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1239,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=184%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20394\">\n    184 Cal.Rptr.3d 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

There is no allegation or suggestion that anyone other than Frank dragged plaintiff by the hair and caused her injuries. There is no possibility raised in the complaint that Frank might be found liable for creating the conditions that led to plaintiff's false imprisonment; rather, the allegation is that he falsely imprisoned her by dragging her by the hair without her consent. Dkt. No. 20-3, Ex. 4 \u00b6 7. And it is stipulated for summary judgment purposes that Frank did indeed grab plaintiff \"by the hair and deprived her the freedom of moving away and/or escaping,\" Dkt.

Without deciding, then, what California law should be, the Court finds that\n   <em>\n    Hanover\n   </em>\n   is not consonant with California law as it currently stands. This is so because, as our circuit has determined, California follows the principle that if an insured can form an intent to act, the intent to harm is irrebuttably presumed and evidence of a mental state is irrelevant.\n   <em>\n    Morton by Morton v. Safeco Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1807239\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/905/1208/#p1210\">\n    905 F.2d 1208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1210-12 (9th Cir. 1990). In that sense, other state decisions like\n   <em>\n    Wessinger v. Fire Insurance Exchange\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12020669\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/949/834/\">\n    949 S.W.2d 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex. App. 1997), are more consistent with the way California approaches questions of assaultive conduct and intent. While the Court shares the\n   <em>\n    Hanover\n   </em>\n   court's concern for victims and the desire to promote the \"public interest that the victim be compensated,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3901590\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/413/781/\">\n    413 Mass. at 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=604%20N.E.2d%20689\">\n    604 N.E.2d 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this cannot trump the policy language itself and the law in this jurisdiction. The Court is also mindful of the countervailing public policy that the decision to voluntarily intoxicate oneself-with illegal drugs, no less-should not be abetted or rewarded by the comfort that one's ensuing savagery will be paid for by the insurance company. In addition, allowing voluntary intoxication to void an agreed-upon exclusion for intentional harm would unduly disrupt settled contract expectations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   There was no \"accident\" and State Farm has established the applicability of the exclusionary clause in the Umbrella Policy here, and consequently it has no duty to indemnify or defend Frank for the underlying action. State Farm's motion for summary judgment, Dkt. No. 20, is granted. Plaintiff's cross-motion, Dkt. No. 21, is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   What remains in the case is not entirely clear. Plaintiff disputes the propriety of granting summary judgment on \"non-coverage issues\" at this point of the litigation, Dkt. No. 22 at 20-21, and State Farm also appears to believe that some portion of this case may be left even if it had no insurance coverage duties as a matter of law. Dkt. No. 25 at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Court consequently directs the parties to file a joint statement addressing this issue by\n   <strong>\n    January 19, 2018\n   </strong>\n   . If the parties are in agreement that this order resolves the entire case, the Court will enter judgment in favor of State Farm and close the case. If the parties believe some part of the action may still be left, they are to suggest a case management plan for addressing and resolving those remaining claims by motion practice or otherwise. The parties may also propose dates for a further case management conference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    The pending requests for judicial notice, Dkt. Nos. 20-4 &amp; 23-1, are granted, and the evidentiary objections, Dkt. Nos. 23-5 &amp; 25-1, are overruled. The Court also grants plaintiff's motion for leave to supplement the record, Dkt. No. 36, but finds that the newly proffered evidence does not change the outcome here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    The contrast between the facts of\n    <em>\n     Gonzalez\n    </em>\n    and those here also shows why this reading of the exclusionary provision does not render the insurance policy illusory. If the facts here had been closer to\n    <em>\n     Gonzalez\n    </em>\n    , there would have been a possibility of coverage for a false imprisonment claim notwithstanding the existence of this exclusionary clause, as was the case in\n    <em>\n     Gonzalez\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
