Miller is an investment professional with experience in the global oil and gas exploration and production industry.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1. Miller began working for Mercuria EG at its global headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland on or about June 2008.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22. Miller subsequently moved to Texas and entered into an employment agreement with Mercuria's U.S. affiliate, METI, which is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Greenwich, CT.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 12, 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In late 2009, Miller negotiated and orchestrated Mercuria's acquisition of a lucrative oil and gas investment company known as Glacco Compania Petrolera S.A.

Following the acquisition, Miller remained significantly involved with Glacco's governance and operations, serving as its Director and President.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27. Miller also negotiated an operating agreement with Roch S.A. (\"Roch\") to operate Glacco's oil and gas assets in Argentina.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mercuria created the company Upstream Latinoam\u00e9rica, S.L.

Compl. at \u00b6 34. Article 14 of the Articles of Association defines the dissolution events that would trigger the preferred liquidation quota as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   The Company will be dissolved ... in the case that the Company assets directly or indirectly consist of shares in the capital of another operating company or companies, when (i) the Company proceeds to transfer all of its share capital or the majority of the control of the company or operating companies owned directly or indirectly by the Company to any third party, whether by sale, non-monetary contribution, structural modification or admission to list on a secondary official market; or (ii) such operating company or companies owned directly or indirectly by the Company proceed to transfer all or the majority of the assets resulting from its activities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ULA Articles of Association at art. 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Miller resigned from Mercuria in October 2012. Compl. at \u00b6 36. In consequence, Miller and defendants METI, Mercuria Capital, Mercuria US Holdings, and Mercuria EAM (as well as another Mercuria affiliate, Mercuria Bakken, LLC) entered into a Mutual Release and Settlement Agreement (the \"Separation Agreement\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 36-37;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   Ex.

A-1 at p. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   With respect to the JWM Glacco Carried Interest, the Separation Agreement first states by way of background that Miller owns Class A shares that, \"pursuant to the terms of ULA's Articles of Association,\" grant him \"in certain predetermined scenarios, the right to receive a preferred liquidation quota equal to seven percent (7%) of the operating profit of ULA exceeding an investment rate of return of ten percent (10%).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex.

It continued, \"[n]othing in this Settlement Agreement or specifically the provisions set forth in this Section V shall be interpreted or construed to override or otherwise conflict with any of the terms and conditions of ULA's Articles of Association.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"To the extent of any such conflict, you and Mercuria BV [a/k/a Mercuria EAM] agree that the terms and conditions of ULA's Articles of Association ... shall prevail over this Settlement Agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Finally, the Separation Agreement contains the following forum selection clause: \"Any action to enforce the terms of this Settlement Agreement, or arising from or relating to this Settlement Agreement, shall be brought in the United States Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex.

As\n   part of this transaction (known as the \"Phoenix Transaction\"), Mercuria EAM entered into a share purchase agreement pursuant to which it sold the entirety of its shareholdings in ULA (that is, all the shares of ULA other than Miller's) to Trefoil Holdings B.V. (\"Trefoil\"), another Mercuria holding company. Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 51, 55. Trefoil indirectly owned, through several of its subsidiaries (including ULA), 99.99% of the shares of PETSA, the operating company for Mercuria's Argentinian oil and gas exploration and production business (including Glacco).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51. Then, all of Trefoil Holding's shares were sold to Andes Energia. Andes Energia in turn sold about 75% of its shares (1,899,106,385 shares) to Upstream Capital Partners VI Limited (\"Upstream Capital\"), an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of Mercuria EG.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 57;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   Ex.

Here, the parties dispute only whether the Mercuria Parties breached the Separation Agreement.

Therefore, he argues, damages under Count III are governed by the Mercuria Parties' threshold agreement to redeem the JWM Glacco Carried Interest pursuant to the Articles of Association, whereas\n   damages under Count II are governed by Section V(B) of the Separation Agreement, which describes a specific valuation methodology for the JWM Glacco Carried Interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.

Even setting aside the Court's foregoing conclusion that the Separation Agreement does not incorporate the ULA Articles of Association to the extent Miller claims, Miller's argument fails: Either the ULA Articles of Association are incorporated by reference into Section V of the Separation Agreement, in which case Count III is duplicative of Count II, or they are not incorporated by reference, in which case the Mercuria Parties have no obligation to redeem Miller's rights under the ULA Articles of Association and accordingly cannot have breached the duty of good faith and fair dealing by failing to do so.

Therefore, the forum selection clause does not modify the laws and jurisdiction that govern ULA's relationship with Miller pursuant to the Articles of Association and this Court lacks personal jurisdiction over ULA with respect to Count I, the only count brought against ULA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Phoenix Global (Counts IV and V)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Miller offers three reasons to find Phoenix Global sufficiently \"closely related\" to the Mercuria Parties and the Separation Agreement to be bound by the forum selection clause: (1) Mercuria EG, the parent company of all the Mercuria Parties, is a majority owner of Phoenix Global; (2) Phoenix Global now holds the Glacco oil field assets (and relatedly, now holds all the ULA shares that Mercuria EAM once held); and (3) \"Mercuria\" holds three seats on Phoenix Global's board. Specifically, Anuj Sharma, the head of Mercuria EG's Argentine subsidiaries, was appointed Phoenix Global's Chief Executive Officer; Matthieu Milandri, the Investment Director at METI, was appointed as Director of Phoenix Global; and, most significantly, Guillaume Vermersch, the sole director of ULA, was appointed as Director of Phoenix Global. Compl. Ex. E-1 at 24-26. In\n   addition, Mercuria EAM now owns a relatively small number of Phoenix Global shares.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Phoenix Global argues that it is not closely related because it could not have foreseen that it would be subject to the forum selection clause, given that the Separation Agreement was executed prior to Phoenix Global's involvement in the underlying transactions at issue. That is not dispositive, however, since the same is true of successors-in-interest, who \"unquestionably fit within the definition of closely related.\"\n   <em>\n    KTV Media Intern., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4182132\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/812/377/#p386\">\n    812 F.Supp.2d at 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Nevertheless, the Court finds that Phoenix Global could not have foreseen that it would be subject to the forum selection clause, and does not otherwise satisfy the \"closely related\" test, for two reasons. First, the relationship between Phoenix Global and the Mercuria Parties is more attenuated than the relationships courts have previously found sufficiently close to bind non-signatories to a forum selection clause. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Electric Mobile Cars, LLC v. Electric Mobile Cars, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the court found a close relationship between a signatory and non-signatory that were alter egos.

In\n   <em>\n    Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios\n   </em>\n   , non-signatory Groupe Canal owned 65% of non-signatory Canal &amp; France, which owned 100% of Canals &amp; Distribution, which was the successor-in-interest of TPS, the signatory to the contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. The relationships between the entities were vertical: every entity found closely related to the signatory had an ownership (or ownership-like, in the case of the successor-in-interest) relationship with the signatory. Here, by contrast, the relationship between Phoenix Global and the Mercuria Parties is primarily horizontal, as they are both owned, to varying degrees, by Mercuria EG. As a result, Phoenix Global's interests are not \"completely derivative of and directly related to, if not predicated upon, the signatory party's interests or conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Weingrad\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%202990645\">\n    2005 WL 2990645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The second (and related) reason this Court finds Phoenix Global and the Mercuria Parties insufficiently closely related to render Phoenix Global bound by the forum selection clause is that Phoenix Global did not play an active role in the transaction giving rise to plaintiff's claims,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   plaintiff's denial of his right to redeem his preferred shares. \"The vast majority of cases that have found a nonsignatory bound by a forum selection clause under the theory that they are 'closely related' to the dispute or the signatory, have done so where the non-signatory had a far more active role in the transaction.\"\n   <em>\n    Leviton Mfg.

Moreover, there is little reason to think that Phoenix Global would have been put on notice, as a result of the share exchange between Trefoil Holdings and Andes Energia, of the forum selection clause in a separation agreement between various other Mercuria entities and a former Mercuria employee, simply because the separation agreement addressed (among other things) the Class A preferred shares of ULA, one of Phoenix Global's (many) subsidiaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Miller also argues that Phoenix Global is a successor-in-interest to ULA and therefore subject to the forum selection clause on that basis. \"[I]f successorship is established, a non-signatory is subject to the ... presumption of the enforceability of mandatory forum selection clauses.\"\n   <em>\n    Aguas Lenders Recovery Grp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3480551\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/585/696/#p701\">\n    585 F.3d at 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that ULA is itself subject to the forum selection clause, Phoenix Global is not. The Court notes, as an initial matter, that Miller has not identified a single case where a court enforced a forum selection clause against a successor-in-interest to a non-signatory bound by a forum selection clause because of its close relationship to the transaction (as opposed to a successor-in-interest to a signatory to a forum selection clause).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   More fundamentally, the law views corporations as entities \"endowed with a separate and distinct existence from that of its owners. Because a principal purpose for organizing a corporation is to permit its owners to limit their liability, there is a presumption of separateness between a corporation and its owners, ... which is entitled to substantial weight.\"\n   <em>\n    Am.

Specifically, Andes Energia agreed \"to acquire the entire issued share capital of Trefoil Holdings,\" Compl. Ex. D at p. 11, the parent company of ULA. Therefore, Phoenix Global, though the Phoenix Transaction, bought 99.6% of the shares of ULA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In response, Miller contends that notwithstanding that the Phoenix Transaction was effected by a share exchange, it was in actuality a \"combination of assets.\" He cites the fact that in exchange for selling Trefoil holdings, Mercuria's Upstream Capital in turn received shares of Phoenix Global, which resulted in its 75% ownership of Phoenix Global. But plaintiff does not explain why an exchange of shares, as opposed to a one-sided purchase, is tantamount to a purchase of assets. And while plaintiff cites documents describing the transaction as a \"combination\" of Mercuria and Andes Energia's oil and gas \"asset bases in Argentina,\" Compl. Ex. E-1, pp. 1, 8, two companies can \"combine\" their asset bases through a share purchase. Plaintiff cites no case where a transaction was structured as a share purchase but nevertheless treated as an asset purchase for purposes of the successor-in-interest test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Since, therefore, Phoenix Global is not ULA's successor-in-interest, it could only be bound by the forum selection clause (again, assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that ULA is bound by the forum selection clause) if ULA and Phoenix Global's \"separate corporate structures should be disregarded under the doctrine of corporate veil-piercing.\"\n   <em>\n    Golub\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2000%20WL%201024688\">\n    2000 WL 1024688\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. \"Those seeking to pierce a corporate veil ... bear a heavy burden of showing that the corporation was dominated as to the transaction attacked and that such domination was the instrument of fraud or otherwise resulted in wrongful or inequitable consequences.\"\n   <em>\n    TNS Holdings, Inc. v.
