Defendants are charged in an eighteen-count superseding indictment with conspiracy to commit bribery and honest services fraud (Count 1), violating the Travel Act (Count 2), bribery (Counts 3-14), and honest services mail and wire fraud (Counts 15-17). Menendez is additionally charged with making false statements to a government agency (Count 18). After a nine-week trial, the jury failed to reach a verdict on all counts. For the following reasons, the Court denies the motion as to Counts 1-8, 15, 16, and 18, and grants the motion as to Counts 9-14 and 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court assumes the parties' familiarity with the facts for the purposes of this motion. As to the procedural history of this case, Defendants were arraigned under a superseding indictment on August 22, 2017. Jury selection began that day, and trial commenced on September 6. On October 11, at the close of the Government's case, Defendants made their first motion for acquittal. Oct. 11, 2017, Tr. at 88; ECF No. 241. Following oral argument and briefing by the parties, the Court denied the motion in part and reserved in part. Oct. 16, 2017, Tr. at 34-57. Defendants renewed their motion on October 30 at the close of all evidence. ECF No. 261. In addition, Menendez moved to dismiss Count 18 on the ground that the Government had not introduced evidence that venue is proper in this District. ECF No. 262. After the jury deadlocked and the Court declared a mistrial, Defendants again renewed their Rule 29 motion on November 30. ECF No. 281.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29 requires the Court to enter a judgment of acquittal on \"any offense for which the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction.\" Fed.

Following Defendants' presentation of evidence, Menendez made the additional argument that the Government failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that venue in this district is proper on the false statements count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

During this same period of time, there is evidence that Menendez reached his highest public office, that of the United States Senate, and became a member of the Finance and Foreign Relations Committees.

There is evidence to support the conclusion that from 2009 to August 2012, at various times and with various representatives of Medicare and with cabinet officials, Menendez sought to pressure or advise such officials to look at the controversy favorably to Melgen by making personal phone calls to officials in the Department of Health and Human Services, which has overall direction of Medicare policy, and meeting with the then-secretary of that agency in August 2012.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Oct. 2, 2017, Tr. at 82 (2009 phone call with Jonathan Blum); Oct. 3, 2017, Tr. at 179, 187 (August 2012 meeting with Kathleen Sebelius and others).

First, the language of\n    <em>\n     McDonnell\n    </em>\n    requires that a public official who advises another official know or intend that his advice will \"form the basis\" for an official act, but does not impose such a limitation when the public official engages in an official act by \"exert[ing] pressure.\" The two alternatives are set out in separate sentences, and the \"exert[ing] pressure\" sentence does not require that the public official know or intend that the pressure \"form the basis\" of the ultimate official act.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598120\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2355/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598120\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2355/\">\n     at 2370\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Consequently, the Government is not required to prove that a public official knew or intended that inter-branch advocacy would \"form the basis\" for any official act if such advocacy comes in the form of \"exert[ing] pressure.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598120\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2355/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Second, it is certainly possible for inter-branch advocacy to \"form the basis\" for an official act. Defendants essentially acknowledge this when they posit a hypothetical in which a senator persuades the President to veto a bill, and argue that it would not constitute an official act. ECF No. 241-1, at 52. If, as they suggest, a senator in fact convinced the President to veto a bill he otherwise would have signed, then the pressure would have \"formed the basis\" for the official act under any reasonable understanding of that phrase.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Defendants further argue that limiting\n    <em>\n     McDonnell\n    </em>\n    's, \"exert[ ] pressure\" and \"advise\" language to intra-branch advocacy is necessary to prevent its application from being overbroad. ECF No. 241-1, at 52. The Court disagrees.\n    <em>\n     McDonnell\n    </em>\n    carefully drew the line between advocacy that could serve as an \"official act\" and advocacy that could not. The Chief Justice laid out multiple limitations on this type of official action.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    An official does not take an \"official act\" by \"[s]imply expressing support [for an official act] ... as long as the public official does not intend to exert pressure on another official ....\"\n    <em>\n     McDonnell\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598120\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2355/\">\n     136 S.Ct. at 2371\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

This cramped reading of\n    <em>\n     McDonnell\n    </em>\n    is contrary to the purpose of section 201 and the language of the\n    <em>\n     McDonnell\n    </em>\n    Court. Given the clear limitations in the\n    <em>\n     McDonnell\n    </em>\n    opinion, Defendants' reading is not necessary to save its application from overbreadth.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Defendants' motion for acquittal on this basis is denied.

A Rational Juror Could Find that Melgen Gave Menendez Gifts Intending that Menendez Take Official Actions He \"Would Not Otherwise Take.\"\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Defendants next argue that acquittal is required on Counts 2-17 because the Government failed to prove that that either defendant had the specific intent to commit bribery. ECF No. 241-1, at 43. Specifically, they argue that the Government failed to introduce evidence that Menendez took official action that he would not otherwise take.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    In explaining the requisite intent to commit bribery, the Third Circuit has stated that the Government must prove that \"the payor provided a benefit to a public official intending that he will thereby take favorable official acts that he would not otherwise take.\"\n    <em>\n     United States v. Wright\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3863162\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/665/560/#p568\">\n     665 F.3d 560\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 568 (3d Cir. 2012).\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Defendants rely on this language to argue that the Government must show that Menendez \"accepted a bribe with the intent to take favorable official acts that he would not otherwise take.\" Oct. 11, 2017, Tr., at 208. As the Court has stated, that language describes the requisite intent of the payor, not the public official. Nov. 11, 2017 Tr. at 57. The Third Circuit stated that \"[the factfinder] must conclude that\n    <em>\n     the payor\n    </em>\n    provided a benefit to a public official intending that he will thereby take favorable official acts that he would not otherwise take.\"\n    <em>\n     Wright\n    </em>\n    , 664 F.3d at 568 (emphasis added). In contrast, the court went on to say that the factfinder \"must conclude that the\n    <em>\n     official\n    </em>\n    accepted those benefits intending, in exchange for the benefits, to take official acts to benefit the payor.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Consequently, the \"would not otherwise take\" standard applies only to Melgen. As to him, Defendants argue that a jury could find only that Melgen provided the things\n    of value as a reward, but not as an attempt to influence. They therefore argue that this would constitute only a gratuity, and not a bribe. ECF No. 241-1, at 44.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    From the evidence introduced at trial, viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, a rational juror could find that Melgen had the intent to influence Menendez in the performance of official acts, regardless of Menendez's earlier advocacy. With regard to the Medicare billing dispute, it is true that Menendez had taken steps to help Melgen before the alleged bribe. That does not mean, however, that Menendez remained willing to intercede again on Melgen's behalf. A rational juror could infer that Melgen provided things of value with the intent to influence Menendez to take up the issue again, believing that he otherwise would not have done so. Further, Menendez's 2009 advocacy is itself charged as an official act in a bribery scheme,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 149, at \u00b6\u00b6 146-82, and there is no reason to conclude that, if that advocacy was the result of a bribe, Melgen believed he no longer had to pay Menendez for further advocacy in 2012.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    With regard to the Brownfield meeting, Defendants argue that Melgen cannot have made the May 16, 2012 contribution with the intent to influence Menendez because, when Melgen agreed on May 11 to make the contribution, Menendez had already scheduled the meeting. ECF No. 241-1, at 47. However, the Government introduced evidence from which a rational juror could infer that Melgen had already agreed to make the contribution before Menendez scheduled the Brownfield meeting.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , GX 133 (April 30 email from Eduardo Rodriguez (Melgen's son-in-law and employee) to Daniel O'Brien (Menendez's chief of staff) stating \"don't worry ... [w]e will take care of [the contribution]\"). Because the relevant timing in a bribery case is that of the agreement (and not any resulting exchange), a rational juror could find that Melgen made the May 16 contribution with the intent to influence Menendez to advocate for him with Brownfield.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Defendants also argue, as with the Medicare dispute, that Menendez's earlier advocacy with regard to the ICSSI contract is conclusive evidence that Melgen did not have the intent to influence because Menendez would take the requested action without receiving a thing of value. The Court rejects this argument for the same reasons.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    With regard to the visa applications, Defendants argue that Menendez's similar advocacy for other visa applicants is conclusive evidence that Melgen did not have the intent to influence Menendez in the performance of official acts. ECF No. 241-1, at 48. Defendants point to evidence in the record indicating that visa-related advocacy by Menendez and other senators is not unusual. However, that Menendez provided similar assistance to others is not evidence that would preclude a juror from finding that Melgen believed that offering things of value would influence Menendez. There is no evidence that Melgen was aware of Menendez's similar efforts for others, such that he could expect Menendez's assistance in three separate visa matters as a matter of course. \"It goes without saying that matters of intent are for the jury to consider.\"\n    <em>\n     McCormick\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6221807\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/257/#p273\">\n     500 U.S. at 270\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6221807\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/257/#p273\">\n     111 S.Ct. 1807\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (citing\n    <em>\n     Cheek v.

This is far less unusual than an on-demand denial of summary judgment without any familiarity with the case or consultation of the motion papers. Further, unlike in\n    <em>\n     Terry\n    </em>\n    , there is no evidence here that Defendants discussed the alleged official acts during the relevant time, and no statement by Melgen that he expected to get special privileges as a result of the political contributions. Even if Menendez's renewed interest in the ICSSI contract did originate from a conversation with Melgen, and was intended to further his interests, there is no evidence that it was in any way related to the contribution.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    The Government also contends that there is evidence that Defendants concealed their conduct. The Government contends that Menendez's intent to exchange his advocacy for Melgen's political contribution is demonstrated by an email from Menendez staff member Jodi Herman in which she stated that she had to \"drag [information about the Brownfield meeting] out of him.\" This failure to disclose further information to a staff member about the subject of the meeting is not sufficient evidence for a rational juror to infer that Menendez was concealing the information. Further, even if Menendez was withholding the information from his staff, there is no evidence that the reason he was doing so was connected to the $60,000 contribution.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    The Government also alleges that Melgen concealed his identity by providing $20,000 through his daughter Melissa. The Government references the circumstance that on the same day that Melgen's daughter donated $20,000 to the NJDSC, she also received a $20,000 check from Melgen's company, VRC. The Government alleges that Melgen made the contribution through an illegal conduit, demonstrating both the concealment of his identity, and also his \"willingness to break the law.\" ECF No. 251, at 6. However, the Government has not introduced any evidence that the check from VRC was reimbursement\n    for the contribution. Further, there is no evidence that such a reimbursement would violate campaign finance laws. And Melgen did nothing to \"conceal\" the remaining $40,000 in contributions. More importantly, none of this is evidence that would permit a rational juror to infer that the donation was connected with the specific official act-Menendez's meeting with Brownfield.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    Finally, the Government argues that an explicit\n    <em>\n     quid pro quo\n    </em>\n    can be inferred from the \"defendants' pattern of corrupt activity and concealment, established through a years-long stream of benefits in return for official acts.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 11. However, a rational juror cannot infer that Defendants knew the terms of this alleged\n    <em>\n     quid pro quo\n    </em>\n    simply because they are alleged to have committed bribery in another context. In\n    <em>\n     Empress Casino\n    </em>\n    , the jury was not permitted to infer an explicit\n    <em>\n     quid pro quo\n    </em>\n    as to the '06 Act, despite significant evidence that the defendant had engaged in the exact same conduct two years later with the '08 Act.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4181256\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/763/723/#p731\">\n     763 F.3d 723\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Because an explicit\n    <em>\n     quid pro quo\n    </em>\n    requires that the charged defendant be aware of the terms of the precise exchange alleged, general allegations that the defendant was involved in corrupt activity is not sufficient to support such a finding without specific evidence.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Empress Casino\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4181256\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/763/723/#p731\">\n     763 F.3d 723\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    In sum, the evidence introduced by the Government shows only a close temporal relationship between the Brownfield meeting and the contributions, communications between Melgen and Menendez's fundraisers about the contributions, that one member of Menendez's staff stated that she had to \"drag [information] out of him,\" and a check from VRC to Melissa Melgen with the notation of \"Salary.\" This evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, is insufficient to permit a rational juror to find an explicit\n    <em>\n     quid pro quo.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    The Court emphasizes that the agreement need not be express,\n    <em>\n     Siegelman\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203917\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/640/1159/#p1171\">\n     640 F.3d at 1171\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , and that a jury may infer a\n    <em>\n     quid pro quo\n    </em>\n    from circumstantial evidence,\n    <em>\n     Carpenter\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1863226\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/961/824/#p827\">\n     961 F.2d at 827\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

This advocacy culminated in a meeting with then-Acting Administrator of CMS Marilyn Tavvenner in June 2012, and a meeting with then-Secretary of HHS Kathleen Sebelius in August 2012.

Within a week of the Pegasus fundraiser and Melgen's $300,000 contribution to Majority PAC, Menendez scheduled a meeting with Marilyn Tavenner. Oct. 3, 2017, Tr. at 92, 184.

GX 203.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    At the meeting, Menendez asked Tavenner to reexamine CMS's policy regarding multi-dosing. Oct 3, 2017, Tr. at 97-99, 170-71. They discussed multi-dosing generally, and they did not mention Melgen or Lucentis, the medicine Melgen had been multi-dosing.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 98, 167.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    Tavenner followed up with Menendez in July and informed him that CMS believed its multi-dosing policy was clear, and that CMS was not going to make any changes.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 99. Menendez replied that he did not agree with her conclusions, and that he would \"take it to the next steps.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 100. Tavenner believed this to mean that Menendez would bring the issue to Sebelius.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Tavenner testified that this was the only time anyone from Congress brought her an issue and then elevated it to Sebelius.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 101.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    Menendez did elevate the issue to Sebelius.

Menendez then enlisted the help of then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Oct. 4, 2017, Tr. at 51, 58. At Menendez's request, Reid contacted Sebelius to set up a meeting.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 56-59.

Reid opened the meeting and made some introductory comments, and there was testimony at trial that Melgen's name was mentioned by way of introduction. Oct. 2, 2017, Tr. at 98. Menendez led the substantive discussion, and stated that CMS's multi-dosing policy was unclear and unfair to providers. Oct. 3, 2017, Tr. at 183. Menendez discussed wastage of medicine, a change in multi-dosing rules between 2007 and 2010, and the need for policy clarification.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 199-201.

HHS Employee Jonathan Blum testified that Sebelius explained that \"the case was in the administrative process,\" and that \"she had no authority to intervene or change course.\" Oct. 2, 2017, Tr. at 99. Blum then discussed multi-dosing and billing, and explained that it was CMS policy not to pay twice for a drug purchased only once by a physician.

Blum testified that the meeting stuck out to him because of how angry Menendez became, and because meetings with members of Congress usually concern national policies or something within their own state.

After some brief follow-up, Menendez abandoned his efforts with HHS.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    From the evidence introduced at trial, no rational juror could find an explicit\n    <em>\n     quid pro quo.\n    </em>\n    The evidence consists of Defendants' presence at the Pegasus fundraiser, Melgen's June 1 contribution, and Menendez's later advocacy.

ECF No. 251, at 8. Here, the Government points to the circumstance that Melgen made the contribution through VRC rather than his personal account. The Government claims that the jury may infer that this is evidence of concealment because \"most campaign contributions are made by individuals.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4199200\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/638/1006/#p1013\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    However, the Government did not present evidence to show that use of a company's funds to make political contributions is unusual.

GX 240.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    The Government also argues that a rational juror could infer that Melgen concealed his identity because he earmarked the contribution for the New Jersey Senate race, but \"[t]hat earmark ... is absent from Majority PAC's FEC reports.\" ECF No. 251, at 8. However, the Government did not introduce evidence that Melgen's earmark was designed to evade reporting requirements, or that the FEC would have otherwise included the earmark in its report. Further, to use Melgen's choice of contribution method itself as evidence of concealment raises significant First Amendment concerns.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Citizens United\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p318\">\n     558 U.S. at 360\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3639027\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/558/310/#p318\">\n     130 S.Ct. 876\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"By definition, an independent expenditure is political speech ....\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    Finally, the Government argues that a jury can infer an explicit\n    <em>\n     quid pro quo\n    </em>\n    from escalation. Similar to its argument with regard to the Brownfield meeting, the Government contends that a jury can infer an explicit\n    <em>\n     quid pro quo\n    </em>\n    because Menendez advocated against CMS's multi-dosing policy more zealously in 2012 than he had in 2009. ECF No. 251, at 9. The Government specifically refers to Menendez's insistence on speaking with Secretary Sebelius in 2012, while he settled for a phone call with a lower-level CMS employee in 2009. The Government claims that the escalation is also demonstrated because Menendez \"did not conduct any official action on [Melgen's] CMS dispute for years\" before scheduling the meeting with Tavenner in 2012. ECF No. 251, at 9.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    As with the Brownfield meeting, increased advocacy in 2012 is not sufficient evidence from which a rational jury could infer an explicit\n    <em>\n     quid pro quo.\n    </em>\n    The Government's \"escalation\" argument is essentially a recapitulation of its argument that the advocacy and the political contribution occurred close in time. There is no evidence that the advocacy was the result of a bribe, rather than Menendez's frustration that CMS had not been receptive to the concerns he had voiced in 2009. There is evidence that Menendez wanted to speak with Sebelius in 2012 specifically because he \"didn't feel like [he] was getting adequate responses from [CMS].\" Oct. 4, 2017, Tr., at 57. That Senator Reid expressed similar criticism of CMS's multi-dosing policy and agreed to help Menendez further rebuts the Government's contention that Menendez's enthusiasm is evidence of an explicit\n    <em>\n     quid pro quo.\n    </em>\n    The Government's contention that Menendez did not conduct \"any official action\" on the CMS dispute for years ignores that Menendez scheduled a meeting between Melgen and Senator Harkin in 2011 about this issue.

Defendants' presence at the Pegasus fundraiser, that Melgen provided the donation through VRC, and the zealous nature of Menendez's advocacy are not enough to meet the heightened requirement of an explicit\n    <em>\n     quid pro quo.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    The failure of the Government to produce evidence of facts either direct or circumstantial as predicates for proffered inferences evokes Gertrude Stein's celebrated critique of her hometown, Oakland. \"There is no there there.\" Gertrude Stein,\n    <em>\n     Everybody's Autobiography\n    </em>\n    (1937).

Menendez signed his financial disclosure report for calendar year 2010 and dated it May 16, 2011, the same date reflected in a \"RECEIVED, SECRETARY OF THE SENATE\" stamp on the report. GX 101. An itinerary covering May 15-17, 2011 reflects that Menendez was in New Jersey all day on May 16, except for a few hours he spent in New York City. GX 102. It is true that Menendez's administrative director testified that Menendez signed and dated the form not on May 16, but rather \"[t]he previous week and before he left Washington, D.C.\" for New Jersey. Oct. 25, 2017, Tr. at 134:10-11. On balance, however, a rational juror could discount that testimony and conclude that Menendez signed the form while in New Jersey on May 16, and transmitted it (by fax or email, for example) to Washington, D.C. for filing. The administrative director's recollection proved faulty on this\n    topic, for example, when he testified that it was Menendez's practice to \"just sign it for the due date and date it for the due date, not the date that it was signed.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11181102\" index=\"273\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/1/#p6\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11181102\" index=\"273\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/1/#p6\">\n     at 130-33\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Menendez's financial disclosure report for calendar year 2009, which the administrative director testified he helped prepare, reflects that Menendez signed and dated it on May 13, 2010; the form was not filed with the Senate, however, until May 17. GX 99; Oct. 25, 2017, Tr. at 190-91 (referring incorrectly to exhibit 95).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-179\">\n    Second, a rational juror could find that Menendez took an underlying act or acts in furtherance of his scheme to conceal while in the District of New Jersey; that is, a rational juror could find that Menendez received, used, or possessed in this District one or more gifts that should have been reported in his annual Senate financial disclosure forms.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Sept. 13, 2017, Tr. at 141-45 (testimony of pilot Robert Nylund regarding undisclosed Summer 2008 flight from Teterboro, New Jersey to Dominican Republic with Menendez as passenger); GX 87 (listing seven undisclosed flights arriving in or departing from New Jersey on which Menendez was a passenger);\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Hernando Ospina\n    </em>\n    , 798 F.2d at 1577 (finding venue proper in section 1001 prosecution where \"virtually all the acts comprising that scheme to conceal were carried out\" in venue district, including accumulation and transfer of laundered funds).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-180\">\n    Defendants' motion for acquittal on this basis is denied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-181\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      CONCLUSION\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-182\">\n    For these reasons, Defendants' Rule 29 motion is granted in part, and denied in part.

Counsel made this argument based on\n     <em>\n      Ganim\n     </em>\n     's theory of corruption, which he discussed for forty-nine lines without interruption or question.
