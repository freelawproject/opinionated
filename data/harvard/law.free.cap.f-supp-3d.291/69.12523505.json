DHS argues that the charts, data, and metrics in the draft reports are not segregable because they expose the decision-making process of the individuals developing the reports.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DHS Mot. at 12 (\"Specifically, the factual calculations at issue here are imbued with the decision-making of the CRCL subordinate personnel from the choice of statistical modeling utilized and not utilized to the theorizing concerning possible ways to overcome weaknesses in methodologies being considered.\"). Facts are nonsegregable, says DHS, when the selection of which facts to include is itself deliberative.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montrose Chem. Corp. v. Train\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679704,203876\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/491/63/\">\n    491 F.2d 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. Cir. 1974). Because DHS employees selected which data to highlight, that selection process would allegedly shine a light on the deliberative process. Thus, goes the argument, disclosure would dissuade candid discussion within the agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   While DHS is correct that the act of compiling facts and selecting data to include in a summary or report may itself be deliberative and provide protection for the selected facts under Exemption 5, DHS previously determined, and shared publicly, which information and metrics would be included in the statistical reports. As discussed above, that action by DHS appears to have eliminated the decision-making of the report drafter for all portions that merely reflect the metrics previously identified by DHS. Therefore, DHS's argument\n   that the facts are inextricably intertwined in the deliberative nature of the document and cannot be segregated is unsupported.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
