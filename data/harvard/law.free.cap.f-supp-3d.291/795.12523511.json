No. 188, which United States District Judge Sam A. Lindsay has referred to the undersigned United States magistrate judge for determination,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 191. Plaintiff Jacked Up, LLC (\"Jacked Up\") filed a response,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 192, and Sara Lee filed a reply,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 163. For the reasons and to the extent explained below, the Court GRANTS Sara Lee's Amended Motion to Exclude Testimony of Plaintiff's Damages Expert [Dkt. No. 188].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In September 2011, Jacked Up and Sara Lee entered into a licensing agreement (the \"Licensing Agreement\"), in which Jacked Up agreed to license its brand name and proprietary energy drink ingredients to Sara Lee in exchange for royalties. In October 2011, Sara Lee announced the sale of its North American Beverage Division to J.M. Smucker Company (\"Smucker\"), and, amidst concerns that Smucker would not assume the Licensing Agreement with Jacked Up and that Jacked Up would not move forward with market testing, the deal broke down.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 7, 2011, Jacked Up brought a breach of contract claim against Sara Lee in Texas state court. Sara Lee then removed the action to this Court, and Jacked Up added Smucker as a defendant, alleging, among other things, that Smucker interfered with the Licensing Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Jacked Up later added a claim against Smucker for common law trade secret misappropriation and added claims against Sara Lee for breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, and fraudulent inducement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the close of discovery, Smucker, Sara Lee, and Jacked Up each moved for summary judgment and asked the Court to strike certain summary judgment evidence. The Court granted Smucker's and Sara Lee's motions for summary judgment and entered judgment in favor of Sara Lee and Smucker. Jacked Up appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the Court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Smucker, affirmed the Court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Sara Lee on Jacked Up's breach of fiduciary duty claim, and reversed the Court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Sara Lee on Jacked Up's breach of contract claim and fraud and fraudulent inducement claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Fifth Circuit panel declined to affirm summary judgment on the alternative ground that Sara Lee and Smucker had asserted: \"that Jacked Up's evidence of lost profits is speculative.\"\n   <em>\n    Jacked Up, L.L.C. v. Sara Lee Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277111\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/854/797/#p816\">\n    854 F.3d 797\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 816 (5th Cir. 2017). The Court of Appeals noted that \"Jacked Up's evidence of lost profits-an expert report prepared by EJ Janik ('Janik Report')-is critical to its claim for damages. Indeed this expert report is the only evidence of damages in the record.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277111\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/854/797/#p816\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But the panel left \"it to the district court to determine whether Jacked Up has put forth sufficient evidence of damages,\" further explaining that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [t]he district court may choose to conduct a\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   inquiry to determine whether the Janik Report is admissible. Indeed, Sara Lee and Smucker moved to exclude the Janik Report, and this motion was still pending when the district court granted summary judgment. We leave it to the district court to determine whether the Janik Report is admissible, and if it is admissible, whether it establishes lost profits with reasonable certainty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277111\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/854/797/#p816\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277111\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/854/797/#p816\">\n    at 817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In light of the Fifth Circuit's invitation, on remand, Sara Lee filed a Motion for Leave,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 184, seeking to refile its Motion to Exclude the Testimony of Plaintiff's Damages Expert,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 85, which the Court had denied as moot in its order granting summary judgment in favor of Smucker and Sara Lee,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 152. After Jacked Up filed its response, the Court granted Sara Lee's Motion for Leave,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 187, and Sara Lee filed the Amended Motion to Exclude Testimony of Plaintiff's Damages Expert (the \"Motion to Exclude\") that is before the Court,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 188.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In its Motion to Exclude, Sara Lee asks the Court to exclude Janik's opinions because they are unreliable and irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Sara Lee argues that Janik's opinions are unreliable because Janik (1) fails to test or verify the reliability of Sara Lee's pro forma on which he relied (the \"Sara Lee Pro Forma\"); (2) makes other untested and unverified assumptions to increase Jacked Up's purported damages; (3) fails to consider or explain conflicting evidence and other relevant considerations; and (4) fails to deduct Jacked Up's expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   And Sara Lee argues that Janik's opinions are irrelevant because (1) Jacked Up is not entitled to lost profits under Illinois law and (2) the Licensing Agreement limits Jacked Up's potential recovery to only one year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In response, Jacked Up argues that Janik's opinions are reliable because (1) the Sara Lee Pro Forma is objectively reliable because it was created and used by Sara\n   Lee in entering the Licensing Agreement; (2) Janik did not rely exclusively on the Sara Lee Pro Forma to develop his opinions; (3) Janik accounted for Jacked Up's expenses; and (4) Janik applies a discount to his model. Jacked Up further contends that Sara Lee's arguments about the reliability of Janik's opinions go to the weight, and not the admissibility, of Janik's expert testimony and that \"these are issues to be resolved by the trier of fact, not through a[ ] ...\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   [m]otion.\" Dkt. No. 192 at 27 of 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   And, as to the relevance of Janik's opinions, Jacked Up argues that its recovery of lost profits is not barred under Illinois law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    Legal Standards\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In a diversity case, the admissibility of evidence is a procedural issue governed by federal law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reed v.

First, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Amigo\n   </em>\n   , Jacked Up points to no actual revenue data on which Janik relied in calculating lost profits-Janik explicitly relies on the Sara Lee Pro Forma and Jacked Up's own damages estimate in calculating Jacked Up's lost profits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 190 at 166-68 of 297 (estimating lost net profits for the energized tea, coffee, and cappuccino products \"based on Sara Lee's Project Flash 9/15/2011 model or P108 [the Sara Lee Pro Forma], and JU's original calculation\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Second, unlike the\n   <em>\n    Amigo\n   </em>\n   expert, neither Janik nor Jacked Up has explained on what information Janik's assumptions are based and why Janik's assumptions are reasonable. And many of Janik's assumptions conflict with facts in the record, as the Court explains below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Jacked Up's second argument-that, merely because Sara Lee created and used the Sara Lee Pro Forma in determining whether to enter the Licensing Agreement, Janik can reasonably rely on the Sara Lee Pro Forma to calculate lost profits-also fails to persuade for two reasons. First, a company's financial projections are not automatically reliable, such that an expert may rely on the projections without further inquiry or explanation. Second, evidence presented by Sara Lee contradicts Jacked Up's contention that Sara Lee's Pro Forma is objectively reliable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   First, an expert who relies on work provided by another party to calculate lost profits must show some basis for believing that party's projections.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Diabetes Ctrs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%20375505\">\n    2008 WL 375505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2, (excluding expert testimony on lost profits where \"[the expert] conducted no independent research into whether the projected figures given to him by [the plaintiff] were valid, or even reasonable\" and the expert \"was not sure how the projected numbers were developed or who developed them\");\n   <em>\n    JRL Enters.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%2021284020\">\n    2003 WL 21284020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7-8 (collecting cases in which courts have excluded expert opinions where the expert failed to conduct any independent research to determine the reliability of his assumptions);\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stelluti Kerr, L.L.C. v.

And here, neither Janik nor Jacked Up has explained Janik's basis for believing the Sara Lee Pro Forma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In fact, although Sara Lee had created multiple pro formas, or at least multiple versions of the Sara Lee Pro Forma, Janik selected one of the more, if not the most,\n   aggressive options as the basis for his opinions. While Janik's own report does not explain why, Jacked Up suggests that Janik specifically selected the Sara Lee Pro Forma because it was the most \"updated\" or \"finalized\" version.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 192 at 13 of 28. But the evidence to which Jacked Up points in support is inconclusive: on the one hand, Lynda Bartell, Sara Lee's corporate representative, indicated in her deposition that she was unsure whether the pro formas were meant to be separate and distinct or to be updated as information was provided,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 193 at 135 of 232 (Bartell Dep. at 175, lines 5-17), but she explained that it seemed that the latter was true,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=166%20Fed.%20Appx.%20714\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 136 of 232 (Bartell Dep. at 181, lines 11-18). On the other hand, Greg Immell, Sara Lee's former Director of Marketing for Beverage Products who worked with Jacked Up to develop the Licensing Agreement, suggests in his declaration that Sara Lee had created various pro formas using different assumptions of success and that the Sara Lee Pro Forma is the \"max scenario\" which a senior Sara Lee executive had requested. Dkt. No. 190 at 23 of 297, \u00b6\u00b6 43-44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Still, even if the Sara Lee Pro Forma is the most \"up-to-date\" model, that fact alone does not make it a reliable basis for Janik's opinions. Jacked Up offers no argument or evidence suggesting that Janik conducted an independent determination of whether the Sara Lee Pro Forma's projections were valid or reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   But Jacked Up points to the deposition testimony of Paul Pierce, who managed dispensed beverages for 7-Eleven during the time the Licensing Agreement was formed, and argues that, \"[r]ather than suggesting that the Sara Lee Pro Forma was an unrealistic 'gangbusters' scenario, Mr. Pierce's testimony indicates that these projections were entirely reasonable.\" Dkt. No. 192 at 15 of 25. Jacked Up notes that \"Pierce testified unequivocally in his deposition that he was 'eager to deal' with Sara lee regarding the Licensed Products as energy products were 'the hottest category in convenience.'[ ] He indicated that Sara Lee JACKED UP teas 'tested well' and 'tasted great.' Indeed, Mr. Pierce testified that following his meeting with Sara Lee and [Jacked Up] at NACS[,] the Licensed Products would have been 'fast tracked' to market.\" Dkt. No. 192 at 14-15 of 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Based on these statements by Pierce, Jacked Up concludes that, \"with 7-Eleven's eight thousand locations, the escalators in the Licensing Agreement could have been met and exceeded very quickly as the Licensed Products proliferated throughout its network and Sara Lee's own networks.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=166%20Fed.%20Appx.%20714\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 15 of 28. But Sara Lee had not yet formed contracts with 7-Eleven-or any other retailers-at the time that the Licensing Agreement broke down. Jacked Up's speculation that, based on Pierce's enthusiasm, the products would have performed off-the-charts at 7-Eleven stores does not show that the Sara Lee Pro Forma itself was reliable and that, therefore, so are Janik's projections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Second, evidence in the record suggests that the Sara Lee Pro Forma itself is based on insufficient facts and is an unlikely prediction of the Jacked Up products' success. In his declaration, Immell explains how the Sara Lee Pro Forma was created and the purpose that it served in crafting the deal. Because \"Sara Lee's senior management had to approve the concept of a relationship with Jacked Up\" prior to any final agreement, \"the business team at Sara Lee, with input from sales and from Jacked Up, would have to put together its best guess as to how a Jacked Up energy iced tea would perform in the marketplace over the life of a potential agreement.\" Dkt.

Immell recognizes the Sara Lee Pro Forma \"as being the most aggressive, 'gangbusters' scenario created for a Jacked Up branded dispensed energy ice tea.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   As to the accuracy of the Sara Lee Pro Forma's predictions, Immell remarks that \"[t]he number of stores reflected in the gangbusters scenario in the first year of a brand new product within a brand new product line is not only aggressive, but, in [his] experience, highly unlikely.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   And Immell explains that, in addition to reflecting the parties' most aggressive performance prediction, the Sara Lee Pro Forma is based on unverified data. Because Sara Lee and Jacked Up had not yet conducted a market test, Sara Lee's business and sales teams created the Sara Lee Pro Forma using their own educated guesses as to the costs associated with producing the Licensed Product; Sara Lee's estimates of the retail price of the energized tea products; and Jacked Up's own assessment of its supposed existing consumer network. But Sara Lee had no verifiable Jacked Up energy component cost figures, actual data as to labor and overhead costs and product pricing, or verification of the quality of Jacked Up's pre-existing market presence.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45-48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Immell further explains that the market test contemplated by the Licensing Agreement would provide more \"specific and verifiable\" data to use \"instead of mere assumptions\" on which the Sara Lee Pro Forma was based.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46. And that market test, according to the Licensing Agreement, was a precondition to Sara Lee's continued performance under the contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

Janik, without explanation, increases the number of locations selling Jacked Up's energized tea, coffee, and cappuccino products by 125%, 150%, 175%, and 200% more than the numbers estimated in the Sara Lee Pro Forma to reach his estimate of Jacked Up's lost profits. And Janik, without stating his basis for doing so, applies a 20% compounded annual growth rate for another three years beyond the time period reflected in Sara Lee's pro forma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Jacked Up points to no supporting evidence and offers no argument or explanation as to how Janik made these assumptions and why they were reasonable based on the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Janik's calculations further assume that Jacked Up was going to sell its energy component to Sara Lee at a markup yielding additional profits. Jacked Up argues that, under the Licensing Agreement and Jacked Up's relationship with its manufacturer, Jacked Up would obtain its products from a supplier and then sell those products to Sara Lee at a marked-up price.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 192 at 18 of 28. For support, Jacked Up cites to the declaration of Joseph Schmitz, owner and President of Jacked Up, which states that Jacked Up would pay $25.41 per kilogram for its products and would sell its products to Sara Lee for $32.91 per kilogram.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 193 at 87 of 232.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   But the Licensing Agreement contains no price at which Sara Lee would buy Jacked Up's products.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 193 at 19 of 232 (Licensing Agreement \u00a7 1(j) );\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11471033\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/136/#p146\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 22 of 232 (License Agreement \u00a7 9). And evidence presented by Sara Lee suggests that Jacked Up was planning to sell the product to Sara Lee without markup.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 189 at 22 of 29. n.11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Janik assumes that coffee and cappuccino products would be sold one year after the tea products but at the same number of stores as the tea products. But Sara Lee points to evidence in the record suggesting that \"Sara Lee was focused on pursuing the tea energy product, and not coffee or cappuccino, at least not in the immediate term,\" and that \"the company wanted to proceed in a disciplined 'walk before we run' manner with roll-out of dispensed energy products.\" Dkt. No. 188 at 20 of 29, n.10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In response, Jacked Up argues that \"[t]he course of the parties' negotiation indicates a clear desire by Sara Lee to quickly expand the market from teas to coffees and cappuccinos and other products to maximize profits,\" Dkt. No. 192 at 15 of 28, again citing to numerous pages of Pierce's deposition testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   But the cited testimony demonstrates Pierce's interest in bringing a dispensed energy tea to 7-Eleven-not Sara Lee's interest in expanding its own Jacked Up beverage products in the manner that Jacked Up asserts. In fact, although Pierce, on behalf of 7-Eleven, became interested in contracting with Sara Lee for the Jacked Up tea products after he saw them at a trade show, he never discussed or reached such a deal with Sara Lee. And\n   Jacked Up points to no evidence suggesting that Pierce ever discussed with Sara Lee its plans for the coffee and cappuccino products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Janik also assumes that the volume of coffee sold would be double that of energized tea and that the volume of cappuccino sold would be half that of energized tea, an assumption that Janik bases on a conversation that he says he had with Pierce.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 190 at 170 of 297 (\"This is based on conversation with Paul Pierce of 7-Eleven Stores....\"). But, when asked about that conversation in his deposition, Pierce testified that he never told Janik that coffee sales are historically twice the amount of tea sales,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 193 at 231 of 232 (Pierce Dep. at 110, lines 22-25), and that he never told Janik that cappuccino sales at are historically half the amount of tea sales,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11471033\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/136/#p146\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Pierce Dep. at 112, lines 5-8). Pierce further testified that he had never met or spoken with Mr. Janik at all.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 190 at 249 of 297 (Pierce Dep. at 108, lines 20-25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Nonetheless, Jacked Up argues that \"Mr. Pierce does not dispute that coffee sales are historically 'at least' double tea sales, simply confirming the information that Janik attributes to him. Thus, it is no great leap to presume that sale of Sara Lee's JACKED UP products would follow that trend.\" Dkt. No. 192 at 15 of 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The Court disagrees. Not only did Pierce make clear that he never discussed trends in tea, coffee, and cappuccino sales with Janik, but Pierce also explained that he was not sure whether energized coffee sales were twice the amount of energized tea sales,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 193 at 231 of 232 (Pierce Dep. at 111, lines 16-20), perhaps because, before Pierce saw Jacked Up's energy tea at a trade show in 2011, he had never seen an energy tea before,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11471033\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/136/#p146\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 217 of 232 (Pierce Dep. at 55, lines 24-25). Pierce further explained that he was interested in Jacked Up's unique energized tea because, in his experience, \"energy was the-the hottest category in convenience.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11471033\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/522/136/#p146\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Pierce Dep. at 56, lines 15-20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Still, Jacked Up argues that because \"Sara Lee was the 3rd largest manufacture[r] o[f] coffees, teas and cappuccinos in the U.S. with over $9 billion in sales, it was certainly in a position to dispute this assumption with facts,\" yet Sara Lee has not contradicted Janik's underlying assumption. Dkt. No. 192 at 16 of 28. But Sara Lee has no burden to contradict Janik's underlying assumptions-Jacked Up has the burden, as the proponent of Janik's report, to prove its reliability by a preponderance of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3902591\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/685/452/#p459\">\n    685 F.3d at 459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   And Jacked Up contends that \"Defendant appears to be taking advantage of their own wrongful behavior in arguing that coffee and cappuccino sales are irrelevant.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3902591\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/685/452/#p459\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 16 of 28. But the issue before the Court is not whether coffee and cappuccino sales should be excluded from the lost profits analysis entirely, but whether Janik, in projecting Jacked Up's lost profits, had a basis for his assumptions such that his calculations were not speculative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Finally, Jacked Up contends that Sara Lee, by challenging Janik's assumptions and reliance on the Sara Lee Pro Forma, is attacking the factual basis of Janik's opinions and that the jury, not the Court in considering a motion to exclude evidence, should evaluate this issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

In\n   <em>\n    Viterbo\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit explained that, although questions relating to the bases and sources of an expert's opinion generally go to the opinion's weight and not admissibility,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   [i]n some cases, however, the source upon which an expert's opinion relies is of such little weight that the jury should not be permitted to receive that opinion. Expert opinion testimony falls into this\n   category when that testimony would not actually assist the jury in arriving at an intelligent and sound verdict.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   J. Weinstein &amp; M. Berger,\n   <em>\n    Weinstein's Evidence\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 702[1] (1985) (assistance of trier of fact is central concern of Federal Rules of Evidence regarding opinion witnesses). If an opinion is fundamentally unsupported, then it offers no expert assistance to the jury. Furthermore, its lack of reliable support may render it more prejudicial than probative, making it inadmissible under Fed. R. Evid. 403.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barrel of Fun, Inc. v.

Likewise, [the expert] acknowledged that SportsBand would have to change its marketing strategy substantially to achieve his projected 50 percent penetration ratio, most likely by including SportsBand receivers in the ticket package of the event. As the district court pointed out, though, even [the expert] conceded that such a strategy would require the approval of the individual event organizers, who were not likely to view the concomitant increase in ticket prices with favor. ... The court concluded that \"[the expert]'s model for lost profits is based on assumptions which are so speculative that his testimony would be irrelevant and would not materially assist the trier of fact.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Court finds the exception in\n   <em>\n    Viterbo\n   </em>\n   applicable and the rationale in\n   <em>\n    Sportsband\n   </em>\n   persuasive here. As the Court has discussed, Janik selected the Sara Lee Pro Forma-perhaps the most aggressive pro forma that Sara Lee prepared-without conducting any research into whether the Sara Lee Pro Forma's figures were valid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Diabetes Ctrs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%20375505\">\n    2008 WL 375505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. And, as the Court has noted, Janik made numerous assumptions that remain unexplained or unsupported by the record, although these assumptions were critical to Janik's calculations of Jacked Up's lost profits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=547%20Fed.%20Appx.%20513\">\n    547 Fed.
