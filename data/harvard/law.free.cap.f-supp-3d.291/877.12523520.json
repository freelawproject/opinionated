INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This matter comes before the Court on the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J. [Doc. No. 183]; Defs.' Mot. for Summ. J. [Doc. No. 170].) For the reasons that follow, Plaintiff's motion is granted, and Defendants' motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff Solutran, Inc. (\"Solutran\") is the owner by assignment of United States Patent No. 8,311,945 (the \"'945 Patent\"), which claims a system and method for processing check transactions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 10 [Doc. No. 1].) According to Solutran, its system improves on legacy check processing systems by eliminating the need for merchants to scan checks after they are received, and by speeding the rate at which the merchant's account would be credited with a payment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opening Claim Construction Br. at 4-6 [Doc. No. 78].) Solutran's check processing system is marketed as \"Solutran's POS [Point of Sale] Imaging Network,\" or \"SPIN.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 25, 2013, Solutran filed suit against Defendants U.S. Bancorp and its subsidiary, Elavon, Inc. (collectively, \"US Bank\"), alleging infringement of the '945 Patent. (\n   <em>\n    See generally id.\n   </em>\n   ) In particular, Solutran contends that US Bank's competing \"Electronic Check Service,\" or \"ECS,\" system is practically identical to SPIN, and infringes at least one of the claims of the '945 Patent. (\n   <em>\n    See generally id.\n   </em>\n   ) US Bank has consistently denied any\n   infringement and brings counterclaims in its own right against Solutran, seeking declaratory judgments of non-infringement and patent invalidity. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Am. Answer [Doc. No. 17].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In February 2014, US Bank petitioned for a Covered Business Model (\"CBM\") review of the '945 Patent before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's Patent Trial and Appeal Board (\"PTAB\"), arguing that: (1) the patent was invalid under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and (2) the patent's claims were unpatentable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20103\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   as obvious.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    US Bancorp v.

The PTAB rejected US Bank's \u00a7 101 argument, but instituted the CBM proceeding based on the \u00a7 103 argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *6-13. While the CBM review was underway, this Court stayed proceedings in this district court action. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 18, 2014 Order to Stay [Doc. No. 50].) After the PTAB found that the challenged claims in the '945 Patent were not unpatentable as obvious,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    US Bancorp v. Solutran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204698463\">\n    2015 WL 4698463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10-16 (PTAB Aug. 5, 2015),\n   <em>\n    aff'd\n   </em>\n   , No. 2016-1302,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=668%20Fed.%20Appx.%20363\">\n    668 Fed.Appx. 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fed. Cir. 2016), this Court lifted the stay. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jan. 12, 2016 Text-Only Order [Doc. No. 62].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following extensive motion practice and discovery, the Court heard the parties' claim construction arguments on August 30, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Aug. 30, 2016 Minute Entry [Doc. No. 87].) In total, the parties asked the Court to construe eight different terms found variously in claims 1, 2, 4, and 5 of the '945 Patent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Solutran, Inc. v. U.S. Bancorp\n   </em>\n   , No. 13-cv-2637 (SRN/BRT),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202274959\">\n    2017 WL 2274959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (D. Minn. May 24, 2017). At this stage of the litigation, however, the application of only one of those terms is disputed: \" comparing by a computer said digital images with said data in the data file to find matches.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   This term appears in claims 1(d), 4(e), and 5(e) of the '945 patent -for illustrative purposes, and to provide needed context, the Court will reproduce claim 1 in full here:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   1. A method for processing paper checks, comprising:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   a) electronically receiving a data file containing data captured at a merchant's point of purchase, said data including an amount of a transaction associated with MICR\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   information for each paper check, and said data file not including images of said checks;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   b) after step a) crediting an account for the merchant;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   c) after step b), receiving said paper checks and scanning said checks with a digital image scanner thereby creating digital images of said checks and, for each said check, associating said digital image with said check's MICR information; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   d)\n   <em>\n    comparing by a computer said digital images with said data in the data file to find matches\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (Compl., Ex A (\" '945 Patent\") at 10:54-67 (emphasis added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court issued its claim construction order on May 24, 2017. The parties responded by filing their cross-motions for summary judgment the following month. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J.; Defs.' Mot. for Summ. J.) Solutran contends that the undisputed record evidence shows that US Bank's ECS service practices \"every single step\" of claims 1, 2, 3,\n   and 5 of the '945 Patent. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Pl.'s Mem. in Supp.\") at 1 [Doc. No. 185].)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   It notes that US Bank now argues non-infringement solely on the basis of the comparing step. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202274959\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) In its view, however, the Court's construction of this term resolves the issue in its favor, and thus a judgment of infringement is warranted here. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202274959\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) US Bank, however, argues the opposite in its own motion-that the Court's construction makes clear that its service does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   infringe the '945 Patent. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Defs.' Mem. in Supp.\") at 2 [Doc. No. 172].) In the alternative, US Bank also contends that all asserted claims are invalid because they are too abstract to qualify for patent protection under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As noted above, that step requires \"comparing by a computer said digital images with said data in the data file to find matches.\" One of the key disputed points between the parties in interpreting this term was whether the phrase \"said data\" necessarily incorporated the definition of that phrase found in claim 1(a),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   which provides in part for \"electronically receiving a data file containing data captured at a merchant's point of purchase,\n   <em>\n    said data\n   </em>\n   including an amount of a transaction associated with MICR information ....\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '945 Patent at 10:55-58 (emphasis added).)\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Solutran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202274959\">\n    2017 WL 2274959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6. US Bank argued that the phrase must be interpreted uniformly across the claims, and that its explicit reference to the transaction amount meant that the comparing step should be read as requiring that the transaction amount be involved in any comparison.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202274959\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In contrast, Solutran argued that the phrase could be left to its plain meaning, but that in any event, US Bank's interpretation was improper.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202274959\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court construed the term, and there the matter rested for the moment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at *6-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Now, however, the parties once again debate a matter of interpretation-this time with regard to the boundaries of the Court's construction. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. in Supp. at 9-19; Defs.' Mem. in Opp'n to Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Defs.' Mem. in Opp'n\") at 2-11 [Doc. No. 203].) Both parties agree on one thing: that the Court made clear that the \"said data\" referenced in the comparing step must include, at minimum, the amount of the transaction. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. in Supp. at 12; Defs.' Mem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   in Opp'n at 6-7.) Where they differ, however, is whether the Court also meant to be understood as requiring that the transaction amount found in \"said data\"\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   be independently considered as part of the comparing process. Because the parties do not apparently dispute that US Bank's process relies on MICR information and not the transaction amount in conducting its own comparison, resolution of this issue is effectively dispositive of Solutran's infringement claim. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' Mem. in Opp'n at 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Having carefully reviewed the parties' arguments on the matter, the Court clarifies its initial construction of the comparing step as follows: (1) the data captured at the merchant's point of purchase must include the transaction amount; (2) the transaction amount must be one of the elements of the \"said data\" in the \"data file,\" the latter of which must then be compared with the digital images; and (3) the \"match\" being made as part of the comparison step can involve, but need not necessarily involve, the transaction amount. In other words, additional data from the data file, such as MICR information, can independently form the basis of the match for purposes of claim 1(d), 4(e), and 5(e). While the transaction amount must be in the \"said data\" grouping, it need not be separately singled out and directly compared against a similar datum in the digital image.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Application of the Construction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In light of this updated-and, hopefully, clearer-construction, the Court concludes that summary judgment is warranted in favor of Solutran on the issue of infringement. The parties do not contest that US Bank's process involves a comparison step that is designed to match the digital image of the check with data captured in a data file. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' Mem. in Opp'n at 9; Pl.'s Mem. in Supp. at 10.) Nor do they contest that US Bank captures the transaction amount as part of the data captured at the point of purchase. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Defs.' Mem. in Opp'n at 9.) Although it is apparent that the accused process does not rely on the transaction amount for purposes of forming matches (rather, it uses MICR information), that fact is not dispositive of infringement. In light of the Court's construction of claim 1(d), so long as US Bank captures the transaction amount\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   makes a match using some element (or elements) of the data in the data set, then its process infringes upon that claim. Here, this is exactly what the ECS system does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   As Defendants disputed infringement solely as to the comparing step, and do not, apparently, contest infringement as to all other steps of the asserted claims, resolution of this matter in favor of Solutran necessarily resolves the parties' infringement dispute. The Court accordingly grants Solutran's motion for summary judgment of infringement, and denies US Bank's corresponding motion for non-infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

While the '945 Patent contains three independent claims, the parties acknowledge that the language in the other claims is similar or nearly identical to the language in Claim 1.

The Court does not dispute this general observation.

As noted, the Court agrees with the PTAB that simply because individual elements of Claim 1 recite isolated, fundamental economic practices, such as \"crediting an account for a merchant,\" when viewed as a whole, the claim's limitations demonstrate that the claim is not directed to an abstract concept.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    US Bancorp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%203943913\">\n    2014 WL 3943913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8. Neither is the core concept of Claim 1 a method of organizing human activity similar to the commercial practice of hedging in\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   , nor is it a mental process that can be performed by human thought alone, like the method claim in\n   <em>\n    CyberSource\n   </em>\n   for verifying the validity of a credit card transaction over the internet. Rather, the character of Claim 1 is directed to a physical process for processing paper checks that captures data from a paper check at the merchant's point of purchase, and uses the data to credit a merchant's account, while the same paper check is later scanned in a different location to create an image of that check.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Because the Court finds that Claim 1 of the '945 Patent is not directed to an abstract idea, it need not examine the claim under step two. However, even if Claim 1 were directed to an abstract idea, it would nevertheless satisfy the second step of the\n   <em>\n    Mayo / Alice\n   </em>\n   analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Courts examine whether the limitations in the claim represent a patent-eligible application of the abstract idea.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/#p2354\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Mem. in Supp. at 15, 20.) But \"new steps in a process may be patentable even though all the constituents of the combination were well known and in common use before the combination was made.\"\n   <em>\n    Diehr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6183273\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/175/#p183\">\n    450 U.S. at 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6183273\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/175/#p183\">\n    101 S.Ct. 1048\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While US Bank argues that component parts of the claimed invention were known conventions, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Reply at 13), it fails to consider the ordered combination of the elements in Claim 1, focusing instead on the individual elements. Nor does it argue that these combined elements were a known convention. Rather, as Solutran notes, \"Claim 1's elements describe a new combination of steps, in an ordered sequence, that was never found before in the prior art and has been found to be a non-obvious improvement over the prior art by both the USPTO examiner and the PTAB's three-judge panel (affirmed by the Federal Circuit).\" (Pl's Mem. in Opp'n at 27.) The ordered combination captures data from a paper check at the merchant's point of sale in order to credit the merchant's account, while the same check is later scanned at a different location to create an image. The image and the data are then reunited and compared to find matches. While US Bank asserts that the claim fails to recite that the checks are \"transported,\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Reply at 13), Claim 1(c) indicates that the paper checks are \"receiv[ed].\" This Court previously construed \"receiving said paper checks\" as \"the paper checks are received from a location different from where the checks are scanned\" in its claim construction ruling,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Solutran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202274959\">\n    2017 WL 2274959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5. This construction sufficiently conveys that the checks are moved from one location to another.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Specifically with respect to patented \"processes\" under \u00a7 101, one means by which courts evaluate their patent eligibility is the \"machine-or-transformation test.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bilski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644410,12455287\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/593/\">\n    561 U.S. at 602-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3644410,12455287\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/593/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 3218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As Solutran explains, \"the physical paper check is transformed into a different state or thing, namely into a digital image.\" (Pl.'s Mem. in Opp'n at 29.) In\n   <em>\n    In re Bilski\n   </em>\n   , the Federal Circuit stated that the transformation of raw, physical data, into a visual depiction of that object satisfies the transformation part of the machine-or-transformation test.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3857791\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/545/943/#p962\">\n    545 F.3d 943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 962-63 (Fed. Cir. 2008). Moreover, the transformation here is \"central to the purpose of the claimed process,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3857791\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/545/943/#p962\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3857791\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/545/943/#p962\">\n    at 962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and \"impose[s] a meaningful limit on the scope of the claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Versata Dev.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4276845\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/793/1306/#p1333\">\n    793 F.3d at 1335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Solutran explains that receiving and scanning paper checks\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   they have been moved from the merchant's point of sale is central to the purpose of the '945 Patent : \"If this step (c) were removed from the claims, then step (d) would be incomprehensible and steps (a) and (b) would merely describe relatively routine practices found in\n   [point of purchase] check transactions. Step (c) therefore is not 'mere data gathering' or 'routine, post-solution activity,' but imposes a meaningful limit on the claimed process.\" (Pl.'s Mem. in Opp'n at 30-31.) The Court therefore finds that even if it reaches step 2 in the analysis, the elements of Claim 1 contain a sufficiently transformative inventive concept so as to be patent eligible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Accordingly, for all of the reasons set forth above, the Court finds that the claims of the '945 Patent are not abstract, but rather, are patent eligible under \u00a7 101.
