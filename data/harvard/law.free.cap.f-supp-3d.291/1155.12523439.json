Plaintiffs did not plead that Peoplease had the power to hire and fire Plaintiffs. <em>See</em> FAC \u00b6 14-20. Plaintiffs do not allege that Peoplease <em>supervised</em> Plaintiffs' work schedules. Instead, they merely pled that Peoplease \"[set] schedules and hours,\" suggesting Peoplease engaged in a mere ministerial administrative task. FAC \u00b6 17.
