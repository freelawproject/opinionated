Simon, District Judge\n   Two motions are pending before the Court: Defendants' Motion to Transfer Venue Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (ECF 10); and Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF 13). In response to Plaintiff's request for summary judgment, Defendants rely on Rule 56(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and argue that Plaintiff's motion should be denied or deferred. Defendants request sufficient time to take discovery of facts that Defendants contend are exclusively in the possession of Plaintiff but may support an affirmative defense. For the reasons that follow, Defendants' Motion to Transfer Venue Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) is denied, and Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment is deferred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

That statute provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   For the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought or to any district or division to which all parties have consented.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Consideration of a motion to transfer venue under \u00a7 1404(a) requires two findings. First, unless all parties consent, the court being asked to transfer venue must determine whether the transferee court is one in which the action originally might have been brought. Second, the court that is being asked to transfer venue must determine whether transfer is appropriate, considering the convenience of parties and witnesses and the interest of justice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hatch v. Reliance Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"311706\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/758/409/#p414\">\n    758 F.2d 409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 414 (9th Cir. 1985). As explained by the Ninth Circuit,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   the district court has discretion to adjudicate motions for transfer according to an individualized, case-by-case consideration of convenience and fairness. A motion to transfer venue under \u00a7 1404(a) requires the court to weigh multiple factors in its determination whether transfer is appropriate in a particular case. For example, the court may consider: (1) the location where the relevant agreements were negotiated and executed, (2) the state that is most familiar with the governing law, (3) the plaintiff's choice of forum, (4) the respective parties' contacts with the forum, (5) the contacts relating to the plaintiff's cause of action in the chosen forum, (6) the differences in the costs of litigation in the two forums, (7) the availability of compulsory process to compel attendance of unwilling non-party witnesses, and (8) the ease of access to sources of proof. Additionally, the presence of a forum-selection clause is a significant factor in the court's \u00a7 1404(a) analysis. We also conclude that the relevant public policy of the forum state, if any, is at least as significant a factor in the \u00a7 1404(a) balancing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

Plaintiff is successor-in-interest by merger to the Bank of the Cascades, an Oregon-chartered bank that previously had its headquarters in Oregon. Defendants VHG Aviation, LLC (\"VHG\"); VGH Aviation, LLC (\"VGH\"); and TSE, Inc. (\"TSE\") are limited liability aviation companies based in Pennsylvania. Each owns or leases aircraft used for airplane charter flight services. Defendants James Valvano (\"Valvano\") and Christopher Gilchrist (\"C. Gilchrist\"), along with third parties Joseph Gilchrist (\"J. Gilchrist\") and Ray Hassey (\"Hassey\"), are members of VHG and VGH. Defendants Valvano and C. Gilchrist and third parties J. Gilchrist and Hassey are domiciled in Pennsylvania. Defendants VHG, VGH, TSE, Valvano, and C. Gilchrist are collectively referred to as \"Defendants.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On December 9, 2015, the Bank of the Cascades loaned $960,000 to Defendant VHG, pursuant to the terms of a promissory note (\"Note One\") and an aircraft security agreement (\"Aircraft Security Agreement One\"). Also on December 9, 2015, the Bank of the Cascades loaned $2,026,744 to Defendant VGH, pursuant to the terms of a separate promissory note (\"Note Two\") and a separate aircraft security agreement (\"Aircraft Security Agreement Two\"). In addition, Defendants Valvano, C. Gilchrist, and TSE each separately and unconditionally guaranteed repayment of both Note One and Note Two. VHG is in default under Note One in the principal amount of $903,662 plus interest and expenses, for failure to make monthly payments. Similarly, VGH is in default under Note Two in the principal amount of $1,906,790 plus interest and expenses, for failure to make monthly payments. According to Plaintiff, the Bank of the Cascades gave written notice to VHG and VGH of the payment defaults and provided each with an opportunity to cure. Also according to Plaintiff, neither VHG nor VGH has cured the defaults, and the Bank of the Cascades elected to accelerate the indebtedness under each note pursuant to the terms of each note. Plaintiff also alleges that all conditions precedent to enforcement of each note have been performed or have occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Each of the loan guarantees signed by Valvano, C. Gilchrist, and TSE contain the following permissive forum-selection clause at paragraph 16:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   With respect to any disputes between the parties, any proceeding by Lender [Bank of the Cascades] against Guarantor\n   may be brought by Lender in a court of competent jurisdiction located in the State of Oregon (which court shall have jurisdiction to hear such matters), and Guarantor irrevocably consents and submits itself to jurisdiction in any such court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   That same paragraph also contains a waiver of each party's right to trial by jury. In addition, both Note One and Note Two state that they are governed by Oregon law, contain a waiver of the right to trial by jury, and recite that the \"loan transaction evidenced by this Note has been applied for, analyzed, approved and disbursed in the State of Oregon.\" Further, both Aircraft Security Agreements provide at paragraph 9(c):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    Governing Law and Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The Note, this Agreement, and the Related Documents have been delivered to Lender [Bank of the Cascades] and accepted by Lender in the State of Oregon.

Defendants were served on October 24, 2017. On November 22, 2017, Defendants removed the Oregon state court action to this federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

VGH, VHG, and TSE Global Aviation, LLC further allege that Dumont orally represented to the Pennsylvania Litigation plaintiffs that the acquisition of certain private aircraft would generate a substantial amount of income and profit for those plaintiffs. Further, Dumont allegedly represented to those plaintiffs that Dumont would handle all of the chartering and maintenance of the aircraft. Dumont allegedly further represented\n   that it would return to the plaintiffs in the Pennsylvania Litigation $80,000 per month after Dumont paid all of the debt service that those plaintiffs owed on the aircraft plus the overhead and operating costs of the hanger, pilots, crew, and fuel. Dumont also allegedly promised that it would fund a maintenance reserve for future service and larger maintenance expenses. In addition, Dumont allegedly represented that the aircraft to be acquired had been completely refurbished and were in good mechanical and working order, with minimal maintenance and service needed for the foreseeable future. The plaintiffs in the Pennsylvania Litigation also allege that, based on these representations by Dumont, these plaintiffs entered into aircraft management agreements and charter agreements with Dumont and purchased the aircraft that are the subject of Note One and Note Two, among other aircraft. Based on these allegations, the plaintiffs in the Pennsylvania Litigation assert against Dumont claims of fraudulent inducement, fraudulent misrepresentation, violation of Pennsylvania's Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Act, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of contract, unjust enrichment, rescission, and replevin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Marine\n   </em>\n   involved a mandatory, rather than a permissive, forum-selection clause and, thus, has no application when the clause at issue is permissive, rather than mandatory. Defendants add that the loan guarantees in the pending case contain, at most, a permissive forum-selection clause, because they provide that any proceeding by the Bank of the Cascades against a guarantor \"may be brought,\" rather than must be brought, \"in a court of competent jurisdiction located in the State of Oregon.\" From this, Defendants argue, the Court should evaluate the traditional \u00a7 1404(a) factors without regard to the presence of a forum-selection clause. The Court agrees that the relevant guarantees contain only a permissive, rather than a mandatory, forum-selection clause, but does not agree that\n   <em>\n    Atl. Marine\n   </em>\n   is so limited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Several district courts have disagreed over whether\n   <em>\n    Atl. Marine\n   </em>\n   must be confined\n   to cases involving mandatory, as opposed to permissive, forum-selection clauses.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Paragon Mortg. Serv's., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%202646740\">\n    2016 WL 2646740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (N.D. Oh. 2016) (collecting cases on both sides). The Ninth Circuit has not yet addressed this question. The district courts that favor a narrow reading of\n   <em>\n    Atl. Marine\n   </em>\n   often focus on the text from that case that refers to \"the parties' agreement as to the\n   <em>\n    most\n   </em>\n   proper forum\" (emphasis added). As explained in\n   <em>\n    Paragon\n   </em>\n   , \"[b]y indicating 'the most proper forum,' the Supreme Court could only be referring to mandatory clauses as permissive clauses only authorize jurisdiction in a forum but do not require it. A mandatory clause, on the other hand, indicates that jurisdiction is proper only in the selected forum.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%202646740\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   I respectfully disagree with the analysis in\n   <em>\n    Paragon.\n   </em>\n   First, the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Atl. Marine\n   </em>\n   did not expressly limit its holding to cases involving mandatory, as opposed to permissive, forum-selection clauses. Second, the phrase \"the most proper forum\" does not imply that no other forum could also be proper. Finally, the rationale explained by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Atl. Marine\n   </em>\n   , which borrowed from Justice Kennedy's concurrence in\n   <em>\n    Stewart\n   </em>\n   , is that \"the enforcement of valid forum-selection clauses, bargained for by the parties, protects their legitimate expectations and furthers vital interests of the justice system.\"\n   <em>\n    Atl. Marine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12702000,12584659\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/568/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The protection of the parties' bargain and their legitimate expectations does not depend on whether the forum-selection clause is mandatory or permissive. When one party sues another in a forum that is expressly consented to in a permissive forum-selection clause, it would thwart the first party's bargain and legitimate expectations if the second party were to obtain a transfer to a different forum merely because the second party persuaded a court that the other forum would be more convenient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In this case, the Bank of the Cascades and the Defendant guarantors bargained and agreed that the Bank of the Cascades may bring an action in Oregon to enforce a guarantee against the guarantors. The Bank of the Cascades, or to be precise, its successor-in-interest, has brought just such a lawsuit. To allow the Defendant guarantors to avoid this forum by arguing that it is inconvenient to litigate in Oregon would fail to respect the bargain of the parties and would fail to protect their legitimate expectations. That result should not occur, at least in all but the most exceptional case. Because the Court concludes that\n   <em>\n    Atl. Marine\n   </em>\n   applies, even in a case involving a permissive forum-selection clause, and the pending dispute is not an exceptional case, the Court need not consider the private interests of Defendants in resolving their motion to transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court, nevertheless, would reach the same conclusion even if it were required to evaluate all of the factors of \u00a7 1404(a) described in\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1743591\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/211/495/#p498\">\n    211 F.3d at 498-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The first three factors in\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   favor denying Defendants' motion to transfer. First, as recited in the two aircraft security agreements: those agreements, the two notes, and the \"Related Documents\" (which include the guarantees) \"have been delivered to Lender [Bank of the Cascades] and accepted by Lender in the State of Oregon.\" Second, the relevant documents provide that Oregon law governs this dispute, and this Court presumably is more familiar with Oregon law than is the federal court in Pennsylvania. Third, the Plaintiff chose to sue in the forum that the parties contractually agreed would be appropriate. (The result might have been different if Defendants had filed the first lawsuit against Plaintiff in Pennsylvania, assuming that personal jurisdiction could have been had against Plaintiff in that\n   state.) The fourth factor may favor transfer, but the fifth, sixth, and seventh factors are generally neutral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Finally, the eighth factor addresses \"the ease of access to sources of proof.\" Although Defendants assert that this factor favors transfer, the Court disagrees. The Court has reviewed Defendants' response in opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment. Substantively, it does not appear that Defendants challenge the factual bases of Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   claims. Instead, as discussed below, Defendants seek additional time to determine whether they may be able to establish a meritorious affirmative defense, such as equitable estoppel, unclean hands, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, or violation of Oregon's Uniform Commercial Code. The sources of proof for any of these potential affirmative defenses are more likely to be found in Oregon in the files of the Bank of the Cascades, or its successor-in-interest, than they are likely to be found in Pennsylvania. Thus, the eighth factor also favors denying Defendants' motion to transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and Defendants' Request under Rule 56(d)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Defendants timely removed this lawsuit from Oregon state court on November 22, 2017. On December 13, 2017, Defendants filed their motion to transfer venue. Five days later, December 18, 2017, Plaintiff filed its motion for summary judgment. The parties have briefed both motions, but have not yet even commenced discovery. Although Defendants do not appear to challenge the factual bases of Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   claims, Defendants request a reasonable amount of time to determine whether they may be able to establish a meritorious affirmative defense, such as equitable estoppel, unclean hands, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, or violation of Oregon's Uniform Commercial Code. As explained by Defendants, they seek discovery of the relevant files of the Bank of the Cascades and possibly one or more depositions. Plaintiff represents that it has begun gathering the relevant documents, which Plaintiff reports do not appear to be particularly voluminous or burdensome to locate. Also, at least one principal actor from the Bank of the Cascades is deceased. Thus, allowing Defendants to have a reasonable opportunity to take discovery will not be particularly time-consuming or burdensome for either party. Defendants' motion under Rule 56(d) is allowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Defendants' Motion to Transfer Venue Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (ECF 10) is DENIED. Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF 13) is DEFFERED. The Court allows Defendants 60 days from the date of this Opinion and Order to take discovery needed to respond to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment. The Court shortens Plaintiff's time to respond to any document requests, requests for admission, and interrogatories propounded by Defendant to 14 days from receipt. Plaintiff also shall promptly make available for deposition any witnesses whom Defendants seek to depose who are employed by or otherwise under the control of Plaintiff. Not later than May 1, 2018, Defendants may file a supplemental response to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment. Plaintiff may file a supplemental reply not later than May 15, 2018. If Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment is denied, the Court will allow all parties additional time to complete pretrial discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    TSE Global Aviation, LLC is a limited liability company whose sole member is Defendant Valvano.
