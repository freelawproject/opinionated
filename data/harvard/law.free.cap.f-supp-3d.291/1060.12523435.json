Justin Wilkenfeld Deposition Transcript (\"Wilkenfeld Tr.\") (Dkt. No. 147-2) at 109:3-12, 182:2-4. Carter Dow took the photos at issue and Lee Dralle retouched the photos. Lowe MSJ Decl., Exs. 281, 282; Wilkenfeld Tr. at 109:15-16, 113:8. During the photo shoot, \"there was direction coming from [GoPro's] ... head of the creative department to the art director or creative director, who then passed that along to the actual photographer.\" Wilkenfeld Tr. at 182:10-15. This was \"creative direction in terms of the overall aesthetic look to the photographs that [GoPro] ... wanted for marketing purposes,\" including what camera angles to shoot and selecting multiple mediums or backgrounds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 182:17-183:1. For instance, at the shoot, the GoPro products were photographed on black and white Plexiglass surfaces \"to see what the differences were in contrast[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 135:3-12. The lighting and angles were also important to \"avoid getting weird reflections or other things that can actually make that image not quite as crisp or clear or as good as [GoPro] would want it to be,\" especially because some of the images featured waterproof housing that was reflective.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 191:1-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Dow took many photos, including \"every 15 degrees of the product.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 192:1-17. GoPro then reviewed a \"big pool of images,\" and \"narrow[ed] it down to a limited set of images that the team continue[d] to work on.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 192:18-23. Notes from the review meeting were then shared with the photo editor for the retouch work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 113:22-25. Dralle made digital additions to the photographs, including adding the information on the front screen of the camera, the holiday bow, coloring and shading (including black shading on the camera lens), \"[h]ow clearly and prominently or crisp the logos look,\" and ensuring that the LED lights are lit the right way to show the camera is recording.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 193:10-25. Dralle \"would have been charged with taking direction from the [GoPro] art director and/or head of marketing ultimately to make sure that final product met all of that direction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 194:3-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After the photos were retouched, there was a \"back and forth process with the ... photo editor\" where \"additional feedback can happen.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 114:18-115:1. GoPro \"take[s] a lot of time and really pay[s] very close attention to the minute details on those final images ... [A] seemingly simple image takes quite a lot of work to actually get to that final product that [GoPro will] publish.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 115:2-6. The \"aesthetic,\" or \"overall look and feel,\" of the photographs reflects \"stylistic choices\" by GoPro's creative team, including having \"clean lines, clean look, crisp images, ... [a] white reflective background, ... [and] how the logo looks.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 189:7-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   GoPro asserts that 360Heros infringed its copyrights by copying those four photographs and publishing them on 360Heros' website.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cena MSJ Decl., Ex. P (Smart Remote), Ex. Q (HERO4 Black Three Camera View), Ex. R (HERO4 Black Two Camera View), Ex. S (HERO4 Black Two Camera View with Bow). 360Heros is not an authorized reseller or distributor of GoPro's products. Cena MSJ Decl., Ex. A at 134:2-8. Nor did 360Heros ask GoPro for permission to use GoPro's images.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 134:23-135:7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Instead, 360Heros obtained the images from GoPro's authorized resellers or other websites.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   135:10-17; 137:13-138:23;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Jim Weiser (Dkt. No. 132-1). For instance, Jim Weiser of RU4Scuba LLC declares that, as a member of the GoPro Authorized Reseller Program (\"GARP\"), RU4Scuba received marketing materials, including the four disputed images, from GoPro. Weiser Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-3. RU4Scuba sold GoPro cameras and related accessories to 360Heros and, in the latter half of 2014, provided GoPro's images to 360Heros for use on the 360Heros website.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. The GoPro cameras and accessories that RU4Scuba sold to 360Heros \"were then sold by 360Heros on its 360Heros online website shop which also displayed the GoPro product images that RU4Scuba had supplied[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. Weiser declares that he understood RU4Scuba's \"business relationship with 360Heros was fully approved by GoPro,\" and states that RU4Scuba established its relationship with 360Heros with the approval of Shane Meyers of Sportech Sales Group, which is a GoPro authorized distributor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. However, GoPro's Authorized Reseller Agreement prohibits its resellers from assigning, subcontracting, or delegating their rights and obligations under the agreement without GoPro's prior written consent. Cena MSJ Decl., Ex. O, \u00a7 9. The Reseller Agreement further states that any attempt to do so would be void.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   There is no evidence of any written consent by GoPro to 360Heros' use of the four images.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Summary judgment is proper if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

Additionally, there is no need for additional discovery regarding the copyright assignments because the Court has received copies of the copyright registrations for each of the images and the valid assignment contracts from Dow and Dralle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Consequently, the Court GRANTS summary judgment of copyright infringement\n   by 360Heros and DENIES 360Heros' Rule 56(d) motion for additional discovery on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Motion to Compel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   On July 27, 2017, in response to a joint discovery dispute letter, the Court ordered 360Heros to produce within ten days \"all non-privileged, responsive documents in its possession\" with respect to GoPro's First Set of Requests for Production (\"RFP\") (RFP Nos. 7, 9, 27, 28, 37, 38, 42, 70, 71, 72, 82, and 83). Dkt. No. 80. The Court stated that \"[i]f GoPro remains unsatisfied, it may bring a motion to compel with specific details as to why 360Heros' productions remain incomplete,\" and that \"[i]f a motion to compel becomes necessary, the Court may consider shifting fees.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   GoPro now moves to compel production in response to those same RFPs. Dkt. No. 88. It groups its RFPs into four categories: (1) third party materials about testing and prototyping of 360Heros' products (RFP Nos. 7, 9, 27, 37, 82, and 83); (2) third party materials relating to manufacturing, distribution, and marketing of 360Heros' Products (RFP Nos. 9, 27, 70, 71, 72, 82, and 83); (3) third party materials relating to permission to use GoPro Copyrighted Images (RFP Nos. 27, 70-72); and (4) third party materials obtained at conferences and trade shows (RFP Nos. 7, 9, 28, 70-72). It also requests a second deposition of Kintner, and its fees and costs associated with bringing this motion. 360Heros opposes and requests its fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The parties' primary disagreement is whether the Court's prior order required 360Heros to produce electronically-stored information (\"ESI\"), including emails, in light of the Court's ESI Order (Dkt. No. 78). Because of this confusion, the Court now clarifies that it intended all responsive materials-including ESI and emails-to be produced. Given the Court's rulings on GoPro's summary judgment motion and its previous order regarding the requested discovery, the Court GRANTS in part GoPro's motion to compel. 360Heros shall produce all responsive, non-privileged materials-including ESI and emails-to the extent the requests are relevant to the remaining claims in this suit\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     within ten days of this order\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . If 360Heros needs search terms or other assistance in defining its search for responsive ESI materials, the parties shall meet and confer to ensure that the responsive materials are located efficiently. The Court also grants the request to take another deposition of Kintner after the responsive materials have been produced. This deposition is limited to three hours and discussion only of newly produced materials. The parties shall bear their own costs associated with this deposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In light of the seeming confusion over the scope of the Court's prior order, the Court DENIES GoPro's and 360Heros requests for an award of fees and costs in relation to this motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(5)(A)(ii)-(iii). In the future, if the parties have any disputes regarding the meaning of the Court's orders, they should seek prompt clarification from the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Additionally, the Court DENIES GoPro's administrative motion to supplement the record regarding the motion to compel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.
