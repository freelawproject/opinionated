Alexander Acosta, brings this action on behalf of two discharged employees against their employer, Defendants Lloyd Industries Inc. (\"Lloyd Industries\") and William P. Lloyd (\"Mr. Lloyd\"), alleging violations of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration Act (the \"OSH Act\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20660\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   According to the Secretary, Matthew Spillane and Santa \"Dino\" Sanna were wrongfully terminated in retaliation for assisting the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") in identifying safety hazards at Lloyd Industries. The Secretary relies upon Section 11(c) of the OSH Act, which prohibits the discharge of employees because they file complaints or otherwise exercise rights afforded by the Act, including informing OSHA about unsafe conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Secretary brings one claim of retaliation in violation of the OSH Act. Defendants have moved for summary judgment. As genuine issues of material fact exist, Defendants' motion will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL RECORD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The issue before me is whether material undisputed facts exist to establish that Defendants'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   termination of Mr. Spillane and Mr. Sanna was non-retaliatory. The Secretary asserts that Mr. Spillane was fired because he took and shared photographs of a machine that caused an injury to a co-worker, leading to an OSHA complaint. The Secretary further posits that Mr. Sanna was fired because of his relationship to an employee who filed a complaint with OSHA and for testifying at an OSHA hearing. Defendants counter that the material undisputed facts establish that Mr. Spillane was terminated because he was sleeping on the job, and Mr. Sanna was terminated because his disregard for his duties to oversee OSHA compliance resulted in OSHA citations. Not surprisingly, these vastly divergent versions of events are supported by differing and disputed facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The parties agree on only the following facts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   - Lloyd Industries is a small business manufacturing a variety of fire and smoke dampers, a product designed to stop the spread of fires. Founded by its owner and president, Mr. Lloyd, the company employs almost 100 individuals in two plant locations-one in Florida and one in Montgomeryville, Pennsylvania, which is the focus of the lawsuit before me.

Mr. Spillane\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Defendants contend that the Secretary has offered no evidence of a causal connection between Mr. Spillane's protected activity and termination. They argue that the Secretary cannot demonstrate temporal proximity between when Mr. Spillane took photographs (July and August 2014) and when he was terminated (November 2014). Additionally, Defendants assert there is no other evidence giving rise to an inference of causation, nor is there evidence to suggest that Mr. Lloyd knew or suspected Mr. Spillane was providing the photographs for the OSHA investigation. Defendants point to the fact that Mr. Lloyd gave Mr. Spillane baseball tickets after learning that he had taken\n   photographs as evidence that Mr. Lloyd did not know the photographs were for the OSHA investigation. (Defs.' Mot. at 12-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   According to the Secretary, missing from Defendants' timeline is November 13, 2014-the day that Compliance Safety and Health Officers arrived at the plant as part of the OSHA investigation. While the Secretary acknowledges that several months passed between when Mr. Spillane took photographs and when he was terminated, he stresses that Mr. Spillane's firing five days after the arrival of OSHA personnel at Lloyd Industries supports an inference of a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action. (Pl.'s Resp. at 11-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Additionally, the Secretary argues that Mr. Lloyd knew, or at least correctly surmised, that Mr. Spillane's photographs were for the OSHA investigation. In support, he points to the following facts: Mr. Lloyd knew that Mr. Elbode filed a complaint with OSHA before OSHA came to inspect the plant; Rene Santos saw Mr. Spillane taking photographs of the press brake machine and informed Mr. Lloyd that he saw Mr. Spillane taking photographs at the machine \"where a worker got hit\"; Mr. Lloyd responded that he had \"heard that was part of the deal that [Mr. Spillane] was taking pictures\"; Compliance Safety and Health Officers arrived at the plant on November 13, 2014 as part of the OSHA investigation; and Mr. Lloyd fired Mr. Spillane on November 18, 2014.

It is also undisputed that Mr. Lloyd knew that Mr. Elbode had filed a complaint with OSHA regarding his injury and that machine. Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the Secretary, a reasonable fact finder could believe that Mr. Lloyd concluded the photographs were being supplied for an OSHA investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   While I agree with Defendants that there is no evidence of temporal proximity between when Mr. Spillane took photographs and was fired, Mr. Spillane was fired only five days after the compliance officers from OSHA showed up at Lloyd Industries to investigate Mr. Elbode's\n   complaint. Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the Secretary, it is entirely possible that Mr. Lloyd fired Mr. Spillane because he provided photographs that Mr. Lloyd suspected contributed to the OSHA investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    ii. Mr. Sanna\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Defendants argue that the Secretary cannot show a causal connection between Mr. Sanna's protected activity and termination because six months passed between when Mr. Lloyd knew about Mr. Elbode's complaint (December 2014) and Mr. Sanna's termination (May 2015), and three months passed between Mr. Sanna's OSHA testimony (February 2015) and his termination (May 2015). Defendants further contend that the Secretary has not put forward any other evidence demonstrating that Mr. Sanna's OSHA testimony caused Mr. Lloyd to fire him. (Defs.' Mot. at 21-22.) The Secretary responds that Defendants have omitted a critical fact: Mr. Sanna was fired on May 11, 2015-the same day that Mr. Lloyd received the OSHA citations. Additionally, the Secretary contends these dates must be viewed through a lens considering what else Mr. Lloyd knew: Mr. Sanna is Mr. Elbode's grandfather, and Mr. Elbode had filed a complaint with OSHA. According to the Secretary, these facts, assessed together, lead to the inference that Mr. Lloyd fired Mr. Sanna because of his OSHA testimony. (Pl.'s Resp. at 18-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the Secretary, I find that the Secretary has put forward sufficient evidence to suggest that Mr. Lloyd fired Mr. Sanna because he provided testimony to OSHA and/or because his grandson had filed a complaint with OSHA. A fact finder could certainly conclude that on the same day he was fined $822,000, Mr. Lloyd illegally fired the grandfather of the employee who filed an OSHA complaint and who provided testimony for the OSHA investigation for retaliatory purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   As such, for the purposes of this motion, the Secretary has put forward sufficient evidence that both Mr. Spillane and Mr. Sanna were fired for engaging in protected activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Legitimate Non-Discriminatory Reason and Pretext\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Defendants assert that even if the Secretary can establish a prima facia case of discrimination, summary judgment is appropriate because they have proffered the following legitimate non-discriminatory reasons (\"LNDR\") for Mr. Spillane and Mr. Sanna's terminations: (1) Mr. Spillane was a bad employee who slept on the job, and (2) Mr. Sanna was terminated because he neglected his duties as the employee assigned to oversee OSHA compliance. I agree with Defendants that they have met their \"relatively light\" burden at this stage of articulating legitimate non-discriminatory reasons for the decision to terminate Mr. Spillane and Mr. Sanna's employment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dunsmuir v.

Mr. Lloyd testified that he first heard about Mr. Spillane sleeping in his car from Russell Murphy about three or four months after Mr. Spillane began working at Lloyd Industries. However, Murphy testified that he never spoke with Mr. Lloyd about Mr. Spillane sleeping in his car prior to Mr. Spillane's termination.

The Secretary focuses on Mr. Lloyd's statement that he did not fire Mr. Spillane for sleeping immediately after hearing about it from Russell Murphy because he \"like[s] to hear it from two different people.... [because] it makes it more credible.\" The Secretary points out that Mr. Lloyd testified he received a second report of Mr. Spillane sleeping from Rene Santos, yet Mr. Spillane was not fired until two months later.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the Secretary, this gap in Mr. Lloyd's explanation further reflects that a factfinder should sort out the facts.

Murphy testified that \"it became questioned that [Mr. Spillane] was fired wrong, so they had asked for witnesses to him in the parking lot.\" Murphy further testified that either Mr. Lloyd or Mr. Sanna approached him after Mr. Spillane was fired and asked if he had \"seen Mr. Spillane doing this,\" i.e., sleeping. Mr. Murphy provided a note saying that he had witnessed \"former employee Matt Spillane sleeping in his car while clocked in at work.\" (Pl.'s Resp. at 15-16;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%201773725\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%201773725\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Ex. J, 57:3-58:22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In addition, the chronology of events could also establish that Mr. Spillane's firing for alleged sleeping on the job was pretextual. Mr. Elbode filed his OSHA complaint in October 2014; Mr. Lloyd was aware of the complaint; Rene Santos saw Mr. Spillane taking pictures of the worksite where Mr. Elbode was injured and informed Mr. Lloyd of such; Compliance and Safety Officers arrived at Lloyd Industries as part of the OSHA investigation on November 13, 2014; and Mr. Spillane was terminated five days later, on November 18, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Viewing all of this evidence in the light most favorable to the Secretary, I conclude that the Secretary has pointed to sufficient evidence to demonstrate that Defendants' non-discriminatory reason for firing Mr. Spillane was pretextual. Defendants contend that the facts the Secretary points to amount to only \"minor inconsistencies.\" I disagree. A fact finder could determine that Russell Murphy's testimony calls into question Mr. Lloyd's credibility. Moreover, a fact finder could find the fact that Mr. Spillane was fired five days after the OSHA officers arrived at Lloyd Industries as evidence of retaliation for providing photographs for the OSHA investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Farrell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11453805\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/206/271/#p284\">\n    206 F.3d at 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[E]vidence supporting [a] prima facie [retaliation] case is often helpful in the pretext stage and nothing about the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   [burden-shifting] formula requires us to ration the evidence between one stage or the other.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    ii. LNDR 2-Mr. Sanna neglected duties as the employee assigned to oversee OSHA compliance\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Secretary asserts that a jury could disbelieve the reason Defendants identify for firing Mr. Sanna because there are several questions about the credibility of Mr. Lloyd's proffered reason for firing Mr. Sanna.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   First, the Secretary avers there is evidence undermining Mr. Lloyd's statement that he believed Mr. Sanna was responsible for safety and health at the plant. The Secretary contends that had Mr. Lloyd truly believed that Mr. Sanna was responsible for safety and health, he would have included Mr. Sanna in the OSHA inspection. Instead, Mr. Sanna stated that Mr. Lloyd did not ask him to participate in the initial meeting with the OSHA agents on November 13, 2014, nor was he included in any part of the OSHA inspection at any time in 2014. According to the Secretary, this evidence undermines Defendants' position that Mr. Lloyd believed Mr. Sanna was in charge of safety and health, and thus calls into question whether Mr. Lloyd in fact fired Mr. Sanna for failing to uphold his duties to oversee OSHA compliance. (Pl.'s Resp. at 18-19;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11453805\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/206/271/#p284\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11453805\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/206/271/#p284\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Ex. C, 1765:11-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Second, the Secretary asserts that Mr. Lloyd had already considered firing Mr. Sanna in December 2014 during the OSHA inspection, citing to Mr. Lloyd's testimony that he posted a job listing for a plant manager on Monster.com. Mr. Lloyd testified that he was not planning to replace Mr. Sanna at that time, but instead had decided to hire a second plant manager to oversee \"administrative stuff.\" Yet, Mr. Lloyd never hired anyone to fill that second position. Rather, he interviewed one person, did not hire them, and never posted a listing for that position again. According to the Secretary, this evidence suggests Mr. Lloyd had considered firing Mr. Sanna for reasons other than the OSHA violations, and had in fact actively looked for a replacement, before the OSHA citations were issued.

Mr. Lloyd testified that he believed the OSHA citations were \"frivolous\" and that there was \"no merit whatsoever\" to them. The Secretary contends that if Mr. Lloyd believed the citations were meritless and \"frivolous,\" it is illogical that he would fire his plant manager of six years. Prior to the OSHA citations, Mr. Sanna had earned two raises and Mr. Lloyd testified that Mr. Sanna had never performed any of his job duties in less than a satisfactory manner.

In concluding such, I have also considered the evidence Mr. Sanna offered in support of his prima facie case. A fact finder could find the fact that Mr. Sanna was fired on the same day that OSHA citations were lodged to be evidence that Mr. Lloyd fired him in retaliation for testifying before OSHA and being related to Mr. Elbode.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In sum, the evidence presented by the Secretary provides a sufficient basis on which a jury could infer that the two non-discriminatory reasons proffered by Defendants were pretextual for retaliation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sheridan v.

Based on the foregoing, the Secretary has established both a prima facie case of retaliation in violation of the OSH Act and the existence of genuine issues of material fact regarding whether Defendants' proffered reasons for Mr. Spillane and Mr. Sanna's termination were pretextual. Defendants' motion for summary judgment on the Secretary's OSH Act retaliation claim will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' motion for summary judgment will be denied. An appropriate Order follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Defendants cite to Exhibit 27 as support for this fact, however, Exhibit 27 appears to be only a cover page of a transcript of a statement taken from Mr. Sanna on February 23, 2015. Nonetheless, Mr. Sanna stated that he provided testimony to OSHA on February 23, 2015 in a declaration. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Resp., Ex. D \u00b6 12.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Citing to Mr. Sanna's declaration, the Secretary states that Mr. Lloyd was aware that Mr. Sanna provided testimony as part of the OSHA inspection.

G, 52:5-7.)

Nonetheless, the Secretary highlights that Mr. Lloyd testified that Mr. Spillane's supervisor, Kai Tran, was the only employee who had complained about Mr. Spillane's work to him. According to Mr. Lloyd, Tran spoke to him once or twice about this. However, Tran testified that he never spoke to Mr. Lloyd about Mr. Spillane being a bad worker. In fact, Tran testified that he never spoke to Mr. Lloyd about Mr. Spillane before Mr. Spillane was fired. (Pl.'s Resp., Ex.

Importantly, the\n    <em>\n     Simpson\n    </em>\n    court did not require a showing of a comparator, but instead stated that evidence of a comparator was one way that a plaintiff could show pretext.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"219280\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/142/639/#p644\">\n     142 F.3d at 644-45\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (listing multiple ways a plaintiff can show pretext). Thus, because I find that the Secretary has put forward sufficient evidence from which a jury could infer pretext, it is not fatal that he has failed to identify comparators.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
