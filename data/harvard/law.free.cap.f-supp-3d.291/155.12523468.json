If an individual does not meet one of these requirements, the Licensing Unit will typically issue the LTC subject to a \"Target &amp; Hunting\" restriction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Licensing Unit imposes three varieties of restrictions on firearm licenses: (1) employment, (2) target and hunting, and (3) sporting. A written policy describing those restrictions states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     EMPLOYMENT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   -restricts possession to a business owner engaged in business activities, or to an employee while engaged in work related activities, and maintaining proficiency, where the employer requires carry of a firearm (i.e. armored car, security guard, etc.).

(Def. Evans's SMF \u00b6 5). However, the Licensing Unit does follow general guidelines. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6). For example, the Licensing Unit draws a\n   distinction between victims of random crime and victims who were specifically targeted; the latter are more likely to show the \"good reason to fear injury\" required for an unrestricted LTC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10). The Licensing Unit does not define \"good reason to fear injury\" with regard to high-crime areas. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11). In addition, applicants requesting an unrestricted LTC must submit a letter and supporting documentation to Lt. Det. McDonough. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13). Lt. Det. McDonough states that he reviews those documents to determine eligibility for an unrestricted LTC on an individualized, case-by-case basis.

In holding that prohibition unconstitutional, the court noted that \"[r]emarkably, Illinois is the\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    state that maintains a flat ban on carrying ready-to-use guns outside the home.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3645425\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/702/933/#p942\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (emphasis in original).

Indeed,\n    <em>\n     Moore\n    </em>\n    specifically noted that \"[n]ot even Massachusetts has so flat a ban as Illinois.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3645425\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/702/933/#p942\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3645425\" index=\"206\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/702/933/#p942\">\n     at 940\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Ultimately, the Seventh Circuit struck down the law, concluding that Illinois had failed \"to justify the most restrictive gun law of any of the 50 states.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3645425\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/702/933/#p942\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3645425\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/702/933/#p942\">\n     at 941\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Even then, the court stayed its entry of judgment for 180 days to \"allow the Illinois legislature to craft a new gun law that will impose reasonable limitations, consistent with public safety and the Second Amendment as interpreted in this opinion, on the carrying of guns in public.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3645425\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/702/933/#p942\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3645425\" index=\"208\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/702/933/#p942\">\n     at 942\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The logical inference is that the Seventh Circuit concluded that some limitation on the carrying of firearms is reasonable. As\n    <em>\n     Moore\n    </em>\n    did not consider a restriction that permitted individuals with a special need for self-defense to obtain unrestricted firearm licenses, it is of limited persuasive value.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
