Allied is a motor carrier company authorized by the Department of Transportation to \"transport household goods and high-value commodities in interstate commerce.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) Allied provides interstate moving services to the general public through its \"disclosed household goods agents throughout the United States.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Astro \"provides local warehouse services and transportation services under its own authority from the New York State Department of Transportation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.) \"Household goods agents\" are defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20375.14\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 375.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to include \"agents who are permitted or required under the terms of any agreement or arrangement with a principal carrier to provide any transportation service for or on behalf of the principal carrier, including the selling of or arranging for any transportation service ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20375.14\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 375.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Under the Agency Contract, Astro is required to comply with,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , Allied's \"Certified Labor Program\" (\"Labor Program\"). Established in 2006, the Labor Program requires Astro, and other agents, to ensure all of their contractors and employees participating in Allied's interstate moving jobs to have successfully completed a criminal background check. (Stuart Lichten Decl. in Supp. of Pls. First Mot. (\"Lichten Decl.\") 25, Docket Entry No. 38.) The Labor Program grants Allied \"sole authority and responsibility to establish and determine the consent process, adjudication standards, and documentation criteria for both certification of individuals and alternative vendors.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Agents that fail to comply with the Labor Program face fines and potential liability.

(Adjudication Guidelines (\"AG\"), annexed to Defs. First Mot. as Ex. G., Docket Entry No. 27-6.) Under the Adjudication Guidelines, an applicant's \"felony conviction for any (A) sexual offense; (B) kidnapping; (C) death related offenses; (D) attempted murder; (E) assault with a deadly weapon; (F) assault with intent to kill or (G) armed robbery, mandates the applicant's permanent disqualification from any jobs performed by a disclosed household goods agent under [Allied's] interstate authority.\" (Defs. 56.1 \u00b6 49; AG.) If an individual is not qualified, an agent may continue employing the disqualified individual in the agent's own moving business under the agent's own operating authority, but the individual may not be used on Allied's interstate business. (Defs. 56.1 \u00b6 74.) Astro is also free to hire anyone, regardless of criminal background, for its own intrastate moving services. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Plaintiffs and the application of the Labor Program\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Griffin began working for Astro in August 2008, and, through a referral by Griffin, Godwin began working for Astro in May of 2010. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) Both worked as \"helpers,\" which required them to pack\n   household goods for transportation and move the goods into and out of the homes of Astro's customers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Even though the Labor Program was established in 2006, according to Keith Verderber, Astro's Chief Executive Officer, Allied started asking Astro to conduct background checks on individuals working on Allied shipments in 2008-2009, and thereafter, Astro \"needed to get [its employees] cleared to go on the particular jobs.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75.) On February 8, 2011, Griffin completed the background investigation consent form. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77.) Godwin also completed a background investigation consent form, in which he admitted to having a rape conviction in November of 1998. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 78-79.) Background checks on Griffin and Godwin disclosed that both had convictions for violent sexual offenses against young children, are registered sex offenders and remain under supervision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   According to Griffin, Astro terminated his employment a day or two after he completed the background investigation consent form. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82.) Verderber stated otherwise and explained Griffin was not terminated and chose to leave after being informed that he \"could only go on limited jobs such as a commercial job which is not household goods, not going in somebody's home,\" but that work was limited because Astro did not \"have much of it.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Godwin also failed his background check, and, as a result, Astro terminated his employment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91.) Astro advised Godwin that, based on his criminal record, Astro could not allow him to enter customers' homes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 92.) According to Verderber, Godwin was not offered the same opportunity as Griffin to explain his failed background check or to continue to work for Astro. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 93.) Verderber responded differently to Griffin and Godwin's failed background checks because he \"had a longer relationship\" with Griffin, but he felt he \"couldn't do anything else with\" Godwin. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94.) Verderber determined that Godwin could not have worked on any non-Allied shipments due to liability concerns. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Procedural background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In the May 29, 2014 Decision, the Court denied Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment and granted Defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment. The Court held that Allied and Sirva were not Plaintiffs' employers and therefore were not liable under 296(15).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Griffin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%202434196\">\n    2014 WL 2434196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11. The Court also found that Allied and Sirva were not \"joint employers\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, as a result,\n   could not be subject to \"aider and abettor\" liability under section 296(6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Court conducted a jury trial on Plaintiffs' claims against Astro beginning with jury selection on November 17, 2014. (Minute Entries dated November 17, 2014 through November 21, 2014.) After three days of trial and deliberations, the jury found that Astro did not unlawfully discriminate against Plaintiffs within the meaning of section 296(15). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Verdict Sheet 5, Docket Entry No. 70.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs appealed the summary judgment decision dismissing the claims against Defendants to the Second Circuit but did not appeal the jury verdict.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Griffin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354579\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/835/283/\">\n    835 F.3d at 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the appeal involved several unresolved questions of New York law, the Second Circuit certified the following three questions to the New York Court of Appeals regarding who may be liable under the NYSHRL:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , does Section 296(15) limit liability for unlawful denial of employment only to the aggrieved party's \"employer\"?\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , if Section 296(15) is limited in that way, how should courts determine whether an entity is the aggrieved party's \"employer\" for the purposes of a claim under Section 296(15) ?\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , does the \"aiding and abetting\" liability provision of the NYSHRL, Section 296(6), apply to Section 296(15) such that a non-employer may be liable under Section 296(15) as an aider and abettor of an employer's unlawful denial of employment?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354579\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/835/283/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4354579\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/835/283/\">\n    at 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The New York Court of Appeals answered in the affirmative as to the first question and as to the second question explained that an employer under section 296(15) is to be defined in accordance with common-law principles, \"with greatest emphasis placed on the alleged employer's power \"to order and control\" the employee in his or her performance of work.\"\n   <em>\n    Griffin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280764\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/29/174/\">\n    29 N.Y.3d at 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280764\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/29/174/\">\n    54 N.Y.S.3d 360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 186,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280764\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/29/174/\">\n    76 N.E.3d 1063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Lastly, Plaintiffs argue that, because Defendants are corporations and not individuals, the case law requiring an underlying violation in order to find aider and abettor liability is inapposite. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As explained below, the Court dismisses Plaintiffs' aider and abettor claim because (1) Plaintiffs are collaterally estopped from relitigating the issue of a primary violation because a jury has already found that Astro did not take any discriminatory actions in violation of section 296(15), and (2) without a primary violation by Astro, Defendants cannot be liable as aiders and abettors under section 296(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    i.

After three days of trial and deliberations, the jury found in favor of Astro, concluding that Plaintiffs had failed to prove by a preponderance of evidence that Astro unlawfully terminated their employment because of their prior criminal convictions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Verdict Sheet 5 (marking \"No\" in response to the question \"Have Plaintiffs proven by a preponderance of the evidence that [Astro] unlawfully terminated their employment because of their prior criminal conviction?\").)

According to Plaintiffs, \"the jury found Astro not liable because the jury believed that Astro was compelled by [D]efendants to discharge [P]laintiffs.\" (Pls. Second Mot. 6.) Plaintiffs thus argue that the \"verdict did not necessarily mean that the jury found no Human Rights Law violation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The trial record does not support Plaintiffs' arguments.

In addition, the Court twice instructed the jury: \"Requirements, preferences, or attitudes of [Astro's] clients, customers, or principals such as [Defendants] Allied Van Lines or Sirva, Inc. are not relevant to your determination of whether or not [Astro] complied with its obligations under the statute.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   109:19-23; November 21, 2014 Tr. 140:6-10.)
