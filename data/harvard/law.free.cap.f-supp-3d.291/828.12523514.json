(Compl., ECF No. 1.) On July 10, 2017, Defendant appeared before Magistrate Judge Deavers for a Preliminary Hearing. (ECF No. 5.)

For Defendant to prevail on her as-applied First Amendment challenge, she must demonstrate that the statute is unconstitutional as applied to her particular\n   expressive activity. She asserts that her alleged Facebook posts are protected by the First Amendment because of their truth and because they did not contain overtly threatening speech.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Government takes the position that Section 1513(e) is one of several statutory provisions that punishes language-based crimes, such as \"true threats\" or \"fighting words.\" (Gov. Br. at 2, ECF No. 9.) The Government also contends that the speech at issue here was the very vehicle of the crime itself, similar to perjury, bribery or extortion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) At bottom, the Government posits that the posts on the social media website were threats intended by the Defendant to retaliate against CI-1 for cooperation with law enforcement, or otherwise \"speech\" that is unprotected under the First Amendment as \"speech integral to criminal conduct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Ultimately, determining whether Defendant's speech is protected by the First Amendment requires the Court to review the context of her alleged Facebook posts and her intent in posting the material. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12(b) prohibits such finding on issues ultimately triable to a jury with regard to a criminal statute otherwise constitutional on its face.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Truth of the Statements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendant contends that if she in fact posted the comments, she published only truthful statements on Facebook about CI-1 such that her speech is protected by the First Amendment. (Def.'s Br. at 17, ECF No. 10.) By way of this argument, Defendant, in effect, maintains that intent under Section 1513(e) may be inferred only if a person publishes false statements regarding a witness or informant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Other courts that have addressed the interplay between Section 1513(e) and the First Amendment look to the\n   <em>\n    context\n   </em>\n   of a defendant's actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sergentakis,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%203763988\">\n    2015 WL 3763988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   at *6,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%2077719\">\n    2015 U.S. Dist.

The court explained,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   The truthfulness of Mr. Camick's factual allegations does not undermine the fact that the district court found the legal theories Mr. Camick advanced against Ms. Wattley nonmeritorious. In other words, even if Mr. Camick's allegation that Ms. Wattley filed an improper stolen vehicle report were true, a jury could still infer that his legal theories were so divorced from reality that he filed the Civil Rights Lawsuit not because he thought he might win on the merits, but because he intended to retaliate against Ms. Wattley by forcing her to defend against meritless claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5768961\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/796/1206/#p1220\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendant also contends the intent to retaliate can only be inferred when a defendant \"publishes false information regarding a witness or informant,\" and\n   therefore the government cannot prove intent. (Def.'s Br. at 17.) As noted, not all true statements are protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Accordingly, determining whether the Government can prove intent to retaliate is inappropriate at this juncture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Indeed, the Court agrees Defendant's Facebook posts do not contain any overt calls to retaliate against CI 1 as set forth in the Complaint. Again, the context of Defendant's alleged Facebook posts is important to this matter, not the non-overtly threatening nature of the posts. The Government will be required to prove Defendant's specific intent to retaliate and evidence that her actions caused harm to CI 1.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201513\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   A determination at this stage of the proceeding as to whether the Government has met its burden in proving intent is inappropriate under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12(b).\n   <em>\n    United States v.
