Defendant urges that the standard of review should shift accordingly to abuse of discretion.

They did not rely on or interpret the definition of \"disability insurance\" under the California Insurance Code, and their analysis thus does not shed light on the question at issue here. The court in\n   <em>\n    Bain\n   </em>\n   also noted that California regulates health insurance plans that are registered as health care service plans (\"HCSP\") under the California Health and Safety Code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bain\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204529495\">\n    2016 WL 4529495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8. Here, Defendant does not argue that it is an HCSP that is not subject to the Insurance Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that the state ban's reference to \"disability insurance\" encompasses health insurance as a subset of disability insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Based on a plain reading of the California Insurance Code, the Court finds that \u00a7 10110.6's ban on discretionary clauses applies to health insurance and renders any discretionary provision in the Plan void. The default, de novo standard of review therefore applies. Accordingly, Plaintiffs' cross-motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   and Defendant's motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Court further\n   <strong>\n    SETS\n   </strong>\n   a case management conference for February 13, 2018, at 2:00 p.m. The parties shall submit a joint case management statement by February 6, 2018, including a proposed expedited briefing schedule for the cross-motions for judgment on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    The parties agree that the Medical Benefits Plan at issue here is for \"health insurance.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt.
