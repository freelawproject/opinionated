The actions are pending in the Northern District of California, the Northern District of Georgia, and the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, as listed on the attached Schedule A.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs in all three actions oppose centralization, as does plaintiff in the one tag-along.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   On the basis of the papers filed and the hearing session held, we deny First Databank's motion. The three actions share factual issues concerning First Databank's decision to change its coding of prescription prenatal vitamins to \"Non-Rx\" or over-the-counter. Plaintiffs, which are manufacturers and distributors of these vitamins, allege that this new coding is false and deceptive, that it will lead to\n   widespread denial of Medicaid and insurance coverage for prenatal vitamins, and that it will harm plaintiffs' businesses. But these issues-in particular, the central issue of whether coding plaintiffs' vitamins as lacking a federal legal prescription requirement is false or misleading-do not appear to be particularly complex or likely to require a substantial amount of discovery. In addition, there are only four actions, and motions to transfer (under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) or first-to-file grounds) are pending in the Georgia and Pennsylvania actions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even if transfer is denied, the small number of actions indicates that alternatives to centralization are feasible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re: Eli Lilly &amp; Co.
