(\"Raymours\" or \"defendant\") for violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et. seq.\n   </em>\n   and related New York state wage and labor laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Raymours now moves to compel arbitration on an individual basis, strike plaintiffs' class allegations, and dismiss the complaint. In response, plaintiffs concede that they entered into a binding agreement to arbitrate the instant claims with Raymours. Plaintiffs argue only that the arbitration agreement's statute of limitations is unenforceable against their FLSA claims and must be severed. Raymours argues that the arbitrator should decide whether the arbitration agreement's statute of limitations is enforceable, and that, in any event, the provision is enforceable. For the reasons that follow, the Court concludes that the arbitration agreement's statute of limitations provision is unenforceable, and accordingly severs that provision. The Court additionally strikes the class allegations, and stays this action pending arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A. Facts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following facts are taken from the complaint (ECF No. 1), the Declaration of Stephen McPeak filed in support of defendant's motion to compel arbitration (ECF No. 18), and the exhibits attached thereto.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At all times relevant to the complaint, plaintiffs were employed by Raymours, a furniture retailer. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 23, 31, 39, 46, 54.) While employed by Raymours, each plaintiff agreed to be bound by an Employee Arbitration Program (\"EAP\"). (McPeak Decl. \u00b6 12.) The EAP requires Raymours employees to arbitrate \"any employment-related or compensation-related claims, disputes, controversies or actions\n   ... that in any way arise from or relate to [their] employment with [Raymours] ... and that are based on a legally protected right.\" (McPeak Decl. Ex. 1 at 2.) Under the agreement, \"[l]egally protected right[s]\" include,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , rights under \"the federal Fair Labor Standards Act or any state wage and hour laws.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The EAP also establishes a 180-day\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   statute of limitations for asserting a claim. Specifically, the EAP provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   A Claim must be filed with the Administrator within 180 days after it arises .... If a Claim is not filed with the Administrator within the time period described above, the party wishing to assert it will forever waive and lose the right to seek relief for that Claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Additionally, the EAP includes a class action waiver, which states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   CAN CLAIMS BE DECIDED BY CLASS OR COLLECTIVE ACTION? No. This section describes the \"Class Action Waiver\" of the Program. Claims cannot be litigated or arbitrated by way of a class or collective action. All Claims between you and us must be decided individually.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Finally, the EAP provides that \"disputes about the validity, enforceability or scope of this Program or any part thereof (including the Class Action Waiver described below)\" are \"for a court or agency and not an arbitrator to decide.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   B. Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs filed the complaint on April 4, 2017. Defendant moved to compel arbitration on an individual basis, strike the class allegations, and dismiss the complaint on July 28, 2017. Plaintiffs opposed defendant's motion on September 11, 2017, and defendant replied on October 2, 2017.

DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiffs do not dispute that they are bound to arbitrate the instant dispute. Instead, they argue only that the EAP's statute of limitations is unenforceable against their FLSA claims\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and must be severed from the agreement. In response, defendant argues that the provision's enforceability is a procedural issue for the arbitrator to decide, and, in any event, that the shortened statute of limitations is enforceable against the FLSA claims. As explained below, the Court concludes that the provision's enforceability is a question for the Court, and that the provision is unenforceable against plaintiffs' FLSA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A. Whether the EAP's Limitations Period is Enforceable is for the Court to Decide\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As a threshold matter, whether the EAP's statute of limitations provision is enforceable is for the Court to decide. Defendant correctly argues that \"issues of procedural arbitrability,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , whether prerequisites such as\n   <em>\n    time limits\n   </em>\n   , notice, laches, estoppel, and other conditions precedent to an obligation to arbitrate have been met, are for the arbitrators to decide.\"\n   <em>\n    Howsam v.

However, the issue before the Court is not whether the EAP's limitations period has been met; it is whether the EAP's limitations period is enforceable. That issue falls squarely within the Court's province.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Granite Rock Co. v.

Moreover, the EAP expressly reserves issues concerning the EAP's enforceability for the Court. Specifically, it states that \"disputes about the validity, enforceability or scope of this Program or any part thereof\" are \"for a court or agency and not an arbitrator to decide.\" (McPeak Decl.

Because the defendant had agreed not to attempt to enforce either provision against the plaintiff, the court did not determine whether either was enforceable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4215969\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/595/115/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In a section entitled \"A Note of Caution,\" however, the court wrote that \"[h]ad the defendants attempted to enforce the arbitration agreement as originally written it is not clear that we would hold in their favor.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4215969\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/595/115/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4215969\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/595/115/\">\n    at 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court continued, \"had the defendants not waived enforcement, it is at least possible that Ragone would be able to demonstrate that these provisions were incompatible with her ability to pursue her Title VII claims in arbitration, and therefore void under the FAA.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4215969\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/595/115/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4215969\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/595/115/\">\n    at 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court finds the non-binding case authority discussed above to be persuasive, and concludes that the EAP's 180-day statute of limitations is unenforceable as to plaintiffs' FLSA claims. First, the provision contravenes congressional commands. As discussed above, Congress chose to distinguish between ordinary and willful FLSA violations by providing an extended limitations period for the latter. The EAP-which provides employees with 180 days to assert a claim without regard to the egregiousness of the violations-eliminates that intended distinction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The EAP's 180-day limitations period also undermines the FLSA's remedial scheme. Because a new cause of action accrues under the FLSA with each allegedly unlawful paycheck, a plaintiff may recover damages as far back as the statute of limitations reaches. By limiting plaintiffs' time to assert FLSA claims, the EAP also limits their potential recovery. As noted above, the Supreme Court has \"held that FLSA rights cannot be abridged by contract or otherwise waived because this would 'nullify the purposes' of the statute and thwart the legislative policies it was designed to effectuate.\"\n   <em>\n    Barrentine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189685\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/728/#p740\">\n    450 U.S. at 740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6189685\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/450/728/#p740\">\n    101 S.Ct. 1437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1981). Because the EAP operates to waive plaintiffs' rights to full recovery under the FLSA, it contravenes the policies that the statute was designed to effectuate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Second, the EAP's limitations period is unenforceable under the effective vindication exception. As noted above, the Supreme Court made clear in\n   <em>\n    Italian Colors\n   </em>\n   that the effective vindication exception applies when a provision operates as a \"prospective waiver of a party's\n   <em>\n    right to pursue\n   </em>\n   statutory remedies.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698468\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/228/#p233\">\n    570 U.S. at 235-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698468\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/228/#p233\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court further instructed that the exception \"would certainly cover a provision in an arbitration agreement forbidding the assertion of certain statutory rights.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698468\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/228/#p233\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698468\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/228/#p233\">\n    at 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12698468\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/570/228/#p233\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, because the EAP's limitations period operates as a waiver of plaintiffs' rights to pursue the full amount of damages provided for by the FLSA, the effective vindication doctrine applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Having determined that the EAP's limitations provision is unenforceable, the Court concludes that the appropriate remedy is to sever that provision. The parties agree that, if held to be unenforceable, the provision should be severed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Moreover, the Second Circuit has instructed that the \"appropriate remedy when a court is faced with a plainly unconscionable provision of an arbitration agreement-one which by itself would actually preclude a plaintiff from pursuing her statutory rights-is to sever the improper provision of the arbitration agreement, rather than void the entire agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Ragone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4215969\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/595/115/\">\n    595 F.3d at 124-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the Court severs the provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   C. The EAP's Class Action Waiver is Enforceable\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Defendant's motion requests that this Court compel arbitration on an individual basis and strike the complaint's class allegations based on the EAP's class action waiver. Plaintiffs do not appear to oppose these requests. As noted above, the EAP provides that \"Claims cannot be litigated or arbitrated by way of a class or collective action. All Claims between you and us must be decided individually.\" (McPeak Decl. Ex. 1 at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Binding Second Circuit precedent requires the Court to enforce the EAP's class action waiver. Specifically, in\n   <em>\n    Sutherland\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit held that \"the FLSA does not preclude the waiver of collective action claims.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073562\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/726/290/#p298\">\n    726 F.3d at 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, plaintiffs must proceed to arbitration on an individual basis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, because the EAP provides that claims \"cannot be litigated\" on a class basis, the Court grants defendant's motion to strike the complaint's class allegations.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marcario v.
