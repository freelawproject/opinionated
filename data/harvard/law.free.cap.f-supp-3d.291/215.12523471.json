Section (c) instructs that \"[a] party opposing a motion for summary judgment shall submit with its opposition a separate, short, and concise statement of material facts.\" L. CV. R. 56(c).

As the First Circuit has stated, \"[t]he\n   plain language of the rule specifically requires that additional facts be put forward in a 'separate section.' \"\n   <em>\n    Carreras v. Sajo, Garcia &amp; Partners\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4218361\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/596/25/#p32\">\n    596 F.3d 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 32 (1st Cir. 2010) (holding that district court acted within its discretion when it disregarded additional facts not contained in a separate section). A separate section serves two purposes: \"to allow the moving party to reply to those additional facts and to allow the court to easily determine the disputed facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Malave-Torres v. Cusido\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4306247\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/919/198/#p207\">\n    919 F.Supp.2d 198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 207 (D.P.R. 2013). For these reasons, \"a party may not include numerous additional facts within its opposition to the moving party's statements of uncontested facts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4306247\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/919/198/#p207\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   If a party improperly controverts the facts, Local Rule 56 allows the Court to treat the opposing party's facts as uncontroverted. Thus, the First Circuit has consistently held that litigants ignore Local Rule 56 at their peril.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Caban Hernandez v. Philip Morris USA, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3115677\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/486/1/#p7\">\n    486 F.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 7 (1st Cir. 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The line between a properly supported qualification or denial and additional facts can be blurry. Because Local Rule 56 requires that a record citation support each qualification or denial, it can seem inevitable to proffer additional facts when doing so. But a better understanding of what constitutes a qualification or denial helps. A qualification is \"[a] modification or limitation of terms or language; esp., a restriction of terms that would otherwise be interpreted broadly.\"\n   <em>\n    Qualification\n   </em>\n   , BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 1436 (10th ed 2014). Simply put, a qualification must clarify a statement of fact that, without clarification, could lead the Court to an incorrect inference. Thus, if a fact states that \"Plaintiff works as an attorney all day,\" a proper qualification would be: \"Plaintiff works as an attorney from 9-5\" and a citation to the record supporting this fact. This would prevent the Court from inferring that Plaintiff works as an attorney from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., which can be the standard in the legal world. Adding that Plaintiff works from 9-5 would not be considered an \"additional fact\" in the context of Local Rule 56. On the other hand, a denial, as common sense suggests, is \"[a] statement that something is not true.\"\n   <em>\n    Denial\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 527. So if a fact states that \"Plaintiff is an attorney,\" a proper denial would be: \"Denied. Plaintiff is a doctor\" and a citation to the record supporting this fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   First Circuit case law sheds some light on when parties cross the line between a proper qualification or denial and additional facts. In\n   <em>\n    Acevedo-Padilla v. Novartis Ex Lax, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the district court held that \"a party's denial or qualification of a proposed fact\n   <em>\n    must be strictly limited to the issue therein raised.\n   </em>\n   Any additional information shall be included in a separate section in order to ease the Court's task.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4154861\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/740/293/#p298\">\n    740 F.Supp.2d 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 298 (D.P.R. 2010),\n   <em>\n    rev'd and\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    remanded\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    on other grounds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5865014\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/128/\">\n    696 F.3d 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1st Cir. 2012) (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The First Circuit affirmed this ruling, labeling it \"an appropriate exercise of [the district court's] discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Acevedo-Parrilla\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5865014\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/128/\">\n    696 F.3d at 137\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[D]istrict court, in an appropriate exercise of its discretion, ruled that it would disregard any additional facts provided by [plaintiff] when denying or qualifying [defendant's] statement of uncontested facts\"). So, returning to the previous example of the 9-5 attorney, it could be improper to qualify the fact that Plaintiff works \"all day\" by adding that one day at work, Plaintiff's boss made a discriminatory remark. This fact would not be \"strictly\n   limited to the issue therein raised.\"\n   <em>\n    Acevedo-Padilla\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4154861\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/740/293/#p298\">\n    740 F.Supp.2d at 298\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Court notes that the \"strictly limited to the issue therein raised\" standard for denials and qualifications, as articulated by my esteemed colleague, the late Senior Judge Salvador E. Casellas, is demanding but necessary.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4154861\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/740/293/#p298\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court wants to impart justice, and lawyers play an essential role in helping it achieve this goal. Honest argumentation and clear presentation of the issues and facts help the Court tremendously. The opposite burdens the Court just as much.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Here, Natal's response to Oriental's statement of uncontested material facts suffers from the same flaw as the plaintiff's in\n   <em>\n    Acevedo-Parrilla\n   </em>\n   : many of Natal's denials and qualifications contain additional facts. For convenience and readability, the Court will address the issues in footnotes as they arise in the relevant facts section. But to illustrate the problem, here is a notable example. Paragraph 21 of Oriental's statement of uncontested material facts states: \"On September 30, 2015 Mr. Natal was suspended from work and pay from September 30, 2015, through October 30, 2015 for incorrectly directing his tellers' employees and for telling them that they could accept tips from clients up to $150.\" (Docket No. 49 \u00b6 21) (Record citations omitted). A proper qualification would be strictly limited to the suspension's date, length, or reason. But instead, Natal narrates everything that transpired before, during, and after the suspension, as the following\n   <em>\n    fragment\n   </em>\n   of Natal's paragraph 21 shows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Paragraph 21 of DSUF is qualified, since on September 30, 2015, Natal was summoned to a meeting with Beatriz Santiago (\"Santiago\") and Mrs. Tania S\u00e1nchez (\"S\u00e1nchez\"), who was one of the managers of defendant's human resources department. During the meeting, S\u00e1nchez and Santiago referred to Natal as old man and accused him of having informed the employees of the branch that they could accept tips up until the amount $150.00, which Natal denied. Natal informed both of them that he had never issued that instruction to any of the employees that he supervised. During the meeting, Santiago and S\u00e1nchez referred to Natal as \"old man\" and also told him to 'be quiet and to shut up his mouth', and also told him to 'be quiet old man'. S\u00e1nchez also told Natal that he was an old man, that he was worthless and that he should not be working at the bank. S\u00e1nchez and Santiago also told Natal that he was not good as a bank manager. Natal stated that the whole meeting was to insult him. Santiago then physically pushed Natal out of the room and told him to wait outside while Santiago and S\u00e1nchez continued with the meeting. S\u00e1nchez and Santiago also told Natal that he was going to be fired and ordered Natal to leave the facilities. Santiago and S\u00e1nchez then told Natal that he was going to be suspended from employment but failed to inform Natal about the amount of days of the suspension from employment and whether Natal was going to be suspended without pay or not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   On September 30, 2015, Natal sent an email requesting to Santiago and S\u00e1nchez the reason for his suspension and the time of his suspension, but neither Santiago nor S\u00e1nchez, nor any defendant officer sent to Natal a response.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   On October 9, 2015, Natal filed a charge of discrimination before the EEOC and on October 14, 2015, sent a copy of the same to the defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (Docket No. 61-1 \u00b6 21) (Record citations omitted).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Natal's non-compliance troubles the Court because some of these improperly provided facts are crucial to his case. They tell the story of when, where, and how he suffered alleged discrimination. The Court could ignore them because it does not have to ferret through the parties' exhibits under Local Rule 56.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   L. CV. R. 56(e) (\"The court shall have no independent duty to search or consider any part of the record not specifically referenced in the parties' separate statement of facts.\"). But the Court firmly believes in access to justice, the lack of which is a serious problem in Puerto Rico, and feels uncomfortable completely disregarding these additional facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , LUIS F. ESTRELLA MART\u00cdNEZ, ACCESO A LA JUSTICIA 5 (2017) (\"Dworkin visualizes 'integrity' as an ideal that aspires that public powers are not exercised in a capricious or arbitrary way, but coherently.\") (translation ours); Deborah L. Rhode &amp; Pablo J. Hern\u00e1ndez Rivera,\n   <em>\n    Access to Justice in Puerto Rico\n   </em>\n   , 86 REV. JUR. UPR 818, 822 (2017) (\"The challenges facing Puerto Rico in ensuring access to justice remain substantial.\"); Federico Hern\u00e1ndez Denton,\n   <em>\n    Acceso a la justicia y Estado de Derecho\n   </em>\n   , 81 REV. JUR. UPR 1129 (2012) (focusing on two issues that \"directly affect the manner in which one can measure our Rule of Law's success .... access to justice and court efficiency\") (translation ours); JOS\u00c9 TR\u00cdAS MONGE, SOCIEDAD, DERECHO Y JUSTICIA 291 (1986) (\"[L]awyer[s] must ensure the continued improvement in the progress of our courts\") (translation ours). Balancing its interests in efficiency and access to justice, the Court will make an exception: It will consider that part of Natal's deposition testimony where he narrates the alleged discriminatory incident when deciding if the facts he states, if believed by a jury, would create a genuine issue of material fact.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Relevant Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Natal was born in 1957, and at the time of the complaint, was 58 years old. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6 1; 61-1 \u00b6 1). He has worked in different banks since 1979, and for Oriental since 2012. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6\u00b6 2-8; 61-1 \u00b6\u00b6 2-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   When he became Oriental's employee, Natal worked as a Branch Operations Manager in the Old San Juan branch. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6 7; 61-1 \u00b6 7). His functions included managing branch operations, administering personnel, ensuring compliance with Oriental's policies, bank regulations, and procedures, among others.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4154861\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/740/293/#p298\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   One of these policies was Oriental's Code of Business Ethics, which forbade soliciting and accepting anything of value in exchange for any business service. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6 11; 61-1 \u00b6 11). Oriental gave Natal the Code and required him to review it annually. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6\u00b6 9-11; 61-1 \u00b6\u00b6 9-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In November 2013, Oriental transferred Natal from the Old San Juan branch to the Cata\u00f1o branch, where he worked as Branch Service and Operations Manager. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6 14; 61-1 \u00b6 14). He was in charge of supervising cashiers and platform relationship officers. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6 17; 61-1 \u00b6 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Work Suspension and Alleged Discrimination\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   During his tenure in Cata\u00f1o, in March 2015, an employee named Diosys Ortiz was placed under Natal's supervision. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6 78; 61-1 \u00b6 78). On the one hand,\n   Oriental asserts that Natal \"never had to give Ms. Ortiz a warning or call her attention regarding her performance or violation of Oriental's rules and policies.\" (Docket No. 49 \u00b6 78). On the other hand, Natal qualifies that he was instructed to keep an eye on her to provide a reason to terminate her, because she was sick with cancer. (Docket No. 61-1 \u00b6 78). Regardless of this dispute, the parties agree that the following September, Oriental terminated Ortiz for accepting cash tips from a client. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6 78; 61-1 \u00b6 78).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Consequently, on September 30, Oriental suspended Natal for incorrectly telling his employees that they could accept tips up to $150. (Docket No. 49 \u00b6 21). Nevertheless, Natal qualifies this fact by clarifying that he denied the accusation. (Docket No. 61-1 \u00b6 21).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Natal's deposition testimony, after the cash tip incident, he was summoned to a meeting with Santiago, his supervisor, and Tania S\u00e1nchez, a human resources manager. (Docket No. 49-1 at 55-60, 159-60). According to Natal, during the meeting they referred to him as old, told him to be quiet, and called him worthless.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4154861\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/740/293/#p298\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Natal was suspended for one month. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6 21; 61-1 \u00b6 21). He does not know if Oriental has ever reprimanded other managers for the same conduct he allegedly engaged in. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6 27; 61-1 \u00b6 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   During his suspension, Natal filed a discrimination charge against Oriental in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleging age discrimination and retaliation. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6 22; 61-1 \u00b6 22). According to Natal, he never complained to Human Resources about the discriminatory acts because the discriminatory comments were made by a human resources manager. (Docket No. 61-1 \u00b6 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Reasonable Accommodation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Natal did not return to work when his suspension ended on November 1 because he took a leave under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) until November 30.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Natal also requested reasonable accommodation to attend his medical appointments four to five times per month. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6 75; 61-1 \u00b6 75). He did not request any other types of reasonable accommodation. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6 77; 61-1 \u00b6 77). Although Oriental has never rejected Natal's requests for sick leave, Natal claims that Santiago, his supervisor, made disrespectful comments about his age when he made his request, such as \"it's time for you to go home, just pick up your bags,\" and also questioned his requests. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6 76; 61-1 \u00b6 76).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Return to Work and Transfer to Old San Juan\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Natal returned to work on December 3. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6 23; 61-1 \u00b6 23). A month and a half later, Oriental transferred Natal back to the Old San Juan branch. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6 24; 61-1 \u00b6 24).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    2015 Work Evaluation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Natal's performance during 2015 was evaluated by his supervisor, Santiago. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6 29; 61-1 \u00b6 29).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The evaluation occurred in October, while he was suspended.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Docket No. 49 \u00b6 47). His performance in the \"Goals-Coaching Sessions\" section was rated as \"unsatisfactory/does not meet expectations\" because he failed to complete the second part of a training. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6 30; 61-1 \u00b6 30). But Natal claims he was unable to complete this training because it occurred during his suspension and leave.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4154861\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/740/293/#p298\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   According to Natal, he tried to complete the second part in December but Santiago did not let him. (Docket No. 61-1 \u00b6 30). In all other areas of the \"Goals\" section, however, Natal received a positive evaluation. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6\u00b6 31-39; 61-1 \u00b6\u00b6 31-39). But again in the \"Competency\" section, Natal received negative evaluations which he disagreed with, testifying in his deposition that they were because of his age.

(Docket Nos. 49, \u00b6 52; 61-1 \u00b6 52). After asking Human Resources about the letter, a supervisor told Natal that it was an informative communication for his records, and as of this complaint's filing, none of the qualifying events had happened. (Docket Nos. 49, \u00b6\u00b6 53-54; 61-1 \u00b6\u00b6 54).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Four days later, Natal received a written warning for failing to monitor the cash funds and exceeding the cash limits at the Cata\u00f1o branch in December 2015, and in the Old San Juan branch in January 2016. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6 56; 61-1 \u00b6 56). Natal does not dispute the fact that he received the warning, but sustains the warning was unjust and retaliatory. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6 58; 61-1 \u00b6 58). Still, Natal is unaware if Oriental disciplined other managers who engaged in the same conduct as him. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6 57; 61-1 \u00b6 57).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Almost two weeks later, Natal filed this lawsuit alleging age and disability discrimination.

The four exhibits are (1) a memo dated April 13, 2016 (Docket No. 61-11), (2) a medical record (Docket No. 61-12), (3) an anti-discrimination charge filed on June 23, 2017 (Docket No. 61-14), and (4) a memo dated April 15, 2016 (Docket No. 61-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Memos and Anti-Discrimination Charge\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Oriental contends that the Court should strike the two memos and the anti-discrimination charge because Natal (1) did not produce them in discovery and (2) they relate to matters beyond the complaint's scope. (Docket No. 66 at 3).

The memos date from April 2016, and the charge from June 2017. These documents raise new allegations of discrimination. Natal argues that he did not submit these exhibits to raise new allegations, but to clarify an incorrect statement by Oriental that Natal had not been terminated. But as Oriental points out in its motion, at the time of the complaint, Natal had not been terminated or subject to additional disciplinary measures. (Docket No. 48, fn. 3). Therefore, there was nothing to correct. Moreover, this is not a case where the plaintiff \"is merely augmenting the evidentiary basis for the very same age discrimination claim that he had already sufficiently pled.\"\n   <em>\n    Soto-Feliciano v. Villa Cofresi Hotels, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4012991\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/19/#p26\">\n    779 F.3d 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 26 (1st Cir. 2015). That would be the case if Natal introduced new evidence supporting his existing claims, like a deposition from another employee concerning his transfer to Old San Juan. Instead, Natal is \"introducing a new theory of liability\"-that he was terminated and thus, discriminated and retaliated against.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4012991\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/779/19/#p26\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   If Natal wanted to include these new allegations, the appropriate course was to amend his complaint and include these new events in a supplemental pleading. The reason for this is straightforward: fairness demands notice, and Oriental needed notice of the allegations to defend itself against Natal. Raising new allegations of discrimination at the summary judgment stage betrays this principle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Medical Records\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The medical records are cited in support of Natal's disability claim.

Natal did not supply any admissible additional facts in his submissions that would allow the Court to conclude that the transfer was disadvantageous. Even assuming that the facts raised in his response brief are true-that it was a demotion just because the Old San Juan branch was less active-these would not prove that the transfer was materially adverse. \"A materially adverse change in the terms and conditions of employment 'must be more disruptive than a mere inconvenience or an alteration of job responsibilities.' \"\n   <em>\n    De Jesus v.

Oriental's statement of uncontested material facts states that: \"Natal received a written warning for failure to monitor the cash funds in the branch and exceeding the cash limits at the Cata\u00f1o branch for the month of December 2015 and in the Old San Juan branch for the month of January, 2016.\" (Docket No. 49 \u00b6 56). Natal improperly denied this fact, and the Court has admitted Oriental's fact as uncontroverted. There are no other facts indicating a material change in the conditions of Natal's employment as a result of this warning. A warning in and of itself is not an adverse employment action. Even if treated as a negative job evaluation, case law is clear that there must be proof that the negative evaluation is \"unwarranted.\" Given that Natal has not provided\n   <em>\n    admissible\n   </em>\n   facts indicating so, and the Court is not required to ferret through exhibits to find them, it holds that Natal has not met his burden of proof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Likewise, Natal has not proven an issue of fact regarding the COBRA letter being an adverse action. The undisputed facts show that Natal received an informative letter about his rights and responsibilities under COBRA. (Docket Nos. 49, \u00b6 52; 61-1 \u00b6 52). After asking Human Resources about the letter, a supervisor told Natal that it was an informative communication for his records. (Docket Nos. 49, \u00b6 53; 61-1 \u00b6 53). As of filing this complaint, none of the letter's qualifying events that would activate his rights have happened. (Docket Nos. 49, \u00b6 54; 61-1 \u00b6 54). Thus, the letter did not materially change anything in his employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   On the other hand, the suspension and negative job evaluation from 2015 could be considered an adverse employment action. It is undisputed that Natal got a negative job evaluation for not completing a training. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6 30; 61-1 \u00b6 30). Whether the job evaluation was warranted or not is disputed, as Natal properly qualified that he was unable to complete the training because he was suspended and on leave while it happened. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6 30; 61-1 \u00b6 30). Since an unwarranted job evaluation could be a \"material change,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9314231\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/312/6/#p14\">\n    312 F.3d at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , it could also be an adverse action in the eyes of a reasonable juror. Thus, on this issue, Natal has met his burden. The same is true of the suspension, which Oriental has conceded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In sum, the Court concludes that Natal has met his burden on the adverse action prong of the\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   test for the suspension and the 2015 negative evaluation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    2.

Oriental argues that Natal is not qualified because he instructed employees that they could take tips and he failed to complete part of his training. These were also the reasons for the adverse actions taken by Oriental: the suspension and the negative evaluation. But Natal does not need to disprove these reasons at this stage, and evidence exists that would allow a reasonable juror to infer he was qualified. First, he has worked in banking for decades, and Oriental proffered no proof of prior negative performance. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6 2; 61-1 \u00b6 2);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Velez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3479775\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/585/441/#p444\">\n    585 F.3d at 448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Plaintiff pointed specifically to his long record of employment ... a twenty-four year period without discipline or indications of deficient performance ....\"). Second, Oriental gave Natal a positive evaluation in some areas of its 2015 evaluation. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6\u00b6 31-39; 61-1 \u00b6\u00b6 31-39). Thus, despite his flaws in one area, a juror could conclude that his strengths in other areas tip the scale in his favor. Third, Oriental cannot point to his suspension as proof that he was not qualified because he allowed employees to take cash tips. (Docket No. 49 \u00b6 21). Natal denies having instructed so, thus creating a dispute of fact regarding this alleged instruction. (Docket No. 61-1 \u00b6 21). And as explained earlier, Natal does not need to disprove the reason for the adverse action-the suspension-at this stage. Therefore, the Court holds that Natal meets his burden for this part of the\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    3. Treating Age Neutrally\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Court agrees with Oriental that Natal failed to provide evidence showing that Oriental did not treat age neutrally when it suspended Natal and issued a negative job evaluation. As plaintiff, he bears the burden of proof that Oriental did not treat age neutrally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Regarding the suspension, Natal fails to satisfy the burden of proof due to insufficient evidence. Natal does not know if Oriental has reprimanded other managers for the same conduct he allegedly engaged in-authorizing cash tips. This undisputed fact is highly indicative that Natal cannot prove that Oriental did not treat age neutrally when suspending him. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6 27; 61-1 \u00b6 27). Still, an issue remains as to whether the age-based comments during the suspension meeting can prove that Oriental did not treat age neutrally. It is true that \"evidence of age-related comments could support an inference of pretext and discriminatory animus,\" especially when \"some of these comments [are] made by the key decisionmaker and others ... during the decisionmaking process.\"\n   <em>\n    Dominguez-Cruz v. Suttle Caribe, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"917956\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/202/424/#p433\">\n    202 F.3d 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 433, n. 6 (1st Cir. 2000). Nevertheless this inference does not follow where the plaintiff \"fail[s]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   to adduce sufficient evidence that the remarks were both temporally\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   causally related to [the defendant's] decision to discharge him.\"\n   <em>\n    Dunn v. Trustees of Boston Univ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151311\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/761/63/#p75\">\n    761 F.3d 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 75 (1st Cir. 2014) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Melendez v.

While Natal says they called him \"old man,\" he also says that \"[w]hat was discussed [in the meeting] was the topic of the tips.\" (Docket No. 49-1 at 55, 57). This may prove that key decisionmakers made age-related comments during the decision-making process, but he still fails to \"adduce sufficient evidence that the remarks were\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   temporally and causally related\" to their decision to suspend him.\n   <em>\n    Dunn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151311\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/761/63/#p75\">\n    761 F.3d at 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He has not offered sufficient proof to convince a jury that he was suspended\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   he was \"old,\" or even that it weighed in the decisionmaking process. A jury is left to conclude that Oriental did not treat age neutrally because (1) two employees called him old (2) during a meeting where they suspended him. That these two facts co-exist does not prove a causal relation in ADEA discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   As to the negative evaluation, Natal's only proof that Oriental did not take age neutrally is his testimony attributing it to becoming \"old\" in the eyes of his supervisor after the suspension. (Docket No. 49-1 at 98 (\"From September on, I became an 'old' person.\") ). The problem is that Natal offers no facts that would support an inference that his conclusion is correct. As the First Circuit has held, \"a nonmovant cannot rely merely upon conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation.\"\n   <em>\n    Garmon v. Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175415\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/844/307/#p313\">\n    844 F.3d 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 313, 315 (1st Cir. 2016) (\"[O]nly evidence proffered ... contains unsupported, speculative assertions about the way overtime was determined and administered ....

Moreover, \"testimony and affidavits that 'merely reiterate allegations made in the complaint, without providing specific factual information made on the basis of personal knowledge' are insufficient.\"\n   <em>\n    Velazquez-Garcia v. Horizon Lines Of Puerto Rico, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2539806\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/473/11/#p18\">\n    473 F.3d 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 18 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Santiago-Ramos v.

Therefore, given the lack of evidence allowing a jury to conclude that Oriental did not treat age neutrally, the Court holds that Natal cannot establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of ADEA discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    4. Burden-Shifting: Legitimate Business Reasons and Pretext\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Even if the Court concluded that Natal met his burden of proof to show that Oriental did not treat age neutrally, Oriental can prove it had legitimate business reasons to suspend Natal-Oriental believed that Natal authorized employees to take tips against Oriental's ethical code and policies. This legitimate business reason would shift the burden back to Natal to prove that this reason to suspend him was pretextual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   If Natal tried to prove that this reason was pretextual, he would fail again because of insufficient evidence. All he could point to would be temporally proximate stray remarks without any proof of a causal connection, and his denial that he authorized to take tips. But the undisputed facts are that Ortiz took an unauthorized cash tip, Natal was her supervisor, and Oriental reprimanded him for letting it happen. Being called old for the first time during the suspension meeting is not enough to convince a reasonable jury that he was really suspended because of his age and not because of the tip incident, especially when the undisputed facts prove that Oriental had compelling reasons to punish him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket 49-1 at 98 (\"\n   <em>\n    From September on\n   </em>\n   , I became an 'old' person.\") (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    Melendez v.

These are all the facts properly submitted on this matter: Natal worked extra hours on some Saturdays, and admits it was not due to his age. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6 48; 61-1 \u00b6 48). He did not request additional personnel in Old San Juan because he did not need assistance. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6 49; 61-1 \u00b6 49). He never worked as a cashier in Old San Juan. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6 54; 61-1 \u00b6 50). He received a COBRA letter on March 12, 2016, and was told by Carla Molina, the Human Resources Supervisor, that it was an informative communication. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6\u00b6 52-53; 61-1 \u00b6\u00b6 52-53). Moreover, he received a warning for failing to\n   monitor the cash funds in Cata\u00f1o and San Juan, and he has clarified that the amount in San Juan was $55. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6 56; 61-1 \u00b6 56). He has also admitted that he does not know if Oriental took disciplinary action against other managers for the same breach, but Natal subjectively feels that the warning was the result of persecution due to age. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6\u00b6 57-58; 61-1 \u00b6\u00b6 57-58). Despite this pattern of alleged harassment, Natal did not report the allegedly discriminatory remarks made by Santiago to Human Resources or her supervisor. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6 59; 61-1 \u00b6 59). He knows that Oriental has an antidiscrimination policy in place, but he has clarified that he did not report his grievance because the Human Resources Manager was present when the alleged discriminatory remarks were made. (Docket No. 61-1 \u00b6 28). The only fact Natal has disputed is an e-mail from early 2015 where he appears friendly to his supervisors and that according to Oriental disproves his hostile work environment claim. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6 61; 61-1 \u00b6 61). Beyond these facts, which incorporate Natal's qualifications, Natal did not submit any additional relevant facts in a separate section for Oriental to admit, deny, or qualify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Taking all these facts as true, even the alleged comments at the suspension meeting, the Court cannot conclude that Natal suffered from a hostile work environment. None of it arises to the degree of severity and pervasiveness required to establish a hostile work environment claim in the eyes of a reasonable juror-not even the alleged ageist remarks at the suspension meeting or when he requested reasonable accommodation.

It is undisputed that Ortiz was transferred to Cata\u00f1o in March 2015, and Oriental claims that Natal never had to reprimand Ortiz. (Dockets No. 49 \u00b6 78; 61-1 \u00b6 78). Natal qualifies this by saying that \"immediately upon assigning Ortiz,\" he was instructed to issue warnings for everything she did so that Oriental could discharge her because she was sick. (Docket No. 61-1 \u00b6 78). According to Natal, he refused to comply.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206452411\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206452411\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Six months later he was suspended.

The undisputed facts show that Oriental gave Natal a negative evaluation because he failed to complete the second part of his training. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6 30; 61-1 \u00b6 30). This is a legitimate business reason for the negative evaluation, so the burden shifts back to Natal to prove that it was pretextual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <em>\n    5. Pretext\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Since Oriental provided a legitimate business reason, the burden shifts back to Natal to show a genuine issue of material fact on the matter of pretext. \"An employee can establish pretext 'by showing weaknesses, implausibilities, inconsistencies, incoherencies, or contradictions in the employer's proffered legitimate reasons such that a factfinder could infer that the employer did not act for the asserted non-discriminatory reasons.' \"\n   <em>\n    Carreras\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4218361\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/596/25/#p32\">\n    596 F.3d at 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original) (citing\n   <em>\n    Santiago-Ramos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11189985\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/217/46/#p53\">\n    217 F.3d 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 56 (1st Cir. 2000) ). Natal does just that: qualifying Oriental's statement of fact, he clarifies that he failed to complete the training because he was suspended when it happened. (Docket Nos. 49 \u00b6 30; 61-1 \u00b6 30). He also clarified that he tried to take the training upon his return, but his supervisor did not allow him.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11189985\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/217/46/#p53\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This is the type of weakness, inconsistency, and incoherence that establishes pretext.
