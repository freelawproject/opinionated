BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Kaupthing ehf., an Icelandic bank, sold billions of dollars in notes to investors throughout the world. One such investor was Defendant Bricklayers and Trowel Trades International Pension Fund, which owned a series of these notes until Kaupthing bought them back under a repurchase provision. When Kaupthing thereafter went bankrupt, it filed a suit in Iceland to rescind the buy-back and recover the monies expended. The Fund, a resident of the District of Columbia, never appeared overseas to defend itself, and a default judgment resulted. That judgment, however, did not name the Fund as a liable party; instead, the Icelandic court ordered another party-an account owned by the Fund-to pay Kaupthing $422,296.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff has come to this Court to enforce the Icelandic Judgment, suing the Account, the Fund, and the Fund's Board of Trustees. Defendants now move to dismiss, arguing that the Account lacks the capacity to be sued, the Icelandic Judgment does not name the Fund or the Trustees as liable parties, and Defendants, in any event, were not subject to personal jurisdiction in Iceland. Agreeing with all of these contentions, the Court will grant the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court treats the facts set forth in the Complaint as true, as it must at this stage, but also draws much of the background from the Icelandic Judgment itself. Plaintiff is an Icelandic corporation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl., \u00b6 4. In 2007, it initiated a multi-billion-dollar program in which it sold certain securities-namely, the notes at issue in this case-to investors all over the world.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 11, Exh. C (Icelandic Judgment) at 2-3. Although the notes at issue originated with Plaintiff, investors purchased them through a program run by an American clearing house.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4. These notes and their indentures were also to be construed and governed \"entirely in accordance with the law of the State of New York.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Purchase of a note entitled its owner to receive semiannual payments from Plaintiff and to eventually cash out at specified maturity dates.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Plaintiff, however, was empowered by a repurchase provision in the note program's prospectus to buy back outstanding notes and reduce its liability under the program by extinguishing them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2008, Plaintiff exercised this power under the repurchase provision and bought back notes owned by Bricklayers and Trowel Trades International Pension Fund-a District of Columbia resident.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6; Am. Compl., \u00b6 6. The Fund, before the buy-back, held the notes in an account called the Bricklayers and Trowel Trades International Pension Fund Liquidation Portfolio (Account).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Icelandic Judgment at 7. Management of the Account was entrusted to the Western Asset Management Company-the Fund's agent-but the Fund maintained ultimate control over the Account and the notes contained therein.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Emails exchanged between Plaintiff and WAMC culminated in a \"single transaction\" whereby Plaintiff transferred payment to the Account, and, in return, its outstanding liabilities under the note program were reduced by the value of the interest purchased.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Kaupthing went bankrupt shortly thereafter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Its bankruptcy entitled it, under Icelandic law, to rescind its buy-back of the Fund's notes and to recover the sum paid.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8. Plaintiff filed a lawsuit in Iceland in June 2012 to pursue that end.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8; Am. Comp., \u00b6 10. The complaint named WAMC as \"primary defendant,\" the Account as \"alternative defendant,\" and the Fund as \"defendant of last resort.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl., \u00b6 10. Only WAMC, however, appeared in Icelandic court to defend itself.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   That court ultimately declined to impose liability on WMAC because it \"was involved in the transaction only as an intermediary.\" Icelandic Judgment at 13, 16; Am. Compl., \u00b6 14. Next setting its sights on the Account, the Court held that it was \"a legal person capable of having legal rights\" and was thus able to \"be the defendant in a lawsuit.\" Icelandic Judgment at 15. The court also identified the Account as the party that had been \"the beneficial owner\" of the \"note interest\" bought back by Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court, accordingly, entered a default judgment ordering the Account to pay Plaintiff $422,296.03 plus interest.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16; Am. Compl., \u00b6 14. The Fund, conversely, was not mentioned in the court's order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Icelandic Judgment at 16 (omitting Fund, as defendant of last resort, from \"ADJUDICATION\" section).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff then filed this diversity action to enforce the Icelandic Judgment under the District of Columbia's Uniform Foreign-Country Money Judgments Recognition Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In seeking dismissal here, Defendants produce a congeries of arguments. The Court will first address the threshold question of the Account's capacity to be sued. It will then separately turn to the enforcement and jurisdictional requirements of the D.C. Uniform Foreign-Country Money Judgments Recognition Act. As its analysis of these issues resolves the Motion, the Court does not reach Defendants' contention regarding service of process in this suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Capacity of Account\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendants' opening position is that the Account has no legal capacity here. In countering this challenge, Plaintiff\n   first maintains that a party may not raise such an issue on a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 11-12. While the relevant rule is silent on the issue,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(a)(2), there is ample case law contrary to Kaupthing's position.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Smartdoor Holdings, Inc. v.

The Fund not only benefited from the assets, but it also \"owned\" them, and it asserted its control by moving the assets around in 2008, as well as by delegating authority to WAMC through various \"investment management\n   agreement[s].\" Icelandic Judgment at 7. As in\n   <em>\n    St. Francis\n   </em>\n   , the Fund's exertion of control over the Account limited the latter's financial independence. Indeed, the degree of control here went far beyond that exercised by the Archdiocese-the Account was under\n   <em>\n    complete\n   </em>\n   control and had\n   <em>\n    no assets\n   </em>\n   of its own. As a result, a judgment obtained against the Account, like one against a corporate division, could not be satisfied without securing an additional judgment imposing liability on the Account's owner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The application of this principle does not leave an injured party with nowhere to turn, as the Account's lack of capacity has no bearing on the liability of its owner. Rather, holding that a bank account lacks the capacity to be sued directs injured parties towards judgments that, if won, could actually be satisfied. The Court, accordingly, finds that a bank account under the circumstances here lacks the capacity to be sued and that the Account must be dismissed from the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Enforcement Against Fund and Trustees\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Motion next argues that Plaintiff cannot enforce the judgment against the remaining Defendants-\n   <em>\n    viz.\n   </em>\n   , the Fund and the Trustees-because they are not parties to such judgment.

It then held that the U.K. judgment was unenforceable against the parent company because (1) the parent company was not named as a liable party in the U.K. judgment; (2) the U.K. court recognized that the parent and subsidiary companies were distinct entities; and (3) extending liability to the parent company would creep into the \"underlying merits\" of the foreign action, impermissibly extending its scope.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869435\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/556/489/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869435\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/556/489/\">\n    at 494-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   All three of these justifications are present in this case, too. First, the Icelandic Judgment imposed no liability on the Fund or the Trustees and ordered only the Account to pay Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Icelandic Judgment at 16-17. Second, the Icelandic court viewed the Account and the Fund as distinct entities, the former of which it held was a \"legal person capable of having legal rights\" and of being a \"defendant in a lawsuit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SerVaas Inc. v.

Finally, as a result of this recognized distinction, enforcing the judgment against the Fund would delve into the underlying merits of the Icelandic Judgment and extend the scope of that court's ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Plaintiff does not dispute that\n   <em>\n    Novae\n   </em>\n   , although clearly not binding precedent, should guide the Court's analysis. Instead, it argues that refusing to extend liability to the Fund would sanction the closing of an account \"as a mechanism to frustrate potential creditors.\" Opp. at 12-13 (citing D.C.'s fraudulent-transfer laws). This argument puts the cart before the horse. Prohibitions on fraudulent transfers exist to prevent a party that has already been found liable from hiding its assets and becoming judgment proof. In such a scenario, however, the necessary prerequisite is that the evading party has a judgment against it. As discussed above, there is no judgment against the Fund. What Plaintiff asks the Court to do is to create one. Refusing to do so does not sanction fraud, but it does adhere to the limitations imposed by the D.C. UFMJRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   As that Act may only be used to enforce a judgment \"between the parties\" actually named in it, the Icelandic Judgment cannot be enforced against the Fund or the Trustees.
