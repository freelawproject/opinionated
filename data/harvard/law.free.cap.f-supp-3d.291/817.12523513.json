For the reasons stated below, the motions are\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs operate a youth sports publication and hold a registered trademark for their THE SPORTING TIMES mark (\"Mark\"). (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 13-15, DN 1). The claims in this case relate to Defendants' use of the Mark in conjunction with the release of the movie\n   <em>\n    Spaceman\n   </em>\n   in August 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-31). The film is a\n   biopic of professional baseball pitcher Bill \"Spaceman\" Lee. (Defs.' Mem. 2). Early in the film, a montage of news stories \"provides the audience with an overview of Lee's career and a sense of his quirky persona.\" (Defs.' Mem. 2). The montage originally included \"a nine-second shot of the cover of a fictional magazine entitled\n   <em>\n    The Sporting Times\n   </em>\n   , dated July 1976, with the headline 'Boston's Bill \"Spaceman\" Lee; In an Orbit All His Own' over a photo of Josh Duhamel, the actor who played Lee, in his pitching stance ....\" (Defs.' Mem. 2; Compl. \u00b6 22). Approximately two seconds of the same shot was also included in the original movie trailer, released in the summer of 2016. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 20-21; Defs.' Mem. 3). Defendants note that the image shown is not an actual copy of Plaintiffs' publication, which did not exist until 2004 and whose Mark was not protected by trademark until its registration in 2008. (Defs.' Mem. 3; Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 13-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 19, 2016, Plaintiffs sent a letter to Orion Pictures and its parent company, MGM, objecting to the film's use of their Mark. (Compl. \u00b6 23; Compl. Ex. B, DN 1-2; Defs.' Mem. 3). According to Defendants, they \"promptly removed\" the Mark from the film and trailer, but Plaintiffs contend the \"infringing materials remain publicly available.\" (Defs.' Mem. 3; Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 25-26). Plaintiffs claim the movie \"venerates [Lee's] enthusiastic addictions to drugs and alcohol\" and strenuously object to the use of their Mark, as viewers might believe their \"youth publication promotes and sponsors druggy middle-aged athletes ....\" (Compl. \u00b6 19; Pls.' Resp. Defs.' Mot. Dismiss 2, DN 21 [hereinafter Pls.' Resp.] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 24, 2017, Plaintiffs filed the present suit alleging Defendants' actions constitute trademark infringement, trademark dilution, false designation of origin, passing off, and commercial disparagement under the Lanham Act. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 32-34, 38-40). Plaintiffs also bring associated state law claims for false and misleading advertising, unauthorized commercial use, and commercial disparagement. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 35-40). Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages in excess of $400,000.00, punitive damages in excess of $1,000,000.00, as well as various forms of equitable relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 41-46).

In\n   <em>\n    Fortres Grand\n   </em>\n   , the court found that the defendant satisfied this element, as its use of the plaintiff's mark had artistic reference to the film and websites at issue.

Thus, the face of the\n   Complaint describes the artistic connection between their Mark and the story told by Defendants' film.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendants argue that the use of the title\n   <em>\n    The Sporting Times\n   </em>\n   for a \"fictitious sports-themed publication in the film unquestionably exceeds the above-zero artistic relevance threshold.\" (Defs.'

The movie portrays the story of \"Spaceman\" Lee and Plaintiffs' Mark is depicted above a photograph on the mocked-up cover of a publication depicting Lee in his wind-up while wearing a spacesuit. The artistic relevance of the Mark to the plot of the film is beyond cavil.

In a similar vein in the case\n    <em>\n     sub judice\n    </em>\n    , Plaintiffs argue that in addition to harm merely by the act of Defendants' alleged infringement, Plaintiffs are further harmed because \"The Sporting Times is negatively portrayed as a publication that venerates and promotes over-the-hill athletes with serious addiction problems-the sort of sensationalist story that it would by all means avoid as it is the antithesis of the clean cut girl or boy next door image it actively promotes.\" (Compl. \u00b6 28).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Plaintiffs inquire why Defendants did not \"simply pay the publication that ran the photo originally to use their mark instead of ours?\" (Pls.'
