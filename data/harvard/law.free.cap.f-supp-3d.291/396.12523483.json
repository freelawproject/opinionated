After prosecutors dismissed the charges, Plaintiff brought claims against Sergeant Fredy Cruz and Officers Alejandro Rivas, Felix Acosta, Danny Guzman, and Brendan Regan (the \"Officers\") of the New York City Police Department (\"NYPD\"), as well as the City of New York (collectively, \"Defendants\"), under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for false arrest, malicious prosecution, fabrication of evidence and denial of a fair trial, failure to intervene, and municipal liability.

Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Events of May 9, 2013\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On May 9, 2013, Defendants Felix Acosta and Alejandro Rivas-then NYPD officers assigned to the 33rd Precinct-were part of a Street Narcotics Enforcement Unit (\"SNEU\") team. (Pl. 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 1). By way of background, SNEU teams operate in two groups: an \"observation team\" and a \"catch team.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 33-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; Cruz Dep. 24:9-25:15). The observation team consists of at least two officers who observe an area from a location, typically the roof of a building, while the catch team is assigned to a car on the street. (Cruz Dep. 24:9-26:24). If the observation team sees a narcotics transaction, they will radio the catch team and provide a physical description of the individuals involved and their \"direction of flight.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). At that point, the catch team will attempt to locate and apprehend the individuals described. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Acosta and Rivas were part of the observation team on May 9, 2013, and were working from an observation post to gain an aerial view of the area surrounding St. Nicholas Avenue between 162nd and 163rd Streets. (Pl. 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 2). As an initial matter, Plaintiff impugns Acosta's and Rivas's ability to observe events on the street from their perch atop a 15-story building several blocks away in a \"busy urban area\" near a school and a subway station and while using equipment of disputed utility. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2). But more than that, Plaintiff disputes the entirety of Defendants' account of the events of May 9, 2013. Defendants claim that Acosta \"observed what appeared to be a hand-to-hand narcotics transaction\" involving several individuals, one of whom he subsequently identified as Plaintiff. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 3, 37). Plaintiff contests whether it was Acosta or Rivas who observed this alleged narcotics transaction, and indeed he disputes whether Rivas was even present at the observation post at the time of the alleged transaction. (Pl. 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at \u00b6 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Plaintiff disputes the entirety of Defendants' account of what happened on May 9 and why they connected Plaintiff to that event.\") ). Instead, Plaintiff claims that Defendants' account of the events of May 9, 2013, is a \"fabrication developed by Defendants on May 23[, 2013] in an effort to correct Plaintiff's false arrest[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   While Plaintiff denies Defendants' account of the May 9, 2013 events, that account is presented here for context. Defendants claim that Acosta, working from his observation post, identified a buyer, a seller, and a third man who interacted with both the buyer and the seller as an intermediary. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, 8-11). \"The third man caught [ ] Acosta's attention, in part, because he was standing in the area bouncing a tennis ball,\" which Acosta knew to be a means of surreptitiously transferring narcotics. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 6-7). Once the alleged sale concluded, Acosta alerted the catch team to what he saw and gave them a description of the buyer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13). The catch team apprehended that buyer and a second buyer, who was alleged to have engaged in a transaction with the same seller that day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 14-15). One alleged buyer was an individual with the initials B.P.; the other alleged buyer was an individual with the initials E.J.R. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 16-17). The seller and the intermediary, however, were not apprehended. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 18-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   According to NYPD documents, B.P. was arrested at 4:25 p.m., on May 9, 2013, and was charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree. (Lozar Decl., Ex. 19, 21). Defendant Officer Danny Guzman is listed as the arresting officer; B.P.'s Arrest ID is M13641930 and his arrest is listed as connected to Complaint Number 2013-033-01874. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. 19). The New York County District Attorney's Office (\"DANY\") charged B.P. with a misdemeanor offense of cocaine possession; he was given a desk appearance ticket, pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to time served. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. 20-22). B.P.'s DANY Datasheet references an \"unapprehended seller,\" but does not reference an intermediary or even a third individual involved in the transaction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   E.J.R. was arrested at 4:40 p.m., on May 9, 2013, and was also charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance in the seventh degree. (Lozar Decl., Ex. 16). Officer Rivas is listed as the arresting officer; E.J.R.'s Arrest ID is M13641909 and his arrest is listed as connected to Complaint Number 2013-033-01874. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The DANY charged E.J.R. with a misdemeanor offense of cocaine possession and he was given an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. 18). E.J.R.'s DANY Datasheet states: \"Dealer being investigated by POs, not arrested today.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Datasheet makes no mention of an intermediary or third person involved in the sale and only references exchanges between E.J.R. and the dealer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The parties agree that on May 9, 2013, Rivas generated an NYPD Omniform System Complaint (\"OSC\") numbered 2013-033-01874. (Pl. 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 23; Lozar Decl., Ex. 15). This is the complaint number referenced in B.P.'s and E.J.R.'s arrest papers. (Lozar Decl., Ex. 16, 19). The OSC lists the location as \"Front of 1045 Saint Nicholas Avenue,\" the time of occurrence as May 9, 2013, at 4:40 p.m., and the statement that \"at [time and place of occurrence] deft. was observed in possession of alleged cocaine at above location.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. 15). But the parties disagree about the impetus for the OSC and its connection, if any, to Plaintiff. Defendant contends that the OSC was created \"in connection with the alleged activities of the two apprehended buyers and the un-apprehended third man\"-whom they now identify as Plaintiff-and was \"left 'open' because the third man had not been apprehended.\" (Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 24-25).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff disputes the entirety of the alleged May 9, 2013 events, and, by extension, whether the OSC was left open that day. (Pl. 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 24-25). Plaintiff contends that because the offense on the OSC is criminal possession of a controlled substance and the buyers (possessors) of the alleged narcotics had been arrested and charged, the offense in question had been addressed and there were no individuals remaining at large. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Events of May 23, 2013\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On May 23, 2013, Defendants Acosta and Rivas were again assigned to a SNEU observation team, and Defendants Fredy Cruz, Danny Guzman, and Brendan Regan were assigned to the catch team. (Pl. 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 30, 33-34). Again, the parties dispute what happened: Defendants contend that Acosta and Rivas were positioned atop a building, while \"equipped with binoculars,\" from which they observed \"two men walking toward 2040 Amsterdam Avenue.\" (Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 32, 36). Acosta radioed down to the catch team that he recognized one of the men as the individual who had bounced a tennis ball during a previous hand-to-hand narcotics transaction and that there was an open complaint for that individual's arrest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 38-40). Cruz confirmed the description with Acosta, and the catch team proceeded to apprehend the two men at 2040 Amsterdam Avenue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 42-46). Cruz and Guzman testified during their respective depositions that they had been informed that the observation team believed that one of the two men was a participant in a May 9, 2013 narcotics transaction that was the subject of an open complaint. (Cruz Dep. 46:2-15 (\"Officer Acosta went over the radio and indicated that he[ was] observing an individual that he observed a couple of days ago involving a hand-to-hand as a seller ... [who] was the guy bouncing the ball.\"); Guzman Dep. 26:19-27:3 (\"[The observation team explained t]hat there was an open Complaint for [Plaintiff's] arrest for the sale of narcotics.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   With particular respect to the events of May 23, 2013, Defendants emphasize that Cruz was the only officer who interacted with Plaintiff, and that Regan and Guzman interacted with the other individual, a man with the initials J.R. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 44, 61-62; Regan Dep. 35:7-12; Guzman Dep. 31:5-11). According to NYPD records, J.R. was arrested for criminal possession of marijuana in the fifth degree based on marijuana \"recovered from [J.R.'s] crotch area.\" (Lozar Decl., Ex. 25-26). Guzman was the arresting officer for J.R.; J.R.'s arrest is not listed as being associated with any others or with any open complaint number. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. 25). For its part, Plaintiff's arrest report states that he was arrested\n   for criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree based on the allegation that he was observed \"exchanging cocaine for U.S. currency from an apprehended buyer\" on May 9, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. 27). Plaintiff's Arrest ID is M13646592 and his arrest is logged as connected to OSC 2013-033-01874-the number of the OSC generated on May 9, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Ex. 15). There are two arrests listed as associated with Plaintiff's: Arrest ID M13641909 and Arrest ID M13641930; these are the arrest numbers, respectively, for alleged buyers E.J.R. and B.P., who were apprehended on May 9, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. 16, 19, 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiff denies Defendants' account of the events on May 23, 2013, and contends that Plaintiff was \"falsely arrested ... for being in JR's vicinity when JR committed a marijuana offense.\" (Pl. 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 36). As partial support, Plaintiff cites certain paperwork generated by the officers upon arrival at the 33rd Precinct. Cruz acknowledged that he recorded Plaintiff's and J.R.'s arrests in a command log book. (Lozar Decl., Ex. 23). The entry for J.R. states that Guzman was the arresting officer and that J.R. was charged with \"CSM,\" or criminal sale of marijuana, and notes that the arrest \"conforms with IO 49-2011,\" an NYPD document that relates to charges for marijuana offenses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Cruz Dep. 67:16-68:9). Plaintiff's arrest entry states that Acosta was the arresting officer and that he, too, was charged with CSM and that his arrest also \"conforms [with] IO 49-2011.\" (Lozar Decl., Ex. 23).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Plaintiff's Criminal Charges and Their Dismissal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Ultimately, the DANY charged Plaintiff with criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree, in violation of New York Penal Law \u00a7 220.39(1). (Lozar Decl., Ex. 30). The felony complaint alleges that \"[o]n or about May 9, 2013 at about 4:21 P.M., in front of 1045 Saint Nicholas Avenue ... the defendant knowingly and unlawfully sold a narcotic drug.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Acosta signed the complaint as deponent, averring in part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   I am informed by Police Officer Alejandro Rivas, shield # 7319 of th[e] 33rd Precinct, that defendant exchanged a quantity of cocaine for United States currency from another apprehended individual. I am further informed by Sergeant Fredy Cruz, shield # 887 of the 33rd Precinct, that he recovered said quantity of cocaine from said other apprehended individual.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The DANY Datasheet in Plaintiff's file indicates that the officers observed Plaintiff engage in a narcotics transaction on May 9, 2013, and apprehended Plaintiff in connection with this offense on May 23, 2013. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On May 24, 2013, Plaintiff was arraigned and released on his own recognizance. (Lozar Decl., Ex. 31; Pl. 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 56). His case was adjourned to September 9, 2013. (Lozar Decl., Ex. 31; Pl. 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 57). On June 14, 2013, the DANY made a motion to dismiss the charges. (Pl. 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 58). Plaintiff states that he \"was not notified of the dismissal; and did not learn about the dismissal until he appeared for\n   his next court date on September 9, 2013.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Neither the DANY file nor the New York County Criminal Court file contains any information about why the charges against Plaintiff were dismissed. The June 14, 2013 Record of Court Action bears a stamp that reads \"DISMISSED MOTION A.D.A.\" with no further information. (Lozar Decl., Ex. 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff initiated this action on February 1, 2016, and amended his pleadings on May 4, 2016. (Dkt. # 1, 15). Following an unsuccessful mediation, discovery commenced on October 11, 2016, and concluded on May 10, 2017. (Dkt. # 40, 71). Defendants moved for partial summary judgment on July 3, 2017. (Dkt. # 74-77). On August 5, 2017, Plaintiff filed his opposition to Defendants' motion and a letter dismissing certain claims, which letter is discussed in more detail below. (Dkt. # 78-81). This motion became fully briefed when Defendants submitted a letter in lieu of a reply brief on August 23, 2017. (Dkt. # 88).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff's First Amended Complaint raises the following claims against all Defendants: (i)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; (ii) false arrest; (iii) malicious prosecution; (iv) fabrication of evidence; (v) denial of a fair trial; (vi) failure to intervene; and (vii) municipal liability for the City under\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Department of Social Services\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    436 U.S. 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    56 L.Ed.2d 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978). Following the filing of Defendants' motion for partial summary judgment, Plaintiff dismissed his freestanding \u00a7 1983 claim in its entirety, and dismissed all claims against the Doe Defendants. (Dkt. # 90). Plaintiff also dismissed his claims for malicious prosecution, fabrication of evidence, and denial of a fair trial against Sergeant Cruz and Officers Guzman and Regan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As noted, Defendants' motion is one for partial summary judgment. In particular, Defendants have not moved for summary judgment as to Plaintiff's false arrest claim against Officers Acosta and Rivas, and thus the Court will not address the viability of this claim against them in this Opinion. The Court first will address Defendants' motion for summary judgment as to each claim against the affected Officers, and second will address Defendants' motion as to Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim against the City for a deprivation of his constitutional rights pursuant to a municipal policy or custom and for a systematic failure to train police officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The record indicates that Regan did not interact with Plaintiff; instead, Regan stopped, searched, and arrested J.R., the individual who was with Plaintiff at 2040 Amsterdam Avenue. (Lozar Decl., Ex. 12 (Regan Memo Book) (\"Deft. [J.R.; criminal possession of marijuana]. I recovered 31 [clear plastic bags] of marijuana from his waist area in blk plastic bag.

But he corroborates these claims with evidence of facts that are not in dispute, namely, that Regan was part of the SNEU team on patrol that day and that the two arrests happened in close proximity to one another. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).

By Defendants' telling, on May 23, 2013, the SNEU catch team, including Cruz and Guzman, was informed by the SNEU observation team that there were two men walking south on St. Nicholas Avenue, one of whom (Plaintiff) was wanted in connection with an open complaint for a recent drug transaction. (Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 36-41). Defendants state that Cruz and Guzman arrested Plaintiff based on this information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff disputes that he was the person seen by the observation team on May 9, 2013, or that the complaint for the May 9, 2013 transaction was open as of May 23, 2013. (Pl. 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 25, 36-41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The relevant question here is not whether Plaintiff was, in fact, involved in the alleged May 9, 2013 transaction or whether a complaint was actually open for his arrest, but, rather, whether Plaintiff has identified a genuine dispute of fact as to whether Cruz and Guzman were told these things and consequently arrested Plaintiff based on them. Defendants correctly argue that police officers are entitled to rely on information they receive from fellow officers to effect a lawful arrest. (Def. Br. 12 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Colon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11095144\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/250/130/#p135\">\n    250 F.3d 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 135 (2d Cir. 2001) ) ).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Colon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11095144\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/250/130/#p135\">\n    250 F.3d at 135\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Under the collective or imputed knowledge doctrine, an arrest or search is permissible where the actual arresting or searching officer lacks the specific information to form the basis for probable cause ... but sufficient information to justify the arrest ... was known by other law enforcement officials initiating or involved with the investigation.\"). Cruz and Guzman both testified at their depositions that the observation team told them that the individual later identified as Plaintiff was wanted in connection with an earlier drug sale. (Cruz Dep. 46:2-5 (\"Officer Acosta went over the radio and indicated that he's observing an individual that he observed a couple of days ago involving a hand-to-hand as a seller.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 46:9-49:18; Guzman Dep. 27:2-3 (\"[The observation team said that] there was an open Complaint for Mr. Ernesto's arrest for the sale of narcotics.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the Officers concocted this story as a post-hoc justification for falsely arresting Plaintiff simply because he was walking with J.R., an individual who Plaintiff acknowledges was found to be in possession of marijuana. (Pl. 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 36). To support his theory, Plaintiff cites to four pieces of evidence: (i) Cruz's testimony before the Civilian Complaint Review Board (\"CCRB\") regarding the information relayed by the catch team on May 23, 2013; (ii) Plaintiff's prisoner pedigree card, which lists the offense of arrest as \"CSM,\" or criminal sale of marijuana; (iii) the 33rd Precinct command log, which contains a similar notation; and (iv) Cruz's and Regan's testimony before the CCRB regarding the arrest of the individual known as J.R. Considered individually or in tandem, these four pieces of evidence are insufficient to raise a triable dispute of fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Plaintiff first claims that \"Cruz testified to [Civilian Complaint Review Board (\"CCRB\") ] that Acosta radioed to [Cruz, Guzman, and Regan] that he had observed JR involved in a drug transaction.\" (Pl. 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 36). In point of fact, the statement is correct. (Lozar Decl., Ex. 10 at 6:25-7:9, 11:20-14:3). However, it wholly ignores the subsequent pages of testimony, in which Cruz states that after Acosta initially saw J.R. engage in a hand-to-hand on May 23, 2013, Acosta subsequently radioed to the catch team that the alleged buyer from the hand-to-hand (J.R.) was now walking with an individual who was the subject of an open complaint for a prior drug transaction (Plaintiff). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7:10-21:17). The Court similarly disposes of Plaintiff's claim that \"Cruz and Regan testified at CCRB that Acosta did not say that Plaintiff was involved in the alleged JR incident.\" (Pl. 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 36). This statement is also correct, but it has no bearing on whether Acosta\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   told the catch team that he recognized Plaintiff has having been involved in an earlier incident that was the subject of an open complaint, as Cruz and Guzman testified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   That leaves Plaintiff's prisoner pedigree card and the precinct command log. Both are records of Plaintiff's arrest and both contain entries that list \"CSM\" (criminal sale of marijuana) as the crime of arrest. The pedigree card shows \"Guzman\" on the line for \"Arresting Officer,\" but this is crossed out and replaced with \"Acosta\"; and it shows \"C.S.M.\" on the line for \"Primary Charge,\" but this is crossed out and replaced with \"CSCS (OPEN 61).\" (Lozar Decl., Ex. 24). The precinct command log entry for May 23, 2013, lists Plaintiff's name, \"Acosta\" as the arresting officer, and \"CSM\" as the charge. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. 23). Cruz testified at his deposition that he fills out the command log entries from the pedigree cards and that this command log entry is wrong and should say \"criminal sale of controlled substance.\" (Cruz Dep. 69:15-72:24). Neither Acosta nor Guzman was asked about the pedigree card during their respective depositions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   As noted, the relevant inquiry here is whether there is a genuine dispute that Cruz and Guzman were told to apprehend Plaintiff because he was wanted in connection with a prior drug sale. The pedigree card and command log records do conflict with the later arrest records that show Plaintiff was arrested and charged with criminal sale of a controlled substance. But they do little, if anything, to show the existence of a genuine dispute as to what Cruz and Guzman were told in the radio transmission from the observation team. Cruz and Guzman both testified that they were told by the observation team that Plaintiff was involved in a prior narcotics transaction. Plaintiff relies solely on his deposition for his denial that he was involved in the May 9, 2013 narcotics transaction. (Pl. Dep. 105:18-106:7, 107:23-108:8). Even crediting that testimony, it\n   does not detract from what Cruz and Guzman consistently testified they were told over the radio. For this reason, the Court finds no genuine dispute that Cruz and Guzman were instructed by the observation team to apprehend Plaintiff based on an open complaint for his arrest. Thus, the Court finds no genuine dispute that Cruz and Guzman acted with probable cause to effect a lawful arrest-or, at the very least, that they acted with arguable probable cause sufficient to warrant a finding of qualified immunity. Summary judgment is therefore granted as to these two Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Malicious Prosecution\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

The City Criminal Court's disposition sheet offers no further information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Without any indication of why prosecutors dismissed Plaintiff's case, the Court cannot resolve the issue of favorable termination in either side's favor. This question must be put to a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , even were the Court to find that Plaintiff has made out all the elements of a malicious prosecution claim, the Court cannot determine on summary judgment whether Acosta can marshal a probable cause defense. There remains a triable issue of fact as to whether Acosta had probable cause to order Plaintiff's arrest by the catch team. The parties have a genuine dispute as to who, if anyone, identified Plaintiff on May 9, 2013; whether that person had the physical ability to identify accurately Plaintiff from their observation post atop a 15-story building, and whether they accurately identified Plaintiff again on May 23, 2013. (Pl. 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 1-13, 26, 30-40). And without documentary evidence that memorializes what Acosta saw on May 9, 2013, the probable cause question rests largely on a resolution of the conflict between the Officers' and Plaintiff's testimony. The Court will leave for the jury to decide whose testimony should be believed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   And given the Court's inability to resolve as a matter of law the parties' disputes as to Acosta's\n   <em>\n    conduct\n   </em>\n   , it cannot find as a matter of law that Acosta is entitled to a qualified immunity defense. On this record, a reasonable jury could credit Plaintiff's telling of the May 2013 events\n   and find that Acosta acted unreasonably. In sum, the Court cannot find, as a matter of law, that Acosta initiated criminal proceedings against Plaintiff with malice but, likewise, cannot find that he is free from liability.\n   <em>\n    Minott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%201386583\">\n    2014 WL 1386583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

Plaintiff's Claims of Deficient SNEU Training and Guidance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   In addition to his claims against the individual Officers, Plaintiff also advances a\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim against the City for \"failure to train\" and \"failure to supervise.\" In support of this claim, Plaintiff alleges that the NYPD failed to train officers on SNEU teams and did not advise them of new SNEU guidance that was issued in 2012 following the highly-publicized death\n   of Ramarley Graham. (Pl. 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 73-84). During their depositions, Plaintiff asked Defendants about their SNEU training; he now contends that Acosta, Guzman, Regan, and Rivas either did not recall their training or were unfamiliar with the SNEU manual. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 68-94).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Acosta testified that he received SNEU training sometime between 2010 and 2012, that it spanned several \"days,\" and that he was trained to \"[i]dentify different narcotics\" and conduct chemical tests. (Acosta Dep. 14:12-16:23). Acosta was not aware of the existence of a SNEU manual. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 142:22-25). Guzman similarly testified that he learned how to identify narcotics, including the packaging of different drugs, and how to interpret the behavior of individuals involved in street sales of narcotics. (Guzman Dep. 15:3-19:6). He believes he received SNEU training between 2004 and 2008. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19:2-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Regan testified that he received SNEU training but could not recall when. (Regan Dep. 13:19-25). He did recall that his SNEU training focused on how to \"identify different packages of drugs\" and conduct field tests, but testified that he had never seen a SNEU manual. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13:16-14:12; 15:18-17:21). Rivas was also unable to recall seeing a SNEU manual but did recall that he had received SNEU training. (Rivas Dep. 60:12-24). Finally, Cruz testified that he recalled his SNEU training, even though it was a \"while ago,\" and that it involved \"a lot of lectures in regards to narcotics operations, and also law, and identifying narcotics, the proper way of vouchering narcotics, [and] identifying ... narcotics locations.\" (Cruz Dep. 15:25-16:7). He remembered receiving \"written material ... like a manual guide.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16:8-19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Plaintiff makes much of the fact that the City was unable to locate and produce a copy of the SNEU manual that was in effect in May 2013. (Pl. 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 79). He declaims the City's inability to produce copies of the SNEU Daily Activity Worksheet and SNEU Observation Reports for May 9 and 23, 2013-or even exemplars of these forms-even though such paperwork is required by the NYPD SNEU manual. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 85-91). Somewhat relatedly, Plaintiff observes that the SNEU manual only permitted overtime work \"as operations required,\" and that supervisors were ordered to \"scrutinize\" overtime requests and \"investigate the circumstance present when arrests are routinely made late in the tour.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 95). Reviewing the time entries in Cruz's, Guzman's, and Acosta's memo books, Plaintiff alleges that these three officers worked overtime on May 9, 2013, after arresting eight individuals in the last two hours of their tour.

Summary Judgment Is Granted as to Plaintiff's\n    <em>\n     Monell\n    </em>\n    Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Plaintiff first alleges that his arrest was effectuated pursuant to a City and NYPD policy of:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   [A]rresting innocent persons in order to meet \"productivity goals,\" or arrest quotas; arresting individuals for professional advancement, overtime compensation, and/or other objectives outside the ends of justice; and/or manufacturing false evidence against individuals in an individual effort and also in a conspiracy to justify their abuse of authority in falsely\n   arresting, unlawfully stopping and maliciously prosecuting those individuals.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   (Am. Compl. \u00b6 80). In support of this claim, Plaintiff proffers evidence that the Officers had a \"busy day\" on May 9, 2013, and arrested a number of individuals toward the end of their tour, causing them to work past their scheduled end time. (Pl. 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 97-98). The Court agrees with Defendants that there is \"no evidence that the officers or precinct involved in [Plaintiff's] arrest were subject to an alleged quota or productivity goal system.\" (Def. Br. 7). There is similarly no evidence in the record that the Officers structured their schedules to order to maximize the possibility of overtime compensation, or rushed end-of-tour arrests in a manner that increased the possibility of mistaken arrests. There is, in consequence, no basis for a reasonable juror to find for Plaintiff on a policy-based\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim, and summary judgment is granted in favor of the City.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Alternatively, Plaintiff advances a failure to train theory of municipal liability. As detailed above, Plaintiff's counsel asked each of the Officers during their depositions about their training on SNEU procedures. None of the Officers recalled exactly when he received SNEU training, though they all confirmed that they had attended SNEU training and recalled, generally, the subjects covered. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Acosta Dep. 14:12-16:23; Guzman Dep. 15:3-19:6; Regan Dep. 13:16-14:12; 15:18-17:21; Rivas Dep. 60:12-24; Cruz Dep. 15:25-16:19). Acosta, Guzman, and Rivas also confirmed that they had received periodic training on their patrol duties throughout their career at the NYPD. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Acosta Dep. 9:22-10:5; Guzman Dep. 14:17-24; Rivas Dep. 104:23-105:9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   In opposing Defendants' motion, Plaintiff invokes the highly-publicized killing of Ramarley Graham, an incident that he claims evidences a pattern of faulty identifications and misperceptions by police officers; Plaintiff predicates a\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim on allegations that the Officers were not trained on a SNEU Interim Order that was issued by the NYPD shortly after Graham's tragic death. (Pl. Opp. 21-24). In other words, Plaintiff argues-and predicates his\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim in part on the argument-that even though the NYPD issued new guidance following the Graham incident, \"the City never took appropriate action to implement it\" as evidenced by,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the Officers' \"near-total ignorance of the mandatory SNEU recordkeeping protocols[.]\" (Pl. Opp. 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   For example, Plaintiff notes that Defendants could not produce any SNEU Observation Reports for May 9, 2013, or May 23, 2013. (Pl. Opp. 24). Plaintiff explains that SNEU Observation Reports must be filled out \"for each transaction (buyer/seller) that occurs on the set\" and must contain \"facts/details re: times, locations, observations and more in their memo books.\" (Pl. 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 87 (internal quotation marks omitted) ). Plaintiff also faults the Officers (and thus the City) for allegedly incomplete descriptions in their memo books. The memo books indicate that the Officers routinely recorded the times and locations of alleged narcotics transactions, as well as descriptions of the individuals involved or the specific circumstances of the transaction, but were neither perfectly consistent nor perfectly complete in all cases. (Lozar\n   Decl., Ex. 11-15). For example, Guzman-who was the officer of record for B.P., one of the alleged buyers in the May 9, 2013 transaction-recorded details of this transaction in his memo book. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. 13). Guzman's entry indicates that Rivas observed a narcotics transaction on St. Nicholas Avenue between 162nd and 163rd Streets; Cruz recovered narcotics from the buyer at the scene and again at the precinct. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The memo book does not contain a description of the seller or the intermediary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   In point of fact, none of the Officers' May 9, 2013 memo book entries contains a description of an individual who matches Plaintiff's physical characteristics. But the Officers' deviation from their obligation to record details about all participants in a transaction is not enough to establish that the City acted with deliberate indifference to the risk that police officers would misidentify the individuals they pursue.\n   <em>\n    Jenkins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3782389\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/478/76/#p88\">\n    478 F.3d at 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A training program is not inadequate merely because a few of its graduates deviate from what they were taught.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   To be sure, a reasonable juror could conclude that the Officers' vague memories of their SNEU training suggest that the training could be improved or offered more often. But the record before the Court does not establish that Plaintiff was falsely arrested or maliciously prosecuted\n   <em>\n    because of\n   </em>\n   deliberate indifference on the part of the City to the risk of faulty identifications. Without enough evidence to support a causal link between the NYPD's training program and the deprivations of Plaintiff's rights, a reasonable juror could not find for Plaintiff on his\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim. Accordingly, summary judgment is granted in favor of Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' motion for summary judgment is GRANTED on Plaintiff's false arrest claim against Sergeant Cruz and Officers Guzman and Regan; GRANTED on Plaintiff's malicious prosecution claim against Officer Rivas; DENIED on Plaintiff's malicious prosecution claim against Officer Acosta; GRANTED on Plaintiff's claims for fabrication of evidence and denial of fair trial against Officer Rivas; DENIED on Plaintiff's claims for fabrication of evidence and denial of a fair trial against Officer Acosta; and GRANTED on Plaintiff's failure to intervene claim against Sergeant Cruz and Officers Guzman and Regan.

The parties have submitted deposition transcripts for Plaintiff and each of the individual Defendants; each transcript will be referred to using the convention \"[Name] Dep.\" Finally, the Court refers to the documents submitted with the Declaration of Ryan Lozar using the convention \"Lozar Decl., Ex. [ ].\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    The OSC is often referred to by the officers as the \"61\" or the \"open 61.\" (\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Regan Dep. 77:13-19 (\" 'Open 61,' is when there is an investigation needed for that complaint.\") ).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    The Court ascribes no significance to the fact that the OSC is presently marked as \"closed.\" The version of the OSC in the record post-dates Plaintiff's arrest and does not indicate what its status was between May 9 and May 23, 2013. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Lozar Decl., Ex. 15). The Court similarly places little importance on the Officers' inability during their depositions to point to a marking or indication on the face of the OSC that shows it was left open at the time it was generated. (\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Cruz Dep. 109:16-24 (\"To 61 and it's-no I can't say.\"); Regan Dep. 80:6 (\"It says, 'closed.' \"); Guzman Dep. 82:3-5 (\"I do not see it on this page.\") ). The officers were shown the same version that is in the record before the Court-the version that post-dates Plaintiff's arrest and is listed as \"closed.\" Because there is no indication on the document of its status between May 9 and 23, 2013, the fact that the officers could not identify anything on the document showing that it had been left open on May 9, 2013, is consistent more with their obligation to testify truthfully than with Plaintiff's theory of the case. Nonetheless, the Court agrees that there is a genuine dispute as to whether the OSC was left open at the time it was generated on May 9, 2013.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    Cruz explained at his deposition that there was \"[o]bviously ... an error in [Plaintiff's] charge,\" because it \"should be criminal sale of a controlled substance,\" and that he tends to fill out the log entries based on the Prisoner Pedigree Card he receives from the arresting officer. (Cruz Dep. 70:4-19; 72:19-24). In the \"Arresting Officer\" field of Plaintiff's Prisoner Pedigree Card, \"Guzman, D.\" is crossed out and \"Acosta\" is written to the right on the same line.
