In\n   <em>\n    Noel\n   </em>\n   , two Haitian nationals unlawfully present in the United States and subject to orders of deportation married U.S. lawful permanent residents and sought \"extended voluntary departure,\" a form of discretionary relief from deportation that would have enabled them to remain in this country for up to two years while waiting for visas.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"135234\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/508/1023/#p1030\">\n    508 F.2d at 1024\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Between 1968 and 1972, it was the practice of the New York District Director for Immigration and Naturalization Services (\"INS\") routinely to grant extended voluntary departure to such Western Hemisphere aliens who were present in this country and married to permanent\n   resident aliens.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"135234\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/508/1023/#p1030\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"135234\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/508/1023/#p1030\">\n    at 1025\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In 1972, however, INS issued a directive stating that such aliens \"should not routinely be granted extended departure time, but rather should be offered that privilege only in those cases where compelling circumstances warranted the relief.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"135234\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/508/1023/#p1030\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"135234\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/508/1023/#p1030\">\n    at 1025-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Instead, the directive only offered \"a statement by the agency of its general policy as a guideline for the District Directors\" in their exercise of this discretion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"135234\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/508/1023/#p1030\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Second, the directive did not \"change [ ] the existing right of the [aliens] to have their applications for extensions of time to depart authorized in the sole discretion of the district director,\" because those aliens remained eligible to seek deferred voluntary departure, albeit only on the more limited basis of hardship.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"135234\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/508/1023/#p1030\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Like the directive at issue in\n   <em>\n    Noel\n   </em>\n   , the DACA Rescission Memo appears to be a general statement of policy, not a legislative rule. The DACA Rescission Memo does not deprive individuals of a substantive right to receive deferred action or work authorization, or to have these benefits renewed for additional terms. As the memorandum that launched the DACA program (the \"2012 DACA Memo\") states clearly, no such rights exist. (Mem. from Janet Napolitano, Sec'y, DHS, \"Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children\" (\"2012 DACA Memo\") (Dkt. 77-1 at ECF p.1).) Instead, the decision to grant or deny an individual deferred action and work authorization continues to lie within immigration authorities' discretion. Like the 2012 DACA Memo, the DACA Rescission Memo offers guidance to DHS employees as to how the agency intends to exercise this discretion prospectively: Whereas the 2012 DACA Memo advises DHS staff to consider exercising prosecutorial discretion with respect to individuals meeting certain identified criteria (such as age of entry into the United States and absence of a meaningful criminal record), the DACA Rescission Memo directs those staff not to consider those criteria when exercising their prosecutorial discretion. The DACA Rescission Memo is thus \"directed primarily at the staff of [DHS] describing how it will conduct agency discretionary functions.\"\n   <em>\n    Noel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"135234\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/508/1023/#p1030\">\n    508 F.2d at 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   It is true that, if the DACA Rescission Memo were to take effect, hundreds of thousands of individuals would no longer have the opportunity to seek deferred action and work authorization through the DACA program. As Defendants note, however, the DACA Rescission Memo does not purport to strip immigration authorities of the ability to grant deferred action and work authorization, but only provides that they should not do based on the criteria identified in the 2012 DACA Memo, or on the submission of DACA application materials. (BV MTD at 7 (\"[A]s was true before implementation of the DACA Policy in 2012, deferred action remains available on an individualized basis.\").) At least in theory, individuals who would have been eligible for deferred action and work authorization under the DACA program may still qualify for those benefits based on their\n   individual circumstances. As a practical matter, the DACA Rescission Memo almost certainly means that fewer individuals will receive for deferred action and work authorization. But the directive at issue in\n   <em>\n    Noel\n   </em>\n   surely reduced the number of aliens eligible for discretionary relief, too, and that did not render the directive a legislative rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Noel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"135234\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/508/1023/#p1030\">\n    508 F.2d at 1025-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that the DACA Rescission Memo nevertheless is a legislative rule because it binds DHS's discretion and requires the agency to reject all DACA applications and renewal requests not meeting certain criteria. (BV Pls. Opp'n at 12-14; State Pls. Opp'n at 1519.) As Plaintiffs point out, a number of courts outside this circuit-most notably the D.C. Circuit-have determined whether a rule is legislative at least partly by looking to whether the rule constrains the agency's own discretion.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Clarian Health W., LLC v. Hargan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264332\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/878/346/#p357\">\n    878 F.3d 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 357 (D.C. Cir. 2017). In this view, a rule \" 'cabining ... an agency's prosecutorial discretion can in fact rise to the level of a substantive, legislative rule' when it 'is in purpose or likely effect one that\n   <em>\n    narrowly limits administrative discretion\n   </em>\n   .' \"\n   <em>\n    Ass'n of Irritated Residents v. EPA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047721,3565167\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/494/1027/\">\n    494 F.3d 1027\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1034 (D.C.

Cir. 1987) (per curiam)). Plaintiffs note that the DACA Rescission Memo mandates the rejection of certain DACA applications, and therefore contend that the memo eliminates DHS's discretion to consider those applications and thus constitutes a legislative rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   While there is some force to Plaintiffs' arguments, they are unavailing. As an initial matter, it is not clear to this court that an agency's compliance with its stated policy is reason to deem that policy a legislative rule. Because one might expect functional organizations generally to abide by their own policies, treating general compliance with internal policies as evidence that those policies were in fact legislative rules risks writing the \"general statements of policy\" exception to notice-and-comment rulemaking out of the APA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, it is important to remember that the DACA Rescission Memo purports to end a program that was itself created by a policy statement. Plaintiffs' view that Defendants must use notice and comment to stop what started without notice and comment is not only counterintuitive, but also at odds with the general principle that the procedures needed to repeal or amend a rule as the same ones that were used to make the rule in the first place.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perez v.

(BV TAC \u00b6\u00b6 195-98; State Pls. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 233-39.)

The court is aware of no authority holding that this rule does not apply simply because the speaker is, or is running to be, the President of the United States. The court expresses no view as to whether these statements (which as Defendants note, are not directly connected to the DACA rescission) would ultimately suffice to provide that the rescission was motivated by discriminatory animus; that is a question for summary judgment or trial. The court concludes only that Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to raise a plausible inference that the DACA rescission violated equal protection, and thus to withstand a motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Defendants do not defend the President's comments but argue instead that the court should simply ignore them. First, Defendants suggest that because the President's statements were \"almost all made before he took the oath of office and [were not] made in connection with the [DACA rescission],\" these comments \"do not tend to show the existence of both discriminatory intent and discriminatory effect.\" (State MTD at 33.) Defendants cite no authority for the proposition that, to state an equal-protection claim, a plaintiff must point to some evidence that simultaneously demonstrates both discriminatory intent and discriminatory effect, or that evinces discriminatory bias directly in connection with the challenged official action. To the contrary,\n   <em>\n    Arlington Heights\n   </em>\n   states that courts may\n   consider the background of facially neutral decisions to smoke out whether they were covertly motivated by discriminatory purposes.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6951\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/252/#p264\">\n    429 U.S. at 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6951\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/252/#p264\">\n    97 S.Ct. 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The court recognizes that searching for evidence of discriminatory motivation in campaign-trail statements is potentially fraught. Old statements may say little about what lay behind a later decision.

Defendants argue that the President's statements are legally irrelevant because Acting Secretary Duke \"was the only official vested with authority ... to make the decision at issue,\" and Plaintiffs do not point to similarly objectionable statements by her. (BV MTD at 22; State MTD at 34.) To the extent Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have insufficiently alleged racial animus on the part of Acting Secretary Duke or the Attorney General, the court is inclined to agree: Plaintiffs have not identified statements by Acting Secretary Duke or the Attorney General that would give rise to an inference of discriminatory motive. Although the\n   <em>\n    Batalla Vidal\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs insinuate that the Attorney General referred to immigrants as \"filth\" (BV TAC \u00b6 100; BV Pls. Opp'n at 20), his prepared remarks make clear that this term was used only to refer to international drug-trafficking cartels and the gang MS-13 (Dep't of Justice, Press Release, Attorney General Jeff Sessions Delivers Remarks Announcing the Department of Justice's Renewed Commitment to Criminal Immigration Enforcement (Apr. 11, 2017), https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-jeff-sessions-delivers-remarks-announcing-department-justice-s-renewed). This comment therefore does not support a plausible inference that the Attorney General was motivated by racial discrimination when he advised that Acting Secretary Duke end the DACA program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The court rejects, however, Defendants' remarkable argument that the President apparently\n   <em>\n    cannot\n   </em>\n   be liable for rescinding the DACA program because only Acting Secretary Duke had the legal authority to end that program. (State MTD at 34.) Our Constitution vests \"executive Power\" in the President, not in the Secretary of DHS, who reports to the President and is removable by him at will. U.S. Const., art. II, \u00a7 1, cl. 1. This position appears to be at odds with the stated position of the President himself, who tweeted that if Congress were unable to \"legalize DACA,\" he would \"revisit this issue,\" implying that he (correctly) understands that he has ultimate authority over the program. (Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump), Twitter.com (Sept. 5, 2017 7:38 PM), https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/905228667336499200.) If, as Plaintiffs allege, President Trump himself directed the end of the DACA program (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , State Pls. Am. Compl. \u00b6 16), it would be surprising if his \"discriminatory intent [could] effectively be laundered by being implemented by an agency under his control\" (BV Pls. Opp'n at 18).

They did so, the third amended complaint alleges, because \"Defendants consistently represented ... that the information they provided would be protected from disclosure to U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") and Customers and Border Protection (\"CBP\") for immigration enforcement proceedings against them and their family members or guardians, except in limited, delineated circumstances.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs contend that, as part of\n   the DACA rescission, however, \"DHS has changed its policy ... to remove the limitations on using [this] information for immigration-enforcement purposes.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 156.) In particular, Plaintiffs attach to the third amended complaint a document of frequently asked questions published by USCIS on November 30, 2017 (the \"November 30 FAQs\"), which states that \"[i]nformation provided to USCIS for the DACA process will not make you an immigration priority for that reason alone. That information will only be\n   <em>\n    proactively provided\n   </em>\n   to ICE or CBP if the requestor meets the criteria for the issuance of a Notice To Appear or a referral to ICE under the criteria set forth in USCIS' Notice to Appear guidance.\" (USCIS, Frequently Asked Questions: Rejected DACA Requests (Last Reviewed/Updated 11/30/2017) (\"Nov. 30 FAQs\") (Dkt. 113-1 at ECF p.65) at Q5 (emphasis added).) The\n   <em>\n    Batalla Vidal\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs contend that this alleged change violated Section 706(2)(A) of the APA.

Procedural Due Process\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Finally, the court turns to the newly asserted claim in the\n   <em>\n    Batalla Vidal\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' third amended complaint, in which MRNY challenges Defendants' processing of renewal requests submitted pursuant to the DACA Rescission Memo. MRNY states a claim with respect to some categories of DACA recipients whose renewal requests were allegedly unfairly denied in September or October 2017, but not others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In the DACA Rescission Memo, Acting Secretary Duke stated that DACA recipients whose deferred action and work authorization were set to expire before March 5, 2018, could request a final two-year extension of their benefits. (DACA Rescission Memo at 4.) In particular, DHS would \"adjudicate-on an individual, case by case basis-properly filed pending DACA renewal requests and associated applications for Employment Authorization Documents from current beneficiaries that have been accepted by the Department as of the date of this memorandum, and from current beneficiaries whose benefits will expire between [September 5, 2017] and March 5, 2018 that have been accepted by [DHS] as of October 5, 2017.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   According to MRNY, Defendants implemented this directive in a series of unfair ways. First, MRNY alleges, Defendants rejected applications that were delivered to USCIS P.O. boxes late in the day on October 5 but not retrieved by USCIS staff and taken to separate USCIS \"lockboxes\" until the following day. (BV TAC \u00b6\u00b6 115-20.) Second, Defendants allegedly rejected as untimely certain renewal requests that were delivered after October 5 due to unusual U.S. Postal Service delays. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 121-22;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Liz Robbins,\n   <em>\n    Post Office Fails to Deliver on Time, and DACA Applications Get Rejected\n   </em>\n   , N.Y. Times (Nov. 10, 2017) (Dkt. 113-1 at ECF p.49).) Third, Defendants allegedly rejected renewal requests that were received before October 5 \"but had been returned to the applicant due to real or perceived clerical errors.\" (BV TAC \u00b6 123.) For example, USCIS allegedly rejected one MRNY member's DACA renewal request because a USCIS employee misread the date on her application-fee check as \"2012,\" rather than \"2017.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 124.) DHS invited some of these applicants to refile corrected applications, but when\n   they did so, DHS rejected the refiled requests as untimely. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 123, 127) According to MRNY, this deviated from DHS's prior practice of allowing individuals whose DACA applications were rejected for minor clerical errors to correct those errors or submit further evidence in support of their applications within a given period of time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 123)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   On November 15, 2017, Defendants indicated that USCIS would reconsider certain applications that were delayed in the mail or improperly rejected. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 129 (citing Defs. Nov. 15, 2017, Letter Regarding USCIS Guidance (Dkt. 108).) USCIS allegedly stated that it would reach out to individuals whose applications were rejected as untimely due to mail delays and provide them instructions on how to resubmit their applications. (BV TAC \u00b6\u00b6 130.) USCIS allegedly has not, however, created an equivalent process for individuals whose applications were rejected due to real or perceived minor clerical errors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 132-34.) MRNY contends that this \"arbitrary and unfair implementation of the October 5, 2017 [DACA renewal request] deadline violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment\" by depriving DACA recipients of a liberty or property interest without the process to which they are entitled. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 199-205.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Standing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Defendants first move to dismiss this claim for lack of standing, arguing that MRNY has not alleged that its clients or members suffered an injury-in-fact because \"the injuries on which [it] ... relies have been remedied.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   This argument is meritless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   As their submissions make clear, Defendants have not, in fact, remedied all injuries incurred by DACA recipients whose renewal requests were allegedly improperly rejected. For MRNY clients and members whose applications arrived late on October 5, \"the agency will identify those individuals affected and invite them to resubmit their DACA requests,\" and \"those not yet contacted ... may affirmatively reach out to the agency, explain their situation, and resubmit their request for reconsideration.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Dec. 7 FAQs at Q3).) For individuals whose requests were delayed due to postal-service errors and subsequently rejected as untimely, \"USPS is working with USCIS to identify DACA requests that were received after the deadline due to USPS mail-service delays.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11 (quoting Dec. 7 FAQs at Q8).) Once such requests are identified, \"USCIS will send affected DACA requestors a letter inviting them to resubmit their DACA request.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting Dec. 7 FAQs at Q8).) And individuals whose requests were rejected due to perceived clerical errors \"may contact the agency and explain the error believed to\n   have been made\"; \"[i]dentification of '\n   <em>\n    clear error\n   </em>\n   in the processing of a renewal request'\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   result in the agency '\n   <em>\n    exercising its discretion\n   </em>\n   to review the request again.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting Dec. 7 FAQs at Q7 (emphasis added and alterations adopted)).) Thus, with respect to each category of allegedly wronged MRNY client or member, Defendants' supposed \"remedy\" is either that USCIS intends to address the injury in the future or that it will allow the injured party to ask it to reconsider its decision. The court commends Defendants for taking steps to redress the allegedly wrongful denials of these DACA renewal requests. But Defendants err to the extent they contend that, because they have stated that they may reconsider these denials, MRNY members and clients whose applications were denied have not suffered injuries-in-fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wong v. Daines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3906105\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/582/475/#p479\">\n    582 F.Supp.2d 475\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 479 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (failure to exhaust administrative remedies does not implicate Article III injury-in-fact).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   MRNY has standing to assert this claim on behalf of its members and clients who were adversely affected by Defendants' allegedly wrongful adjudication of their DACA renewal requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Nor is this claim moot.

(BV MTD at 22-25.) The court agrees in part and disagrees in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \"A procedural due process claim is composed of two elements: (1) the existence of a property or liberty interest that was deprived and (2) deprivation of that interest without due process.\"\n   <em>\n    Bryant v.

They correctly argue that only benefits to which a person has a \"legitimate claim of entitlement\" can support a constitutionally protected liberty or property interest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Town of Castle Rock v.

Because the decision to grant deferred action and work authorization is ultimately discretionary, they say, there can be no constitutionally protected liberty or property interest in receiving DACA benefits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-24;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   2012 DACA Memo at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   This argument is partly true. \"In determining whether a given benefits regime creates a 'legitimate claim of entitlement' to such benefits, we ask whether the statutes and regulations governing the distribution of benefits 'meaningfully channel[ ] official discretion by mandating a defined administrative outcome.' \"\n   <em>\n    Barrows v.

The 2012 DACA Memo only sets out criteria for DHS staff's consideration, and there is no guarantee that fulfillment of these criteria will result in a grant of deferred action or work authorization. Under the memo, the decision to grant or deny those benefits is entirely as a matter of DHS's discretion. Because DHS is not effectively required to grant any particular DACA renewal requests, MRNY cannot state a procedural-due-process claim challenging the denial of its members' and clients' requests.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yuen Jin v. Mukasey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4126593\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/538/143/#p156\">\n    538 F.3d 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 156-57 (2d Cir. 2008) (petitioners for asylum lack liberty or property interest in discretionary relief). While the denial of those requests may affect some DACA recipients' liberty interests (a question the court need not decide), any such liberty interests are ultimately contingent on DACA beneficiaries' receipt of renewed deferred action, to which they have no \"legitimate entitlement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Defendants' argument is also something of a red herring. MRNY contends not only that Defendants improperly denied its members' and clients' renewal requests, but that Defendants' implementation of the October 5 deadline improperly denied MRNY's members and clients of the opportunity to be considered for renewal. (BV Pls. Opp'n at 23.) As MRNY points out, the DACA Rescission Memo clearly stated that USCIS \"\n   <em>\n    will adjudicate\n   </em>\n   ... properly filed pending DACA renewal requests and associated applications for Employment Authorization Documents ... from current beneficiaries whose benefits will expire between [September 5, 2017] and March 5, 2018 that have been accepted by [DHS] as of October 5, 2017.\" (DACA Rescission Memo at 4 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   BV Pls. Opp'n at 23.) While the ultimate decision to grant or deny a renewal request is discretionary, this language makes clear that USCIS would at least consider every \"properly filed\" and timely \"accepted\" renewal request. MRNY has therefore sufficiently alleged that its affected members and clients had a legitimate entitlement to submit their renewal requests.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yuen Jin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4126593\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/538/143/#p156\">\n    538 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   161 n.1 (Sack, J., concurring in part and in the judgment) (\"Although asylum is a discretionary form of relief, and the Due Process Clause does not protect benefits that government officials may grant or deny in their discretion, every asylum applicant is nonetheless entitled to due process in establishing her eligibility for that form of relief.\" (internal quotation marks and citations omitted and alteration adopted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   MRNY has also sufficiently alleged that at least some of its members and clients were deprived of cognizable interests in the consideration of their DACA renewal requests without due process of law. With respect to individuals whose requests were rejected because they were delivered to USCIS P.O. boxes on October 5 but not transferred to the appropriate \"lockbox\" until the following day, the DACA Rescission Memo was at least ambiguous as to which applications would\n   be deemed \"accepted ... as of October 5, 2017.\" (DACA Rescission Memo at 4.) The DACA Rescission Memo did not state that applications had to be received at a USCIS P.O. box by mid-to late afternoon to be \"accepted,\" or that only those applications redelivered to a designated USCIS \"lockbox\" by October 5 would be deemed \"accepted,\" raising the possibility that MRNY may be able to show that the denial of these requests violated due process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Meyer v. Jinkosolar Holdings Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4151039\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/761/245/#p249\">\n    761 F.3d 245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 249 (2d Cir. 2014) (stating that, on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, \"dismissal is appropriate only where [plaintiffs] can prove no set of facts consistent with the complaint that would entitle them to relief). Likewise, MRNY has stated a claim on behalf of individuals whose requests were rejected because USCIS staff incorrectly deemed them to be marred by clerical errors. Such applications were, in fact, \"properly filed,\" as the DACA Rescission Memo required, but were only rejected due to errors by USCIS staff. It is hard to see how such denials comport with due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   MRNY has not stated a claim, however, with respect to DACA recipients whose requests were rejected as untimely after being delayed by the U.S. Postal Service. The court sympathizes with the plight of these individuals and commends Defendants for voluntarily taking steps to address this unfortunate situation. The DACA Rescission Memo states, however, that only \"properly filed\" and \"accepted\" requests would be considered. It is common for mailing deadlines to be calculated based on when something is postmarked, not when it is actually delivered to the recipient. But USCIS's stated decision to use a \"delivery rule,\" rather than a 31 \"mailbox rule,\" to determine which requests were timely does not violate the Due Process Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Likewise, MRNY has not stated a claim with respect to individuals whose renewal requests were rejected due to actual (as opposed to incorrectly perceived) clerical errors. In light of the human consequences of the decision to grant or deny an individual a renewal of DACA benefits, it may seem overparticular to deny a renewal request because someone \"forg[ot] to check a box, forg[ot] to sign or sign[ed] in the wrong place, or submitt[ed] a check for what applicants previously had to pay for DACA renewal.\" (BV TAC \u00b6 141.) The court hopes that USCIS will review these applications sympathetically, understanding the gravity of taking away someone's livelihood and tentative protection against deportation simply because he or she forgot to check a box on a multi-page form. The court cannot, however, require USCIS to do so, because due process of law does not require the agency to accept incomplete or incorrect renewal requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Accordingly, Defendants' motion to dismiss the\n   <em>\n    Batalla Vidal\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' sixth claim for relief for failure to state a claim is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. MRNY has adequately alleged that the rejection of DACA renewal requests that arrived late in the day on October 5, 2017, or that were erroneously deemed to contain minor clerical errors, violated procedural due process. MRNY has not, however, stated a procedural-due-process claim on behalf of requestors whose applications arrived after October 5 due to postal delays or actually contained minor clerical errors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   For the reasons stated above, Defendants' motions to dismiss the\n   <em>\n    Batalla Vidal\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' third amended complaint and the State Plaintiffs' amended complaint (Dkt. 207 in No. 16-CV-4756; No. 71 in No. 17-CV-5228) are GRANTED IN PART\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   and DENIED IN PART. The\n   <em>\n    Batalla Vidal\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' first, third, and fourth claims for relief are dismissed, and the second claim for relief is dismissed to the extent it alleges that Defendants weakened DHS's information-use policy. The sixth claim for relief is dismissed in part, as stated above. The State Plaintiffs' fifth and sixth claims for relief are dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    All record citations refer to the docket in\n    <em>\n     Batalla Vidal v.

(2d Am. Compl. (Dkt. 60) \u00b6\u00b6 160-65; Nov. 9 M&amp;O at 37-38.) The court also dismissed for lack of standing the State Plaintiffs' notice and information-use-policy claims. (Nov. 9 M&amp;O at 38-46.) While the\n    <em>\n     Batalla Vidal\n    </em>\n    Plaintiffs reassert a notice claim in their third amended complaint (3d Am. Compl. (\"BV TAC\") (Dkt. 113) \u00b6\u00b6 188-94), they concede that they do so only to preserve the claim for appeal and that, under the reasoning of the November 9 M&amp;O, this claim should be dismissed (Pls. Mem. in Opp'n to Mot. to Dismiss the BV TAC (\"BV Pls. Opp'n\") (Dkt. 240) at 4 n.5). Accordingly, the\n    <em>\n     Batalla Vidal\n    </em>\n    Plaintiffs' fourth claim for relief is DISMISSED.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Defendants have also contested whether Make the Road New York (\"MRNY\") and the State Plaintiffs fall within the APA's \"zone of interests.\" (BV MTD at 12; State MTD at 20-21.) These Plaintiffs fall within the zone of interests of the Immigration and Nationality Act such that they may bring suit under the APA. DACA recipients are members, clients, and employees of MRNY, an organization that advocates for immigrants' rights. (BV TAC \u00b6\u00b6 46, 49-50; BV Pls. Opp'n at 6-7.) At the very least, the State Plaintiffs employ a number of DACA recipients. (Nov. 9 M&amp;O at 38-40; State Pls. Opp'n at 3-6.) Plaintiffs' interests in the decision to end the DACA program are thus not \" 'so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the [Immigration and Nationality Act] that it cannot reasonably be assumed that' Congress authorized [those] plaintiff[s] to sue.\"\n    <em>\n     Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v.
