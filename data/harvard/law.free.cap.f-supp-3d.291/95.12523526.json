In the instant motion,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs seek conditional certification of an opt-in collective action under federal and D.C. law. For reasons set forth below, the Court will grant the motion in part and deny it in part. Conditional certification will be granted, with the following limitations:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   First, the putative class is limited to servers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Second, conditional certification is not granted with respect to the following factual allegations: (a) Plaintiffs' \"homework\" allegations; (b) Plaintiffs' allegations regarding uncompensated time at pre-shift meetings insofar as they relate to the Founding Farmers Tysons restaurant in Virginia; and (c) Plaintiffs' allegation that Defendants failed to aggregate hours worked at different restaurants for overtime purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Third, the putative class will be divided into three sub-classes, one for each of the three relevant jurisdictions (the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Fourth, Defendants will be required to produce names, mailing addresses, and email addresses for notice purposes within the next twenty days but, absent a further order of the Court, will not be required to produce telephone numbers or to include notices with paychecks mailed to employees. The opt-in period will last sixty days from when notice is sent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Fifth, the Court does not approve Plaintiffs' proposed form of notice (Pls.' Br., Ex. A, ECF No. 14-1). Instead, the Court will order the parties to meet, confer, and submit to the Court a revised form of proposed notice consistent with this Opinion by February 9, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

ECF No. 5 (\"Am. Compl.\") \u00b6 3.

The instant motion relates only to Plaintiffs' proposed collective action, and accordingly Plaintiffs' Maryland-law claims are not relevant to the issues presently before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs claim that Defendants engaged in the following allegedly improper employment practices:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 Defendants required employees to use their own money \"to purchase uniforms including, but not limited to, specific denim chambray shirts, suspenders, black non-slip shoes, aprons, and bow ties,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36, and \"to clean, starch, and press their uniforms,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 Defendants required employees \"to purchase equipment for use while at work, including, but not limited to, bottle openers, corkscrews, black lighters, and black click-top pens.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 Defendants required employees \"to attend pre-shift meetings\" before each shift that lasted \"on average 15 to 20 minutes,\" and employees were not compensated for time spent at the meetings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 Defendants required employees \"to engage in close-out duties for 30 minutes to two hours per shift,\" and such duties included without limitation \"rolling silverware, resetting tables, polishing silver, and cleaning and setting up the restaurants.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. Similarly, Defendants required employees to spend time \"sweeping, cleaning, and preparing the restaurants to open before their shifts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49(d).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 Defendants \"required plaintiffs to pool their tips and share tip proceeds with staff who do not customarily and regularly receive tips and gratuities, including their managers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 When employees worked at multiple restaurants within Farmers Restaurant Group, Defendants \"counted the hours of work at each location separately for purposes of calculating overtime to avoid paying overtime.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 Defendants generally failed to compensate Plaintiffs \"for all hours worked over 40 in a workweek at the proper overtime rate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 Defendants failed to provide employees with sick leave.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 Plaintiffs allege that they were paid using the \"tip credit\" for purposes of federal and state labor law.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.

Four named Plaintiffs worked at two restaurants, and each such Plaintiff claims that the same policies applied at both restaurants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Calvillo Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-2; Clark Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-2; Pitt Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-2; Stephens Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-2. Only Plaintiff Calvillo worked at the Maryland restaurant, MoCo's Founding Farmers,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Calvillo Decl. \u00b6 1, and only Plaintiff Storey worked at the Virginia restaurant, Founding Farmers Tysons,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Storey Decl. \u00b6 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The declarations attest to each Plaintiff's knowledge of the allegedly unlawful practices at the restaurants. These declarations track the allegations in the Amended Complaint in most, but not all, respects.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 Plaintiffs declare that they were required to purchase \"uniforms\" generally similar to those described in the Amended Complaint, and that they were required to launder the uniforms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Calvillo Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-5; Clark Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-5; Krohn Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-4; Pitt Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-5; Stephens Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-5; Storey Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-4; Willig Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-4. The descriptions of the uniforms vary somewhat from plaintiff to plaintiff. For example, while most Plaintiffs include \"denim chambray shirts\" when describing the uniform,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Calvillo Decl. \u00b6 4, Plaintiff Pitt includes \"white oxford shirts with non-French cuffs\" instead, Pitt Decl. \u00b6 4. Similarly, only two of the seven Plaintiffs mention suspenders in their descriptions, Calvillo Decl. \u00b6 4; Stephens Decl. \u00b6 4, and the word \"suspenders\" appears to have been whited out in Plaintiff Pitt's declaration,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pitt Decl. \u00b6 4.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \u2022 Plaintiffs declare that they were required to purchase equipment including \"bottle openers, corkscrews, black lighters, and click-top black ink pens\" for work. Calvillo Decl. \u00b6 6; Clark Decl. \u00b6 6; Krohn Decl. \u00b6 5; Pitt Decl. \u00b6 6; Stephens Decl. \u00b6 6; Storey Decl. \u00b6 5; Willig Decl. \u00b6 5.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \u2022 With two notable exceptions, Plaintiffs uniformly report that they were required to attend pre-shift meetings lasting, \"on average, 15 to 20 minutes each\" and were prohibited from \"clocking in\" until the meetings were over. Calvillo Decl. \u00b6 7; Krohn Decl. \u00b6 6; Pitt Decl. \u00b6 7; Stephens Decl. \u00b6 7; Willig Decl. \u00b6 6. However, Plaintiff Clark, who worked at both Farmers &amp; Distillers and Founding Farmers DC, mentions only Farmers &amp; Distillers when stating that servers could not \"clock in\" before the meetings (remaining silent on whether this was the case at Founding Farmers DC).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Clark Decl. \u00b6 7. And Plaintiff Storey explains that employees are prohibited from \"clocking in\" at Founding Farmers Tysons only if they do not \"come in at least 10 minutes early.\" Storey Decl. \u00b6 6.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   \u2022 Plaintiffs also claim that they lacked the opportunity to earn tips during the pre-shift meetings. Calvillo Decl.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 7; Clark Decl. \u00b6 7; Krohn Decl. \u00b6 6; Pitt Decl. \u00b6 7; Stephens Decl. \u00b6 7; Storey Decl. \u00b6 6; Willig Decl. \u00b6 6. Plaintiffs similarly describe having performed \"30 minutes to two hours\" after each shift of non-tipped close-out duties, such as \"folding linens, polishing silverware, bullets, and ramekins, cleaning the wait stations, removing trash, restocking the takeout and to go boxes, restocking condiments, cleaning and restocking beverage stations, polishing wine glasses, and preparing tables.\" Calvillo Decl. \u00b6 8;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Clark Decl. \u00b6 8; Krohn Decl. \u00b6 7; Pitt Decl. \u00b6 8; Stephens Decl. \u00b6 8; Storey Decl. \u00b6 7; Willig Decl. \u00b6 7. Once again, there are some variations among the duties described. For example, Plaintiff Clark does not report having polished silverware, and Plaintiffs Clark and Storey do not say that they polished ramekins.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Clark Decl. \u00b6 8; Storey Decl. \u00b6 7.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \u2022 All Plaintiffs report having pooled their tips with other employees, in most cases with \"bartenders, bussers, runners, and stockers.\" Calvillo Decl. \u00b6 9; Clark Decl. \u00b6 9; Krohn Decl. \u00b6 8; Pitt Decl. \u00b6 9; Stephens Decl. \u00b6 9; Storey Decl. \u00b6 8. Plaintiff Willig says that the tip pool includes \"bussers, runners, pastry workers, and stockers.\" Willig Decl. \u00b6 8.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \u2022 Only Plaintiff Stephens, who worked at Farmers &amp; Distillers and Farmers Fishers Bakers, reports that Defendants would \"count the hours worked at each restaurant separately in order to avoid\" paying overtime. Stephens Decl. \u00b6 11.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   \u2022 Six Plaintiffs state that they were denied sick leave. Calvillo Decl. \u00b6 12; Clark Decl. \u00b6 10; Krohn Decl. \u00b6 9; Pitt Decl. \u00b6 11; Stephens Decl. \u00b6 13; Willig Decl. \u00b6 10. Three Plaintiffs further specify that, when they requested sick leave, they were ordered to come in to work. Clark Decl. \u00b6 10; Pitt Decl. \u00b6 11; Stephens Decl. \u00b6 13. Plaintiff Storey does not declare that she was denied sick leave.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Storey Decl.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \u2022 Six Plaintiffs' declarations also include the allegation, absent from the Amended Complaint, that their first two weeks of work involved a \"training\" period during which they were required to perform homework for \"one to two hours\" each workday. Calvillo Decl. \u00b6 11; Krohn Decl. \u00b6 10; Pitt Decl. \u00b6 10; Stephens Decl. \u00b6 12; Storey Decl. \u00b6 10; Willig Decl. \u00b6 9. Plaintiff Clark's declaration does not mention any such homework.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Clark Decl.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   \u2022 The cash wage that Plaintiffs earned varied by jurisdiction: $2.77 in D.C., $3.63 in Maryland, and $2.13 in Virginia.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Calvillo Decl. \u00b6 3; Storey Decl. \u00b6 2.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiffs report that these practices applied to \"other servers\" as well, with one exception: no Plaintiff states that Defendants' alleged sick-leave policies applied to employees other than the named Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Calvillo Decl. \u00b6 13; Clark Decl. \u00b6 11; Krohn Decl. \u00b6 11; Pitt Decl. \u00b6 12; Stephens Decl. \u00b6 14; Storey Decl. \u00b6 11; Willig Decl. \u00b6 11. In addition, only Plaintiffs Calvillo, Stephens, and Storey say that they worked overtime, and each reports having worked overtime either a quarter or a third of the time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Calvillo Decl. \u00b6 10; Stephens Decl. \u00b6 10; Storey Decl. \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Defendants' Declarations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendants filed four declarations, which accompanied their opposition brief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   declarations were filed by (1) Defendant Simons,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Simons Decl., (2) the Director of Accounting Operations at Founding Farmers Group,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Guilford Decl. \u00b6 1, (3) a former General Manager at MoCo's Founding Farmers,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Smith Decl. \u00b6 1, and (4) a Service Manager at Farmers Fishers Bakers,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Garcia Decl. \u00b6 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendants' declarations describe several differences among the restaurants that they assert assist them in defeating conditional certification. They explain that each restaurant is owned by a separate limited liability company with a different ownership structure, although Defendants do not appear to deny that Founding Farmers Group operates the restaurants (presumably through those other entities).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Simons Decl. \u00b6 3. Defendants also explain that the restaurants have \"operational differences\" that affect their wage and hour policies.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. For example, Defendants state that the restaurants have varying volumes of work at different times of the year and different hours of the day, resulting in different policies with respect to shifts, pre-shift meetings, and side work.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5-7, 11. Defendants also state that the restaurants offer different types of food and service (for example, some offer brunch buffets while others do not).\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-12. Defendants state that their clothing policies (which they describe as \"style guides\" rather than \"uniforms\") vary among the restaurants.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. They further state that there are variations in their policies regarding the tip credit and tip pooling,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14, 17-18, and whether employees are required to roll and polish silverware,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendants' declarations also deny several of Plaintiffs' substantive allegations. The declarations state that employees are not required to do homework,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19; that Defendants have paid employees straight-time and overtime pay as required,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-21; Guilford Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-4; that Defendants gave employees paid time off to use as sick leave (and in some cases, paid employees for unused sick leave at the end of their employment),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Guilford Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-12; that pre-shift meetings were not held at MoCo's Founding Farmers,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Smith Decl. \u00b6 6; and that such meetings varied in length and frequency at Farmers Fishers Bakers,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Garcia Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-9. Defendants' declarations further state that employees are not eligible to begin taking sick leave until 90 days after they start their jobs, and that some employees work for fewer than 90 days or for not much longer than that.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Guilford Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-9. Finally, the declarations state that at least two individual managers, and some vendors, gave employees access to many of the tools that Plaintiffs claim they had to purchase (such as pens, \"wine tools,\" and lighters).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Smith Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-5; Garcia Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Thus, the pre-shift work at the Virginia restaurant is properly included in this claim related to non-tipped work, even though-as discussed above-Plaintiffs have not met their burden on their claim that pre-shift work at the Virginia restaurant was uncompensated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    (e) Tip-Pool Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The Amended Complaint alleges that Plaintiffs were required to pool tips \"with staff who do not customarily and regularly receive tips and gratuities, including their managers.\" Am.

Plaintiff Stephens reports having worked overtime approximately a quarter of the time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.

Here, in conclusory fashion, Plaintiff Stephens states that \"other servers\" were subject to the same aggregation-of-hours policy, but does not detail whether that statement rests upon specific personal observations or conversations with other employees, or is simply a rumor. Moreover, the affidavit states only that other servers were \"subject to\" this policy, but not that those other servers actually had their overtime pay unlawfully reduced when the policy was applied to them. In short, the affidavit contains nothing from which the Court can conclude that the asserted existence of similarly affected plaintiffs is more than \"pure speculation.\" Under these circumstances, and even in light of the low bar Plaintiffs must meet at this stage, this deficiency is fatal. Courts have routinely denied conditional certification where plaintiffs have advanced only one affidavit that speaks in only conclusory terms about the existence of other, similarly situated employees.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Munoz v.

Moreover, unlike the declaration at issue in\n   <em>\n    Galloway\n   </em>\n   , it does not specifically say that the policy was applied to these other employees in such a way as to render them similarly situated by unlawfully reducing their overtime pay. It thus falls short of the declaration submitted in\n   <em>\n    Galloway\n   </em>\n   , which, as the court in that case emphasized, represents the bare minimum to merit conditional certification. Finally, unlike the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Galloway\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs here have submitted multiple declarations from other servers who were in a position to know about this alleged practice, but they fail to corroborate it. Plaintiffs have thus failed to establish that their evidence rests on anything more than speculation, and so conditional certification will be denied with respect to the alleged aggregation-of-hours policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    (b) Uncompensated Pre-Shift Meetings Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The Court has already analyzed Plaintiffs' allegations regarding uncompensated pre-shift meetings in connection with their minimum wage claim, and concluded that those allegations are fit for certification except as they relate to the Founding Farmers Tysons restaurant in Virginia.

That argument is better suited to a motion to dismiss than conditional certification, but in any event, it is meritless. \"[T]o state a plausible FLSA overtime claim, a plaintiff must sufficiently allege 40 hours of work in a given workweek as well as some uncompensated time in excess of the 40 hours.\"\n   <em>\n    Lundy v.

Those Plaintiffs are similarly situated to any other members of the putative class who worked overtime. Moreover, Defendants state that they pay overtime when it is required, implicitly conceding that some employees do work overtime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Simons Decl. \u00b6 21; Guilford Decl. \u00b6 3. Accordingly, the Court will grant conditional certification of the overtime claim as it relates to pre-shift meetings, except at Founding Farmers Tysons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    (c) Homework Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   As explained above in the context of Plaintiffs' minimum wage claim, the Court will not grant certification with respect to the alleged \"homework\" policy, because Plaintiffs did not include that policy in their Amended Complaint.

Certification of the overtime claim is denied in all other respects, including with respect to Plaintiffs' aggregation-of-hours and homework allegations. As a result, the Court will not certify any overtime claim for employees who worked only at the Founding Farmers Tysons restaurant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Sick Leave Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The Amended Complaint alleges that Defendants denied employees sick leave in violation of D.C. law, and threatened to fire employees who did take sick leave or who complained about Defendants' policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 42, 77-78. Six named Plaintiffs declare that they were denied sick leave, and three expressly state that they were ordered to come to work when they requested sick leave (although none reports having been threatened with termination).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Calvillo Decl. \u00b6 12; Clark Decl. \u00b6 10; Krohn Decl. \u00b6 9; Pitt Decl. \u00b6 11; Stephens Decl. \u00b6 13; Willig Decl. \u00b6 10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Defendants have pursued several lines of attack, all of which are unavailing at this stage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants, relying on their own affidavits, claim that employees were afforded sick leave and, in many cases, were paid out for sick leave when their employment ended.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Opp'n at 24 (citing Guilford Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 10, 12). Once again, Defendants' attempt to raise a factual dispute is misplaced at this stage of the proceedings. Moreover, Defendants' claim that they paid out unused sick leave is not on point, because Plaintiffs' allegation is that employees were denied the opportunity to take sick leave when they asked for it, not that Defendants failed to pay out unused sick leave.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 42, 77-78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs have not made out a claim, because D.C. law does not require employers to grant sick leave during the first 90 days of employment, and Plaintiffs have not alleged when they requested sick leave.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Opp'n at 24. Defendants have cited no authority for the proposition that Plaintiffs must plead their sick leave claim with this level of particularity. Rather, case law suggests that such specificity is not required.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alvarez-Soto v. B.

Defendants will be free to revisit this argument at summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Finally, Defendants assert that the sick leave claim will require individualized determinations, because some employees (including one of the opt-in plaintiffs) did not work long enough to become eligible for sick leave, while others may never have requested sick leave after the statute's 90-day\n   probation period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Opp'n at 24-25 (citing Guilford Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 7-9). The Court is not convinced that such differences preclude conditional certification, because the key issue is whether Defendants had a common policy of denying sick leave to eligible employees, not how individual employees were affected.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blount\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4230835\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/945/88/#p93\">\n    945 F.Supp.2d at 95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (granting conditional certification with respect to allegedly unlawful policy despite immaterial variations in how it was applied).
