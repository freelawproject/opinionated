Martinez, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This lawsuit arose from a bicycle accident that caused significant injuries to Plaintiff Michael Olivero. He and his wife, Plaintiff Angela Olivero (together, the \"Oliveros\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   sue Defendant Trek Bicycle Corporation (\"Trek\") on theories of product\n   liability, negligence, breach of warranty, and (as to Angela Olivero) loss of consortium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Currently before the Court are four motions: (1) Trek's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 33); (2) Trek's Motion\n   <em>\n    in Limine\n   </em>\n   to Preclude Evidence Related to Certain Alleged Future Economic and Noneconomic Damages (\"Motion\n   <em>\n    in Limine\n   </em>\n   \") (ECF No. 47); (3) the Oliveros' Motion to Strike Defendant's Rebuttal Accident Reconstruction Expert (\"Motion to Strike Rebuttal Expert\") (ECF No. 68); and (4) the Oliveros' Motion to Strike the Affidavits and New Evidence from Defendant's Summary Judgment Reply Brief (\"Motion to Strike Reply Evidence\") (ECF No. 78). For the reasons discussed below, Trek's summary judgment motion is denied. As for the various evidentiary motions, each is granted in part and denied in part, and, as to certain objections to expert testimony, both parties must elect whether to seek a rebuttal from an expert of their own, as explained below. Absent such an election, the Court will strike a portion of the expert opinions in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. UNDISPUTED FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Trek designs, manufactures, and sells bicycles and their various components. (ECF No. 33 at 3, \u00b6 1.) Sometime in 2014, Olivero purchased a Trek bicycle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) On March 25, 2015, Olivero purchased a new Trek carbon fiber bicycle fork to replace the fork then installed on his bicycle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) This new fork was not manufactured in a Trek facility, but was instead manufactured by a Chinese subcontractor named Martec Industrial Corp. (\"Martec\"). (ECF No. 49 at 7, \u00b6 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Olivero had his new fork professionally installed by the bike shop where he purchased the fork. (ECF No. 33 at 3, \u00b6 6.) The bike shop performed the installation properly. (ECF No. 49 at 15, \u00b6 1.) From that date (March 25, 2015) until the accident that led to this lawsuit, Olivero rode his bicycle with the replacement fork many times for a significant distance, in the aggregate. (ECF No. 33 at 4, \u00b6 7; ECF No. 49 at 6-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 15, 2015, Olivero was riding his bicycle on South Garrison Street in Lakewood, Colorado, when he \"suddenly and unexpectedly crashed.\" (ECF No. 33 at 5, \u00b6\u00b6 15-16.) Olivero has no memory of the event. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) Two eyewitnesses saw it happen, however. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6, \u00b6 18.) These eyewitnesses were traveling in a car some distance behind Olivero, who was riding to the right of the automobile traffic lanes and also to the right of a designated bike lane. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-22.) Both eyewitnesses testified to seeing essentially the same event: the bicycle fork snapped in a backwards direction for no discernible reason, the bicycle collapsed beneath Olivero, and he fell forward over his handlebars and onto the pavement. (ECF No. 49 at 16, \u00b6\u00b6 4-10.) The right side of his face struck the pavement just before, or about the same time as, the rest of his body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Again, Olivero does not remember the accident. Based on his normal riding behavior, however, he estimates that he was likely traveling 15-20 mph at the time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17, \u00b6 12.) Post-accident investigation revealed no skidmarks or signs of a foreign object that might have lodged in Olivero's wheel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18, \u00b6 17;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 21, \u00b6 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   All of the bicycle components, including the broken fork, have been preserved as evidence for this lawsuit (ECF No. 33 at 7, \u00b6 29), which Olivero filed on April 1, 2016 (ECF No. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. THE OLIVEROS' MOTION TO STRIKE TREK'S EXPERT EVIDENCE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Before addressing the parties' substantive arguments for and against summary judgment, the Court must resolve a heated\n   dispute over the proper extent of Trek's rebuttal expert's opinions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Competing Reports\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Oliveros retained Braden Kappius-who has significant education in metallurgy, materials science, and mechanical engineering-to inspect the broken bicycle and to provide an expert report. Kappius's report is dated November 11, 2016. (ECF No. 68-1 at 11.) The most important statements in the report are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Purpose\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   The purpose of this analysis was to determine the most likely cause of the accident and whether or not manufacturing defects and/or improper installation and assembly of the fork onto the frame caused or contributed to the June 15, 2015 accident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Procedure\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The bicycle components recovered following the accident were inspected ...

While these defects might not have made themselves present prior to the accident, that does not preclude them from existing. Carbon fiber composites can and will often fail in a sudden and catastrophic manner. This is a function of the mechanical properties of carbon fiber composites.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-15 (typeface formatting in original).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Trek designated a mechanical engineer, Gerald Bretting, as its rebuttal expert. Bretting's rebuttal report is dated January 6, 2017. (ECF No. 68-2 at 4.) The Bretting Report contains a substantially longer narrative of what he observed at the in-person inspection of Olivero's bicycle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-7.) Among his observations were \"an impact crack to the aft surface of the left fork blade between 3.5 and 3.75 inches below the crown race seat [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , below where the fork inserts into the head tube] with scraping around in this area that leads to the inboard surface of the left fork blade\"; that the front wheel has one broken spoke, but \"[t]he direction of the overload that caused the spoke to break cannot be determined\n   by the spoke alone\"; and that \"[t]he valve stem of the inner tube [of the front wheel] is bent from a load that is opposite the direction of rotation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, 6.) Later in the report, it becomes clear that the broken spoke was immediately adjacent to the bent valve stem. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bretting also noted that the parts of the bicycle that normally sit closest to the ground,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the crank arms and the chain rings, showed \"no signs of ground contact.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As for his opinions, Bretting disputes Kappius's statement\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   that there is no indication of undue applied stresses to the bicycle frame; to the contrary, there is abundant physical evidence of stress being applied at the aft facing surface of the left fork blade, which then translated into force on the forks being applied by the rider pitching over the front as described below.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7, \u00b6 1(a).) This opinion foreshadows the bulk of Bretting's remaining opinions, which largely comprise a description of how a foreign object must have been picked up and carried by the valve stem or a spoke until it lodged against the aft surface of the fork blade, which bent the valve stem and then lodged against the adjacent spoke, causing the wheel to suddenly stop rotating, in turn causing Olivero and the rearward portion of his bicycle to pitch forward around the axis created by the now-immobilized front wheel. That forward pitch caused an enormous amount of stress on the spoke and the forks, causing both to break. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8, \u00b6\u00b6 2-5.) But, says Bretting, Olivero would have pitched forward and off his bike in any event (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , even if the fork had not broken) given the sudden stoppage of the front wheel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) Bretting's reconstruction of this scenario contains details at the millisecond level,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , how long it would take for a foreign object to be picked up and carried until it hit the back of the fork, how quickly the fork would have snapped, etc. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Bretting also offered the following attacks on Kappius's opinions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   The loads required to break a spoke of the front wheel were in the order of magnitude of 400 to 500 lbs. A load of this magnitude is only created when the bicycle and rider are pitching over with an object wedged between the back of the fork and a spoke.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   The cracking on the under surface of the fork crown is further evidence of a large rearward load being applied to the fork blades.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   During normal riding the fork is in [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] forward bending. The load on the fork on a smooth road with a 160 lb rider with his hands on the brake hoods is between 72 and 144 lbs. If the fork was to break under those circumstances, the front wheel would move forward away from the rest of the bicycle. As the front wheel moves away, the bicycle will drop toward the ground with either the large chain ring or a crank arm impacting the ground first followed by the upper fracture surface of the fork blades.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   The lack of physical evidence of ground contact to the chain rings, crankarms, chain, and the upper fracture surfaces of the fork blades is inconsistent with the fork failing during normal riding loads.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8, \u00b6\u00b6 7-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Oliveros' Objections to Bretting's Report\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Failure to Submit the Report in the Form of an Affidavit or Declaration\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Trek attached Bretting's expert report as-is to its summary judgment motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Oliveros, in their response brief, objected that Bretting's opinions are not competent summary judgment evidence in that form, but must be in the form of an affidavit or declaration. (ECF No. 49 at 14.) Trek, in its reply brief, attached an affidavit from Bretting attesting that he would testify consistent with his expert report. (ECF No. 63-2.) He expressed no new opinions in that affidavit. Unsatisfied, the Oliveros filed their Motion to Strike Reply Evidence, opening with a gratuitous\n   <em>\n    ad hominem\n   </em>\n   : \"It appears that Trek simply cannot figure out how to procedurally pursue a summary judgment motion. Further motion practice is therefore necessary.\" (ECF No. 78 at 1.) The Oliveros argue that Bretting's reply affidavit is simply too late. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   It is difficult to understand how such a petty and easily correctable issue could be worthy of motion practice. Unfortunately, the Oliveros' counsel have company-the Court has recently faced this issue in multiple cases. The resolution here is the same as before:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court is frankly tired of addressing this utterly formalistic and baseless (yet surprisingly common) objection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pertile v.

Trek disclosed Bretting as a rebuttal expert, but, according to Trek, Bretting's opinions go well beyond proper rebuttal. (ECF No. 68.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   A proper rebuttal expert opinion is one offered \"solely to contradict or rebut evidence on the same subject matter identified by another party\" through that party's affirmative expert disclosures. Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(D)(ii). Understanding whether any of Bretting's opinions are proper rebuttal opinions requires keeping in mind the following three statements that Kappius made in his report:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   \u2022 \"There is no indication in the region of the failure that there was [a]n impact to the fork legs from a foreign object prior to or contributing to the failure.\" (ECF No. 68-1 at 14.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   \u2022 \"There is no indication of undue applied stresses to the bicycle from, but not limited to,...abnormal external forces.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   \u2022 \"With the evidence available to date, all signs point toward spontaneous and catastrophic failure of the fork that can only be attributed to underlying defects.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Given these statements, Bretting remained within the realm of proper rebuttal by offering contrary opinions,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that there\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   an indication in the region of the failure of an impact from a foreign object; that there\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   an indication of undue applied\n   stresses from abnormal external forces; and that \"all signs\" do\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   point toward spontaneous failure that can only be attributed to underlying defects. Bretting was also entitled to explain why he believes these opinions are true, namely, why the evidence leads him to believe that a foreign object became lodged in the spokes and then against the back of the fork, causing a pitch-over event that led both to the fork breaking and Olivero tumbling over the handlebars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Oliveros argue that \"[t]his fanciful defense theory could have never been foreseen by Plaintiffs as an alternative cause that had to be ruled out.\" (ECF No. 68 at 11.) They even go so far as to claim that Bretting's theory \"was about as expected and fanciful as Mr. Olivero being somehow stricken by unseen lightning descending from the heavens!\" (ECF No. 77 at 8.) This is simply not true. Kappius's report specifically describes whether he saw evidence of a foreign object, or of undue external forces, or of any potential cause aside from a latent defect. He says he did not. Bretting says he did. The jury will decide whose opinions are more plausible, but Kappius's report shows that a theory such as Bretting's was at least foreseeable. Accordingly, the Court finds that paragraphs 1-2 and 4-15 of Bretting's \"Opinions\" section (ECF No. 68-2 at 7-9) are proper rebuttal opinions that may be tested through cross-examination, as with all other admissible expert testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Paragraph 3 of Bretting's \"Opinions\" section, however, requires a different result. This paragraph goes far beyond an opinion that the damage to the bike is consistent with a foreign object lodging in the spokes. It instead provides a millisecond-by-millisecond account of how Bretting believes the accident played out. It is, in other words, an affirmative accident reconstruction opinion. Its apparent primary purpose is to show how a fork failure caused by a foreign object could happen so quickly that it would be indistinguishable to most eyewitnesses from spontaneous failure-which is what the eyewitnesses here said that they saw. This is not offered solely to contradict or rebut Kappius's report, and should have been disclosed no later than the affirmative expert deadline, thus giving the Oliveros a chance to provide a rebuttal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The question at this point is the proper remedy. The default remedy is exclusion, per Rule 37(c)(1). However, the Court will give the Oliveros a choice between exclusion or obtaining a rebuttal to Bretting's paragraph 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the Oliveros choose to obtain a rebuttal report, the Court will set an appropriate deadline that accommodates the quickly approaching trial. The Oliveros' choice has no effect on the outcome of Trek's summary judgment arguments, as will become clear in Part IV, below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    III. THE OLIVEROS' MOTION TO STRIKE REPLY EVIDENCE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Yet another evidentiary motion stands in the way of the Court's summary judgment analysis. The Oliveros have moved to strike an affidavit submitted with Trek's summary judgment reply brief. (ECF No. 78.) The context for this motion is as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Oliveros' response brief argues that a disputed issue of fact exists regarding whether the fork was actually manufactured according to proper standards because, among other reasons, Trek wanted\n   to obtain Martec's precise technical specifications for its carbon fiber fabrication process, but Martec balked due to trade secret concerns, and Trek backed off. (ECF No. 49 at 22-23, \u00b6\u00b6 41-45.) The implication, of course, is that Trek was not as careful as it claimed to be. The Oliveros also argued from a blueprint of the fork containing a footnote stating, \"Failure mode must be ductile [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , bending without breaking] and within the aluminum parts. Failure in the carbon legs is not permitted.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25, \u00b6\u00b6 51-53 (internal quotation marks omitted).) The Oliveros compare this to the fact that the legs of the fork in question\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   fail, thus attempting to raise the inference that the fork did not conform to manufacturing specifications. Finally, the Oliveros argued that Trek's evidence regarding Martec's testing of forks after their manufacture is inadmissible hearsay because, among other reasons, Trek had not shown that Martec was \"under a business duty or compulsion to provide accurate information to qualify for the reliability and trustworthiness rationale of the [business records] exception [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Fed. R. Evid. 803(6) ].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   To address all of these assertions, Trek submitted with its reply brief an affidavit of Stephen Moechnig, a Trek engineer who actually designed the model of fork that failed in this case. (ECF No. 63-6.) Moechnig explained that, once Trek decided not to press Martec on the trade secret issue, it chose instead to create a system by which every Martec fork would undergo load testing to ensure proper manufacturing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-28.) As for the blueprint describing the ductile \"failure mode\" requirement, Moechnig explained that the blueprint was referring to a \"Frontal Impact test, which was intended to simulate a cyclist's front wheel colliding with an immobile obstruction.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) Lastly, concerning Martec's business duty, Moechnig claimed that Martec was indeed under a business duty by way of a particular contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Seeking to exclude this affidavit from Moechnig, the Oliveros first object that submitting evidence with a summary judgment reply brief is simply not allowed. (ECF No. 78 at 5-7.) The undersigned enforces no such restriction. To be sure, evidence attached to a reply brief rarely eliminates a dispute over a material fact. But there is no blanket procedural exclusion of such evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Oliveros additionally object that Moechnig's statements are the sort that one would expect to be backed up by documentary evidence, yet Trek produced no such evidence during discovery. (ECF No. 78 at 7-13.) The Oliveros' insinuation is that Trek and/or Moechnig are simply making things up now, or that an egregious discovery violation took place. Trek responds by affirming that it has produced all documents responsive to the Oliveros' discovery requests and all documents that it must produce under Rule 26. (ECF No. 81 at 13.) They further affirm that Moechnig's affidavit \"is based on Mr. Moechnig's extensive personal knowledge and experience as the Trek engineer who personally designed and oversaw the production of the Fork on behalf of Trek.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Court agrees with the Oliveros to the extent that the matters addressed in the Moechnig affidavit are the sort of thing one would normally expect leave a paper trail. But it is not beyond belief that a paper trail never existed, or no longer exists. Trek's attorneys have now represented as officers of the Court that they and their client have complied with discovery obligations. In such circumstances, the Court has no basis to look behind counsel's representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Given this, the Court finds nothing objectionable about the Moechnig affidavit. It\n   provides additional detail to rebut arguments raised by the Oliveros in their response briefs. It is therefore typical reply-brief evidence. As will become clear below, it does not \"clinch\" summary judgment for Trek, but it is nonetheless appropriately considered at summary judgment. The Oliveros' Motion to Strike Reply Evidence is denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Trek apparently finds this background rule in the requirement that malfunction or damage, without more, does not permit a finding of defect. In other words, for Trek, the general rule is that the \"more\" in \"without more\" must include observation and testing of the item in question to formulate a hypothesis about a certain manufacturing error that likely caused the malfunction. But, says Trek,\n   <em>\n    Union Insurance\n   </em>\n   created a narrow exception in cases where the allegedly defective item can no longer be examined. In those cases, \"more\" can exist by way of circumstantial evidence, including evidence that tends to exclude other causes (as in\n   <em>\n    Union Insurance\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Weir\n   </em>\n   ), or shows that a defect similar to the one allegedly at issue has been found in other specimens of the same product (as in\n   <em>\n    Oja\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The Court doubts that this is the best reading of\n   <em>\n    Union Insurance\n   </em>\n   . In particular, the Court doubts whether the court in\n   <em>\n    Union Insurance\n   </em>\n   was reasoning against the background rule articulated by Trek (as opposed to a background rule that some form of evidence must exist beyond the fact of malfunction, be it direct or circumstantial evidence). But even if Trek has correctly divined the Colorado Court of Appeals's intent in\n   <em>\n    Union Insurance\n   </em>\n   , this Court would still need to address the Oliveros' argument that the Colorado Supreme Court\n   <em>\n    would\n   </em>\n   adopt the malfunction doctrine as stated in Restatement \u00a7 3, if presented with the question. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 49 at 4-5, 35.)

The Colorado Supreme Court disagreed, reasoning that\n   <em>\n    Tull\n   </em>\n   \"did not establish a requirement that plaintiffs must\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   submit the best obtainable evidence under the circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10375523\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/843/1378/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10375523\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/843/1378/\">\n    at 1382-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). \"Were such a requirement always necessary, courts would be required to draw arbitrary lines on what is the best evidence under the circumstances, or whether expert testimony is always necessary.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10375523\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/843/1378/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1383 n.7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   This is fundamentally the same problem raised by Trek's interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Union Insurance\n   </em>\n   . Trek seems to think that\n   <em>\n    Union Insurance\n   </em>\n   establishes an easy, binary distinction: whether the allegedly defective item destroyed itself or not. In real life this question cannot always be answered with a simple yes or no. Accidents of the type at issue here are a good example. Consider a carbon fiber bicycle fork that, through some sort of manufacturing error, conceals a few small air pockets in one particular location. If the fork eventually snaps in that location, would the evidence of the air pockets' existence still be detectable, or would the tearing of the carbon fibers (as visible in the photographs submitted in this case) obliterate the evidence of their existence? What if the accident happens as Bretting says it would,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the front wheel drifts forward and the large chain ring or a crank arm strikes the ground, followed by the upper fracture surface of the fork, potentially scraping away a few millimeters of the upper fracture surface as it grinds against the pavement? In these scenarios, the various pieces of the bicycle are still available for inspection, but it is not clear whether any expertly administered test could detect that air bubbles had once been present at the location of the fracture. Given these complications, courts operating under the rule of\n   <em>\n    Union Insurance\n   </em>\n   (as Trek articulates it) \"would be required to draw arbitrary lines on what is the best evidence under the circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Pomeranz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10375523\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/843/1378/\">\n    843 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1383 n.7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , many states already accept that a plaintiff may pursue a manufacturing defect case solely on circumstantial evidence, without establishing a specific defect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Restatement \u00a7 3, Reporter's Note to cmt. c (citing cases to this effect from, or applying the law of, Arizona, Arkansas, the District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia). Trek has pointed to no jurisdiction that has rejected such a theory, nor can the Court envision a reason for the Colorado Supreme Court to do so. Again, the Colorado Supreme Court has not typically been doctrinaire about the way a plaintiff must go about proving the case-in-chief. Thus, the Court predicts that the Colorado Supreme Court would adopt Restatement \u00a7 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Trek seems to believe it is significant that the Oliveros did not even try to perform any special testing on the fork. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 63 at 8 (\"Because Plaintiffs elected to forgo any analysis of the available physical evidence-including something as basic as measuring the Fork-they are not entitled to an evidentiary inference of defect.\" (emphasis removed)).) This seems like a fact to be elicited on cross-examination. It is not a fatal legal flaw in the Oliveros' case. The basic problem against which Trek struggles is the reality that a plaintiff may choose to go to trial on less-than-ideal evidence, so long as the evidence is not so weak that no reasonable jury could find in the plaintiff's favor. That is the real question here, to which the Court turns next.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Sufficiency of the Oliveros' Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Again, Restatement \u00a7 3 permits a plaintiff to present a circumstantial manufacturing defect case, \"without proof of a specific defect,\" if the plaintiff can prove that the harm-causing incident \"(a) was of a kind that ordinarily occurs as a result of product defect,\" and \"(b) was not, in the particular case, solely the result of causes other than product defect existing at the time of sale or distribution.\" Trek challenges both elements, and so the Court will discuss both in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    \"Was of a Kind That Ordinarily Occurs as a Result of Product Defect\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The Oliveros have presented sufficient evidence of this element through at least the following.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   First, \"Trek has admitted that, absent a manufacturing defect, absent prior damage, and absent an overloading event, this fork should not fail under normal riding conditions.\" (ECF No. 49 at 22, \u00b6 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Second, Trek's own literature regarding the fork at issue here states,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   In an accident or impact that does not break the carbon fiber, the carbon fiber could have internal or hidden damage but appear normal....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    WARNING: A carbon fiber part that has damage can break suddenly, causing serious injury or death. Carbon fiber can conceal damage from an impact or crash....\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   (ECF No. 49-23.) Although these statements refer to accidental damage, the principle that carbon fiber can conceal a flaw and then suddenly fail is certainly relevant here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Third, Trek does not dispute the following characterization of Moechnig's deposition testimony:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   [t]here are a variety of potential failures in the manufacturing process for carbon fiber at Martec that are highly technical in nature and involve a lot of hand labor, such as the carbon fiber-to-resin ratio, a gap where there is no carbon fiber leaving a thin spot in the layer, the operator not following the production standards,\n   using the incorrect size and angles of the sheets of carbon fiber in the lay-up, problems with bonding, \"kitting\", curing with a heated press ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   (ECF No. 49 at 23, \u00b6 47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   This evidence, if presented to a jury, would be enough for the jury to find the first element satisfied. To be sure, Trek can present contrary evidence, such as its assertion that braking to a stop would likely place more pressure on the fork than the normal riding conditions that, according to the Oliveros, led to its failure. But Trek's evidence is not so overwhelming that a reasonable jury would be forced to reject the Oliveros' case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    \"Was Not, in the Particular Case, Solely the Result of Causes Other Than Product Defect Existing at the Time of Sale or Distribution\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The Oliveros have presented sufficient evidence of this element through at least the following. First, from the eyewitnesses' perspective, Olivero's bicycle simply collapsed underneath him-they saw no foreign object. Second, post-accident investigation located nothing that might qualify as the foreign object necessary for Bretting's theory to be correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Trek argues that the Oliveros have nonetheless failed to plausibly rule out alternative causes. (ECF No. 63 at 13-14.) But the Oliveros need not definitively do so-they only need evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude it is more likely than not that the accident did not result solely from something other than a manufacturing defect.\n   <em>\n    Cf\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Weir\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1164931\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/811/1387/\">\n    811 F.2d at 1392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (applying\n   <em>\n    Union Insurance\n   </em>\n   and noting that \"[e]vidence offered by the defendant that is contrary to the evidence offered by the plaintiff creates a question for the jury; it does not prevent the jury from relying upon the plaintiff's evidence and inferring a defect\"). On the record presented here, the Oliveros have sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that no foreign object existed, while Trek has presented evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that a foreign object\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   exist. In such circumstances, summary judgment is inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Result\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   To the extent the evidence at trial reflects what the Court has seen in the summary judgment record, the Oliveros would be entitled to a jury instruction consistent with Restatement \u00a7 3. Thus, the jury would be permitted to decide whether the two elements of Restatement \u00a7 3 have been satisfied, and if so, the jury would be permitted-although not required-to infer that a manufacturing defect of unknown nature caused the fork to fail. Trek's summary judgment motion will therefore be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    V. TREK'S OBJECTION TO KAPPIUS'S RESPONSE AFFIDAVIT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Responding to Trek's argument that\n   <em>\n    Union Insurance\n   </em>\n   requires testing if the object remains available for inspection, the Oliveros submitted a supplemental affidavit from Kappius. There, Kappius attempted to explain why he had not performed any tests on the forks:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   Knowledge of the actual manufacturing specifications, including the specific fiber, epoxy types, and layup schedule, would be extremely important, if not essential, in any further analysis to determine if [the fork] was manufactured according to the manufacturing specifications and why the design specification was apparently not adhered to.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   None-the-less, any further analysis that would be necessary to potentially uncover the common and well-known sources of carbon fiber catastrophic failures,\n   such as porosity or voids in the carbon fiber, delamination of layers, or improper layup of the carbon fiber layers would require the development of a detailed and expensive protocol involving destructive testing of the carbon fiber fork, which testing should minimally include the following: dissection, optical and scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, dynamic mechanical analysis, and mechanical testing, and, because the Chinese manufacturer's specifications are unavailable, comparative analysis with an exemplar of another fork of the same make and model number.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   However, given the nature of carbon fiber failure, and the fracture in this case, which can often obliterate the actual defect involved, any such testing would not necessarily be conclusive or determinative of the existence or non-existence of such a manufacturing defect, with the likelihood of revealing the source of the failure being substantially less than 100%.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   I was never authorized or requested to perform such further testing and that is the reason why I cannot further identify the specific manufacturing defect(s) in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   (ECF No. 49-22 \u00b6\u00b6 11-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Trek, in its summary judgment reply brief, objects to the admissibility of these statements as an untimely expert disclosure. (ECF No. 63 at 10 n.7.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the circumstances, the Court agrees. Kappius's additional information is the sort of information that he should have disclosed in his original expert report, and his failure to do so deprived Trek of an opportunity to rebut these claims (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , to argue that these tests are not as complicated as they sound, that a simpler test could yield useful results, that testing would not necessarily be futile, etc.). The Court will therefore give Trek the same choice it gave the Oliveros above: Trek must elect between exclusion or obtaining a rebuttal to these new opinions. If Trek elects to obtain a rebuttal, the Court will set an appropriate deadline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.

Dr. Yarnell's treatment note for that visit includes the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   This is a one-year intensive follow-up ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   His wife says the only noticeable change cognitively and personality wise may be a somewhat shortened frustration tolerance....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   Michael is interested in getting a final evaluation as to the extent of his injuries. We will obtain an MRI of the brain and an EEG and also we will get formal neuropsychological testing and be able to summarize the extent of his injuries.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   (ECF No. 66-6 at 1-2.) Regarding the neuropsychological testing, Dr. Yarnell referred Olivero to George Rossie, PhD.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 24 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   On June 2, 2016, U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael J. Watanabe entered the Scheduling Order in this action. (ECF No. 16.) The Scheduling Order set November 18, 2016 as the deadline for expert witness disclosures. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   In written discovery responses dated September 27, 2016, Olivero described his injuries, in relevant part, as follows: \"Head injury symptoms remain that include persistent tiredness, sequencing and short-term memory difficulties, lack of concentration, fatigue and in particular, difficulty with multitasking challenges. Head injuries appear permanent.\" (ECF No. 47-1 at 2.) But Olivero answered \"[n]o further treatment is advised at this time\" to Trek's request that he \"[i]dentify in detail each health care provider who has advised that you may require future or additional treatment for any injuries you attribute to the [accident].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   On the expert disclosure deadline (November 18, 2016), the Oliveros disclosed five non-retained treating doctors as experts under Rule 26(a)(2)(C), all of whom would testify \"consistent with [their] records\" about the injuries they diagnosed and the services they provided in response. (ECF No. 47-5 at 2-4.) Among these non-retained experts was Dr. Yarnell. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4.) None of the summaries of the doctors' expected testimony included a statement about ongoing or permanent cognitive problems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   The Oliveros were deposed on December 21 and 22, 2016. They testified at those depositions that Michael Olivero has consistently suffered a number of mental and emotional symptoms since the accident, such as depression, frustration, feelings of being overwhelmed, difficulty managing schedules, difficulty multitasking, forgetfulness, and a short temper. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 47-2, 47-3, 66-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   This state of the evidence apparently left Trek unsure about whether and how the Oliveros intended to prove some sort of permanent cognitive impairment. On the rebuttal expert deadline (January 6, 2017), Trek disclosed Ernest Nitka, M.D., a neurologist. (ECF No. 47-6.) Dr. Nitka opined, among other things, that \"Mr. Olivero would need to submit to high-quality neuropsychometric testing in an effort to validate his complaints. Additionally[,] without this neuropsychometric testing, we don't know whether or not there are remedial actions that would help him in his daily life [to] mitigate his complaints stemming from the accident.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   The Oliveros claim that, \"[c]onsistent with [Dr. Nitka's] recommendations, on January 23, 2017, an EEG and MRI were performed.\" (ECF No. 66 at 4.) Two days after those procedures, Dr. Rossie-the psychologist to whom Olivero had been referred the previous May-began neuropsychological testing that lasted through March 14, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   On January 31, 2017, the Oliveros moved to amend the Scheduling Order \"to allow\n   Plaintiffs additional time to supplement their [expert] Disclosures.\" (ECF No. 24 at 1.) As grounds for such relief, the Oliveros explained as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n   Dr. Philip Yarnell saw [Michael] in the hospital and diagnosed him with cerebral contusions from this bike crash. Dr. Philip Yarnell was disclosed as a Non-Retained FRCP Rule 26(a)(2) Expert on November 16, 2016, but Dr. Yarnell has continued to treat Plaintiff Michael Olivero and should be able to supplement his opinions as more information is provided. By way of example, Dr. Yarnell prescribed Plaintiff Michael Olivero to get more care including an MRI, EEG testing, and a neuropsychological evaluation from Dr. George Rossi[e] on May 23, 2016. Documentation of this prescription and report was provided to Defense Counsel. However, the actual MRI and visit with Dr. Rossi[e] did not occur until January of 2017. Plaintiff Michael Olivero is getting much needed treatment for his brain injury, as this type of injury is difficult to fully diagnose. Plaintiff seeks until March 24, 2017 to file supplemental expert reports for Dr. Yarnell and Dr. Rossi[e] about their opinions regarding Plaintiff Michael Olivero['s] injuries, bills, diagnosis, and prognosis from the bike crash.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Trek opposed this motion. (ECF No. 26.) Trek emphasized that Michael Olivero had been referred by Dr. Yarnell in May 2016 for an MRI, EEG, and neuropsychological testing-many months before the November 2016 expert disclosure deadline. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17, 22-23, 29-30.) Trek also noted Olivero's deposition testimony claiming that he was still waiting for insurance approval of the MRI, and that he had made an appointment with Dr. Rossie soon after Dr. Yarnell's referral, but on the day of the appointment, he simply did not feel like going and so he canceled it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) Trek accordingly argued that the Oliveros failed to meet the \"excusable neglect\" standard necessary for modifying a scheduling order deadline that has already passed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4-8, 33-38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   While this motion was pending, Dr. Rossie issued a written report regarding the outcome of the neuropsychological testing. (ECF No. 66-12.) Dr. Rossie diagnosed some \"deficits [that] are subtle but notable especially in the high-level tasks measured by executive function tests.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) He also reported Angela Olivero's opinion that Michael \"has problems with sequencing, memory for recent events and multitasking with a 'lower boiling point'. She does not think things have changed over the past year.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, Dr. Rossie did not recommend \"formal neuropsychological therapies.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   On April 5, 2017, Judge Watanabe denied the Oliveros' motion to modify the scheduling order. (ECF No. 44.) Judge Watanabe agreed with Trek that \"Plaintiffs offer no reason, compelling or otherwise, why Plaintiff Michael Olivero failed to seek and obtain additional medical treatment, including the MRI and neuropsychological evaluation from Dr. Rossie, before [the expert disclosure] deadline.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) The Oliveros never filed a Rule 72(a) objection to this ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   On May 4, 2017, Michael Olivero visited Dr. Yarnell again for a \"neurologic follow up.\" (ECF No. 66-15 act 1.) Dr. Yarnell's treatment note for this visit shows that he reviewed Dr. Rossie's report, as well as reports of a recent EEG and MRI (apparently those conducted in January 2017). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Yarnell diagnosed, among other things, \"some post-traumatic encephalopathy symptoms.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.) He did not specifically state what those symptoms were.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Instant Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   On April 27, 2017, Trek filed the motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   now under consideration, seeking\n   to exclude \"any evidence regarding Plaintiffs' alleged future damages related to Mr. Olivero's brain injury.\" (ECF No. 47 at 10.) Trek's motion notes that the Oliveros had, through their Rule 26 disclosures, disclosed six lay witnesses (described as \"friends, coworkers, and family\") who intended \"to testify regarding their observations of Mr. Olivero before and after the accident.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 21.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Trek argues that the medical causation question (whether Olivero's bike accident caused the cognitive symptoms of which he now complains) and the permanence question (whether the symptoms can be expected to last indefinitely) require expert testimony. Thus, Trek says, lay testimony from the Oliveros and their witnesses about Michael Olivero's changed behavior is not enough. Trek further argues that the treating physicians may testify as experts only with respect to matters reflected in their treatment records, and cannot offer a long-term prognosis if not already reflected in those records. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 15-18, 21-23.)\n   <em>\n    Cf\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

(ECF No. 66 at 7-10.) They also point to\n   <em>\n    Tran v. Hilburn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11874723\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/948/52/#p55\">\n    948 P.2d 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 55 (Colo.

(ECF No. 66 at 2.) Moreover, they claim, \"[t]he fact of head trauma is unquestioned, no alternative explanations for the continuing problems have been suggested, and they are consistent with sequelae of the initial injury.... In such a case, expert testimony is not required and permanency and continued future noneconomic damages may be inferred.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Concerning permanent injury and future damages, Colorado case law is consistent with the observation this Court made above (Part IV.B.2), namely, it avoids holding that expert testimony is always required for some set of theories or claims. But it does not rule out the possibility that expert testimony may be required under the circumstances of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Trek relies on two Colorado Supreme Court cases where a jury verdict was reversed and the case was remanded for new trial when the plaintiff was allowed to seek damages for permanent injury and future pain solely on the plaintiff's own testimony. The first of these cases is\n   <em>\n    Cookman v. Caldwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5284432\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/colo/64/206/\">\n    64 Colo. 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=170%20P.%20952\">\n    170 P. 952\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1918), where the plaintiff complained of a battery that injured her shoulder and back, leading to a persisting problem of arm swelling\n   and back pain when trying to lift objects or do certain chores.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=170%20P.%20952\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=170%20P.%20952\">\n    at 953\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Colorado Supreme Court held under the circumstances that such testimony was not enough:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-171\">\n   In the case at bar there was no evidence of a patent physical fact, such as the loss of a limb or any other physical impairment, that would by observation be apparent to the jury, and show that the plaintiff had received a permanent injury or would necessarily suffer pain for some period of time, or would be affected in health and strength in the future. The evidence did not show to a reasonable certainty that the plaintiff would endure pain and suffering in the future as a result of the assault and battery complained of. The testimony of the plaintiff was all concerning a latent injury which was not apparent, and would leave the jury to conjecture whether or not it would affect her future health and strength.\n   <em>\n    The facts narrated by plaintiff were not such that, as a matter of common knowledge, some future pain and suffering would be inevitable\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=170%20P.%20952\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   The second case cited by Trek is\n   <em>\n    Barter Machinery &amp; Supply Co. v.

In this case, the plaintiff was knocked down by a watchdog but his \"injuries were slight, and the evidence was that he suffered a bruise on his right buttock about four inches in diameter and two abrasions on his lower left thigh.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 804. \"He testified that he had continuous lower back pain, but there was no medical evidence connecting his complaints to the slight injury sustained when the dog knocked him to the ground.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"In fact, the medical testimony was that the back pains were consistent with an arthritic condition, unrelated to the incident, and attributable to plaintiff's advanced age.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The trial court therefore erred when it instructed the jury on permanent injury and future pain.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 805 (citing\n   <em>\n    Cookman\n   </em>\n   in support).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   The following year, the Colorado Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    CeBuzz, Inc. v.

The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    CeBuzz\n   </em>\n   sued a grocery store when she was bitten on the hand \"by a tarantula spider or similar spider-like insect\" hidden in a bunch of bananas that she was waiting to purchase.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 458. She won at trial, including an award for permanent disability and future pain and suffering, and the defendant appealed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 458, 461. The \"main thrust\" of the defendant's appeal from this portion of the damages award was \"that medical testimony is indispensable to the establishment of permanent disability, future pain or suffering, or future medical expense.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 461. The defendant cited\n   <em>\n    Barter Machinery\n   </em>\n   for that proposition, but the Colorado Supreme Court distinguished it as a case about \"slight injuries\" and potentially competing medical causes (being knocked down vs. pre-existing arthritis ).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-175\">\n   In the instant case, the medical testimony and the plaintiff's testimony reveals continuous pain in the left arm which started when plaintiff was bitten.

App. 1983). In such circumstances, therefore, an instruction that a jury may infer permanent injury is appropriate, and it is left to the jury to decide whether to draw that inference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lawson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10349404\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/878/127/#p130\">\n    878 P.2d at 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   The Court agrees with the Oliveros that their evidence may be presented in this framework, without expert testimony.\n   <em>\n    CeBuzz\n   </em>\n   establishes that medical causation in Colorado is not quite the inquiry that Trek seems to think it is. A plaintiff is not required to prove (via expert testimony or otherwise) that a certain injury is likely to lead to certain symptoms if: (1) the relationship between the injury and the symptoms is fairly direct;\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) those symptoms did not pre-date the injury. In addition,\n   <em>\n    CeBuzz\n   </em>\n   establishes that the factual question of permanence may be satisfied by evidence of uninterrupted symptoms for two to three years (or more).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   The Oliveros satisfy all of these requirements. First, Michael Olivero indisputably suffered a traumatic brain injury as a result of the accident, and the connection between a serious head injury and later cognitive difficulties is sufficiently direct. Second, he is prepared to present evidence that his current symptoms did not predate the accident. Third, he is prepared to present evidence that those symptoms have persisted. Accordingly, the Oliveros may pursue this theory before a jury and Trek's Motion\n   <em>\n    in Limine\n   </em>\n   will be denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   All that said, a few issues remain in light of statements the Oliveros make in their response brief-statements which amount to an announcement that they intend to evade any restriction on their ability to produce more recently-generated evidence about Michael Olivero's condition. To begin, the Court will\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   permit the Oliveros to introduce evidence of the EEG, MRI, or neuropsychological testing performed in 2017. To permit that evidence to come in through any method (including as Rule 703 evidence with Dr. Yarnell on the stand, through cross-examination of Dr. Nitka, or otherwise) would undermine Judge Watanabe's order, to which the Oliveros never objected. This includes evidence of expenses incurred. Further, Dr. Yarnell will not be permitted to testify about Michael Olivero's May 2017 visit. Dr. Yarnell's treatment notes about that visit are too vague for Trek to be able to prepare adequately for such testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   Finally, with regard to the Oliveros' apparent trial strategy of putting on numerous witnesses to discuss Michael Olivero's personality before and after the accident, the Court will vigorously police the provisions against wasting time and needless cumulative evidence found in Rules 403 and 611(a). In particular, the Court will require an extremely persuasive reason to admit all eight of the witnesses currently designated in the Final Pretrial Order to testify on this topic. The Oliveros are strongly encouraged to present only those witnesses who can provide the most compelling and salient testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   <strong>\n    VII. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Court ORDERS as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   1. Trek's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 33) is DENIED;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   2.

The Oliveros' Motion to Strike Rebuttal Expert (ECF No. 68) is DENIED except as to the third paragraph of Bretting's \"Opinions\" section. As to that paragraph, the Oliveros shall file a notice with the court no later than\n   <strong>\n    November 27, 2017\n   </strong>\n   stating whether they choose to have the Court exclude Bretting's opinions, or whether they instead choose to disclose a rebuttal report as to those opinions;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   4. The Oliveros' Motion to Strike Reply Evidence (ECF No. 78) is DENIED;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   5. Trek shall file a notice with the court no later than\n   <strong>\n    November 27, 2017\n   </strong>\n   stating whether it chooses to have the Court exclude the opinions contained in paragraphs 11-14 of Kappius's supplemental affidavit (ECF No. 49-22), or whether it instead chooses to disclose a rebuttal report as to those opinions;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   6. This matter REMAINS SET for a Final Trial Preparation Conference on January 26, 2018, at 2:00 p.m., and a five-day jury trial beginning on February 12, 2018, all in Courtroom A801 of the Alfred J. Arraj United States Courthouse.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-193\">\n    Any reference in this order solely to \"Olivero\" refers to Michael Olivero.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-194\">\n    In other words, if the bicycle was in forward motion and an observer was watching it from the side, the observer would see the valve stem pass through the fork and then the spoke that ultimately broke would pass through immediately afterward.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-195\">\n    A rebuttal to paragraph 3 would, almost by necessity, likely provide indirect rebuttal to other paragraphs in Bretting's report. This is appropriate, but-should the Oliveros elect to obtain a rebuttal report-the Oliveros are warned not to abuse this opportunity by offering theories that\n    <em>\n     they\n    </em>\n    should have affirmatively disclosed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-196\">\n    The Oliveros are free, of course, to cross-examine Moechnig regarding the lack of a paper trail, to the extent his direct testimony includes discussion of the issues addressed in his affidavit.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-197\">\n    The major exception, it seems, is professional negligence claims-although even in that context the Colorado Supreme Court has not spoken categorically.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Redden v.

See WJM Revised Practice Standard III.B (requiring a separate motion to obtain relief, except in certain circumstances such as \"objections to summary judgment evidence\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-199\">\n    The parties repeatedly spell Dr. Rossie's name as \"Rossi,\" but his own report shows that he spells his name \"Rossie.\" (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 66-12.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-200\">\n    The Final Pretrial Order, entered a few weeks after Trek filed its motion in limine, lists eight friends, family members, and coworkers as may-call witnesses for the Oliveros \"as to damages.\" (ECF No. 71 at 8-10.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-201\">\n    This requirement is not discussed explicitly in the Colorado cases, but is certainly implicit. For example, the woman bitten on her left hand by the spider in\n    <em>\n     CeBuzz\n    </em>\n    experienced pain and weakness her left arm. But if she had instead complained of intestinal problems, or a sudden onset of arthritis in her ankles, it is much more likely she would have needed to present expert evidence on medical causation. This is essentially no different from the general rule that \"lay testimony about medical causation [is permitted] in cases where causation is fairly obvious.\"\n    <em>\n     Llewellyn v.

Colo. May 5, 2015).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-202\">\n    To be clear, the Court's ruling does not rely on the fact that\n    <em>\n     Tran\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , described the lingering effects of closed-head injuries. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Part VI.B, above.) Simply because symptoms of a medical condition are described in case law does not mean that laypersons understand the condition or the symptoms.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
