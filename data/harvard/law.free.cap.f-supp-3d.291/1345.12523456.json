The parties litigated this case for approximately five years, at the end of which the Court denied Defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, denied Plaintiff's partial motion for summary judgment, and granted Defendant's motion for summary judgment. (Docs. 254, 255.) The Court ordered the case closed on October 30, 2015, and Plaintiff appealed the Court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Defendant. Shortly after, Defendant filed a Bill of Costs on November 30, 2015. (Doc. 260.) Plaintiff objected to Defendant's Bill of Costs on several grounds and sought to stay the taxation of costs until the Eleventh Circuit had decided his appeal. (Doc. 264.) The Court granted Plaintiff's request to stay the case pending the Eleventh Circuit's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On November 8, 2016, the Eleventh Circuit reversed this Court's grant of summary judgment on the merits. The Eleventh Circuit held that Plaintiff's FCA claim had previously been publicly disclosed, and therefore this Court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the case.\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

Moreover, a losing party's good faith and limited financial resources are not sufficient on their own to overcome the presumption in favor of awarding costs.\n   <em>\n    Pickett v.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant seeks $167,853.63 in its Bill of Costs. The costs fall into the following three categories under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201920\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-23\"><strong>Cost Category</strong> <strong>Proposed Cost</strong> 1. Fees of the Clerk $ 450.00 2. Fees for printed or electronically recorded transcripts $ 22,335.39 necessarily obtained for use in the case 3. Fees for exemplification and the costs of making copies $ 145,068.24 of any materials where the copies are necessarily obtained for use in the case <strong>TOTAL</strong> $ 167,853.63</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendant attached invoices to support its claim for these costs, including invoices for court fees, deposition transcripts and videotaping, pre-trial hearing transcripts, e-discovery copying costs, and physical document copying costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiff objects to the taxation of these costs for multiple reasons. For one, he emphasizes that this was a close, hard-fought case involving difficult and complex legal issues. He asserts that he pursued this litigation in good faith and prevailed on key issues, such as defeating Defendant's two motions to dismiss and proving falsity under the FCA at summary judgment. Plaintiff further asserts that Defendant engaged in obstructive discovery conduct, which necessitated his motion to compel discovery and his motion for sanctions. Given his financial situation and unemployment status, Plaintiff claims that he is unable to pay costs of $167,853.63. Based on principles of equity under Rule 54, Plaintiff asks the Court to deny Defendant's request for costs. Additionally, Plaintiff makes a non-equitable argument for denying certain costs (as opposed to all costs). Plaintiff asserts that Defendant seeks e-discovery related costs that do not constitute \"copying\" costs under \u00a7 1920, and therefore these costs must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In reply, Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not carried his burden of showing that the total requested costs should not be awarded. Defendant cites to cases stating that neither complex litigation nor good faith by the losing party is a sufficient basis, in and of itself, for denying costs. Moreover, a Court may consider a losing party's inability to pay, but only if there is substantial documentation showing so. Defendant also asserts that it did not engage in obstructive or bad faith conduct, since its failure to produce certain documents was a mistake, not intentional. With respect to Plaintiff's argument about improper copying costs under \u00a7 1920, Defendant argues that its claimed e-discovery costs are proper because they relate to digital activities that courts have found to constitute \"copying\" (e.g., TIFF conversion, metadata extraction).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Fees of the Clerk, Deposition-Related Fees, and Pre-trial Hearing Transcript Fees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendant represents that it is entitled to $450 for fees of the Clerk. These fees are for pro hac vice applications for three \"experienced FCA lawyers whose participation was necessary.\" (Doc. 261 at 4.) Plaintiff does not specifically object to this request, and the Court finds that it is reasonable. The Court awards the fees of the Clerk to Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Additionally, Defendant seeks $22,335.39 in costs for deposition transcripts, videos, and exhibits. These costs are associated with sixteen different depositions of thirteen individuals, and Plaintiff noticed depositions for roughly half of these individuals. The Court has also reviewed the parties' summary judgment and motion to dismiss briefings, and it is evident that both sides relied on these depositions to support their arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant's request for these fees is reasonable, and Plaintiff has not sufficiently demonstrated otherwise. The Court therefore awards these costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Similar reasoning applies to Defendant's request for $525.20 for pre-trial hearing transcript costs, though the Court does not award all of these costs. These costs cover the transcripts for the following: the May 21, 2012 status conference; the January 11, 2013 phone conference regarding the status of the case; the June 17, 2014 oral arguments regarding Plaintiff's motion for sanctions; and the August 13, 2015 oral arguments regarding the motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court finds all of these costs to be reasonable except for the transcript costs for the June 17, 2014 oral arguments regarding Plaintiff's motion for sanctions. As Plaintiff points out, the costs associated with its motion for sanctions arise directly from Defendant's problematic conduct. In particular, the issue was that Defendant produced relevant emails (including a potentially \"smoking gun\" email) at some later date that it should have produced much earlier-especially given that Plaintiff had already taken several depositions of Fresenius employees by that point. The Court held a hearing to better understand whether this was an \"innocent mistake\" or was \"indicative of something more serious.\" (Doc. 189 at 19.) The Court ultimately denied as moot Plaintiff's motion for sanctions because the parties had reached an agreement resolving the issue. (Doc. 193 at 52.) However, even if Defendant did not intentionally withhold the relevant email documents, it was undeniable that Defendant did not act swiftly to correct its error upon discovering it. (Doc. 193 at 16-17.) Defendant's delay on this issue alone resulted in a 150-day extension of discovery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45.) The Court does not find that Defendant acted in bad faith per se, though the record shows that Defendant could have been more diligent and forthcoming during discovery.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Moody Nat. Bank of Galveston v. GE Life &amp; Annuity Assur. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2792572\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/423/651/#p652\">\n    423 F.Supp.2d 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 652 (S.D. Tex. 2003).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Upon weighing the equities, the Court finds that Defendant is not entitled to the $70.20 transcript cost associated with the sanctions hearing. The Court awards Defendant $455.00 for the three other pre-trial hearing transcripts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Fees for Exemplification: ESI and Hard Copies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendant seeks discovery-related copying costs for hard copies and for copying electronically stored information (\"ESI\"). With respect to hard copies, Defendant requests $7,687.76 for copies of deposition exhibits, documents in preparation for depositions, and exhibits for summary judgment briefings (i.e., physical courtesy copies provided to the court). Defendant has properly documented these costs in Exhibit C(3) and stated a reasonable basis for them. Plaintiff does not specifically object to these hard copy costs aside from his general objections. The Court finds that Plaintiff has not overcome the presumption that Defendant is entitled to these costs and therefore awards them to Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Defendant's request for $137,380.48 for ESI costs is another matter. These costs make up over 80 percent of Defendant's Bill of Costs, yet Defendant has not carried its initial burden of demonstrating that these costs are authorized under federal law. In particular, Plaintiff objects to these costs on the grounds that they do not constitute \"copying\" as contemplated by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201920\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4), and the Court finds some merit to this argument after reviewing Defendant's invoices.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As a preliminary matter, the Court examines the case law on this issue. The\n   Eleventh Circuit has not directly ruled on whether e-discovery-related copying costs are recoverable. However, in a case relied on by both parties, the Federal Circuit applied Eleventh Circuit law on this very issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CBT Flint Partners, LLC v. Return Path, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3732153\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/737/1320/#p1326\">\n    737 F.3d 1320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2013). In deciding what e-discovery costs are included in the scope of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201920\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4), the Federal Circuit adopted a three-tiered framework to analyze the services provided by e-discovery vendors: (1) copying electronic documents as a whole from their source material (e.g., a computer hard drive); (2) organizing the electronic materials into a database; indexing, decrypting, and de-duplicating the materials; and then filtering and reviewing the materials to determine which ones are privileged or responsive to discovery requests; and (3) exporting electronic documents onto deliverable memory media, such as a hard drive or a DVD.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201920\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201920\">\n    at 1328-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Federal Circuit determined that activities falling within the second category are most likely\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   taxable as costs, whereas activities within the first category are mostly taxable and activities within the third category are taxable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201920\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201920\">\n    at 1331-1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Federal Circuit explained that keyword searches, for example, are mostly related to the document review process as opposed to the copy-making process, and \u00a7 1920(4) does not include document review costs as taxable. Similarly, the act of deduplication is not included under \u00a7 1920(4), since depulication \"is the culling of a set of documents to eliminate duplicate copies of the same document,\" and it is therefore \"pre- or post-copying activity (depending on when the culling is done), not itself the making of copies.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201920\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   While the\n   <em>\n    CBT\n   </em>\n   decision is not controlling, the Court finds\n   <em>\n    CBT\n   </em>\n   persuasive as have other district courts within this circuit.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Akanthos Capital Mgmt., LLC v.

The Court is unable (and certainly not obligated) to wade through the approximately 200 pages of invoices to determine if some of the non-taxable costs overlap with other taxable costs. The Court's discovery of non-taxable costs within these invoices also casts doubt on other itemized costs with general descriptions. For instance, the Court cannot be sure that some of the more general itemizations exclude costs for OCR or de-duplication. And even after Plaintiff raised these sorts of issues in his objections, Defendant did nothing in its Reply to clarify its 200 pages of invoices or the challenged itemizations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiff also raises a number of equitable factors that weigh against a full award of Defendant's requested costs-particularly the large sum of ESI costs at issue.

The Tenth Circuit did not make such a sweeping statement in this decision. It merely found that the complexity factor did not justify denying costs in this particular case. The Tenth Circuit has made clear in subsequent decisions that such a factor may indeed justify denying costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zeran v.

Furthermore, while the Eleventh Circuit has not expressly held one way or the other, the Eleventh Circuit has considered complexity when reviewing and affirming a lower court's decision to award costs.\n   <em>\n    Pickett v.

Consistent with the weight of authority on this issue, the Court therefore considers the complexity of the present case in ruling on Defendant's bill of costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   This case was particularly close and complex as evidenced by its history. Over a five-year period of litigation, the parties briefed two motions to dismiss and two rounds of summary judgment before the case was appealed. Defendant first moved to dismiss based on a lack of subject jurisdiction (among other things), and the Court denied the motion, partly because the Court found Plaintiff to be an \"original source\" for purposes of the FCA. (Doc. 57.) The Court then ordered two waves of discovery and two corresponding rounds of summary judgment briefing in light of the number and complexity of issues in the case. (Doc. 83.) During the first round of summary judgment, the only legal question before the Court was the falsity element of the FCA. The Court found in favor of Plaintiff on the falsity element. The case then proceeded to the second wave of discovery regarding the intent element and other issues, which led to the second round of summary judgment. (Doc. 144.) Altogether, the parties attached nearly 300 exhibits to their respective motions for summary judgment. Around the same time, Defendant filed a second motion to dismiss for lack of subject jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   (Doc. 215.) The Court denied Defendant's second motion to dismiss, again partly based on Plaintiff being an \"original source.\" (Doc. 254.) Turning to the merits of the case, the Court granted summary judgment in favor of Defendant based on insufficient evidence of intent to defraud. The Court's decision on summary judgment alone was 108 pages long. (Doc. 255.) Plaintiff appealed the decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit disagreed with the Court's finding that Plaintiff was an original source under the FCA. The Eleventh Circuit held that the Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction for this reason. Thus, it reversed the Court's summary judgment decision on the merits and remanded the case for entry of a dismissal order. Yet in reaching its decision that Plaintiff was not an original source, the Eleventh Circuit noted the novelty of this particular issue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Given that Saldivar's firsthand knowledge related to inventory and administration of overfill not costs and billing,\n   <em>\n    we now approach a question we have not explicitly addressed previously\n   </em>\n   : whether Saldivar's secondhand knowledge is sufficient to make him an original source....

Effect on other FCA relators\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Another factor courts consider when determining whether to award costs is the possible chilling effect on future plaintiffs. Courts assess the possibility that their award of costs in a given case could deter future plaintiffs from bringing similar claims in good faith. The purpose of the FCA's\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   provision is \"to encourage private individuals who are aware of fraud being perpetrated against the Government to bring such information forward.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel.

This factor is not decisive in itself, since this would mean that courts could routinely deny costs in all FCA cases. Instead, it is one\n   factor among others that could weigh against awarding costs, particularly where the case is complex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Here, Defendant is seeking a significant amount of costs in a close and complex FCA case. Plaintiff also brought this case to challenge Medicare fraud. Specifically, Plaintiff challenged Defendant's practice of billing the federal government for overfill for certain prescriptions-a practice that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services expressly prohibited after this case was filed. Under these circumstances, an award of costs to Defendant could well have a chilling effect on future relators bringing\n   <em>\n    qui tam\n   </em>\n   actions based on Medicare or Medicaid fraud. Thus, this factor weighs against a full award of costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The parties' conduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Court may consider each party's conduct in determining whether to award costs.

Additionally, Plaintiff successfully established the falsity element under the FCA-a significant legal issue-during the first round of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In contrast, Defendant took certain actions during discovery that unnecessarily prolonged the case. At one point, Plaintiff moved to compel production of documents after Defendant refused to produce certain documents under the attorney-client privilege. The Court granted Plaintiff's motion and compelled production because Defendant had attempted to improperly use the attorney-client privilege as both a sword and a shield. Specifically, Defendant had argued that it acted in the good faith belief that its conduct was legal, but when Plaintiff sought discovery on this issue, Defendant turned around and claimed attorney-client privilege. Thus, Defendant had effectively waived the privilege. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 166.) Moreover, as discussed above, Plaintiff moved for sanctions as a result of Defendant's failure to produce all relevant emails and then its delay in correcting the error or alerting Plaintiff about it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Accordingly, the Court considers the relative conduct of the parties and assigns it some weight (though not substantial) against a full award of costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

The Court is sympathetic to Plaintiff's situation if it is as he claims. But the Court is bound by case authority and therefore does not assign any weight to this factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Weighing of all equitable factors together\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Overall, the Court weighs the closeness and complexity of this case, the chilling effect that an award of costs in this case could have on other FCA plaintiffs, and the parties' relative conduct in litigating this case. The Court considers these factors against the \"strong presumption\" that Defendant is entitled to a full award of costs. Given the difficult and distinctive circumstances of this case as discussed above, combined with Defendant's failure to sufficiently support its request for significant ESI costs, the Court finds a strong basis for denying the ESI costs. Indeed, the Court's discretion in awarding or denying costs exists so that it may consider equity and adjust as needed, particularly in cases such as this one. The Court denies Defendant's request for $137,380.48 in ESI costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS IN PART\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES IN PART\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's Bill of Costs. [Doc. 260]. The Court awards Defendant $30,402.95 in costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   this 28th day of November, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    The district court ultimately awarded the defendants half of the trial transcript fees. But the court based this decision on the defendants' contention that all parties agreed defendants would \"front\" the costs of the transcripts and later be reimbursed, and that all parties relied heavily on the transcripts at trial.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 1169. In the present case, there is no contention or evidence that the parties reached such an agreement regarding any of the costs at issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
