After the EPA denied Plaintiffs' petition, Plaintiffs filed this suit seeking judicial review of the EPA's determination. The EPA argues that Plaintiffs' lawsuit should be dismissed because their administrative petition failed to address conditions of use other than the fluoridation of drinking water, failed to specifically identify the chemicals at issue, and failed to justify treatment of those chemicals on a categorical basis. For the reasons stated herein, the Court finds a citizen petition need not evaluate all conditions of use; that Plaintiffs sufficiently identified the chemicals they sought to regulate; and that Plaintiffs presented an adequate basis, in their administrative petition, for requesting categorical treatment of the chemicals they identified. Defendant's motion is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL &amp; PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs are a group of non-profit organizations and associations and individual parents who sue on behalf of themselves and their minor children.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   They allege that fluoridation chemicals (specifically, hydrofluorosilicic acid, sodium silicofluoride, and sodium fluoride) are added to public water supplies across the United States in an attempt to reduce tooth decay.

The denial contains a summary of EPA's interpretation of the applicable statutory and regulatory framework and a response to the merits of Plaintiffs' petition. The EPA stated that \"[a]fter careful consideration, EPA denied the TSCA section 21 petition primarily because EPA concluded that the petition has not set forth a scientifically defensible basis to conclude that any persons have suffered neurotoxic harm as a result of exposure to fluoride in the U.S. through the purposeful addition of fluoridation chemicals to drinking water or otherwise from fluoride exposure in the U.S.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2011%2C878\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%2011%2C878\">\n    at 11,881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , col. 3. \"EPA also denied the petition on the independent grounds that the petition neither justified the regulation of fluoridation chemicals as a category, nor identified an adequate section 6 rule as the action sought.

Section 21 governs the third pathway, one that appears to be independent of the Section 6(b) risk evaluation process. Indeed, the TSCA explicitly requires a Section 6(b) \"risk evaluation\" to be performed for \"high priority\" chemicals and in response to manufacturer requests, but does not state that the same requirement applies to citizen petitions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.C. \u00a7 2605(b)(4)(C). Thus, the statutory text and structure suggest that Section 21 does not require a citizen petitioner to perform the functional equivalent of a Section 6(b) risk evaluation with respect to conditions of use that the petitioner does not seek to regulate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Nor is there any reason to think that the term \"under the conditions of use,\" as it appears in Section 21's judicial review provisions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202620\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4)(B)(ii), does so either. The use of the plural word \"conditions\" does not mean that a plaintiff must present scientific evidence regarding every single condition of use.

If, as here, the EPA has not yet determined the \"conditions of use\" for a chemical substance, how can a citizen petitioner submit a compliant petition addressing yet-undetermined conditions of use? Petitioners would be required to gaze into a crystal ball and make their best guess at what the Administrator will determine. That is not only unreasonable, but also an unnecessary complication in light of the natural reading discussed above.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ariz. State Bd. for Charter Schools v.

The EPA has three-and-a-half years to complete a Section 6(b) risk evaluation; yet it must act on a citizen petition under Section 21 within 90 days. If the EPA is correct that a citizen petitioner must present\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   scientific information related to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   conditions of use of a chemical substance, then the EPA would essentially be required to perform a potentially wide ranging plenary review within three\n   <em>\n    months\n   </em>\n   perhaps approximating what the EPA would otherwise have three-and-a-half\n   <em>\n    years\n   </em>\n   to complete. Thus, far from easing the EPA's burden, its interpretation requiring Section 21 petitions to tender and the EPA to evaluate all conditions of use would expand that burden exponentially. The structure of the statute thus suggests that a Section 21 petition is not intended to require citizen petitions to present all conditions of use, thus burdening the EPA with an expansive evaluative task which must be completed within 90 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Thus, the text and structure of the statute do not support the EPA's contention that Section 21 requires a citizen petitioner who seeks to regulate a chemical substance to address all conditions of use.

Under the EPA's published rules, a manufacturer's request for a Section 6(b) risk evaluation may be limited to only those particular conditions of use of interest to the manufacturer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20702.37\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 702.37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4).

It also recognized that \"manufacturers are not always privy to every downstream use [of a chemical substance]\" and that it would be \"very difficult [for manufacturers] to obtain all the required information\" for a compliant request identifying all conditions of use.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Requiring citizen petitioners to carry a burden that the EPA deemed was far too high for manufacturers would clearly create a disincentive to making such requests. Citizen petitioners are likely to have less financial wherewithal and resources than manufacturers. There is no indication Congress intended citizens to encounter a burden not presented to manufacturers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Discouraging citizen petitions would undermine the availability of this \"unusually powerful procedure[ ] for citizens to force EPA's hand.\"\n   <em>\n    Trumpeter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4285387,4340852\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/774/1037/\">\n    774 F.3d at 1039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Thus, the purpose of the statute is more consonant with a reading that Section 21 does not require a petitioner to address\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   conditions of use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Legislative History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Although the text, structure, and purpose of the TSCA clearly demonstrate that\n   a Section 21 petition does not need to address all conditions of use, the Court's interpretation is also bolstered by the legislative history.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339721\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/1068/#p1073\">\n    829 F.3d at 1073\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (court may look to legislative history to ascertain Congress's intent if statute's internal indicia are insufficiently clear). The EPA's argument hinges on the notion that the addition of the term \"under the conditions of use\" to Section 21 in 2016 represents a sea change. However, the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Work's Report on the draft legislation states that \"[n]o substantive or policy change is intended by these amendments\" to the citizen petition provisions. S. Rep. 114-67 at 33 (114th Cong. 1st Sess., Jun. 18, 2015). That suggests that Congress did not understand the amendments to be imposing the type of significant burdens and hurdles that the EPA acknowledges its interpretation would place on citizen petitioners; nothing suggests Congress intended to weaken citizen petitions under Section 21, a powerful tool of enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The EPA argues that the Committee Report carries no weight because it referred to an earlier draft of the legislation that did not include the \"conditions of use\" language. That is incorrect. It is true that the phrase \"conditions of use\" did not appear directly in the citizen petition section of that draft. However, the draft referred to whether a citizen petition demonstrated that a chemical would not meet \"the safety standard.\" S. 697 (114th Cong. 1st Sess., Jun. 17, 2015). The term \"safety standard,\" in turn, was defined in the draft to mean \"a standard that ensures, without taking into consideration cost or other nonrisk factors, that no unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment will result from exposure to a chemical substance\n   <em>\n    under the conditions of use\n   </em>\n   ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4339721\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/829/1068/#p1073\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). That is substantially identical to the language that ultimately ended up in Section 21, and, does, in fact, include the disputed term \"under the conditions of use.\" Thus, the Senate Report can fairly be read to reflect the Committee's views about the import (or, more accurately,\n   <em>\n    lack\n   </em>\n   of import) of that term in Section 21.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Accordingly, the legislative history also supports the view that citizen petitioners are not required to address all conditions of use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Consistency With EPA Regulations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The Court's interpretation is also consistent with the EPA's regulations with respect to manufacturer requests and\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   risk evaluations under Section 6(b). (The EPA has not proposed or adopted any rule specifically addressing Section\n   21.)

Reg. at 7565\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   82 Fed. Reg. at 33728-29. The EPA argued that its final rule was grounded in the statutory text.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   82 Fed. Reg. at 33729 (explaining that the statutory text \"suggest[s] that EPA is not required to consider all conditions of use\" and thus EPA \"may\" \"exclude certain activities that EPA has determined to be conditions of use\" from the scope of a Section 6(b) risk evaluation). Similarly, the EPA backed away from a requirement that a manufacturer must address all conditions of use when requesting a Section 6(b) risk evaluation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   82 Fed.

Moreover, the EPA's argument fails to address problems such as the fact that a citizen petitioner cannot know whether it has addressed all conditions of use if the EPA Administrator has not yet determined what those conditions of use are consistent with the statutory definition of \"conditions of use.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 1046-47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Finally, the EPA's policy arguments in support of its interpretation are unavailing. It argues that citizen petitioners must present information about\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   conditions of use, otherwise, citizen petitioners would place a drain on agency resources and cut in line ahead of \"high priority\" chemical substances or those identified by manufacturers. Even so, that would not necessarily be inconsistent with the statute's purpose. A citizen petition must persuade the EPA that a chemical substance poses an unreasonable risk of harm before the EPA is required to issue a rule. It is not unreasonable that Congress would require the EPA to act in response to a known unreasonable risk of harm, regardless of whether the finding is prompted by a citizen petition, a manufacturer request, or a\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   evaluation by the agency. In any event, the statute contemplates the possibility that some citizen petitions may present evidence of harms that are nevertheless less pressing than other matters pending before the EPA. Reviewing courts are thus required to weigh the relative harm addressed by a citizen petition, as well as consider, and accommodate, any EPA resource constraints in fashioning relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202620\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4)(B)(ii) (court \"may permit the Administrator to defer initiating the action requested by the petitioner\" if the court \"finds that the extent of the risk ... alleged ... is less than the extent of risks ... with respect to which the Administrator is taking action under this chapter and there are insufficient resources available to the Administrator to take the action requested by the petitioner\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The EPA ignores this explicit statutory accommodation relative to Section 21 petitions. The EPA's policy argument is unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   For those reasons, the EPA's interpretation in this litigation is entitled to minimal, if any, weight, and the Court rejects it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   6.\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In sum, the statutory text does not support the EPA's interpretation. Rather, a natural reading of the language suggests a citizen petitioner need only present facts demonstrating that a chemical substance poses\n   <em>\n    an\n   </em>\n   unreasonable risk due to one or more conditions of use that are of concern to the petitioner. This construction is consistent with the language, structure, and purpose of the statute, the legislative history, the EPA's interpretation of similar provisions, and the policies Congress sought to advance. The Court therefore concludes that Section 21 does not require a petition under Section 6(a) to address\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   conditions of use, but rather, only those that the petitioner seeks to regulate. The EPA's motion to dismiss for failure to address\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   conditions of use is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs Adequately Identified the Chemical Substances at Issue\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Defendant also argues Plaintiffs' petition \"does not provide enough information to allow the Agency or the Court to evaluate 'fluoridation chemicals' under th[e] statutory scheme because it does not identify the specific chemical substances at issue....\" Mot. at 8. According to Defendant, the petition merely \"allege[s] neurological effects of exposure to unspecified 'fluoridation chemicals.' \" Mot. at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   This argument is not persuasive. The EPA did not deny Plaintiffs' petition on the grounds that it was not sufficiently specific for the EPA to evaluate. Rather, the EPA denied the petition on the merits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   82 Fed. Reg. at 11,881, col. 3. (concluding petition did \"not set forth a scientifically defensible basis to conclude that any persons have suffered neurotoxic harm as a result of exposure to fluoride in the U.S. through the purposeful addition of fluoridation chemicals to drinking water or otherwise from fluoride exposure in the U.S.\"). Like the EPA, the Court will be able to understand from the petition and supporting materials what chemicals are at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Moreover, Plaintiffs' petition\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   identify the chemical substances they seek to regulate. A \"chemical substance\" is \"any organic or inorganic substance of a particular molecular identity, including-(i) any combination of such substances occurring in whole or in part as a result of a chemical reaction or occurring in nature and (ii) any element or uncombined radical.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202602\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(A). Plaintiffs' petition clearly states that it seeks regulation of \"fluoride\" used for \"fluoridation of water\" in the first paragraph of the cover letter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Admin. Pet. at 1. The EPA itself simply refers to \"fluoride\" in notice-and-comment regarding water fluoridation, suggesting there is no reasonable dispute about the chemicals to which that term refers in this context.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs' petition also refers to \"fluorosilic acid\" and \"sodium fluorosilicate,\" specific chemical compounds. Admin. Pet. at 28. The materials attached to the petition also identify the specific compounds that fall under the term \"fluoride.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Connett Decl., Ex. 1, at 1091 (\"Over 91% of US fluoridated water is treated with either sodium silicofluoride or fluosilicic acid.... Less than 10% is treated with simple sodium\n   fluoride.\"). Although in other circumstances the reference to these compounds in the 317th exhibit to Plaintiffs' petition might be insufficient, the EPA's denial of Plaintiffs' petition includes explicit references to all three chemicals, undermining any notion that the EPA was not adequately on notice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   82 Fed.

Reg. at 11889, col. 2, n. 38 (referring to \"sodium fluoride\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Plaintiffs' petition sufficiently identifies the chemicals at issue. This is not a case where Plaintiffs seek to regulate a chemical in litigation that the EPA did not realize was at issue in the administrative petition. Defendant's motion to dismiss on that basis is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs' Reference to the Category \"Fluoride\" Does Not Require Dismissal\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Relatedly, Defendant argues that Plaintiffs' petition fails to justify treatment of the three \"fluoridation chemicals\" as a \"category\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202625\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). That provision states that wherever the EPA may take action \"with respect to a chemical substance or mixture,\" it may take the same action with respect to \"a category of chemical substances or mixtures.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202625\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1). The statute defines \"category of chemical substances\" as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   a group of chemical substances the members of which are similar in molecular structure, in physical, chemical, or biological properties, in use,\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   in mode of entrance into the human body or into the environment, or the members of which are in some other way suitable for classification as such for purposes of this chapter....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202625\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2625(c)(2)(A) (emphasis added). The statute further provides that \"[w]henever the Administrator takes action under a provision of this chapter with respect to a category of chemical substances or mixtures, any reference in this chapter to a chemical substance or mixture (insofar as it relates to such action) shall be deemed to be a reference to each chemical substance or mixture in such category.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202625\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2625(c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Plaintiffs' petition plainly presents a basis for why the chemical substances are \"similar\" \"in use\" and \"in mode of entrance into the human body\": they are all allegedly used for fluoridation of water, and are all ingested through water consumption. Moreover, Plaintiffs claim that these chemicals all have similar \"physical, chemical, or biological properties,\" insofar as they are all used for the same purpose (fluoridation of water to prevent tooth decay) and pose a similar risk of harm (neurotoxic effects). Thus, the petition plainly presents a basis for why it is made with respect to a \"category\" of chemicals under \u00a7 2625(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Defendant also argues the use of a category was problematic because Plaintiffs requested regulation of \"several different chemicals\" but \"fail[ed] to distinguish between them,\" thus conveying \"inadequate information about the properties or conditions of use of the individual chemical substances for EPA or the Court to determine whether they should be considered as a category for purposes of risk evaluation and any necessary regulation.\" Mot. at 13. This argument contradicts the record. The EPA did not deny Plaintiffs' petition because it had inadequate information to evaluate the petition, but rather because the petition did \"not set forth a scientifically defensible basis\" to conclude that \"the purposeful addition of fluoridation chemicals to drinking water\" causes harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   82 Fed. Reg. at 11,881, col. 3. Moreover, as discussed above, Plaintiffs were not required to identify all conditions of use for each of the compounds where they sought\n   to regulate only one condition of use, fluoridation of drinking water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   At best, the EPA raises the question whether Plaintiffs will meet their burden in this litigation by showing by a preponderance of the evidence that each chemical substance in the category of \"fluoride\" or \"fluoridation chemicals\" poses an unreasonable risk of harm, as appears to be required under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202625\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1). However, that question is more appropriately resolved on summary judgment, after the parties have summarized and presented the scientific evidence supporting their positions, rather than at the motion to dismiss stage. Accordingly, Defendant's motion to dismiss for failure to justify treatment of fluoridation chemicals as a category is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Plaintiffs are entitled to judicial review of their petition on the merits because they complied with the two minimal statutory requirements: they filed their petition with the Administrator, and they set forth the facts they believe justify a rule under Section 6(a) regulating the fluoridation of drinking water supplies. Plaintiffs were not required to address other uses of fluoridation chemicals in their petition to the EPA. Moreover, Plaintiffs sufficiently identified the chemical substances at issue in their petition and explained why they seek to regulate that category of substances. Whether they can meet their ultimate burden on the merits with respect to each chemical substance remains to be seen, but they are at least entitled to attempt to make that showing.
