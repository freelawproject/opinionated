The Court has carefully considered the Motions, all supporting and opposing filings, the relevant authorities, has heard oral argument by the parties, and is otherwise duly advised.

The Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This class action lawsuit seeks a declaration as to the meaning of a single sentence contained within a GEICO insurance policy as explained below. Plaintiff is a health care provider that rendered health care services to Conor Carruthers (\"Carruthers\") for injuries he sustained in an automobile accident in March of 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [59] at \u00b6 11. Carruthers was insured under a policy with GEICO that provided personal injury protection (\"PIP\") motor vehicle insurance benefits (the \"Policy\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [81] at \u00b6 1. The Policy provides coverage for PIP claims pursuant to Florida Statute \u00a7 626.736.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [59] at \u00b6 5. The Policy also contains an endorsement to the PIP coverage identified as FLPIP (01-13) (the \"FLPIP (01-13) Endorsement\"), which became effective January 1, 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [67-1]. The FLPIP (01-13) Endorsement states, in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    PAYMENTS WE WILL MAKE\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The Company will pay in accordance with the Florida Motor Vehicle No Fault\n   Law (as enacted, amended, or newly enacted), and where applicable in accordance with all fee schedules contained in the Florida Motor Vehicle No Fault Law, to or for the benefit of the injured person:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (A) Eighty percent (80%) of\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     medical benefits\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   which are\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     medically necessary\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , pursuant to the following schedule of maximum charges contained in the Florida Statutes \u00a7 627.736(5)(a) 1., (a)2., and (a)3.:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   6.

The terms of the FLPIP (01-13) Endorsement quoted above have not changed since they went into effect on January 1, 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [59] at \u00b6 8. The dispute in this case centers on the meaning of one sentence: \"A charge submitted by a provider, for an amount less than the amount allowed above, shall be paid in the amount of the charge submitted.\" ECF No. [67-1] at 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In addition to the FLPIP (01-13) Endorsement, the Policy contains a document identified as M608 (01-13).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [94] at \u00b6 23. Although the parties dispute whether this document is a notice or an endorsement and whether its language has any effect on FLPIP (01-13), neither party disputes the content or authenticity of the document. In addition, the parties are in agreement that this document was mailed to policyholders for all new policies effective on or after January 1, 2013 and all renewal policies effective on or after January 1, 2013. Moreover, the parties agree that and that it was mailed in an effort to comply with \u00a7 627.736(5)(a) 5. and House Bill 119, which are further discussed below.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [81] at \u00b6 4; ECF No. [89] at \u00b6 4.

The Informational Memorandum explains that its \"purpose is to assist insurers with the filings necessary to implement the notice requirement in Section 627.736(5)(a) 5., Florida Statutes, resulting from the passage of House Bill 119.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20617.736\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Among the requirements of House Bill 119 was \"a new statutory requirement that insurers provide a notice of the schedule of medical charges or 'fee schedule' to insureds if the insurer is limiting reimbursement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Along with the Informational Memorandum, the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation supplied \"sample endorsement language for inclusion of the schedule of charges specified in Section 627.736(5)(a), Florida Statutes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20617.736\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, it cautioned that \"it is the insurer's responsibility to develop its own language after researching the law, reviewing its contract forms, and conferring with its legal staff.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20617.736\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   When GEICO submitted the FLPIP (01-13) Endorsement to the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation for its review and approval, GEICO represented that the FLPIP (01-13) Endorsement was submitted as a revision to its Automobile Casualty Forms and that three other forms consisting of A313 (10-97), CRA209 (10-97) and CC1134 (10-97) were withdrawn.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [70-2] at 3. In contrast, when GEICO subsequently submitted the M608 (01-13) form to the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation in compliance with House Bill 119, GEICO did not state that this form would replace or modify the FLPIP (01-13) Endorsement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [70-3] at 3. Instead, the submission indicates that upon the approval, form M608 (04-12) would be withdrawn.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20617.736\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Pursuant to Carruthers's assignment of benefits, Plaintiff submitted HCFA 1500 forms to GEICO showing charges for the treatment rendered to Carruthers in the amount of $60 for CPT code 97110 and $45 for CPT Code 97140.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [59] at \u00b6 13. Both charges were less than the elected 2015 Medicare Part B Fee Schedule, which provides the fee for CPT Code 97110 was $33.52 and the fee for CPT Code 97140 was $30.72.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [60].

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Motion to Disqualify\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Prior to considering the parties' respective Motions for Summary Judgment, the Court must first decide GEICO's Motion to Disqualify and determine whether Plaintiff can proceed as class representative in this action. In support of disqualification, GEICO advances three arguments: (1) Plaintiff is not a member of the class and is, therefore, not typical of the class; (2) Plaintiff does not have a current need for a declaration in light of GEICO's overpayment of benefits and, for that reason, his claim is not typical; and (3) Plaintiff, through its corporate representative, lacks candor, honesty, and credibility, making it an inadequate class representative.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [161]. The Court will address each of these arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Plaintiff's Membership in the Class\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   GEICO first seeks to disqualify Plaintiff because \"Dr. Gerber did not utilize the assignment in submitting claims for no-fault benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. To support this argument, the Motion to Disqualify sets forth a two-step process for membership in the class: (1) class members must each receive an assignment of benefits from a claimant, and (2) they must each submit that assignment to GEICO when making a claim for PIP benefits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. GEICO does not question Plaintiff's ability to satisfy the first step. Instead, GEICO argues that Plaintiff did not submit the assignment when making its claim for benefits, and such an omission excludes it from the class as \"[i]t is a condition precedent to class membership [that] the healthcare provider utilizes the assignment in submitting claims for no-fault benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. By making this argument, GEICO adds a requirement to the class definition that was not discussed, mentioned, or contemplated by this Court's Class Certification Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   To illustrate the point, it is important to understand the reason the Court refined the class definition. In the Class Certification Order, the Court explained that GEICO objected to \"the scope of the proposed class [ ]as overly broad because (1) it include[d] health care providers regardless of whether they ha[d] assignments from\n   the insureds, which raise[d] a question of standing, and (2) it include[d] all health care providers that submitted claims adjusted with code BA regardless of whether their claims [we]re ultimately compensable under the Policy.\" ECF No. [65] at 7. Addressing GEICO's objection that Plaintiff's proposed class definition was overinclusive to the extent it included class members lacking an assignment, the Court narrowed the scope of the class as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   All health care providers that received an assignment of benefits from a claimant and thereafter, pursuant to that assignment, submitted claims for no-fault benefits under GEICO PIP policies to which Endorsement FLPIP (01-13) applies, and any subsequent policies with substantially similar language that were in effect since January 1, 2013, where GEICO utilized the Code BA with respect to the payment of any claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. Significantly, at the class certification stage, GEICO did not argue that class members must have submitted their assignments to GEICO during the claims process. It only argued that the class could not include class members without an assignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Now, in support of disqualification, GEICO reads a requirement into the Class Certification Order that does not exist-that class members must have submitted the actual assignment of benefits to GEICO at the moment a claim for PIP benefits was made under the Policy. To be clear, the class definition does not contain such a requirement. The only requirement is that the class members must have received an assignment of benefits from a claimant. The words \"pursuant to that assignment\" within the class definition do not require that the assignment be submitted with the claim. The language simply requires that the health care providers submit their claims\n   <em>\n    as authorized by\n   </em>\n   the assignment. The Court declines to add a requirement to the class definition that was not contemplated by the parties, much less imposed by the Court when it redefined the class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Court also questions the timeliness of GEICO's argument. Although GEICO could not anticipate the redefining of the class until the Class Certification Order was issued on June 6, 2017, GEICO has been aware of the new definition for five months. Throughout this time period, GEICO also knew that Plaintiff did not submit the assignment when it made the claim for benefits. Despite having this information at its disposal for months, GEICO never sought reconsideration of the Class Certification Order and instead waited to raise this issue on the heels of the scheduled trial. However, the Court need not decide the timeliness of this argument as it misinterprets the requirements of class membership. Because the class definition does not require the submission of the assignment and it is undisputed that Plaintiff had a valid assignment of benefits, the Court finds that Plaintiff is indeed a member of the class.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Plaintiff's Need for a Declaration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   GEICO next argues that Plaintiff is not a typical member of the class in that Plaintiff has no need for a declaration of its rights. More specifically, GEICO argues that, prior to the filing of this lawsuit,\n   Carruthers never received an EMC determination and, as a result, the Policy limits for Carruthers's automobile accident were limited to $2,500.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [161] at 5. Despite the lack of an EMC determination, GEICO paid Plaintiff $7,311.85 in benefits for medical services provided to Carruthers and, in doing so, GEICO paid Plaintiff $4,811.85 more than it was entitled to receive.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Given that Plaintiff cannot pursue benefits above $2,500 without an EMC determination, GEICO contends this lawsuit was prematurely filed and, therefore, Plaintiff has no need for a declaration. Absent the need for a declaration, GEICO argues that Plaintiff's claim lacks the typicality of the class's claim, requiring his disqualification. The Court disagrees with GEICO's argument for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Addressing the timeliness of this argument, GEICO was well aware of which documents were in Carruthers's claims file and what documents were not at the time it paid out the claims for benefits. GEICO has thus known that Plaintiff did not supply an EMC determination since, at least, the inception of this lawsuit-long before class certification was briefed. Yet, at the class certification stage, GEICO did not argue that Plaintiff was atypical of the class because Carruthers had no EMC determination and Plaintiff had consequently exhausted the $2,500 limit, eliminating the need for a declaration. On the question of typicality, GEICO instead generally argued that each individual PIP claim would require the application of different facts and would be subject to different coverage defenses under the policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [57]. GEICO had the ability to raise this specific EMC challenge at the time of the class certification stage more than five months ago but did not. While the Motion to Disqualify suggests that GEICO obtained this information during the recent deposition of Dr. Gerber, at the summary judgment hearing, GEICO conceded that the EMC issue \"dawned\" on it when it began to \"look[ ] closely at the file in the summary judgment stage.\" ECF No. [163] at 36. This concession indicates that GEICO had not looked \"closely at the file\" prior to summary judgment and had overlooked the EMC issue and the alleged overpayment of benefits earlier in the case. Thus, GEICO could have raised this \"typicality\" challenge at the certification stage but failed to do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Even if the Court deemed this typicality argument timely, it does not carry the day for GEICO as the EMC determination falls outside the scope of the very narrow issue to be resolved by this lawsuit. At the class certification stage, GEICO raised exhaustion of benefits generally as a concern when objecting to the ascertainability of the class.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [57] at 7-8 (\"Moreover, 'each individual medical service provider in the class must still demonstrate that it is entitled to reimbursement for the disputed charges-i.e., the bill was properly completed pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20627.736\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5)(b)(1)(d), the benefits of the insurance plan were not exhausted at the time of the procedure, ...' \"). The Class Certification Order specifically addressed GEICO's concern that a declaration in Plaintiff's favor would \"relieve putative class members of their burden to prove entitlement to reimbursement for disputed charges, including proof of proper billing,\n   <em>\n    non-exhaustion of benefits under the\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Policy\n   </em>\n   , valid insurance coverage, and performance of the services billed.\" ECF No. [65]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   at 10. In doing so, the Court explained that, in this lawsuit, \"the Court will ultimately decide nothing more and nothing less than\" the very narrow question of \"whether the Policy requires payment of 80% of the billed amount in all instances\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   payment of 100% of the billed amount for any charges submitted below the fee schedule amount.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20627.736\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court further reassured the parties that such a determination would be made \"without prejudice to GEICO or to the putative plaintiffs to raise other arguments in other proceedings\" relating to the ultimate compensability of the claims.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20627.736\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   GEICO never sought reconsideration of the Class Certification Order. Now, the Motion to Disqualify specifically argues that Plaintiff cannot be typical of the class because he has exhausted available policy limits and does not, therefore, have a need for a declaration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [161]. As the Court already explained, while Plaintiff's alleged exhaustion of benefits may be a defense to a future claim for benefits, this specific question need not be resolved in this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   With this background in mind, the Court must determine whether Plaintiff's claims are atypical of those belonging to the class. When considering typicality, Rule 23(a) requires that \"the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3). \"[T]he typicality requirement is permissive: representative claims are 'typical' if they are reasonably co-extensive with those of absent class members; they need not be substantially identical.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Checking Account Overdraft,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4277646\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/275/666/#p674\">\n    275 F.R.D. 666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 674 (S.D.

Fla. 2003) ). Plaintiff, like all other members in the class, seeks an interpretation of the FLPIP (01-13) Endorsement. Consistent with the Class Certification Order, the Court once again finds that Plaintiff's claim is typical of the class's claims \"[g]iven that the class-wide claim revolves around GEICO's alleged pattern and practice of reimbursing 80% even when the billed amount is less than the fee schedule.\" ECF No. [65] at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Plaintiff's Alleged Lack of Candor, Honesty and Credibility\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Finally, GEICO seeks to disqualify Plaintiff as an inadequate class representative because he has allegedly exhibited a lack of candor, honesty and credibility throughout these proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [161] at 8-10. In support of this argument, GEICO recites a laundry list of items that allegedly evidence Plaintiff's dishonest conduct.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"985411\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/212/602/#p605\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For example, GEICO states that Plaintiff fabricated evidence of his collection of co-payments from insureds, that Plaintiff's assignment of benefits form indicates patients are not obligated to make co-payments until benefits are exhausted; that Plaintiff did not advise the Court of its failure to submit the assignment of benefits when making a claim; that Plaintiff does not maintain adequate records; that Plaintiff concocted a scheme to allow Harvey A. Frank D.C., P.A. to intervene; and that Plaintiff did not bring any documents with him to his deposition.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"985411\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/212/602/#p605\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Before analyzing whether any of these issues warrant Plaintiff's disqualification as class representative, the Court finds that GEICO's objections are untimely. At the class certification stage, GEICO had the opportunity to challenge Plaintiff's adequacy as class representative, but failed to do so. In fact, when discussing Plaintiff's adequacy, the Class Certification Order states: \"GEICO does not suggest that a conflict exists or that Plaintiff is otherwise an unsuitable class representative.\" ECF No. [65] at 17. GEICO removed this lawsuit to the Southern District of Florida on November 3, 2016 and then filed its Response to Plaintiff's Motion for Class Certification five months later on April 3, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. [1] and [57]. Although\n   GEICO had five months to depose Plaintiff's corporate representative in anticipation of class certification briefing, GEICO made no attempts to do so. In fact, GEICO did not advise Plaintiff of its intent to take its corporate representative deposition until June 30, 2017-almost three months after it responded to the Motion for Class Certification and more than three weeks after the Class Certification Order was issued.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [91] at 1.

For example, GEICO states that Plaintiff fabricated evidence regarding the collection of co-payments and that Plaintiff's intention was to waive co-payments and deductibles. Plaintiff has presented an affidavit and evidence that contradict GEICO's assertions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [138-2]. In order to address this alleged lack of candor for purposes of Rule 23(a) adequacy, the Court would be required to assess Plaintiff's credibility and, in doing so, address the merits of Plaintiff's claim on a question of class certification. Rule 23, however, does not grant courts a license to engage in free-ranging merits inquiries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amgen Inc. v. Conn. Ret. Plans &amp; Tr.

As explained in section III(A)(1) above, the class definition does not contain such a requirement; therefore, Plaintiff would not have such an obligation. Other arguments are that Plaintiff does not maintain adequate medical records as required by the Florida Administrative Code, that Plaintiff concocted a scheme to have Harvey A. Frank D.C., P.A. intervene in the action, and that Plaintiff failed to produce documents at his deposition. Addressing each of these in turn, GEICO does not explain how sloppy record-keeping would disqualify a class representative nor does it cite any law supporting such a proposition. With regard to the Motion to Intervene, although Plaintiff did not prevail on this issue, its position was not frivolous so as to warrant disqualification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   And finally, GEICO faults Plaintiff for not producing records at the continuation of Dr. Gerber's deposition on October 31, 2017. However, the Court's recent Omnibus Order informed the parties that the remaining discovery was limited to the completion of Dr. Gerber's deposition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [155] at 11 (emphasis in original) (\"Discovery is open until October 31, 2017 for\n   <em>\n    the limited purpose\n   </em>\n   of completing Dr. Gerber's deposition). In doing so, the Court enforced its prior Order on GEICO's Motion to Compel, which did not require the production of any documents at deposition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [113]. Despite the limited discovery allowed by the Omnibus Order, GEICO served a Notice of Taking Deposition seeking the production of documents, such as a new request for \"billing records for all patients identified in ECF 138, 136 and 133.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [164-2]. Given the limited scope of discovery, Plaintiff had no obligation to bring newly requested documents to the continued deposition. As such, GEICO's request to disqualify Plaintiff as a class representative is unavailing. As the Court previously determined in its Class Certification Order, \"Plaintiff's interests appear to be aligned with those of the class in that GEICO's use of the BA code to adjust claims applied across the board to Plaintiff and the putative class;\" therefore, Plaintiff satisfies the adequacy test of Rule 23(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [65] at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Plaintiff's Motion asks the Court to enter \"a partial summary judgment on the proper interpretation of the GEICO Policy.\" ECF No. [59]. GEICO, on the other hand, argues that summary judgment is premature given the pending\n   interlocutory appeal of the Class Certification Order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [80]. Alternatively, GEICO raises a challenge to Plaintiff's standing, seeking dismissal of the Amended Complaint due to a \"lack of jurisdiction over Gerber's non-justiciable claim for declaratory relief which fails to satisfy the elements required for a declaratory action.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407588\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/455/#p465\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In the event the Court finds that Plaintiff has standing, GEICO alternatively asks the Court to grant final summary judgment in its favor on the interpretation of the FLPIP (01-13) Endorsement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407588\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/455/#p465\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court addresses each of these arguments below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Prematurity of Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Although GEICO seeks summary judgment in its own favor, it argues that Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment is premature because GEICO filed a petition for interlocutory review of the Class Certification Order pursuant to Rule 23(f).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [93] at 5-7. Specifically, GEICO states that if the Eleventh Circuit finds the class was improperly certified, Plaintiff can then seek certification under Rule 23(b)(3) on remand.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407588\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/455/#p465\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This is because Plaintiff's Motion for Class Certification only sought certification under Rule 23(b)(2), not Rule 23(b)(3).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [53]. Based on these facts, GEICO argues that the entry of summary judgment now would violate the rule against one-way intervention if the Eleventh Circuit later reverses the Class Certification Order and then Plaintiff seeks certification under Rule 23(b)(3) on remand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    London v.

Plaintiff never sought to extend the deadline for class certification or seek leave of Court to pursue certification\n   in this bifurcated fashion. While Plaintiff may have pled two alternate grounds for class certification, Plaintiff made a tactical decision to seek certification under Rule 23(b)(2) and is precluded from later seeking to certify on different grounds if the strategy proves unsuccessful.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Washington v.

This argument is a variation of the EMC argument raised in the Motion to Disqualify. In essence, GEICO argues that Carruthers was only entitled to $2500 in medical benefits under the Policy because there was no prior EMC determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [80].

GEICO, which invoked this Court's jurisdiction, argued that \"Plaintiff has alleged an ongoing injury that is substantially likely to occur in the future.\" ECF No. [27] at 13. Agreeing with GEICO, this Court found that \"the Complaint adequately alleges a threat of future injury such that Plaintiff has standing to bring suit in federal court.\" ECF No. [45] at 8. Given that \"Plaintiff's claimed harm is easily-repeatable\" and it \"systematically occurred millions of times in three years,\" the Court rejected any argument that Plaintiff's chance of future injury was \"too remote\" and found that Plaintiff had standing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7849982\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/158/689/#p692\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Standing was again addressed at the class certification stage. \"[P]rior to the certification of a class, and before undertaking an analysis under Rule 23, the district court must determine that at least one named class representative has Article III standing to raise each class claim.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Terazosin Hydrochloride Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1279238\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/220/672/#p679\">\n    220 F.R.D. 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 679 (S.D.

However, GEICO's analysis skips a step in that it presupposes that the M608 (01-13) document is an endorsement simply because it was delivered with the Policy. Before the Court can consider the effect of the M608 (01-13) document, it must first determine whether this document constitutes an endorsement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Florida law requires that \"every policy\" specify certain information including \"the form numbers and edition dates or numeric code indicating edition dates, when such code has been supplied to the office, of\n   <strong>\n    all endorsements attached to a policy\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20627.413\">\n    Fla.

In contrast, the Policy, through its Declarations Page, makes reference to many other endorsements attached to the Policy as required by \u00a7 627.413(1)(g). Specifically, the Declarations Page states on the first page: \"This is a description of your coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [67-1] at 5. Thereafter, GEICO identifies all contracts, amendments, and endorsements to the Policy by form number and edition dates in conformity with \u00a7 627.413(1)(g). For example, the \"Contract Type\" is listed as \"A30FL, FAMILY AUTO INSURANCE POLICY,\" while the \"Contract Amendments\" are listed as \"ALL VEHICLES-A30FL (03-11) A54FL (02-13) FLPIP (01-13),\" and the \"Unit Endorsements\" are listed as \"A-115 (04-08) (VEH 1,2,3); A239 (02-13) (VEH 1,2,3); A431 (05-11) (VEH 1,2,3); UE316F (07-11) (VEH 1).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20627.413\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20627.413\">\n    at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

An endorsement \"is a writing added or attached to a policy or certificate of insurance\n   <em>\n    which expands or restricts its benefits or excludes certain conditions from coverage.\n   </em>\n   \" 2 Couch on Ins. \u00a7 18:19 (emphasis added). The M608 (01-13) document does not purport to expand or restrict Carruthers's benefits or otherwise exclude certain conditions from coverage. This is evidenced by the fact that it is devoid of any language amending or otherwise modifying the Policy. When compared to the other amendments/endorsements attached to the Policy, it becomes clear that GEICO did not intend to make the M608 (01-13) document an endorsement. For example, the FLPIP (01-13) Endorsement, which is signed by two GEICO executives, expressly amends the Policy in the first line by stating: \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     [y]our\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   policy is amended as follows.\" ECF No. [67-1] at 29 and 39 (emphasis in original). Similarly, the A54FL (02-13) \"Florida Policy Amendment\" and the A-115 (04-08) \"Automobile Policy Amendment\" state: \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Your\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   policy is amended as follows.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20627.413\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 29 and 41 (emphasis in original).

As to the UE-316F \"Endorsement Loss Payable Clause,\" it is not signed by anyone, but states \"[t]his endorsement forms a part of\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     your\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   policy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20627.413\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20627.413\">\n    at 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). By way of comparison, the M608 (01-13) document does not contain any language such as \"your policy is amended as follows\" or \"this endorsement forms a part of your policy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20627.413\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20627.413\">\n    at 51-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In order for a paper attached to a policy to demonstrate it is related to the policy, \"sufficient reference [should] be made in\n   <em>\n    either\n   </em>\n   the policy or the endorsement to identify the papers as related.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Metro.

In this case, such a link between M608 (01-13) and the Policy is lacking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Not only does M608 (01-13) fail to identify itself as a document that amends the Policy, but the language within it also suggests it was not intended as an amendment. The last two sentences of M608 (01-13) state: \"Personal Injury Protection Coverage is subject to the terms, conditions and exclusions in your policy. Please read your policy carefully.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52. These two sentences refer Carruthers, as the insured, to his Policy for an understanding of its terms, conditions, and exclusions. Significantly, they do not direct the insured to the language in M608 (01-13) for such an understanding and M608 (01-13) does not identify itself as part of the Policy. Thus, by referring the insured to the Policy language, M608 (01-13) suggests its own language is not part of the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   To support its position that M608 (01-13) is an endorsement, GEICO also relies upon language within the Informational Memorandum prepared by the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (\"OIR\") and argues that the OIR \"required [M608 (01-13) ] to be an 'endorsement' and to have the effect of 'policy language' \" in order to comply with House Bill 119. ECF No. [109] at 6. However, the Court's review of the Informational Memorandum does not reveal such a mandate. Starting at the top of the document, the Informational Memorandum explains that its purpose is \"to assist insurers with the\n   <strong>\n    filings\n   </strong>\n   necessary to implement the\n   <strong>\n    notice\n   </strong>\n   requirement in Section 627.736(5)(a) 5., Florida Statutes, resulting from the passage of House Bill 119. Among the various provisions of this legislation is a new statutory requirement that insurers provide a\n   <strong>\n    notice\n   </strong>\n   of the schedule of medical charges or 'fee schedule' to insureds if the insurer is limiting reimbursement.\" ECF No. [67-4]. Thereafter, the memorandum informs insurers in permissive terms that they \"\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   file and propose policy language as an alternative\" to the sample language.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Although it also states that the OIR will commit to review filings submitted for this purpose on an expedited basis provided that the insurer has submitted only one endorsement, there is no language mandating that the proposed filing take the form of an endorsement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When this language is read in the context of the whole memorandum, it is evident that the OIR was not mandating that the filing take a specific form. For example, the memorandum informs insurers that \"[d]epending upon the\n   <strong>\n    existing policy lan\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    guage\n   </strong>\n   , the sample language may be suitable to address the notice requirement of House Bill 119\n   <strong>\n    or the insurer may already have approved language that satisfies the notice requirement\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). It further reminds insurers that it is each insurer's \"responsibility to develop its own language after researching the law, reviewing its contract forms, and conferring with its legal staff.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, the Informational Memorandum gave insurers the discretion to satisfy the statutory notice requirement as they each saw fit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   A reading of the Policy as a whole leads the Court to conclude that M608 (01-13) cannot be an endorsement. When GEICO intended documents to be an endorsement or amendment to the Policy, it listed them in the Declarations Page and it included language within the endorsement/amendment clearly referencing the Policy and informing the insured of the effect such a document had on the Policy. In addition, with the exception of the UE-316F form, all amendments and endorsements listed on the Declarations Page were signed by GEICO executives. GEICO did not employ any of these techniques when drafting M608 (01-13). The stark contrast between M608 (01-13) and all other endorsements/amendments attached to the Policy leads this Court to find that M608 (01-13) is simply a notice of GEICO's election to adopt the Medicare fee schedules in compliance with House Bill 119 and Florida Statute \u00a7 627.736(5).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   At best, the dichotomy between the title-\"Important Notice Fee Schedule Endorsement\"-and the failure to identify M608 (01-13) as part of the Policy renders its purpose ambiguous. \"If there is more than one reasonable interpretation of an insurance policy, an ambiguity exists and it 'should be construed against the insurer.' \"\n   <em>\n    Pac.

Even under this best-case scenario, such an ambiguity must be construed in favor of the insured or, in this case, in favor of Plaintiff as the assignee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    c) Textual Interpretation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The only question left to be resolved on summary judgment is the meaning of one sentence within the FLPIP (01-13) Endorsement: \"A charge submitted by a provider, for an amount less than the amount allowed above, shall be paid in the amount of the charge submitted.\" ECF No. [67-1] at 31 (\"the disputed provision\"). As mentioned above, Plaintiff interprets this to mean that, if a healthcare provider submits a bill less than the applicable fee schedule, then GEICO must pay the entire amount billed without the application of a 20-percent coinsurance. GEICO interprets this sentence to include such a coinsurance regardless of the amount billed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   To analyze the issue, the Court cannot read this sentence in isolation but must instead consider the pertinent section of the FLPIP (01-13) Endorsement where this sentence is located. It states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    PAYMENTS WE WILL MAKE\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   The Company will pay in accordance with the Florida Motor Vehicle No Fault Law (as enacted, amended, or newly enacted), and where applicable in accordance with all fee schedules contained in the Florida Motor Vehicle No Fault Law, to or for the benefit of the injured person:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   (A) Eighty percent (80%) of\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     medical benefits\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   which are\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     medically necessary\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , pursuant to the following schedule of maximum charges contained\n   in the Florida Statutes \u00a7 627.736(5) (a) 1., (a)2., and (a)3.:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   6.

According to Plaintiff, the phrase \"amount less than the amount allowed above\" echoes GEICO's reference to the \"allowable amount\" language in section (A)6.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%202900452\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In response, GEICO argues that \"[t]he disputed provision of GEICO's policy simply notifies providers that charges not exceeding the fee schedule 'shall be paid' in the amount of the charge submitted,\" but \"[i]t does not address how much 'shall be paid' by GEICO and how much 'shall be paid' by the insured.\" ECF No. [93] at 14. To answer this question, GEICO asks the Court to refer to the coinsurance provision of \u00a7 627.736(5)(a), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   The insurer may limit reimbursement to 80 percent of the following schedule of maximum charges:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   f.

An insurer may limit payment as authorized by this paragraph only if the insurance policy includes a notice at the time of issuance or renewal that the insurer may limit payment pursuant to the schedule of charges specified in this paragraph. A policy form approved by the office satisfies this requirement.\n   <strong>\n    If a provider submits a charge for an amount less than the amount allowed under subparagraph 1., the insurer may pay the amount of the charge submitted.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20627.736\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5)(a) (emphasis added). Relying upon the language in this statute, especially the bolded language, GEICO argues that these \"clearly show that all reimbursements are subject to a 20% copayment.\" ECF No. [93] at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   While GEICO asks the Court to consider the language of the statute when interpreting the disputed provision, the Court is mindful that the interpretation of an insurance policy, such as the one at issue, is subject to principles of contract interpretation. GEICO argues that the FLPIP (01-13) Endorsement \"essentially reproduces, incorporates, and adopts the nearly identical language of section 627.736(5)(a)\" and that an interpretation of the endorsement is an interpretation of the statute\n   that \"would apply to all Florida PIP insurers.\" ECF No. [93] at 11. However, there are pertinent differences between the language of the statute and the language of the FLPIP (01-13) Endorsement that cannot be ignored. The mere incorporation of the Florida Motor Vehicle No Fault Law into the endorsement does not allow the Court to ignore the language of the Policy and replace it with the language of the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kingsway Amigo Ins.

The two are not interchangeable. And, an insurer is certainly free to provide greater insurance coverage than the minimum floor required by the statute.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7026324\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/63/63/#p67\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    State Farm Florida Ins.

The endorsement provides: \"A charge submitted by a provider, for an amount less than the amount allowed above, shall be paid in the amount of the charge submitted.\" ECF No. [67-1] at 31. On the other hand, the statute states: \"If a provider submits a charge for an amount less than the amount allowed under subparagraph 1., the insurer may pay the amount of the charge submitted.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20627.736\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5)(a) 5. The former is mandatory while the latter is permissive. The statute applies to charges that are less than the amount allowed \"under subparagraph 1.,\" which limits reimbursement to 80% of the schedule of maximum charges.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20627.736\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The disputed provision, however, applies when the billed amount is less than the \"amount allowed above\"-without reference to a specific paragraph.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [67-1]. The statute specifies who will pay the amount of the charge submitted-the insurer.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20627.736\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5)(a) 5. The disputed provision does not identify who will pay-a critical distinction given that Plaintiff identifies GEICO as the payor while GEICO argues that it, along with the insured, are payors under the automatic application of a 20-percent coinsurance. Thus, the statute and the Policy are not \"for all intents and purposes\" the same as GEICO argues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Given the differences between the disputed provision and the statute, the Court will focus its analysis on the language of the FLPIP (01-13) Endorsement to ascertain its meaning. GEICO asks the Court to consider the significance of the paragraph alignment in the endorsement to the extent that the disputed provision is indented and aligned with the paragraphs electing the fee schedule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [80] at 11. Pursuant to the Scope-of-Subparts Canon, which means that \"[m]aterial within an indented subpart relates only to that subpart; material in unindented text relates to all the following or preceding indented subparts,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   GEICO argues that the disputed provision is a subpart of paragraph (A).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20627.736\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Paragraph (A) states GEICO will pay \"[e]ighty percent (80%) of medical\n   benefits which are medically necessary, pursuant to the following schedule of maximum charges contained in the Florida Statutes \u00a7 627.736(5)(a) 1., (a)2., and (a)3.\" ECF No. [67-1] at 31. Thus, applying this canon, GEICO asks the Court to find that the disputed provision refers back to the 80 percent reimbursement rate in paragraph (A) and thus contains a 20-percent coinsurance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [80] at 11. According to GEICO, if it wanted the disputed provision to modify the preceding paragraphs as Plaintiff argues, it would not be indented.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20627.736\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20627.736\">\n    at 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Plaintiff counters this rationale by pointing out that canons cannot exist in a vacuum, especially when such an application \"trump[s] the context and wording of the provision interpreted.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [88] at 18. The Court agrees. \"No canon of interpretation is absolute. Each may be overcome by the strength of differing principles that point in other directions.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Scalia &amp; Garner, READING LAW : THE INTERPRETATION OF LEGAL TEXTS at 59. For example, the Eleventh Circuit has rejected the Scope-of-Subparts Canon when its application did not make sense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lary v. Trinity Physician Fin. &amp; Ins. Servs\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073911\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/780/1101/#p1105\">\n    780 F.3d 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1105-06 (11th Cir. 2015). Plaintiff asks the Court to apply the Supremacy of Text Canon, which means \"[t]he words of a governing text are of paramount concern, and what they convey, in their context, is what the text means.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   With these principles in mind, the Court will review the endorsement as a whole to interpret it. The section at issue commences with the title-\"PAYMENTS\n   <strong>\n    WE\n   </strong>\n   WILL MAKE.\" ECF No. [67-1] at 31 (emphasis added, caps in original). Thereafter, section (A) states GEICO will pay 80% of medical benefits \"pursuant to the following schedule of maximum charges\" and it details such charges.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Pertinent to this discussion, subsection 6 states: \"For all other medical services, supplies, and care, 200 percent of the allowable amount under: (I.) The participating physicians fee schedule of Medicare Part B ...\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Following this schedule of maximum charges, the endorsement sets forth a series of separate paragraphs, the first of which begins with the word \"However,\" that specify what and how GEICO will pay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Included in this series of qualifications is the disputed provision. This part of the endorsement states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   <em>\n    However\n   </em>\n   , if such services, supplies, or care is not reimbursable under Medicare Part B (as provided in section (A)6. above), we will limit reimbursement to eighty percent (80%) of the maximum reimbursable allowance under workers' compensation, as determined under Florida Statutes, \u00a7 440.13 and rules adopted thereunder which are in effect at the time such services, supplies, or care is provided. Services, supplies, or care that is not reimbursable under Medicare or workers' compensation is not required to be reimbursed by us.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   A charge submitted by a provider, for an amount less than the amount allowed above, shall be paid in the amount of the charge submitted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   The critical question is whether the phrase \"an amount less than the\n   <em>\n    amount allowed above\n   </em>\n   \" in the disputed provision refers to \"200 percent of the allowable amount under the participating physicians fee schedule of Medicare Part B\" or to the 80 percent reimbursement rate in section (A). ECF No. [67-1] at 31. Far from a model of clarity, the Court concludes that the disputed provision is ambiguous. The use of the indented paragraphs, as GEICO argues, can lead to a reasonable interpretation that the disputed provision is modified by the language of section (A) and is\n   therefore only reimbursed at a rate of 80 percent. At the same time, the use of the word \"above\" in the paragraph that begins with \"However\" directly refers to subsection (A)6. A consistent application of the word \"above\" in the disputed paragraph can reasonably lead to an interpretation that it also refers to subsection (A)6 and not section (A). In addition, GEICO chose to explicitly limit reimbursement in the paragraph beginning with \"However\" to \"80% of the maximum reimbursable allowance under workers' compensation\" for charges not reimbursable under Medicare Part B while it also chose not to include such limiting language in the disputed provision. This can also lead to a reasonable interpretation that the disputed provision is not limited to an 80 percent reimbursement rate; otherwise, GEICO would have explicitly stated so. This argument is even more compelling when one considers the Scope-of-Subparts Canon and the fact that both paragraphs are indented. If all indented paragraphs relate to section (A) and its 80 percent reimbursement rate, it begs the question as to why GEICO specified an 80 percent reimbursement rate in the first indented paragraph and not in the disputed paragraph.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   If there is more than one reasonable interpretation of an insurance policy, an ambiguity exists and it \"should be construed against the insurer.\"\n   <em>\n    Pac.

Here, the Court finds the disputed provision is ambiguous and it must, therefore, construe the provision against GEICO and in favor of Plaintiff. As such, the Court holds that, under the disputed provision, when a health care provider bills for covered services in an amount less than 200% of the fee schedule, GEICO is required to pay the charge as billed without any reduction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

The disputed provision within the FLPIP (01-13) Endorsement that states \"[a] charge submitted by a provider, for an amount less than the amount allowed above, shall be paid in the amount of the charge submitted\" is interpreted as follows: if a provider submits a bill to GEICO that is less than 200 percent of the applicable fee schedule, GEICO shall pay the provider 100 percent of the amount billed. This interpretation of the FLPIP (01-13) Endorsement does not alleviate class members from satisfying their individual burden to prove entitlement to benefits. Similarly, this interpretation of the FLPIP (01-13) Endorsement does not address the availability of any defenses that GEICO may raise in response to any claims for benefits made by members of the class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   3.

Given that the individual class members are not required to submit their assignment of benefits, the Court need not dissect the HCFA 1500 forms within GEICO's claim file.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-154\">\n    As explained below, this \"typicality\" argument on the EMC determination and the alleged overpayment of benefits is also couched as a standing issue within GEICO's Motion for Summary Judgment. This belated standing argument is addressed below in section III(B)(2).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-155\">\n    GEICO's argument was related to general coverage defenses. GEICO did not raise the EMC issue at the certification stage.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-156\">\n    Such credibility issues would be appropriately raised at trial. However, the parties have asked the Court to address the merits of the case on summary judgment, which does not allow the Court to weigh the credibility of evidence or witnesses.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Skop v. City of Atlanta, Ga.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4077801\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/485/1130/#p1140\">\n     485 F.3d 1130\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1140 (11th Cir. 2007) (explaining that a court cannot weigh conflicting evidence on summary judgment). Because the material facts are undisputed and the issues can be resolved on summary judgment as a matter of law, the trier of fact, in this case the Court, will not have the opportunity to address questions of credibility at trial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-157\">\n    Plaintiff argues that it did not have an opportunity to address arguments GEICO raised in its Sur-reply involving the creation of an equitable assignment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. [164].\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-158\">\n    These specific requests could not have been in the original Notice of Taking Deposition. Dr. Gerber's deposition commenced on August 22, 2017, but was discontinued due to a medical emergency.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. [119]. The documents filed at ECF Nos. [133], [136] and [138] were not filed with the Court until early to mid-October of 2017-weeks after the deposition initially commenced.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-159\">\n    At the summary judgment hearing, Plaintiff faulted GEICO for not raising this EMC issue as an affirmative dense in its pleading. The Court notes that GEICO pled a standing affirmative defense on a different issue. GEICO's fourth affirmative defense states that \"GERBER does not plead a claim under a third-party beneficiary theory in its amended complaint. GERBER's assignment is insufficient to afford standing.\" ECF No. [52] at 4-5. No mention was made of the EMC issue and the exhaustion of policy limits within GEICO's affirmative defenses. Standing, however, is not a true affirmative defense but is more akin to a denial. Further, as a court of limited jurisdiction, this Court has a duty to ensure it has subject-matter jurisdiction of the claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-160\">\n    GEICO argues that this provision does not apply to the Policy because it \"only 'applies to life insurance policies and health insurance policies only at the time of original issue.' \" ECF No. [109] at 8. Not so. This subsection states: \"This requirement applies to life insurance policies and health insurance policies only at the time of original issue.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20627.413\">\n     Fla. Stat. \u00a7 627.413\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1)(g). Contrary to GEICO's argument, this statute states that it applies to \"every policy\" but, in the case of life insurance and health insurance policies, this provision\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    applies at the time of original issuance.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20627.413\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Had the Florida Legislature intended to limit the application of this provision to health insurance and life insurance policies, it would have stated so. Instead, the statute contains no such limitation as to other forms of insurance, such as automobile insurance. In fact, \"Part II of chapter 627 contains general provisions\n    <em>\n     governing all insurance contracts subject to regulation by the insurance code.\n    </em>\n    \"\n    <em>\n     Hepler v.
