On June 23, 2016, he filed a motion to vacate or correct his sentence pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , arguing that the Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

The Government has since moved to dismiss his motion. Because Petitioner assented to the terms of his plea agreement under threat of an unconstitutional ACCA-enhanced sentence, and because the sentencing court erroneously assumed that Petitioner was eligible for such a sentence, his motion is GRANTED. The Government's motion is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 27, 2014, Petitioner pleaded guilty to one count of possessing a firearm in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). Plea Agreement 1-2. As part of his plea agreement with the Government, Petitioner accepted a sentence of 120 months in prison, the statutory maximum sentence allowable for a conviction under \u00a7 922(g).\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). In doing so, Petitioner avoided the risk of a mandatory 15-year minimum sentence under the ACCA as an individual with \"three previous convictions ... for a violent felony or for a serious drug offense.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1). Although the indictment against Petitioner listed a number of past felony convictions, he was not charged as an Armed Career Criminal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment 1-2. The 120-month sentence was nevertheless a significant upward departure from the 37 to 46 months recommended under the United States Sentencing Guidelines. Gov't Sentencing Mem. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The record reflects that Petitioner's assent to this upward departure was premised on his belief, and the Government's representations, that he would otherwise be charged as an Armed Career Criminal. As stated in the plea agreement, Petitioner accepted the 120-month sentence at least in part to induce the Government's recommendation \"that the Armed Career Criminal Sentencing Enhancement under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1) should not be applied.\" Plea Agreement 2. The Government further expounded in its sentencing memorandum that the agreement would \"afford[ ] Defendant a significant benefit: avoiding the potential 15-year mandatory minimum he could have been facing as an Armed Career Criminal.\" Gov't Sentencing Mem. 3. When the district court sentenced Petitioner, it was also with the understanding that the 10-level upward variance from the guidelines range was an appropriate bargain for avoiding prosecution and a potential enhanced sentence under the ACCA.

He argues that, with the Supreme Court's invalidation of the ACCA's residual clause in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , his sentence violates the Due Process Clause. Resp. to Mot. to Dismiss 2. Petitioner asserts that every aspect of his plea agreement is infected by the ACCA's residual\n   clause.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    at 11-12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although he acknowledges that his sentence is distinct from the ACCA in name, he suggests that, as a practical matter, he was directly subject to and induced by the unconstitutional provision-it was the\n   <em>\n    sine qua non\n   </em>\n   of the entire agreement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    at 13-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the alternative, Petitioner contends that, in approving the plea agreement and imposing the requested sentence, the district court relied on objectively erroneous information.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    at 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; Pet. Supp. Br. 3-4. Specifically, the court's assumption that Petitioner would be subject to a mandatory 15-year minimum sentence was an error of constitutional magnitude and wrongfully formed the basis for his significantly above-guidelines sentence. Resp. to Mot. to Dismiss 13.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Government opposes Petitioner's motion and seeks its dismissal on two grounds. First, the Government contends that Petitioner's motion is time barred under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f) because the right recognized in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   does not extend to the advisory guidelines. Gov't Mot. to Dismiss 1-2. The Court need not address this argument because this case involves the residual clause of the ACCA, not the guidelines.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, the Government argues that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   is irrelevant because Petitioner's sentence is not pursuant to the ACCA and that, in any event, he knowingly and voluntarily bargained away his right to benefit from\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   Gov't Supp. Br. 3. Petitioner cannot, after the fact, claim misinformation or seek a better deal when he assented with a clear understanding of the risks and benefits.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Notably, the Government does not contest Petitioner's assertion that, absent the residual clause, he would have been ineligible for the ACCA enhancement. Given this implicit concession, the Court assumes that none of Petitioner's prior convictions would qualify as violent felonies absent the residual clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , a federal prisoner may move to have his sentence vacated or corrected if it was \"imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). It is uncontroversial that a sentence imposed pursuant to the residual clause of the ACCA violates the Constitution and is subject to collateral attack under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2557 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Welch v.

Although the present\n   case does not concern a sentence expressly enhanced by the residual clause, it raises an equally important adjacent question of constitutional law. At issue in the present case is whether a sentence knowingly and voluntarily agreed to under threat of an unconstitutional ACCA-enhanced sentence, and imposed by the district court based on a legal assumption later revealed to be erroneous, violates the Due Process Clause and gives rise to a cognizable claim for relief under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court concludes that it does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As an initial matter, this case reflects an inherent tension between two distinct bodies of doctrinal and prudential principles. On the one hand, the Supreme Court has long accorded significant discretion to sentencing courts and reinforced that discretion by assiduously promoting the finality of their judgments.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Custis v.

Since the district court had harbored only a subjective belief about how the Commission would behave, and not an objectively incorrect legal understanding of the circumstances supporting its sentence, relief was unavailable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1532199\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/442/178/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Although the present case is novel in that it deals with an assumption about the constitutionality of a statutory enhancement which itself was only later revealed to be erroneous, it raises the same due process concerns as the cases described above. A growing body of lower court precedent supports this view,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Terrell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271903\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/217/1277/#p1285\">\n    217 F.Supp.3d 1277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1285-87 (E.D. Wash. 2016), and the Ninth Circuit has applied its two-part due process test to at least one plea agreement reached under threat of an ACCA enhancement,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Molesky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=691%20Fed.%20Appx.%20847\">\n    691 Fed. Appx. 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 848 (9th Cir. 2017) (unpublished). In particular, the district court in the present case, like that in\n   <em>\n    Eakman\n   </em>\n   , made an erroneous legal assumption about the applicability of the ACCA enhancement when it sentenced Petitioner. This error, unlike that in\n   <em>\n    Addonizio\n   </em>\n   , was not the result of a subjective belief about an outside entity's future actions, but rather an externally verifiable mistake of law, clearly reflected in the Plea Agreement, Presentence Report, and Sentencing Memo. Without this error, the district court would never have approved the terms of Petitioner's plea agreement. The fact that the assumption appeared correct at the time of sentencing, as\n   <em>\n    Tucker\n   </em>\n   makes clear, is of no consequence given the constitutional nature of the infirmity and\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   's retroactive applicability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Even if the district court did not rely on misinformation of a constitutional magnitude, Petitioner's sentence would still violate the Due Process Clause under a direct application of\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   The Supreme Court's invalidation of the residual clause in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   was premised on the principle that taking \"life, liberty, or property under a criminal law so vague that it fails to give ordinary people fair notice of the conduct it punishes, or so standardless that it invites arbitrary enforcement,\" violates the Constitution's guarantee of due process.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It was fundamentally unfair, the Court explained, to expose defendants to an above-maximum sentence enhancement when it was virtually impossible to predict the type of conduct subject to that enhancement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"The residual clause,\" it opined, \"produces more unpredictability and arbitrariness than the Due Process Clause tolerates.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    at 2558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court concluded that the ACCA's residual clause is \"vague in all its applications\" and that \"increasing a defendant's sentence under the clause denies due process of law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    at 2557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Petitioner's sentence falls squarely within the scope of\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   To hold otherwise-finding that his sentence was distinct from the ACCA, did not involve an application of the residual clause, and was not increased thereby-would be disingenuous. As other lower courts in the Ninth Circuit have concluded, the threatened ACCA enhancement increased Petitioner's sentence and \"permeated the entire process\" leading to its adoption.\n   <em>\n    Pressley v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12185422\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/201/1277/#p1282\">\n    201 F.Supp.3d 1277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1282 (W.D.

Wash. June 20, 2016). Although Petitioner is not serving an above-maximum term like the prisoner in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , this is a distinction in search of a relevant difference. Petitioner suffered from the same lack of fair notice regarding his potential qualification for the ACCA's mandatory 15-year minimum and the Government, in retrospect, had no right to threaten an unconstitutional sentence as a means of obtaining a sentence three-times that of Petitioner's advisory guideline range. The transactional nature of plea agreements notwithstanding, Petitioner was equally entitled to be free from the type of uncertainty in sentencing which was so forcefully rejected by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Petitioner's motion to vacate or correct his sentence under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   is GRANTED and the Government's motion to dismiss is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    Contrary to the Government's assertion Petitioner never attacks his plea agreement on the grounds that it was not taken knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Gov't Supp. Mem. 3.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    Even assuming that the Government made pervasive typographical errors in its briefs and actually intended to challenge the timeliness of Petitioner's motion based on the argument that the right recognized in\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    does not extend to\n    <em>\n     plea agreements\n    </em>\n    reached under threat of an ACCA-enhanced sentence, this argument is without merit. Unlike other cases recently decided by this Court which involved guidelines sentences,\n    <em>\n     see, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Or. 2017), there is no question that Petitioner, in challenging a sentence allegedly based on the residual clause of the ACCA, asserts the same right recognized by the Supreme Court in\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     .\n    </em>\n    The Court can find no controlling or persuasive precedent to suggest otherwise.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    The Court also agrees with Petitioner's substantive argument that his Oregon Burglary II conviction would no longer qualify as a violent felony without the residual clause.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.
