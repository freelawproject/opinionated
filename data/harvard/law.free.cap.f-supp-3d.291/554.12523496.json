Following an appearance by counsel for the Rosen defendants, Hollander learned that Rosen had sold its business to the Gutman defendants in November 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Affidavit of Stanley Rosen, dated May 30, 2017 (annexed as Ex. 1 to Declaration of Stephanie J.

Accordingly, Hollander amended its complaint to name the Gutman defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint, filed June 22, 2017 (Docket # 27) (\"Am. Compl.\"). RPGM was served on July 3, 2017,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Affidavit of Service, filed July 20, 2017 (Docket # 33), and David Gutman was served on July 6, 2017,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Affidavit of Service, filed July 20, 2017 (Docket # 34).

Order to Show Cause for Default Judgment Against Defendants Rosen-Paramount Glass &amp; Mirror, LLC, and David Gutman, filed Aug. 24, 2017 (Docket # 41). On September 19, 2017, Judge Broderick ordered that a default judgment be entered against the Gutman defendants in an amount to be determined after inquest, and decreed that the Gutman defendants be permanently enjoined from further infringement of Hollander's trademark and copyright as alleged in the amended complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Default Judgment Order, filed Sept. 19, 2017 (Docket # 46) (\"Default Judgment Order\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Shortly thereafter, Hollander filed the instant motion for a default judgment against the Gutman defendants seeking damages in the amount of $150,000, together with attorneys' fees in the amount of $54,102.25 and costs in the amount of $1663.42, for a total of $205,765.67.

In response to a court order,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Order, filed Feb. 15, 2018 (Docket # 68), Hollander annotated its records to indicate which hours were expended in litigation with the Gutman defendants, the Rosen defendants, or both,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Rollings 2d Decl. at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Hollander contends its attorneys and their support staff spent 32.75 hours on litigation with the Gutman defendants and 56.05 hours on work attributable to both the Rosen defendants and the Gutman defendants, for a total of 88.8 hours.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7391850\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/742/822/#p837\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In theory, the 56.05 hours expended in support of claims against both the Rosen and Gutman defendants might be fully compensable to the extent they were necessarily spent in order to pursue the default judgment against the Gutman defendants. However, there are a number of instances where the time entries attributable to both defendants reflect that at least some of the time is not compensable. For example, an entry dated May 31, 2017, reflects that Rollings spent 1.9 hours as follows: \"Review opposing counsel objection to OTSC and default; research corporate dissolution issues; conference [Eric Menist], re: dissolution issues; draft/edit amended complaint.\" Rollings 2d Decl. at *13. While we accept that a substantial share of the time drafting the amended complaint was necessary to make claims against the Gutman defendants, the billing entry includes time obviously attributable exclusively to the Rosen defendants: specifically, the review of the objection of the Rosen attorney to an order to show cause as well as research related to the Rosen defendants' corporate dissolution defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Even the 32.75 hours attributable solely to the Gutman defendants cannot be relied upon. For example, an entry dated October 12, 2017, by Jeffrey Rollings states that he spent 3.7 hours on: \"Teleconference opposing counsel, re: referral to magistrate order; teleconference Judge's chambers clerk, re: order error; review/analyze conference order, re: initial conference, magistrate referral, edit inquest papers for default; conference [eric menist] same.\" Rollings 2d Decl. at *26-27. While the notation next to the entry identifies the time as spent exclusively on the Gutman defendants, part of the entry is apparently time spent on the Rosen defendants since it references a conversation with the Rosen defendants' attorney, i.e., \"teleconference opposing counsel,\" and the opposing counsel in fact sent a letter that same day that purported to be on behalf of the plaintiff as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter from Stephanie J. Kaufman, dated Oct. 12, 2017 (Docket # 52).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Additionally, the time entries submitted include many instances of what is commonly referred to as \"block billing\"-that is, the aggregation of a number of tasks in a single time entry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Rollings 2d Decl. at *15 (June 7, 2017), *23 (Sept. 22, 2017), *26 (Oct. 13, 2017).
