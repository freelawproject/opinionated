LEON, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Bean LLC, doing business as Fusion GPS (\"Fusion\" or \"plaintiff\"), applies to this Court for an order enjoining the enforcement of a Congressional subpoena (\"the Subpoena\") that requires the production of certain financial records from Fusion's bank, Defendant Bank (\"the Bank\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Subpoena, issued by the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the U.S. House of Representatives (\"the Committee\"), seeks records of Fusion's financial transactions with certain clients and contractors. The Committee issued the Subpoena in conjunction with its investigation into Russian active measures-\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   Russian conduct, direct and indirect in nature, calculated to advance Russia's political agenda-directed at the 2016 U.S. presidential election (\"the 2016 Presidential election\"). The Subpoena followed revelations in the press that Fusion had a role in compiling a series of memos-together commonly known as \"the Trump Dossier\" (also referred to herein as \"the Dossier\")-that alleges ties between President Donald Trump and the Kremlin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Although the Subpoena was issued to Defendant Bank-not to Fusion-Fusion filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, seeking to enjoin the Bank from complying with the Subpoena on the ground that it is overly broad, unauthorized, and requests records of Fusion's business transactions that are irrelevant to the Committee's investigative inquiry. While the Committee and Fusion were able to negotiate a narrowing of the thousands of records responsive to the Subpoena, they unfortunately could not agree as to seventy of those records. As to these, Fusion asserts that the Subpoena violates its First Amendment rights to speech and association, as well as its rights under certain financial privacy laws. This matter is now fully briefed and ripe for resolution. Upon consideration of the pleadings, oral argument, and the entire record herein. Fusion's Renewed\n   Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence is a standing committee of the United States House of Representatives, charged with oversight of the intelligence community and intelligence-related activities and programs of the United States Government.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H.R. Res. 658, 95th Cong. (1977). Pursuant to those oversight responsibilities, the Committee is currently conducting an investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 Presidential election.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Press Release, U.S. House of Representatives Permanent Select Comm. on Intelligence, Intelligence Committee Chairman, Ranking Member Establish Parameters for Russia Investigation (Mar. 1, 2017) (\"March 1, 2017 Press Release\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Among other things, the Committee's investigation is seeking answers to the following questions: (1) \"What Russian cyber activity and other active measures were directed against the United States and its allies?\" and (2) \"Did the Russian active measures include links between Russia and individuals associated with political campaigns or any other U.S. Persons?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Fusion is a research firm that provides strategic intelligence, opposition research-including research on political candidates-and due diligence services to corporations, law firms, and investors. Decl. of Peter Fritsch (\"Fritsch Decl.\") [Dkt. # 2-2] \u00b6 6. During the 2016 Presidential election campaign, an unknown third party engaged Fusion's services to conduct political opposition research on then-candidate Donald J.

In early 2016, that unknown client terminated its contract with Fusion, but another client took over the contract, seeking the same opposition research. Stewart Decl \u00b6 5. As part of this research, Fusion hired a former British intelligence officer, Christopher Steele (\"Steele\"), to research Mr. Trump's ties to Russia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6; Fritsch Decl. \u00b6 9. Steele's research led to a series of memos that has become known in the press as the \"Trump Dossier.\" Stewart Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6; Fritsch Decl. \u00b6 9. The Dossier made unverified allegations of misconduct regarding Mr. Trump's relationship with Russian individuals, as well as allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and representatives of the Russian government during the 2016 Presidential election. Stewart Decl. \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   It was later revealed that Steele was paid an undisclosed sum of money for work he performed on behalf of the FBI, and that the Trump Dossier was provided to the FBI in 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4-7, 9. It also came to light that other individuals in the Intelligence Community were aware of the Trump Dossier and its contents, and that they provided briefings about the Dossier to both President Obama and President-elect Trump in January 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9. As a result, the Committee is seeking to discover,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   who paid Fusion for the Trump Dossier, who received it, whether steps were taken to verify its accuracy, and whether the FBI relied on the Dossier as grounds for its counterintelligence investigation into potential coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government to influence the 2016 Presidential election.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After unsuccessful attempts to obtain relevant documents and testimony from Fusion itself,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Stewart Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 12-13, Committee Chairman Devin Nunes (\"Chairman Nunes\") issued subpoenas for testimony and documents to each of Fusion's principals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14. Fusion's principals objected to these subpoenas, but on October 18, 2017, two of them appeared for compelled testimony, during which they invoked constitutional privileges not to testify pursuant to the First and Fifth Amendments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On October 5, 2017, the Committee served the Subpoena at issue in this dispute on Defendant Bank, seeking \"all documents sufficient to identify Fusion GPS's banking transaction history, among other items, from August 1, 2015 to October 4, 2017.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14; Decl. of Joshua A. Levy (\"Levy Decl.\") Ex. A [Dkt. # 2-3]. The Bank initially raised a number of objections to the Subpoena, but after the Committee rejected all of those objections, the Bank, on October 19, 2017, agreed to comply and produce all responsive documents by 9 A.M. on October 23, 2017. Stewart Decl. \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In response, Fusion immediately filed the instant action on October 20, 2017, seeking to enjoin the Bank from turning over records of Fusion's financial transactions to the Committee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 3. Curiously, Fusion did not name the Committee as a defendant, but instead listed only Defendant Bank.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9. This case was initially assigned to my colleague, Judge Tanya Chutkan, and she held a telephonic hearing with all interested parties-including the Committee-at 5 P.M. on the day the suit was filed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   10/20/17 Minute Entry; Telephone Conference Tr., Oct. 20, 2017 [Dkt. # 18]. The Committee formally intervened in this case the following day.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Intervene [Dkt. # 7]; 10/21/17 Minute Order (granting the Committee's Motion to Intervene).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After reviewing the pleadings, the Court again held a telephonic hearing with the parties on October 24, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   10/24/17 Minute Entry. Noting her \"reluctan[ce] to wade into this dispute because it presents issues on which there is very little authority, and because it involves a congressional investigation in which [the Court does] not wish to intrude,\" the Court stated that \"both sides have an interest in resolving this dispute short of judicial involvement.\" Telephone Conference Tr. 4:16-18, 5:22-25, Oct. 24, 2017 [Dkt. # 17]. The Court accordingly \"strongly encourage[ed] the parties to try and arrive at an agreement,\" and gave them until 6 P.M. on October 26, 2017 to do so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5:24-25; 10/24/17 Minute Entry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Spurred by the Court's directive, the parties were able to find common ground, and they entered into a Confidential Agreement that provided a mutually agreeable process by which the Committee could review the requested documents. The Court entered a Stipulation and Order binding the parties to the terms of the Confidential Agreement, and it also entered\n   a Sealed Protective Order to preserve the confidentiality of the records sought by the Subpoena.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stipulation &amp; Order [Dkt. # 19] 1. Two days later, the Court dismissed the case, but it retained jurisdiction, should any disputes arise.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2; Order of Dismissal [Dkt. # 21].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   While these events were unfolding, however, the Committee learned from a\n   <em>\n    Washington Post\n   </em>\n   report that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee (\"DNC\") had provided funding to Fusion for the research that resulted in the Trump Dossier. Decl. of Scott L. Glabe (\"Glabe Decl.\") [Dkt. # 37-2] \u00b6 11. Specifically, the\n   <em>\n    Washington Post\n   </em>\n   reported that Mark E. Elias, an attorney with the law firm Perkins Coie-who represented both the Clinton Campaign and the DNC-was the individual who retained Fusion for the purposes of gathering opposition research on Mr. Trump.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Committee also learned from public reporting that Fusion was accused of acting as an unregistered agent of the Russian government, in violation of the Foreign Agent Registration Act, based on work it performed for Prevezon Holdings (\"Prevezon\"), a Russian state-owned company.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6. This same report revealed that Prevezon organized its lobbying efforts through the law firm Baker Hostetler, which was also providing litigation services for Prevezon on a criminal asset forfeiture case being brought by the U.S. Justice Department in the Southern District of New York.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 6, 21. Together, these reports confirmed that various law firms and businesses had retained Fusion on behalf of their clients to perform Russia-related work, thus triggering the Committee's investigative interest in identifying other businesses that sought Fusion's services during the same relevant time period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 20-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On October 27, 2017, pursuant to the terms of the parties' Confidential Agreement, the Bank produced certain responsive records, and the Committee reviewed them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 12-15. The Committee's review was informed, in part, by classified information in the Committee's possession.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19. On November 1, 2017, the Committee identified eighty-two transactions necessary for its investigation that had not been previously produced by the Bank.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18. The Committee also sought re-production of thirty transactions already produced in the initial production.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In total, the Committee requested that Fusion instruct the Bank to produce, or re-produce, records of one hundred and twelve transactions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   To support its requests, the Committee also submitted a justification for each payor or payee, explaining the nexus between the records sought and the Committee's investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   That same day, Fusion objected to the Committee's requests, arguing that the requested records-which contained financial transactions between Fusion and certain law firms, media companies, journalists, and contractors-were irrelevant to the Russia investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply in Supp. of Pl.'s Renewed Appl. for a TRO &amp; Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (\"Pl.'s Renewed Reply\") Ex. C [Dkt # 35-3]. On November 3, 2017, the Bank produced twelve of the requested transactions, leaving seventy previously unproduced transactions-and thirty re-productions-outstanding. Glabe Decl. \u00b6 33. The parties were ultimately unable to come to an agreement on these seventy remaining transactions, so plaintiff moved to reopen this case and filed its renewed motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction on November 3, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Reopen Case [Dkt. # 22]; Pl.'s Renewed Appl. for TRO &amp; Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (\"Pl.'s Renewed Mot.\") [Dkt. # 23]. Shortly thereafter, Judge Chutkan\n   recused herself, and this case was randomly reassigned to me on November 9, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reassignment of Civil Case [Dkt. # 29].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On November 15, 2017, I held the first hearing since plaintiff filed its renewed motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   11/15/17 Minute Entry. During this initial hearing, I consolidated plaintiff's motion for a temporary restraining order and motion for a preliminary injunction. Motions Hr'g Tr. 6:16-24, 7:2-6, November 15, 2017 [Dkt. # 41]. I also expressed concern that all of the pleadings had been filed under seal. Noting that \"having public, open hearings on a matter is in the best interest of all concerned,\" I ordered that the pleadings \"be reconstituted and refiled not under seal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7:10-11, 7:16-17. Although I permitted the parties to file certain documents under seal, the bulk of the pleadings were refiled in a redacted, public format. After reviewing the filings, I held oral argument on November 30, 2017, bifurcating the hearing into a public session for legal arguments, and a sealed session to discuss any confidential issues that might need to be addressed by the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   11/30/17 Minute Entry. Plaintiff's motion is now ripe for my review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff is seeking a preliminary injunction, which requires compliance with the same standard as a temporary restraining order.\n   <em>\n    Hall v.

I address each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Fusion's Claim that the Subpoena Lacks a Valid Legislative Purpose\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff first contends that the Subpoena is invalid because it was issued\n   without authority. Specifically, plaintiff avers that, in issuing the Subpoena, \"Mr. Nunes has acted alone, pursuant to no resolution.\" Pl.'s Appl. for a TRO &amp; Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (\"Pl.'s Mot.\") [Dkt. # 2-1] 7. According to plaintiff, the Committee was required to have a \"formal public 'unambiguous resolution' [to] authoriz[e] this investigation,\" and because no such resolution exists, \"the subpoena is not part of a legitimate legislative activity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   I disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   To begin with, it is clear that Congress has delegated to the Committee its investigatory power over intelligence-related activities. The Constitution provides that \"[e]ach House [ of Congress] may determine the Rules of its Proceedings,\" U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 5, cl. 2., and the House of Representatives has delegated this authority to its committees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rules of the House of Representatives (\"House Rules\"), Rule XI.1(b)(1) (\"Each committee may conduct at any time such investigations and studies as it considers necessary or appropriate in the exercise of its responsibilities.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, the Committee's responsibilities include oversight of \"the activities of the intelligence community.\" House Rule X.3(m);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   House Rule X.11(b)(1). And to exercise this oversight role, the Committee is authorized to issue subpoenas for, among other things, \"[t]he production of memoranda, documents, records, or any other tangible item.\" Rules of the Permanent Select Comm. on Intelligence (\"Comm. Rules\"), Rule 10(b)(2)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   House Rule XI.2(m)(l)(B) (\"For the purpose of carrying out any of its functions and duties ... a committee or subcommittee is authorized ... to require, by subpoena or otherwise, the attendance and testimony of such witnesses and the production of such books, records, correspondence, memoranda, papers, and documents as it considers necessary.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff argues that, even if the Committee is authorized to conduct investigations into intelligence-related issues, Chairman Nunes acted\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   in unilaterally issuing the Subpoena, and thus the Subpoena is not legitimate legislative activity. Pl.'s Mot. 5. According to plaintiff, Chairman Nunes recused himself from the Committee's Russia investigation, and \"he himself remains under investigation by the House Ethics Committee for his alleged misconduct related to [that] investigation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Therefore, under plaintiff's theory, Chairman Nunes acted outside the scope of his authority in unilaterally issuing the Subpoena. Unfortunately for plaintiff, the record contradicts its claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The press release that plaintiff cites for the proposition that Chairman Nunes recused himself indicates that Chairman Nunes would \"have Representative Mike Conaway ... temporarily take charge of the Committee's Russia investigation while the House Ethics Committee looks into the matter,\" but that he would \"continue to fulfill all [his] other responsibilities as Committee Chairman.\" Press Release, U.S. House of Representatives Permanent Select Comm. on Intelligence, Nunes Statement on Russia Investigation (April 6, 2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nowhere in this press release did Chairman Nunes \"recuse\" himself from the Russia investigation. Instead, he simply designated another Committee\n   member to take charge of the investigation, as permitted by the Committee Rules.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Comm. Rule 9(b) (\"An authorized investigation may be conducted by members of the Committee or Committee Staff designated by the Chair.\"). And despite Chairman Nunes's decision to allow other Committee members to take charge of the Russia investigation pending the resolution of his ethics investigation, he retained the power to issue the Subpoena at issue in this case. Pursuant to Committee Rule 10, \"[a]ll subpoenas shall be authorized by the Chair of the full Committee\" and are to \"be signed by the Chair.\" Comm. Rule 10(a), (c). Indeed, the Subpoena would be invalid\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   Chairman Nunes's signature unless the full Committee authorized another member to sign it, which it did not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Comm. Rule 10(c). Plaintiff's claim that Chairman Nunes's decision to allow Representative Conaway to take charge of the investigation somehow stripped him of his powers as Chairman is therefore unfounded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff counters that the Subpoena is still invalid because the Russia investigation was not authorized by a \"formal public\" resolution. Pl.'s Mot. 7. Fusion's theory appears to be that every Congressional investigation must be authorized by a separate formal resolution in order to qualify as legitimate legislative activity. To say the least, that is wishful thinking!

Specifically, Fusion asserts that the Bank's compliance with the Subpoena \"would abridge Plaintiff's First Amendment rights to engage in free political speech, free political activity, and free association.\" Pl.'s Mot. 11. According to plaintiff, disclosure of its financial records would reveal the identity of its clients, and thus would hinder them from contracting anonymously with Fusion in the future. To bolster this assertion, plaintiff submitted affidavits from anonymous law firm partners and owners of consulting firms who asserted that they would not have engaged Fusion's services if they had known that their association would not be kept confidential.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Reply in Supp. of Appl. for a TRO &amp; Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (\"Pl.'s Reply\") Ex. 5 [Dkt. # 13-3]; Pl.'s Reply Ex. 7 [Dkt. # 13-5]. If Fusion's commercial relationship with its clients were revealed, plaintiff insists, it would chill Fusion's ability to do certain kinds of political work and associate with its clients anonymously. Pl.'s Mot. 12-14. At bottom,\n   Fusion's argument amounts to a claim that the Subpoena intrudes on its associational rights under the First Amendment because it would hinder its ability to associate anonymously with its clients, and would thus chill its protected political activity. Unfortunately for plaintiff, I cannot agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that the Committee's disclosure requests violate the private nature of plaintiff's relationships with its customers-relationships that plaintiff claims are protected by the First Amendment. But plaintiff points to\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   authority to support its theory that the freedom of association protects financial records. And this is not surprising, given that commercial transactions do not give rise to associational rights, even where the subjects of those transactions are protected by the First Amendment. Indeed, courts have uniformly held that the kind of commercial relationships Fusion seeks to shield from governmental inquiry here are not protected as associational rights under the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   For example, in\n   <em>\n    FEC v.

It did so on the ground that the subpoenas sought \"information regarding corporate and business transactions,\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   information regarding any political association the [vendor] may have had with [its customer].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"576506\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/888/539/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"576506\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/888/539/\">\n    at 541-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

The financial records the Committee seeks show only the name of the payor or payee, the amount of the payment, and certain identifying information; they do\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   indicate what the payment was for. And the Committee's executive session rules-which require subpoenaed materials, including the seventy transactions at issue in this case, to be kept confidential-are designed to prevent the disclosure that plaintiff fears.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Comm.

To support its fears, Fusion alleges that the Committee \"leaked the identity of Defendant Bank to the media\" and leaked the fact that Fusion's principals asserted constitutional privileges during their executive session interviews.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20L.%20Ed.%201131\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, according to plaintiff, the Committee cannot be trusted with other confidential information, even if it promises to protect that information as executive session material. But apart from plaintiff's blanket accusations in its briefing and at oral argument, Fusion has provided no evidence to support these allegations. The mere fact that confidential information was disclosed to the public, without more to show that the Committee played a role in the disclosure, casts no doubt on the Committee's compliance with its executive session rules. This is especially true in light of the fact that Fusion itself has played a role in publicizing aspects of this litigation and the Committee's investigation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Jeremy Herb &amp; Evan Perez,\n   <em>\n    Fusion GPS Partners Plead Fifth Before House Intel\n   </em>\n   , CNN, Oct. 18, 2017, (noting that\n   <em>\n    Fusion's attorney\n   </em>\n   revealed that Fusion's principals invoked their Fifth Amendment rights not to answer questions before the Committee).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, absent evidence to suggest that the Committee will not follow its own rules-and plaintiff has presented this Court with none-I must presume that those rules are being followed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Navy Chaplaincy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4028338\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/850/86/#p94\">\n    850 F.Supp.2d 86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 94 (D.D.C. 2012) ( [W]ell-settled case law ... requires a court to presume that government officials will conduct themselves properly and in good faith.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   For all of these reasons, I find that Fusion has failed to show that compliance with the Subpoena poses an actual, meaningful threat to its First Amendment rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Fusion's Challenges Pursuant to the RFPA and the GLBA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Finally, plaintiff argues that compliance with the Subpoena would violate two distinct statutory schemes. First, plaintiff asserts that the RFPA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203401\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ,\"prohibits banks from releasing customer records to a Government authority,\" and thus the Bank's release of the disputed records would violate that Act. Pl.'s Mot. 8. Second, plaintiff alleges that the GLBA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201601\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , prohibits the Bank from \"disclos[ing] to a nonaffiliated third party any nonpublic personal information,\" and because Fusion did not receive the statutorily mandated notice and opportunity to opt out, the Subpoena cannot be enforced\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201601\">\n    at 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ultimately, I find both of plaintiff's arguments to be without merit. How so?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   To begin with, plaintiff has no rights under the RFPA because it is not a \"person\" who may qualify as a \"customer\" for the purposes of that statute. A \"customer\" is defined under the RFPA as \"any person or authorized representative of that person who utilized or is utilizing any service of a financial institution.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203401\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 3401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5). A \"person\" is defined in the RFPA as \"an individual or a partnership of five or fewer individuals.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203401\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 3401(4). Plaintiff is a limited liability company organized under Delaware law,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 6; it is not a partnership or an individual. Fusion insists that a limited liability company \"is akin to a limited partnership,\" and thus it should be treated as a customer under the RFPA. Pl.'s Reply 18. But in construing the terms of the RFPA, I \"adher[e] strictly to the explicit, unambiguous definition of customer found in the Act.\"\n   <em>\n    Ridgeley v. Merchants State Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7400760\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/699/100/#p102\">\n    699 F.Supp. 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 102 (N.D. Tex. 1988). Because the RFPA's definition of person is not ambiguous, but instead is clearly set out in the definitions section of the statute, I must apply its plain, ordinary meaning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pittsburgh Nat'l Bank v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"338464\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/771/73/#p75\">\n    771 F.2d 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 75 (3d Cir. 1985) (\"[A] definition which declares what a term means excludes any meaning that is not stated.\" (internal citations, alterations, and quotation marks omitted)). Indeed, other courts to address this issue have reached the same conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Exchange Point LLC v. SEC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503148\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/100/172/#p174\">\n    100 F.Supp.2d 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 174 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) (\"The Court concludes that Movant, as a limited liability company, is not a person as defined by the RFPA and does not have standing to object to the Subpoena.\"). Fusion accordingly may not object to the Subpoena by invoking the protections of the RFPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Unfortunately for plaintiff, the text of the statute equally forecloses Fusion's\n   claim of rights under the GLBA. The GLBA applies to the disclosure of \"nonpublic personal information\" of a \"consumer.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206802\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 6802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The Act defines a \"consumer\" as \"an individual who obtains, from a financial institution, financial products or services which are to be used primarily for personal, family, or household purposes\" or \"the legal representative of such an individual.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206802\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 6809(9). Plaintiff is a limited liability company, not an individual,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 6, and thus the GLBA does not shield plaintiff from the Committee's document requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Subpoena at issue in today's case was issued pursuant to a constitutionally authorized investigation by a Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives with jurisdiction over intelligence and intelligence-related activities-activities designed to protect us from potential cyber-attacks now and in the future. The Subpoena seeks the production of records of financial transactions that have a \"reasonable possibility,\"\n   <em>\n    Packwood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3883506\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/845/17/#p21\">\n    845 F.Supp. at 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , of producing information relevant to that constitutionally authorized investigation. Although the records being sought by the Subpoena are sensitive in nature-and merit the use of appropriate precautions by the Committee to ensure they are not publicly disclosed-the nature of the records themselves, and the Committee's procedures designed to ensure their confidentiality, more than adequately protect the sensitivity of that information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Thus, because I find all of Fusion's objections to the Subpoena to be unavailing, Fusion cannot satisfy the first factor of its burden for obtaining a preliminary injunction-a likelihood of success on the merits-and I need go no further.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Plaintiff's motion must therefore be DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    On the same day that it filed its Complaint, Fusion moved for Defendant Bank to proceed under a pseudonym, arguing that, \"if the name of its bank was[sic] made public, hackers interested in Plaintiffs' confidential information would go after the Defendant Bank's records.\" Mot. for Def. to Proceed Under a Pseudonym [Dkt. # 3] 3.
