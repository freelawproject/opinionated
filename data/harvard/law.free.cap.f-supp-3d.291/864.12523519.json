Gish admits that he killed his girlfriend. But he seeks a writ of habeas corpus under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , arguing that the Wisconsin Court of Appeals unreasonably rejected his claim that his trial counsel was ineffective because counsel failed to investigate and inform Gish of a potential defense of involuntary intoxication. If Gish had known about that defense, he says, he wouldn't have accepted the state's plea deal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Gish's petition is now fully briefed and ready for a decision. After considering the parties' submissions, I conclude that the Wisconsin Court of Appeals unreasonably applied federal law regarding ineffective assistance of counsel. I will hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether Gish is entitled to habeas relief, and I will appoint counsel to represent him at the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I draw the following facts from the petition, briefs, and state court records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the early morning of July 14, 2012, police found Christopher Gish wandering near General Mitchell Airport in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, after he had crashed his girlfriend's minivan. Soon after, police found Gish's girlfriend, Margaret Litwicki, dead in Gish and Litwicki's bedroom. She had been stabbed several times in the head, neck, and chest. Upon questioning,\n   Gish admitted to stabbing Litwicki, explaining that he became upset when she told him she was having an affair and threatened to leave him and take their children with her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Gish was charged with first-degree intentional homicide in Milwaukee County Case No. 12-CF-3564. He was appointed a lawyer, Nathan Opland-Dobs, to represent him. On November 19, 2012, Gish pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of first-degree reckless homicide. The circuit court sentenced Gish to 40 years' confinement and 20 years' extended supervision. Gish did not file a postconviction relief motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On direct appeal, Gish's appointed counsel, Michael Backes, filed a no-merit report under Wis. Stat. \u00a7 (Rule) 809.32, which Gish contested. Gish contended that Opland-Dobs was ineffective for failing to investigate and inform Gish of a potential involuntary intoxication defense under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20939.42\">\n    Wis.

He pointed to police reports that Gish was found \"wandering on the train tracks[,] soaking wet[,] unsteady on his feet[, and] unable to answer any questions\" shortly after the murder, leading the first responders to take him to the hospital, where he continued to appear \"disoriented.\" Dkt. 12-5, at 29, 34. The reports indicate that when Gish began responding to the paramedics' questions, he said things like \"All I saw was red,\" \"I blacked out,\" and \"She's upstairs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20939.42\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wis.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20939.42\">\n    at 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The defendant may file a response. Rule 809.32(1)(e). The appeals\n   court must then review the report and response. If it \"determines that further appellate proceedings would be frivolous and without any arguable merit, [it] shall affirm the judgment of conviction.\" Rule 809.32(3).

Wiseman &amp; Michael Tobin,\n   <em>\n    Wisconsin Practice Series: Criminal Practice and Procedure\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 17.25 (2d ed.) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   I turn now to an analysis of Gish's claim, keeping in mind that the ultimate question is not whether Gish's allegations, if true, would support an involuntary intoxication defense; the question is not even whether there is a reasonable probability that the trial court would have instructed the jury on the defense. Rather, the question is whether Gish's counsel erred in failing to investigate or inform him of the defense and whether there is a reasonable probability that Gish would not have pleaded guilty if he had known about the defense-that probability may exist even if the chances of succeeding on the defense would have been slim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Here, the appeals court determined that Gish's ineffective assistance argument was without any arguable merit because \"there wasn't anything to investigate\" concerning the involuntary intoxication defense. Dkt. 12-7, at 8. This conclusion is puzzling in light of Gish's allegations. Police records available to Opland-Dobs indicate that Gish was taking prescription psychoactive medicine around the time of the crime and was found hours after the crime in a confused, delusional state. Gish told his interrogator that he blacked out, lost his mind, and thought that stabbing Litwicki \"was the right thing to do.\" Dkt. 12-5, at 44. Upon reviewing these records, competent counsel would have investigated further to\n   determine whether Gish could raise involuntary intoxication as an affirmative defense. Upon investigation, counsel would have discovered that Gish was prescribed two to four times the recommended amount of Xanax, that known side effects of Xanax include fear, confusional state, hallucination, rage, disinhibition, hostility, and mania, and that \"Xanax and Lamictal have been known to produce aggressive, and assaultive behavior, as well as temporary memory loss, and hostile behavior.\" Dkt. 14, at 18. Armed with \"some evidence\" that Gish took prescription medicine, that he was unable to distinguish right from wrong during the crime, and that there was a causal link between the two, competent counsel likely could have obtained a jury instruction on involuntary intoxication. At that point, the affirmative defense would have succeeded at trial unless the state proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Gish was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   rendered unable to distinguish right from wrong by his medicine. Gish says that had he known about the affirmative defense, he would not have accepted the state's plea deal. Gish's allegations, which I must accept as true at this point in the proceedings, satisfy\n   <em>\n    Strickland.\n   </em>\n   Gish's claim is far from frivolous. The appeals court's conclusion that Gish's trial counsel was not arguably ineffective is objectively unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Respondent argues that the defense would not have succeeded because Gish could remember events that took place before the crime; Gish could not name a witness who could testify about the effect of the medicine on Gish; and later on, Gish showed remorse for his crime. The state certainly could have raised these points at trial, but the ultimate issue is not whether the defense would have succeeded at trial, but whether, if Gish's counsel had investigated the affirmative defense and told Gish about it, it is reasonably probable that Gish would have refused to plead and insisted on going to trial. Taking all of Gish's allegations as true, the answer is yes. So \u00a7 2254(d) does not bar habeas relief, and I will conduct an evidentiary hearing on Gish's ineffective assistance claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    C.
