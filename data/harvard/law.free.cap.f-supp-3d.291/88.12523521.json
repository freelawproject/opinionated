In 2016, Winmar was hired to renovate the Hilton Crystal City at Washington Reagan National Airport Hotel (\"the Hilton\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. To accomplish the renovations, Winmar entered into five contracts with JK Moving to move and store the Hilton's furniture.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. The relevant contracts were negotiated and signed in D.C. between February and December 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The furniture was moved from the Hilton, located in Arlington, Virginia, and stored in JK Moving's warehouse, located in Sterling, Virginia.

JK Moving has demanded that that Winmar pay the additional $50,000 allegedly owed pursuant to the contracts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. Winmar alleges that JK Moving damaged sixteen pieces of furniture\n   and converted thirteen pieces of furniture.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Winmar also alleges that the contracts are void because JK Moving does not have a moving and storage license, as required by D.C. law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Seeking to collect the entire sum allegedly owed, JK Moving sued Winmar and its President, Edwin Villegas, for breach of contract and fraud in Loudoun County Circuit Court on October 12, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Eastern District Compl., ECF No. 6-1.

Winmar provides no information regarding this factor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n, ECF No. 8. \"The importance of this factor is ... lessened where, as here, the two potential districts are in close proximity.\"\n   <em>\n    Treppel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4189685\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/793/429/#p436\">\n    793 F.Supp.2d at 438\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (transferring from D.C. to Eastern District).

Def.'s Reply, ECF No. 10 at 9. Winmar does not allege that the Eastern District is unfamiliar with the laws governing its complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n, ECF No. 8 at 7-9.

While the declaratory relief determination will be made pursuant to D.C. law, the other two counts in the complaint are common law claims that will most likely be governed by Virginia law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 18-27. \"Under the District of Columbia's choice of law rules, the law governing the plaintiff's claims is the law of the state with the most significant relationship to the matters at issue.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7650429\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/944/13/#p16\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because the contract was performed in Virginia and it was that performance that gave rise to Winmar's claims, the common law claims will likely be governed by Virginia law.

Moreover, it is reasonable to assume that Virginia courts are familiar with D.C. law, given the close proximity of the jurisdictions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jimenez v.

Conclusion and Order\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Having considered all of the relevant factors, the Court concludes that JK Moving has made the necessary showing that \"considerations of convenience and the interests of justice weigh in favor of a transfer.\"\n   <em>\n    Berry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4016175\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/49/71/#p74\">\n    49 F.Supp.3d at 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). The Court is persuaded that the parties and their witnesses will be inconvenienced and judicial resources will be wasted if the two inextricably linked cases are litigated in two different forums.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4016175\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/49/71/#p74\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4016175\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/49/71/#p74\">\n    at 76-77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (transferring in part because the plaintiff filed four civil actions \"arising out of the same set of facts\" in the other district). Both cases likely involve the same witnesses, who will no doubt be inconvenienced by having to participate in two similar cases in two different forums.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   While the burden remains with the movant JK Moving, it is significant that Winmar does not allege that it will be prejudiced if its case is transferred to the Eastern District.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n, ECF No. 8. Indeed, Winmar anticipated litigating these claims in the Eastern District when it asserted them as affirmative defenses in its answer. Eastern District Answer, ECF No. 6-2 \u00b6\u00b6 1-2. As such, the Court is not persuaded that Winmar will be prejudiced by transfer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Berry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4016175\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/49/71/#p74\">\n    49 F.Supp.3d at 75-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that the fact that the plaintiff filed four actions in the other district \"belie[s]\" his \"conclusory allegations of prejudice\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Because the Court has determined that this proceeding will be transferred, the Court does not reach the JK Moving's remaining arguments that (1) Winmar's complaint should be dismissed pursuant to the \"first-to-file\" rule as duplicative of JK Moving's first-filed complaint in the Eastern District, and (2) Winmar's declaratory judgment claim should be dismissed for failure to state a claim.
