Plaintiffs assert four claims for relief: (1) copyright infringement, (2) false designation of origin, (3) breach of contract, and (4) unfair competition. Defendants move, under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, to dismiss the second, third, and fourth counts for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, on the grounds that those claims are preempted by the Copyright Act. For the reasons that follow, the motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are as alleged in the complaint (Dkt.
