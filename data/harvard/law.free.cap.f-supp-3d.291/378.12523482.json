What is more, Defendants request that this Court order arbitration on an individual basis. Plaintiffs oppose the motion, claiming that the arbitration agreement that each signed (the \"Arbitration Agreement\" or \"Agreement\") is unconscionable because (i) Plaintiffs were told to sign the Agreement immediately upon viewing it, without receiving translated versions in Plaintiffs' native languages, and (ii) the Agreement contains a confidentiality clause that, in Plaintiffs' view, is invalid under\n   <em>\n    Cheeks\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Freeport Pancake House\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5769120\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/796/199/\">\n    796 F.3d 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2015), and dissuades employees from bringing claims against Defendants.

Accordingly, the Court grants Defendants' motion to compel arbitration. However, because the availability of collective arbitration is not a \"question of arbitrability,\" the Court reserves the question for the arbitrator. The Court similarly finds that Plaintiffs' claim that the confidentiality clause is invalid under\n   <em>\n    Cheeks\n   </em>\n   is not a \"question of arbitrability\" and must therefore be decided in the first instance by the arbitrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Plaintiffs' Employment at Defendants' Restaurant\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff Suqin Zhu was employed by Defendants as a sous chef at their restaurant-located at 311 West 43rd Street in Manhattan-from February 15, 2012 to July 1, 2016. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 9, 18). Nelson Leung was employed by Defendants as a sous chef starting in January 2012. (Leung Decl. \u00b6 2). Lip Kuen Moy was employed by Defendants as a kitchen prep worker starting in January 2012. (Moy Decl. \u00b6 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Plaintiffs' Alleged Violations of the FLSA, NYLL, NYCHRL, and NYSHRL\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 12, 2016, Plaintiff Zhu signed a Consent to Sue Under Federal Fair Labor Standards Act. (Compl., Ex. 1). The next day-July 13, 2016-Zhu filed a Collective Action Complaint against Defendants Hakkasan NYC LLC and Hakkasan Holdings, LLC. (Compl.). Plaintiff Zhu alleged that: (i) between March 17, 2013, and July 1, 2016, Defendants failed to provide Zhu with overtime compensation for time worked beyond 40 hours each workweek (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29); (ii) \"Plaintiff's workdays frequently lasted longer than 10 hours,\" but \"Defendants did not pay Plaintiff 'spread of hours' premium for every day in which she worked over 10 hours\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 37, 38); (iii) Defendants misclassified Plaintiff and other members of the contemplated class as salaried, exempt employees (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35); (iv) \"Defendants did not provide Plaintiff with proper written notice about the terms and conditions of her employment upon hire [or upon pay increases] in relation to their rate of pay, regular pay cycle[,] and rate of overtime pay\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38); (v) Defendants failed to provide detailed paystub information every payday (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 80-81); (vi) Zhu, who is Han Chinese, was required to work substantially more hours for the same pay as her Caucasian colleagues who performed similar work functions (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 41-43); and (vii) Defendants provided Caucasian employees with more paid holidays than they did to Chinese employees (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff Zhu brought these claims on behalf of herself and \"all persons who are or were formerly employed by Defendants as a sous chef and other similarly situated current and former employee[s] holding comparable positions but different titles, at any time from July 30, 2012 to the entry of\n   judgment in this case.\" (Compl. \u00b6 46). On November 8, 2016, Leung and Moy signed consent to sue forms similar to that originally executed by Zhu. (Dkt. # 21, 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Plaintiffs' Arbitration Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As a condition of their employment by Defendants, Plaintiffs signed a Dispute Resolution/Arbitration Agreement. (Arb. Agmt.). Zhu executed the Agreement on February 15, 2012; Moy, on February 13, 2012; and Leung, on January 26, 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In declarations filed with the Court, Zhu, Leung, and Moy all stated that, \"[around the start of my employment] I was provided with a document in English that resembles the arbitration agreement at issue.\" (Zhu Decl. \u00b6 5, Leung Decl. \u00b6 5, Moy Decl. \u00b6 5). All further stated that, \"I was asked by a Chinese speaking secretary at Hakkasan to sign the document without first having the document translated to me[; t]he secretary informed me that the document must be signed immediately[; and b]efore signing the document I never had any opportunity to determine its contents, or understand its implications.\" (Zhu Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7, Leung Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7, Moy Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 6-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In the Arbitration Agreement, each Plaintiff agreed to \"waive [his/her] right to a court and/or jury trial and agree[d] that disputes relating to [his/her] employment, or the termination of such employment, shall be decided by a mutually agreed-upon Arbitrator in final and binding arbitration.\" (Arb. Agmt. 1). Each further agreed to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   bring any and all claims [he/she] may wish to assert against the Company, other than those claims specifically excluded below, only through arbitration. Such claims, whether based upon statute, regulation, contract, tort, or other common law principles, include but are not limited to, any claim for breach of contract, unpaid wages, wrongful termination, violation of federal, state[,] or city laws forbidding discrimination, harassment, and retaliation on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, national origin, disability, and any other protected status which may be brought under applicable federal, state[,] or local law, and disputes relating to the interpretation of this Agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Agreement goes on to describe the arbitration process, specifying that arbitration \"shall be before a single Arbitrator ... and conducted in accordance with the Employment Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association to the extent consistent with applicable law, including the Federal Arbitration Act, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (relating to filing deadlines, discovery processes, and dispositive motions), and the Federal Rules of Evidence (relating to the presentation of evidence).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Plaintiffs' Linguistic Backgrounds\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiff Zhu's native language is Mandarin Chinese. (Zhu Decl. \u00b6 4). Leung's and Moy's native language is Cantonese Chinese, and both are fluent in Mandarin Chinese. (Leung Decl. \u00b6 4, Moy Decl. \u00b6 4). According to their declarations, Zhu, Leung, and Moy are unable to read or understand English. (Zhu Decl. \u00b6 4, Leung Decl. \u00b6 4, Moy Decl. \u00b6 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff Zhu commenced this putative collective action by filing the Complaint on July 13, 2016, on behalf of all persons employed by Defendants as sous chefs and other similarly situated employees holding comparable positions after July 30, 2012. (Compl. \u00b6 46). In lieu of answering the Complaint, Defendants filed a pre-motion letter on October 18, 2016, requesting leave to move to compel arbitration and dismiss the case pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b) or stay the action\n   pursuant to the FAA, and for costs and fees associated with the pre-motion letter. (Dkt. # 14). The bases for the anticipated motion, which was directed specifically to Plaintiff Zhu, were that: \"[i] Plaintiff signed a valid and enforceable arbitration agreement in consideration for her employment; [ii] Plaintiff's claims fall within the scope of the arbitration provision; and [iii] Plaintiff has withheld her consent to withdraw this lawsuit and proceed to arbitration.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On October 20, 2016, Plaintiff Zhu filed a letter motion requesting leave to file a motion to certify a collective action. (Dkt. # 16). On October 21, 2016, Plaintiff Zhu filed a subsequent letter opposing Defendants' pre-motion letter to compel arbitration in which Zhu argued that she \"was fraudulently induced into signing the agreement.\" (Dkt. # 18). Zhu asserted that \"a binding agreement was never created since it was never fully executed\" and that \"arbitration agreements, such as the one at issue here are incompatible with recent Second Circuit case law, namely\n   <em>\n    Cheeks\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Freeport Pancake House Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5769120\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/796/199/\">\n    796 F.3d 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2015).\" (Dkt. # 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At a pre-motion conference on October 27, 2016, the Court considered Plaintiff Zhu's request for leave to file a certification motion and Defendants' request for leave to file a motion to compel arbitration. At that conference, the parties indicated that they wished to engage in settlement discussions before engaging in motion practice. For that reason, the Court did not rule on the parties' letter motions. (Dkt. # 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On November 8, 2016, Leung and Moy filed consent forms. (Dkt. # 21, 22). The Court notes that it had not certified a collective action in this case and that, to this day, Plaintiffs have filed neither a conditional certification motion nor an amended complaint adding Leung and Moy as plaintiffs. However, the parties' submissions refer to Leung and Moy as individual plaintiffs and state that Leung and Moy joined the case when they filed consents to sue. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Br.; Pl. Opp.; Def. Reply). The Court adopts the parties' framework and, following the parties' lead, refers to Leung and Moy as Plaintiffs in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On March 31, 2017, after the parties tried unsuccessfully to settle the case, the Court ordered Defendants to file their motion to compel arbitration on or before April 20, 2017; Plaintiffs to file their opposition on or before May 11, 2017; and Defendants to file their reply, if any, on or before May 25, 2017. (Dkt. # 32). The parties filed their papers accordingly. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 33-38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Here, Plaintiffs argue that the Arbitration Agreement is unconscionable because it contains a confidentiality clause that, in Plaintiffs' view, violates\n   <em>\n    Cheeks\n   </em>\n   and deters employees from bringing claims against Defendants. Like their procedural challenges, Plaintiffs' substantive unconscionability argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   To begin with, the Arbitration Agreement's confidentiality requirements apply equally to Plaintiffs and Defendants, and the terms of the Agreement are not one-sided. Courts in this District have repeatedly held that, \"when both an employer and its employees are bound to an agreement to arbitrate, when the terms of the agreement are equally applicable to both parties, and when the employer bears any unreasonable cost of the arbitration, the arbitration agreement is not unreasonably favorable to the employer.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Isaacs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4124783\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/968/564/#p569\">\n    968 F.Supp.2d at 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (collecting cases). Here, all of the terms of the Arbitration Agreement-including those in the confidentiality clause-apply equally to Plaintiffs and Defendants, and Defendants bear all of the arbitration costs. For this reason, the confidentiality clause cannot be said to render the Arbitration Agreement substantively unconscionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In addition, the Arbitration Agreement contains a severability clause and a saving clause. The former states, in relevant part, that \"[t]he provisions of this Agreement are severable, and if any provision is determined to be unenforceable, then the remaining provisions shall remain in full effect.\" (Arb. Agmt. 2). The latter qualifies the confidentiality clause's prohibition on disclosure with the phrase, \"unless otherwise required by law.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Because the Court reserves questions of contract interpretation to the arbitrator in the first instance, it declines to analyze these clauses. It does, however, note that if the arbitrator were to decide that the confidentiality clause is unenforceable under\n   <em>\n    Cheeks\n   </em>\n   , that would not necessarily void the entire agreement. Plaintiffs would still have to show that the confidentiality clause is not severable or subject to the saving clause, something the Plaintiffs have not even attempted to do here. For this reason, and because the confidentiality requirements apply equally to Plaintiffs and Defendants, the Court finds that the Arbitration Agreement is not substantively unconscionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Arbitration Agreement Encompasses Plaintiffs' Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Having found the Arbitration Agreement to be enforceable, the Court next considers whether it is applicable. Courts generally construe arbitration clauses broadly.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    McMahan Sec. Co. L.P.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Forum Capital Mkts., L.P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10522281\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/35/82/#p88\">\n    35 F.3d 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 88 (2d Cir. 1994) (\"federal policy favoring arbitration requires us to construe arbitration clauses as broadly as possible\" (internal quotation marks omitted) ). That is particularly true where the agreement itself uses broad language to define the scope of arbitration. Such language \"creates a presumption of arbitrability which is only overcome if it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith/Enron Cogeneration Ltd. P'ship\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Smith Cogeneration Int'l, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"654251\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/198/88/#p99\">\n    198 F.3d 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 99 (2d Cir. 1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   That the Arbitration Agreement contains broad language is irrefutable. Under the Agreement, Plaintiffs must arbitrate \"\n   <em>\n    any and all claims\n   </em>\n   [they] wish to\n   assert against the Company ... whether based upon statute, regulation, contract, tort, or other common law principles[.]\" (Arb. Agmt. 1 (emphasis added) ). The Agreement also includes a non-exhaustive list of claims covered by it. That list explicitly references claims for \"unpaid wages [and] violation of federal, state[,] or city laws forbidding discrimination, harassment, and retaliation on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, national origin, [or] disability[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Plaintiffs' claims fall squarely within the terms of the Agreement. All are covered by the Agreement's reference to \"any and all claims [Plaintiffs] wish to assert against the Company.\" (Arb. Agmt. 1). And most, if not all, are captured within the Agreement's illustrative list of arbitrable claims. As but one example, the Agreement's reference to claims for \"unpaid wages\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), covers Plaintiffs' FLSA and NYLL claims for unpaid overtime wages and spread-of-hour premiums; and the Agreement's reference to claims for \"violation of ... laws forbidding discrimination\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), captures Plaintiffs' NYSHRL and NYCHRL claims. For these reasons, the Court finds that the Arbitration Agreement encompasses Plaintiffs' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Federal Law Compels Arbitration of Plaintiffs' Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Contrary to Plaintiffs' arguments, federal law-specifically, the FLSA-does not operate to foreclose arbitration of any of Plaintiffs' claims.
