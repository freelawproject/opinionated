But when it comes to federal agencies, the Administrative Procedure Act shapes the contours of those consequences. This case involves the Department of Homeland Security's decision to delay the implementation of an Obama-era immigration rule, the International Entrepreneur Rule,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%205%2C238\">\n    82 Fed. Reg. 5,238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Jan. 17, 2017). The Rule would have allowed certain foreign entrepreneurs to obtain immigration \"parole\"-that is, to temporarily enter the United States despite lacking a visa or green card. It was finalized in the waning hours of the Obama administration and was set to take effect 180 days later, on July 17, 2017. On the eve of that date, however, the Department issued a new rule (\"the Delay Rule\") delaying the effective date of the original one for another eight months, until March 14, 2018. The agency did so, however, without providing notice or soliciting comment from the public, as the APA generally requires. Plaintiffs brought suit, alleging that the agency lacked good cause to dispense with the APA's strictures and that the Delay Rule was therefore invalid. Having now reviewed both sides' Motions for Summary Judgment, the Court agrees and will vacate the Delay Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The controversy boils down to two competing rules. The first would have allowed certain foreign entrepreneurs to temporarily enter the United States. The second, promulgated six months later, delayed that rule from taking effect.

While Plaintiffs concede that they have no right to\n   <em>\n    receive\n   </em>\n   parole, they still maintain that being denied the opportunity to seek it constitutes a cognizable injury. The D.C.

As it now stands, however, they claim that they have lost even the opportunity to obtain that immigration benefit. Given that they meet the criteria outlined in the Final Rule, such an opportunity would be far from \"illusory.\"\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CC Distributors\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3474665,10526613\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/883/146/\">\n    883 F.2d at 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, with the IE Final Rule in place, the Krishnas would have a \"significant opportunity\" to move forward with their application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Patel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3710153\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/732/633/#p638\">\n    732 F.3d at 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court, consequently, agrees that the loss of that opportunity suffices to establish a cognizable injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiffs are not home yet, however, as there are two wrinkles still to be ironed out. First, the Government has not\n   <em>\n    permanently\n   </em>\n   deprived them of the opportunity to seek parole-at least not so far. As its name implies, the Delay Rule only\n   <em>\n    delays\n   </em>\n   their ability to seek parole. By contrast, when USCIS\n   <em>\n    denies\n   </em>\n   an immigration petition, it derails the application permanently. Even so, the difference gives the Court little pause in this case. The D.C. Circuit has suggested that an \"order delaying the rule's effective date ... [is] tantamount to amending or revoking a rule.\"\n   <em>\n    Clean Air Council v. Pruitt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275779\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/862/1/#p6\">\n    862 F.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 6 (D.C. Cir. 2017). That is especially so here, as DHS states it is \"highly likely\" to revoke the Rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   82 Fed. Reg. at 31,888. By using this Delay Rule to bridge the gap to rescission, the agency has effectively erased-rather than delayed-the benefit of the IE Final Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Second, even were rescission to occur, Plaintiffs might still technically have an opportunity to apply for parole. As outlined above, the agency has long held the authority to issue parole \"for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(5)(A). It retains that authority today. The IE Final Rule simply provides guidance as to how DHS should assess whether a foreign entrepreneur satisfies the \"significant public interest\" prong of the parole test. Even without that Rule, any given agent could theoretically exercise her discretion to find in Plaintiffs' favor on the same count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   That said, the parties agree that, in practice, the Delay Rule would leave parole a lost cause for entrepreneurs. The Government has maintained in its briefing that the IE Final Rule represented a \"tectonic shift\" for foreign entrepreneurs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Opp. to PI at 25. Indeed, that was the point of the Rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   82 Fed. Reg. at 5,238. During oral argument, moreover, when Plaintiffs argued that parole would be \"virtually impossible\" without the Rule,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 27 (Oral Arg. Tr.) at 6:20, the Government did not dispute the assertion. Indeed, it doubled down, agreeing that \"parole historically has not been ... us[ed] in this matter.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12:13-16. This Court, too, is aware of no case in which a foreign entrepreneur has received parole. It therefore agrees that the Delay Rule deprives Plaintiffs of a \"significant opportunity\" to pursue parole,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Patel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3710153\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/732/633/#p638\">\n    732 F.3d at 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and that loss of a meaningful opportunity constitutes a cognizable injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   With Plaintiffs' injury properly framed as the \"lost opportunity\" to seek parole, the redressability inquiry becomes far less thorny. Plaintiffs ask the Court to invalidate the Delay Rule; were it to do so, the Government agrees that the IE Final Rule would immediately take effect, thereby restoring the Krishnas' shot at parole.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Opp. at 34. During oral argument, the Government suggested that even with the IE Final Rule in place, it might still fail to complete any parole requests before rescission.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 15:6-23; 16:3-10. The Court, however, sees no evidence that the agency would simply run out the clock on applications. Rather, the entire premise of the Delay Rule is that DHS would otherwise implement the IE Final Rule (and expend significant resources doing so). With no indication of bad faith on the Government's part, the Court assumes it would process applications in regular order. Were it to do so, Plaintiffs would have a far more meaningful chance at parole than they would have with the Delay Rule in place. That suffices to establish standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Notice and Comment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Having cleared the jurisdictional brush, the Court now turns to the merits. Under the APA, an agency must provide \"[g]eneral notice of proposed rule making\" in the Federal Register, as well as \"an opportunity to participate in the rule making through submission of written data, views, or arguments,\" before promulgating a rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These requirements apply with no less force when the agency seeks to delay or repeal a valid final rule. As the D.C.

Apparently, DHS needed until July to decide whether it was \"highly likely\" to rescind the IE Final Rule, and only then did it see the Delay Rule as necessary. While the agency may well be decrying an emergency of its own creation, the Court need not resolve whether it has forfeited any good-cause defense. Even on its own terms, the agency's proffered reasons for bypassing notice and comment easily fall short of good cause. The Court now explains why.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    2. Good-Cause Rationales\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In a total of three paragraphs in the Federal Register, DHS offered its rationales for invoking the good-cause exception. First and foremost, the agency explained that if it did not \"delay the effective date immediately, USCIS would be required to expend limited agency resources to implement the IE Final Rule.\" 82 Fed. Reg. at 31,888. Second, it averred that implementing the Rule would \"sow confusion\" among stakeholders and potentially trigger unwarranted reliance interests.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court finds neither statement persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   a. Expense\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   DHS primarily justified the Delay Rule by citing the expense of implementing the new parole system. It worried that doing so \"would require USCIS to establish a new business line for the processing of entrepreneur parole applications, hir[e] and train[ ] additional adjudicators, modify[ ] intake and case management information technology systems, modify[ ] application and fee intake contracts, develop[ ] guidance for the adjudicators, and communicat[e] with the public.\" 82 Fed. Reg. at 31,888. At the same time, it announced that the Department was \"highly likely\" to rescind the Final Rule, \"and may ultimately eliminate the program, [such that] the expenditure of these resources is unlikely to ever be recouped from filing fees under the new program.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In other words, the agency hesitated to pile resources into a parole program that would not be long for this world.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   This explanation does not pass muster. As an initial matter, the agency's concern for its (or its components') own bottom line hardly constitutes the sort of emergency necessary to invoke good cause. As the D.C.

In fact, DHS previously stated that it did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   anticipate \"that the rule will generate additional processing costs to the government to process applications.\" 82 Fed. Reg. at 5,274. That is because \"[t]he INA provides for the collection of fees at a level that will ensure recovery of the full costs of providing services, including administrative costs and services provided without charge to certain applicants and petitioners.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5,282. Specifically, the agency estimated it would process roughly 2,900 applications this year and receive $1,285 each in filing fees, generating more than $3.5 million.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5,283.

At the time, DHS believed those fees sufficient to cover \"processing costs to the government.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5,274. The Government offers nothing to undercut that estimate, such as by providing competing figures about how much implementing the Rule would actually cost. Nor does it explain why ultimate rescission of the Rule would somehow imperil these collections during the Rule's vitality. Defendants instead rely largely on their \"assessment of their own limited resources,\" Opp. at 31, but an \"agency cannot claim good cause without offering any evidence, beyond its asserted expertise.\"\n   <em>\n    Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500920,10519145\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/969/1141/\">\n    969 F.2d 1141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1145-46 (D.C.Cir. 1992) (rejecting good cause when agency provided \"little factual basis\" for its views).

This logic suffers from several flaws. First, the IE Final Rule would not \"up-end ... over a century\" of discretionary decisionmaking, as Defendants protest.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32. Rather, it expressly preserves the agency's discretion on a case-by-case basis, while providing \"guidance\" on how officers might exercise that discretion in a uniquely \"complex\" area of parole.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   82 Fed. Reg. at 5,238. While the Rule may have changed the game for entrepreneurs, it was a far less significant shift for the agency. DHS expects it might receive and process 2,940 applications related to the Rule-hardly a change of \"tectonic\" proportions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5,273. Second, the agency went through the proper channels to consider and mitigate the impact of its updated parole process. It solicited and received more than 700 comments,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5,244, and deemed a six-month time lag sufficient to implement the new system.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5,242. Given that considered process, there is no indication that implementing the Rule would be unduly taxing on the agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Finally, although Defendants maintain that rescission of the IE Final Rule is imminent-such that any expenditures to implement it would be wasteful-the Court has seen no effort to that effect thus far.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Almost five months have already passed since issuance of the Delay Rule, and the agency has still not promulgated any notice of proposed rulemaking, much less a final version. As DHS waits to issue a new rule, its arguments in favor of delay leak water. The agency purportedly seeks to avoid frittering away resources on a temporary rule but, at least for now, the IE Final Rule seems to have a solid hull.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   b. Confusion and Reliance\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Perhaps recognizing the weakness of its primary justification, Defendants assure the Court that the Delay Rule was not \"simply a matter of off-setting costs or training\" additional agency employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Opp. at 32. Instead, the agency insists that implementing the IE Final Rule \"would sow confusion and would likely cause the waste of resources by multiple stakeholders with interests in [the] rulemaking.\" 82 Fed.

As explained above, that protestation overstates the novel nature of the Rule. In any event, Defendants fail to show any real \"confusion\" that required bypassing notice and comment. Most concretely, the agency worries that if the IE Final Rule were left in place, foreign entrepreneurs might misguidedly rely on it, including by \"expending significant effort and resources in order to establish eligibility under the criteria promulgated by the IE Final Rule.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   82 Fed. Reg. at 31,888. They could then be caught betwixt and between if rescission subsequently occurred. Similarly, it fears that companies might unwittingly invest in a start-up, only to learn later that its owners had no shot at parole. Those claims ring hollow, however, when a notice of proposed rulemaking would, by definition, alert the public that the agency was considering delaying or rescinding the Rule. Had the agency issued such a notice, entrepreneurs could have made a reasoned decision as to whether to expend effort and resources. The same is true for any companies considering investments. Plaintiffs aver that they, at least, would choose to apply under the IE Final Rule, even understanding any chance at parole might be short-lived.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Krishna Aff., \u00b6 11. Start-ups grow rapidly, so Plaintiffs believe that even a short stint in the United States could aid their business; they also hope that the Government might grandfather in applications or reevaluate its stance once it sees the program in operation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. MSJ at 26-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The agency, moreover, gave little thought to those foreign entrepreneurs who may have\n   <em>\n    already\n   </em>\n   relied on the impending IE Final Rule, set to take effect just six days before the agency suspended it. Without notice to the contrary, aliens would have fairly expected the Rule to take place as scheduled and therefore already \"expend[ed] significant effort and resources in order to establish eligibility.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Delay Rule prejudices any reliance interest they had in the IE Final Rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In the Federal Register, the Government cited two cases to support its argument that regulatory \"confusion\" arising from the IE Final Rule constituted good cause:\n   <em>\n    Am.

Nov. 15, 2017) (noting district court has discretion to balance equities in staying relief). To so order would simply remedy the agency's delay with more delay. Defendants also invite this Court to commission additional briefing as to remedy. Both parties, however, have had a full opportunity to address the subject and have done so in detail. If Defendants have additional reasons why a stay might be appropriate pending any appeal, they can so move. Until then, the Court believes that vacatur is the appropriate remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
