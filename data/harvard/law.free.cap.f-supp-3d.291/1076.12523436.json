(\"Stein Mart\") filed a Motion for Summary Judgment against Plaintiffs Marilyn Sperling (\"Sperling\") and Jerred Schuh (\"Schuh\") (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\"). Dkt. No 100. Plaintiffs filed an opposition and Stein Mart filed a reply. Dkt. Nos. 108, 111. On December 15, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Class Certification. Dkt. No. 97. Stein Mart filed an opposition and Plaintiffs filed a reply. Dkt. Nos. 106, 112. The Court heard oral arguments regarding the motions on February 16, 2018. For the following reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Stein Mart's Motion for Summary Judgment and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' Motion for Class Certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case centers on Stein Mart's use of comparative reference prices on price tags. Stein Mart's price tags displayed higher \"Compare At\" prices next to lower \"Our Price\" prices for items they sold in their retail stores. Plaintiffs claim they purchased products from Stein Mart in reliance on the comparative reference prices, but that those prices were misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Undisputed Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following facts are undisputed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Stein Mart is a retailer of fashion and household products. SMF\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   1. It strives to sell the same or similar merchandise as department stores, boutiques, and other full-price retailers, but at lower prices. SMF 6. Plaintiffs Sperling and Schuh are individuals who purchased items at Stein Mart stores. SMF 24, 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Stein Mart's \"Compare At\" Prices\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Stein Mart's price tags list two prices-a \"Compare At\" price and \"Our Price.\" SMF 15. An asterisk appears in front the \"Compare At\" price. SMF 16. The explanation of the asterisk on the price tag directs shoppers to Stein Mart's Fair Pricing Policy, which Stein Mart posts at every cash register and online.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Fair Pricing Policy explains that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [w]e strive to offer our customers true everyday value. Our \"Compare at\" price\n   is based on input from our suppliers. We believe that it represents the original price of the same item or a comparable item at department stores, specialty stores or other full-price stores. Our \"Compare at\" price may not be the starting price posted by all full-price stores, and some stores may offer substantial discounts off the suggested retail price.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   SMF 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As the Fair Pricing Policy indicates, Stein Mart bases the \"Compare At\" prices on manufacturers' suggested retail prices (\"MSRPs\") provided by its suppliers. SMF 11. The MSRPs reflect what suppliers expect retailers to charge for products.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Depending on the product, MSRPs can reflect anticipated prices up to a year in advance of actual retail sales. SMF 59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Sperling's Purchases\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Sperling purchased three items from Stein Mart. First, she bought a pair of Yellow Box sandals. SMF 28. Sperling did not provide evidence of the exact version of Yellow Box sandals she purchased, but she did testify that she paid $39.95 for them, and that price tag displayed a \"Compare At\" price of $59.95. Decl. Douglas Caiafa, \u00b6 10, Ex. G, Dep. Marilyn Sperling, Tr. at 91:6-92:6 (Dkt. No. 108-9). Sperling also testified that she did not look for the sandals at any other store. Sperling Dep., Tr. at 92:7-93:13. While Stein Mart could not identify the exact sandals Sperling purchased, it based its \"Compare At\" prices for Yellow Box sandals on MSRPs provided by Stein Mart's supplier. SMF 28, 29. Plaintiffs did not provide any evidence of what other retailers charged for the sandals. SMF 30. However, Stein Mart asserted evidence that other retailers sold Yellow Box sandals for $59.95 or more. Decl. Gary Pierce, \u00b6 4, Ex. A (Dkt. No. 100-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Second, Sperling purchased a Revelation suitcase. Decl. Marilyn Sperling, \u00b6 8 (Dkt. No. 108-13). She declared that Stein Mart sold the suitcase with a \"Compare At\" price tag, and that she felt deceived by it. Sperling Decl., \u00b6\u00b6 8, 10. Sperling did not assert evidence of the particular model Revelation suitcase she bought at Stein Mart, the amount she paid for the suitcase, the \"Compare At\" price listed on the price tag, or the price at which other retailers sold the suitcase. SMF 30. Stein Mart, on the other hand, provided evidence that its \"Compare At\" prices for Revelation suitcases were based on the MSRPs provided by Stein Mart's supplier. SMF 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Third, Sperling bought a pair of Ava pants, which Stein Mart sold under the brand name Peck &amp; Peck, a brand exclusive to Stein Mart. SMF 24, 26. Sperling paid $53.99 for the pants, and the price tag displayed a \"Compare At\" price of $78.00. Sperling Decl., \u00b6 6. While Peck &amp; Peck is an exclusive Stein Mart brand, the Ava pants Sperling purchased were sold by other retailers under those retailers' own brand names. SMF 26. Plaintiffs do not dispute that \"[t]he Ava pant sold by Stein Mart under the Peck &amp; Peck label is also sold by other retailers under those retailers' own private labels. The pants sold by those other retailers are identical in every substantive way.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The president of the company that manufactures the Ava pants declared that \"[t]he overwhelming majority of retailers sell the pants for between $115 and $138.\" Decl. Sam Zucker, \u00b6 6 (Dkt. No. 100-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Schuh's Purchases\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Schuh purchased two items at Stein Mart. First, he purchased a Kenneth Cole suit, which included pants and a jacket. Decl. Jerred Schuh, \u00b6 6 (Dkt. No. 108-14). The \"Compare At\" price for the suit was $320, but Schuh bought it for about $160.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The \"Compare At\" price for the Kenneth Cole suit was based on the MSRP\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   provided by the suit's manufacturer. SMF 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Second, Schuh bought a shirt sold under the Alan Flusser brand name, another brand exclusive to Stein Mart. Schuh Decl., \u00b6 7; SMF 38. The manufacturer from which Stein Mart acquired the Alan Flusser shirt made virtually identical shirts for other retailers, which were sold under different brand names. SMF 38. According to Schuh, however, he purchased the Alan Flusser shirt in part because he liked the brand name. Caiafa Decl., \u00b6 18, Ex. O, Dep. Jerred Schuh, Tr. at 172:23-173:15 (Dkt. No. 108-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B. This Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On July 15, 2015, Sperling filed a complaint with this Court against Stein Mart. Dkt. No. 1. After Sperling amended her complaint twice, Stein Mart moved to dismiss. Dkt. No. 28. The Court granted the motion to dismiss, but gave Sperling leave to amend. Dkt. No. 35, at p. 19. Sperling then filed a Third Amended Complaint, and Stein Mart moved to dismiss again. Dkt. Nos. 36, 37. This time, the Court denied Stein Mart's motion to dismiss. Dkt. No. 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On May 2, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a Fourth Amended Consolidated Class Action Complaint (\"FACCAC\") that added Schuh as a plaintiff. Dkt. No. 87. The FACCAC claims that Stein Mart violated California's Unfair Competition Law (\"UCL\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2017200\">\n    Cal.

SMF 32. The requests for admission included the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   1.

However, according to Nathan, the email went to his junk folder, and he did not receive the mailed requests for admission until November 15, 2017. Decl. Reuben Nathan, \u00b6 12. (Dkt. No. 110-1). Nathan eventually sent responses to the requests for admission on December 18, 2017.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201750\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Stein Mart now moves for summary judgment as to all of Plaintiffs' claims.

A party served with requests for admission must respond with a written objection or answer within 30 days. Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(a)(3). If a party fails to do so, a request for admission is deemed admitted.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10537249\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/877/728/#p731\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   A court can allow a party to withdraw or amend an admission \"on motion.\" Fed.

Schuh therefore had 30 days to respond to the requests before Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(a)(3) operated to deem the requests admitted. Stein Mart served the requests for admission by mail, which provided Schuh an extra three days to respond. Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(d). Thus, Schuh\n   was required to answer the requests for admission by November 28, 2017. He did not provide written responses until December 18, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Nathan avers that his firm did not receive the requests for admission until November 15, 2017. He also declares that he did not see the courtesy email Stein Mart's counsel sent him with copies of the requests for admission because the email went to his junk email folder. Even if he did not receive the requests for admission until November 15, 2017, however, the proof of service clearly stated that it was served on October 26, 2017. Nathan therefore should have known that he needed to promptly respond to the requests for admission. Yet he waited more than a month to serve responses. Because Schuh did not respond to the requests for admission within 30 days, they are deemed admitted under Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(a)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Based on the record before the Court, it is unclear what good cause would exist for Schuh to withdraw his admissions. The Court does not reach the issue, however, because Schuh has not filed a motion to withdraw the admissions. Without a motion properly asking it to do so, the Court cannot grant relief from Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(a)(3). Schuh therefore has admitted, among other things, that he read Stein Mart's Fair Pricing Policy before purchasing the Kenneth Cole suit and Alan Flusser shirt, and that he did not rely on the \"Compare At\" prices in buying those items.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

In the exclusive product cases, the products sold in the defendants' outlets were different than the ones sold in their traditional retail stores. Because the outlet products were made exclusively for outlets, they were never sold in traditional retail stores for the comparative reference prices presented on the price tags. It was therefore deceptive to use the full retail items as price comparators for those products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   On the other hand, in the non-exclusive product cases, manufacturers produced items that would be sold by different retailers and provided MSRPs. Because the same items would be sold in different places, the comparative reference prices could not be misleading on their face, without actually examining what other retailers charged for the items.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DSWC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=699%20Fed.%20Appx.%20654\">\n    699 Fed.Appx. at 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Price tags suggesting that consumers compare the product's price to the manufacturer's suggested retail price are not inherently false or deceptive.\"). If other retailers did sell the products at issue for the MSRPs or more, then the comparative reference prices would not be deceptive. Plaintiffs therefore needed to explain how the comparative reference prices were actually false or misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   This case falls into the category of the non-exclusive product cases. Three of the five products upon which Plaintiffs base their claims were non-exclusive branded items. The Revelation suitcase and Yellow Box sandals Sperling purchased, as well as the Kenneth Cole suit Schuh bought, were not exclusive to Stein Mart. For all of those items, the \"Compare At\" prices were the MSRPs provided by the products' suppliers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Because the undisputed evidence indicates that these products were manufactured to be sold by more than one retailer, Plaintiffs have the burden of asserting evidence that the \"Compare At\" prices were misleading. As noted above, Plaintiffs do not necessarily need to prove that no other retailer sold the products for the \"Compare At\" prices, but they do need to assert some evidence from which a jury could infer that the \"Compare At\" prices were incorrect. Plaintiffs simply fail to do so. They assert no evidence of the prices at which other retailers sell the items they purchased. Accordingly, Plaintiffs fail to raise a fact dispute about whether the \"Compare At\" prices on the Yellow Box sandals, Revelation suitcase, and Kenneth Cole suit were deceptive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The case becomes slightly closer with respect to Plaintiffs' purchases of products sold under Stein-Mart-exclusive brands. On the surface, Stein Mart's use of \"Compare At\" prices for those products appears similar to the defendants' conduct in the exclusive product cases, where they used comparative reference prices for items only sold in their stores. But the undisputed evidence dispels Plaintiffs' claims that the \"Compare At\" prices for those items were deceptive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Stein Mart's use of comparative reference pricing on the Peck &amp; Peck Ava pants Sperling purchased was not misleading. While the \"Compare At\" price seems deceptive because no other stores sell the item under the Peck &amp; Peck brand name, the undisputed evidence shows that other retailers did sell the same pair of pants. As Plaintiffs concede, \"[t]he Ava pant sold by Stein Mart under the Peck &amp; Peck label is also sold by other retailers under those retailers' own private labels. The pants sold by those other retailers are identical in every substantive way.\" SMF 26. Unlike in the outlet cases, then, the same pants Sperling purchased were sold elsewhere. Thus, Stein Mart's use of a comparative reference price was not inherently misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Because other retailers sold pants identical to the ones Sperling purchased, her purchase of the Ava pants was no different than her purchases of the Yellow Box sandals and Revelation suitcase. The pants were sold in more than one place, and Sperling must show that other retailers sold the pants for less than the \"Compare At\" price. Once again, Sperling does not make this showing. Instead, Stein Mart asserts its own evidence that other retailers sold the pants for over $115, even more than the \"Compare At\" price. The comparative reference price on the Ava pants therefore was neither false nor misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Similarly, Stein Mart's use of comparative reference pricing on the Alan Flusser shirt did not deceive Schuh. Like the Ava pants Sperling purchased, other retailers sold shirts virtually identical to the Alan Flusser shirt under different brand names. Because the same item was sold by other retailers, Schuh bears the burden of setting forth some evidence that the \"Compare At\" price was misleading. He fails to provide any such evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Schuh does assert some evidence that he purchased the Alan Flusser shirt because of the brand name. Since the brand name was important to Schuh, Plaintiffs argue, the Alan Flusser shirt was not the same as the shirts sold under different brand names by other retailers. However, as explained above, Schuh has admitted through his failure to timely respond to requests for admission that he read and understood Stein Mart's Fair Pricing Policy, which explains that the \"Compare At\" price refers to the original price of the same item or a comparable item.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The nearly identical\n   shirts sold under different brand names were at least comparable to the shirt Schuh purchased. Accordingly, Schuh could not have been deceived by Stein Mart's use of a nearly identical item for a price comparison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Having failed to present facts from which a rational jury could find that Stein Mart's use of comparative reference prices on the items they purchased was deceptive, Plaintiffs' FAL, CLRA, and UCL claims fail as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    2. UCL Claim Based on FTC Pricing Guides\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Despite Plaintiffs' failure to assert evidence that Stein Mart's comparative reference prices were deceptive, they argue that their UCL claim survives summary judgment because Stein Mart did not follow the guidance provided in the Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") Pricing Guides. The Court has ruled in this case, as have other courts, that the FTC Act does not provide a private right of action, and that the California UCL does not create one for FTC Act claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 35 (citing\n   <em>\n    O'Donnell v. Bank of Am.
