Ellis, III, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this diversity insurance coverage dispute, plaintiff Kitbar Enterprises, LLC (\"KitBar\") alleges a breach of contract claim against defendant Liberty Insurance Underwrites, Inc. (\"Liberty\"), asserting that Liberty's denial of coverage for a lawsuit against KitBar and its members constitutes a breach of the insurance policy Liberty issued to KitBar. In response, Liberty argues that coverage was properly denied on the basis of KitBar's misrepresentations on its application for a policy which was submitted after KitBar discovered that it was likely to be sued. Liberty also contends that it is entitled to void the Policy based on Virginia law because KitBar made misrepresentations that induced Liberty to provide coverage. KitBar argues not only that the lawsuit is covered by the insurance policy, but also that Liberty has waived these objections to coverage. Finally, Liberty argues KitBar's request for the retention of jurisdiction to pursue a claim of bad faith be denied because there has been no breach of the Policy. At issue, therefore, on cross-motions for summary judgment, are the following four questions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   (i) whether KitBar's knowing failure to disclose a possible lawsuit in its application for an insurance Policy caused that lawsuit to fall within the Policy's exclusion for undisclosed suits giving rise to coverage;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   (ii) whether KitBar's misrepresentations in its insurance application void the Policy;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   (iii) whether Liberty waived these arguments by failing to reserve its rights or by defending the suit; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (iv) whether jurisdiction should be retained to allow KitBar to pursue a claim of bad faith denial of coverage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The matter has been fully briefed and argued, and is now ripe for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The entry of summary judgment is appropriate only where there are no genuine disputes of material fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

Analysis of this claim properly begins with the terms of the Policy and the Application. The Application requested, as is typical with insurance applications, information regarding any possible litigation risks KitBar and the named insureds faced. Specifically, section 11 of the Application required KitBar to disclose (i) \"any claims made or now pending against any insured individual or insured entity proposed for coverage\"; and (ii) \"any knowledge or information of any facts or circumstances which could reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim under the proposed policy[.]\" Def. Ex. 36 at 9. The Application further provides that \"any loss arising from a matter disclosed or which should have been disclosed under section 11 of this application is excluded from coverage under the policy[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9213632\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/377/408/#p419\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, the Application makes clear that it is incorporated as a provision in any subsequently issued insurance policy. Def. Ex. 36 at 10 (\"if a policy is issued this application will form part of such policy and Liberty will be relying on the completeness and accuracy of the statements and disclosures in this application.\"). Thus, section 11 of the Application required KitBar to disclose any knowledge or information of any circumstances that might give rise to a claim under the proposed policy, and any losses arising from matters which should have been disclosed under section 11 are explicitly excluded from coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The undisputed record evidence demonstrates that KitBar knew of the Barry complaint and demand letter before it applied for insurance coverage with Liberty. On June 22, 2015, the day before KitBar applied for coverage, Bessette received a draft complaint and demand letter from Barry. KitBar does not dispute that it received the Barry complaint and a demand letter, and in fact the record shows that KitBar submitted its insurance application to Liberty\n   <em>\n    because of\n   </em>\n   the Barry complaint and the desire to insure against any losses that might arise from the anticipated Barry litigation. Thus, there is no dispute (i) that Bessette and KitBar knew of the Barry litigation as of the date KitBar applied for insurance, (ii) that KitBar therefore had knowledge of circumstances which could reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim under the proposed policy, and (iii) that KitBar did not disclose to Liberty or in the Application the existence of the Barry complaint and demand letter when it sought insurance from Liberty. Thus, under the plain language of the Application and the Policy, the Barry complaint falls squarely within the Application's section 11 exclusion for losses arising from claims that should have been disclosed in the application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   KitBar seeks to avoid this straightforward and reasonable conclusion by arguing that the Application did not require them to disclose the Barry complaint and demand letter. KitBar's first argument in this regard is that because the Policy's effective coverage date was June 13, 2015 the Application only required disclosure of claims KitBar had knowledge of as of the effective coverage date. Thus, according to KitBar, KitBar had no duty to disclose its knowledge of the Barry complaint and demand letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   KitBar's argument does not pass the smile test, and flies in the face not only of the plain language of the Application, but also common sense. KitBar's representations in the Application were made on June 23, 2015 and its knowledge as of\n   <em>\n    that date\n   </em>\n   is what matters for purposes of the Application's disclosure requirements. Section 11 of the Application is written in the present tense, asking \"[d]oes any individual or insured entity have any knowledge\" of circumstances giving rise to a claim. Thus, section 11 is not asking about some\n   unspecified date in the past, it is asking about KitBar's present knowledge of potential claims. KitBar's reading would add an additional clause to the end: \"as of the effective date of the policy.\" That language is not present in the Application and there is no reason to read it into the Application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Furthermore, it defies common sense to believe that the Application required disclosure only of what KitBar knew as of the effective date of the Policy. The purpose of the Application is to allow Liberty to assess the risk of covering KitBar and to assist Liberty in deciding whether Liberty should issue an insurance policy to KitBar. Relevant to Liberty's assessment of the risk is whether KitBar is exposed to the risk of litigation, and thus the only sensible reading of the language in the Application is that Liberty sought disclosure of KitBar's knowledge of possible claims as of the date of the Application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   KitBar was seeking to insure against a risk that had already materialized, precisely the kind of risk insurers like Liberty seek to exclude from coverage. Insurance for a risk already realized is not insurance at all, and KitBar's reading of the Application would grant\n   <em>\n    carte blanche\n   </em>\n   to unscrupulous insurance applicants to seek coverage for incidents that have already occurred by backdating the effective insurance date of their policies. For example, KitBar's argument, if countenanced, would allow an individual to apply for car insurance after he has already crashed his car, and would provide coverage for that crash as long as the applicant requested coverage backdated to commence prior to the date of the accident. Such a rule would run directly contrary to the purpose of insurance, and is an invitation to rampant insurance fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   KitBar's second argument in favor of its reading of the Application is equally unpersuasive. KitBar argues that the Application's supplemental disclosure provision, requiring insurance applicants to supplement answers with \"material changes to the statements and disclosures in this application between the date of this application and the effective date of any policy bound with Liberty...\" is controlling and did not compel KitBar to disclose the Barry complaint. This argument fails from the outset; because there was no gap between the date of application and the effective date of the policy this provision simply does not apply to this case. Section 11 required KitBar to disclose its knowledge at the date of application, and this supplemental disclosure provision would apply only if a gap existed between the date of application and the date of effective coverage. Here, no such gap exists, and as such the supplemental disclosure provision is not relevant or material to the question of what KitBar was required to disclose when it applied for insurance with Liberty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Fundamentally, KitBar impermissibly seeks to rewrite the language of the Application. The Application unambiguously required KitBar to disclose any possible claims plaintiff knew of as of the date of the Application, and KitBar indisputably failed to do so. KitBar's attempt to read limitations into the language of the policy is unavailing, as is KitBar's attempt to distort the supplementation provision to exempt it from making honest disclosures about potential claims. The simple fact is that KitBar and its president knew of the Barry complaint and demand letter on the date it applied for insurance coverage, and KitBar and its president failed to disclose this material fact, intending that any liability related to the Barry complaint would ultimately be borne by Liberty. Such a result cannot obtain under the plain language of the insurance application, and thus the Barry complaint was properly excluded from coverage and Liberty had no duty to defend KitBar with respect to the Barry complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Even assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that section 11 of the Application did not exclude coverage for the Barry litigation, KitBar's breach of contract claim against Liberty would still fail because KitBar's misrepresentations in the Application rendered the Policy void under Virginia law and the terms of the Policy. Virginia law requires insurance companies to meet a high bar when seeking to deny coverage to an insured based on a false answer in an insurance application. Virginia Code \u00a7 38.2-309 provides that \"no statement in an application or in any affidavit made before or after loss under [a policy of insurance] shall bar recovery upon a policy of insurance unless it is clearly proved that such answer or statement was material to the risk assumed and was untrue.\" The Supreme Court of Virginia has interpreted this provision as allowing an insurer to void a policy if the insurer shows by clear proof that (i) the statement or omission in the application was false; and (ii) the false statement or omission was material to the insurer's decision to undertake the risk and issue the policy.\n   <em>\n    Time Ins.

Thus, the undisputed record evidence in this case shows that KitBar, through its members Bessette and Stone, knew of the Barry complaint and demand letter and the possibility of a claim against KitBar because Bessette received and reviewed a copy of the draft Barry complaint, including its demand for money damages, the day before Bessette signed the Liberty insurance application. Yet, Bessette and Stone failed to disclose this risk in the Application. The record also demonstrates that this false statement was plainly material; Liberty's underwriter testified that if he had known of the Barry complaint he would not have issued a Policy to KitBar. Brickman Dec. at \u00b6\u00b6 21-31. In addition to the declaration, the underwriter's price quotes to KitBar in June 2015 stated that the quotes were contingent on there being \"No Claims/Circumstances in the past 5 years\" against KitBar or the insured individuals. Def. Exs. 26, 28. KitBar presents no record evidence to dispute the materiality of the misstatements and instead relies on its argument that it was not required to disclose the Barry complaint. As explained\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , KitBar was required to disclose the Barry complaint, and KitBar's failure to do so voids the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   KitBar also argues that Liberty waived its right to apply the exclusion to the Barry complaint by failing to reserve its rights under the policy.

An insurer can waive its right to deny coverage by failing to reserve its rights, or it may reserve its right to deny coverage, but for an insurer's reservation of rights to be effective, it \"must be communicated to the insured, must fairly inform him of the insurer's position, and notice thereof must be timely given.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 726,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=239%20S.E.2d%20902\">\n    239 S.E.2d 902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 908.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Liberty made clear throughout its entire course of dealing with KitBar that Liberty reserved its rights under the Policy to decline coverage for the Barry complaint. In Liberty's initial letter regarding coverage of the Barry complaint sent in December 2015, Liberty notified KitBar that Liberty was investigating the matter and reserving all of its rights during the investigation. In January 2016, Liberty began to fulfil its duty to defend KitBar with respect to the Barry lawsuit. Then, on October 7, 2016, Liberty sent a second reservation of rights stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   [p]ending our further investigation, Liberty reserves all rights and defenses under the Policy and at law and equity including the right to deny coverage based on any of the foregoing or any other Policy terms, conditions, exclusions, endorsements, including matters contained in the Application, to the extent that they are found to apply.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Finally, on January 12, 2017, Liberty sent a letter denying KitBar coverage based on misrepresentations in KitBar's insurance application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The undisputed record evidence clearly demonstrates that Liberty repeatedly reserved its rights under the policy to deny coverage for the Barry complaint. As of December 2015, Liberty properly and fully reserved its rights to exclude coverage for the Barry complaint pending its investigation. Again, in October 2016, Liberty properly reserved its rights to exclude coverage. Then, in January 2017, after discovering coverage had been fraudulently induced, Liberty informed KitBar it was terminating its defense. The law requires nothing more of Liberty beyond what it did here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Seeking to avoid this simple conclusion, KitBar argues that Liberty's failure to reserve its rights\n   <em>\n    yet again\n   </em>\n   between December 2015 and October 7, 2016 constituted a waiver of its right to apply the policy exclusion. That argument, not surprisingly, is without any legal support; KitBar cites no case for the proposition that an insurer must repeatedly reserve its rights in every correspondence with its insured, and with good reason, for such a requirement would be nonsensical. Under KitBar's theory, Liberty would be required to reserve its rights to deny coverage in every communication with KitBar about the Barry complaint. The law does not support KitBar's position. Once an insurance company has reserved its rights it may proceed to defend its insured without prejudicing its later efforts to apply policy exclusions based on the discovery of additional information that shows the insured is not covered by the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   KitBar argues in the alternative that Liberty knew of the basis for rescinding its duty to defend as of December 2015 because the Barry complaint included information demonstrating the KitBar knew of a potential claim before the application, and that because Liberty knew of the basis for rescinding coverage, Liberty has waived its right to rescind now. That argument is meritless. Liberty did not discover that KitBar knew of the Barry complaint before applying for a policy until well after Liberty began its defense and shortly before the Barry litigation was set to go to\n   trial. Liberty discovered that KitBar knew of the Barry complaint prior to applying for coverage as a result of new allegations in Barry's Amended Complaint, filed in September 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lohman Dep. at 48:8-49:6. When Liberty learned that KitBar had misrepresented its knowledge in its insurance application, Liberty's January 12, 2017 letter informed KitBar that Liberty would no longer defend the case. There is no record evidence that even suggests that Liberty had knowledge of KitBar's misrepresentations as of December 2015. As such, KitBar's waiver argument fails and Liberty is free to assert the Policy's exclusions as a bar to coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   KitBar also argues that this court should retain jurisdiction to allow KitBar to pursue a claim of bad faith denial of coverage. Because \"[t]here can be no bad faith in refusing to defend where there is no coverage under the policy[,]\" KitBar's argument is without merit and jurisdiction will not be retained.\n   <em>\n    Brenner v.

Because the parties submitted cross-motions, some portion of their statements of fact and responses were necessarily duplicative. In its motion for summary judgment, KitBar properly listed in numbered-paragraph form all the material facts it contended were undisputed. Liberty responded to the numbered paragraphs, but also included a lengthy narrative which did not comply with the requirements of the Local Rules. In Liberty's own motion for summary judgment, it made the same mistake. KitBar's response to Liberty's motion for summary judgment included a lengthy section referring to \"other undisputed material facts\" which also did not comply with the Local Rule or Scheduling Order. Furthermore, both parties could not resist the temptation to include legal argumentation in their responses to the other's enumerated facts, and the inclusion of legal arguments in the enumerated facts did not comply with the Local Rule or Scheduling Order.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    The relevant portion of Bessette's deposition testimony is excerpted here:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n    Q.

That assertion confuses the legal question of whether KitBar was under a duty to disclose the Barry complaint with the factual question of whether KitBar did disclose the Barry complaint. The undisputed factual record clearly shows that KitBar\n    <em>\n     did not\n    </em>\n    disclose the Barry complaint.

That is a misrepresentation of the record. Under the section of the January 12 letter entitled \"Full Denial of Coverage,\" the first line states that \"Liberty believes it is entitled to fully deny coverage for the Lawsuit under the Policy based on\n    <em>\n     false statements/non-disclosures in the Application\n    </em>\n    .\" P. Ex. 35 at 3 (emphasis added). While it is true that the denial of coverage was based in part on the allegations of the Complaint, those allegations revealed to Liberty that KitBar had known of the Barry complaint before it applied for insurance. Thus, KitBar has not demonstrated that there is a disputed issue of fact as to the basis on which Liberty denied insurance coverage to KitBar.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
