Hegarty, United States Magistrate Judge.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs initiated this employment action against Defendants on October 30, 2015, alleging essentially that they suffered adverse employment actions in retaliation for reporting what they believed to be improper conduct affecting security at Bagram Air Force Base in Afghanistan. Plaintiffs allege claims against their former employer, Defendant Vectrus Systems Corp. (\"Vectrus\"), for common law retaliatory termination (Claim I); violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n    10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Department of Defense whistleblower statute (Claim II); and common law outrageous conduct (Claim III).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Here, Vectrus seeks summary judgment in its favor on Plaintiff Paul Cross' (\"Cross\") first and third claims for relief. The Court finds Cross has raised genuine issues of material fact regarding whether Vectrus wrongfully discharged him, but he has failed to do so demonstrating that Vectrus engaged in outrageous conduct. Therefore, the Court grants in part and denies in part Vectrus' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FINDINGS OF FACT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court makes the following findings of fact viewed in the light most favorable to Cross, who is the non-moving party in this matter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   1. On June 27, 2007, Fluor Corporation (\"Fluor\") entered into contract number W52P1J-07-D-0008 (the \"Prime Contract\") with the U.S. Department of the Army to provide services to the Logistics Civilian Augmentation Program (\"LOGCAP\") in Afghanistan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   2. Vectrus, previously known as Exelis Systems Corporation and ITT Systems Corporation, is a Delaware corporation, with its principal place of business in Colorado Springs, Colorado.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   3. On June 20, 2008, Vectrus entered into a subcontract with Fluor, titled \"Blanket Ordering Agreement,\" to provide support for the LOGCAP program in Afghanistan (the \"BOA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   4. Plaintiff Paul Cross was hired by Vectrus effective January 28, 2010 as a lead security investigator on the LOGCAP program. Deposition of Paul Cross, January 30, 2017 (\"Cross Dep.\") 111: 4-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   5. Prior to working for Vectrus, Cross served in the U.S. Air Force Security Police and the U.S. Army.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   17: 3-9; 60:14-61:2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   6. At Vectrus, Cross, along with other security investigators (or \"screeners\") including Plaintiffs, worked at Bagram Air Force Base (\"BAF\") in Afghanistan in a Force Protection Screening Cell (\"FPSC\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and reported to Brandon\n   Spann (\"Spann\"), senior security supervisor, who reported to Kevin Daniel (\"Daniel\"), regional manager, who reported to Richard Diaz (\"Diaz\"), program manager.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   7. The security investigators, including Cross, conducted interviews and investigations required for the issuance of access badges to over 6,500 non-military personnel for daily entry to the military base. Investigators prepared investigation reports (known as \"dossiers\") which, along with fingerprints, iris scans, and facial photos, were entered into the Biometric Automated Toolset System computer database (\"BATS\"), a security database maintained by the Department of Defense (\"DOD\") and shared with the United States' NATO allies. Answer \u00b6 30, ECF No. 104; Deposition of Andrew Albright, Dec. 21, 2016 (\"Albright Dep.\") 19: 11-25; 22: 5-24: 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   8. The maintenance of accurate information in BATS was vital to the security of the base and the military's other bases throughout the world. Albright Dep. 26: 2-13; 27: 2-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   9. The dossiers summarized the security investigations and recommendations for access to the base (as well as other privileges such as access to laptops, cell phones, or even in some instances weapons), but only the military was authorized to issue access badges. Deposition of Victor Cejka, January 26, 2017 (\"Cejka Dep.\") 109: 23-110: 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   10. While the screening cell was supervised by Spann, Cejka also reported to the military oversight officer, Sergeant First Class John Salinas (\"SFC Salinas\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cejka Dep. 121: 15-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   11. In January or February 2013, Spann told a group of \"leads,\" including Cross, \"If I want somebody to have access to BATS, you will...allow them access, and I don't [care] if they're a foreign national or whatever. If they're from Fluor, you give them access.\" Cross Dep. 170: 5-18. Cross refused, then reported Spann's directive to another security lead, two screening cell managers, and Daniel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   170: 19-22; 171: 13-173: 19. He also reported the directive to military oversight.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   174: 2-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   12. In April or May 2013, Vectrus Human Resources (\"HR\") personnel asked Cross to complete a statement in response to a complaint from Agron Fana, biometrics clerk, following a meeting at which Gary Blanchard, security supervisor, \"counseled\" Fana about his error in \"merging two BAT dossiers\"; Cross was also present in the meeting. Cross Dep. 48: 11-49: 15. Cross responded to HR in or about July 2013 by email (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   254: 19-255: 4), and at the bottom of the statement, Cross wrote, \"Look, I need to talk to you in person, face-to-face, because I have some information about other stuff going on that involves Agron Fana specifically and Kevin Daniel....[p]lease get ahold [sic] of me as soon as you can.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   49: 15-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   13. Cross testified that HR personnel never responded to his request and, thus, he did not know who to trust at Vectrus.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   95: 8-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   14. Cross had wished to discuss with HR his belief that \"in 2011 and 2012 Agron Fana had been issuing badges and doling out privileges to [third country national] friends of his without authorization from the U.S. military. Kevin Daniel and Brandon Spann knew of this but swept it under the rug and allowed Agron Fana to remain working at the FPSC in a trusted position.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   He suspected that the same conduct was happening in 2013.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   255: 5-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   15. Cross also testified that he confronted Spann about Spann giving information from the screening cell to Fluor officials, particularly to Jim Brown, Fluor security specialist, since all such information was \"proprietary knowledge...for the U.S. government\" and \"we are not allowed to talk to any other company, civilian or otherwise, about it, especially without military oversight's approval.\" Cross Dep. 96: 12-97: 25. Cross brought this matter also to the attention of Daniel, Specialist Siewell (who worked in military oversight), and SFC Salinas.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   99: 23-100: 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   16. Cross provided to military oversight a report he received from Plaintiff Jamie Lytle that another Vectrus employee, Carl Lynch, was permitting drugs, alcohol, and prostitutes to come on base through the \"turnstiles\" at the entrance.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   196: 24-197: 7; 198: 4-21. He \"never mentioned Brandon Spann\" when discussing drugs or prostitution to the different agencies to which he reported.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   193: 25-194: 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   17. In or about July or August 2013, some security investigators reported to Cross that another security investigator, Marc Salazar, was conducting \"secret interviews and interrogations in his office...at the direction of Brandon Spann.\" Cross Dep. 41: 16-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   18. Cross testified that one day thereafter, he saw Jim Brown leave Salazar's office, look at Cross nervously, and leave through the back door. Cross asked Salazar, \"What was Jim Brown doing in there with the interpreter and the subject you were interviewing?\" He answered, \"Well, he was participating in the interview.\" Cross said, \"Well, you know we have to get military oversight approval [because before we have anybody, even FBI, participating in the interview, we have to get their approval].\" Salazar said, \"Well, Brandon Spann authorized that.\" Cross attests that he immediately went to Brandon Spann and asked him if military oversight had approved Jim Brown's attendance in the interview. Spann \"kind of looked away and hesitated and then back\" to Cross and said, \"Yeah, he-he authorized it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   42: 2-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   19. Cross testified that immediately thereafter, he went to military oversight-\"a DOD civilian by the name of Siebert, Seaquest, something like that [Specialist Siewell]-and asked him, \"Sir, did you authorize Jim Brown from Fluor to participate in an interview today with Marc Salazar?\" Siewell answered, \"No. I've never even heard of that.\" Cross asked, \"Have you ever authorized that?\" Siewell said no, he had not.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   42: 23-43: 8; 98: 14-99: 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   20. Cross then went straight to Kevin Daniel and reported what he saw and heard saying, \"We're not allowed to do that. We can't have anybody participating in interviews outside of the screening cell unless military oversight approves.\" Daniel responded that he would talk to Brandon Spann and make sure it did not happen again. Thereafter, Daniel and Spann \"avoided\" Cross and rarely talked to him. Cross got the feeling that he \"had stumbled onto something\" and that Spann and Daniel were \"up to something,\" so Cross felt he had to \"watch [his] back.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   43: 9-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   21. Cross testified that he also saw Brown come out of the office of another security investigator, Bernard Hall, whose office was located across from Cross' office. Hall told Cross that Brown had attended the interview at Spann's direction and without the approval of military oversight.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   215:15-216: 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   22. SFC Salinas testified that Cross came to him in or about July 2013 and reported that Spann Brown had been sitting in on interviews that involved Fluor employees. SFC Salinas confirmed that to protect the\n   integrity of the investigation, only the screener, interviewee, translator, and Salinas were authorized to sit in screening interviews. Deposition of John Salinas, November 30, 2016 (\"Salinas Dep.\") 44: 7-8; 45: 20-46: 21; 137: 20-138: 2. After Salinas \"briefed\" the proper procedure, Spann told SFC Salinas that he \"was going to take care of his people his way.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   140: 2-7. SFC Salinas had no knowledge that the reported conduct occurred again.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   141: 3-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   23. At or about the same time that Cross reported to Daniel what he perceived to be unauthorized access by Fluor to Salazar's interviews, Cross also reported his belief that Salazar \"pencil-whipped\" his dossiers (i.e., input incorrect or no information obtained during the interview), conducted improper or unnecessary interviews, and failed to conduct his share of screening interviews. Cross Dep. 144: 21-145: 14; 148: 2-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   24. Cross testified that after reporting to military oversight the interviews at which Brown attended and other perceived problems, he went back to Spann's and Daniel's office to inform them that he had made the reports.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   214: 17-215: 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   25. On July 17, 2013, Vectrus security supervisor Gary Blanchard notified Fluor security that he found material inside a \"work instructions\" document identified as \"secret\" or \"classified.\" Report, ECF No. 124-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   26. Fluor security manager, Jeremiah Keenan, conducted an investigation of this report, which raised potential violations of the National Industrial Security Program Manual (\"NISPOM\"), during which he interviewed and procured witness statements from several Vectrus employees, including Cross.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   27. On July 18, 2013 at 11:51, Cross completed a statement concerning his conduct with respect to a \"training document...on how to join multiple dossiers in BAT.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   July 18, 2013 Statement, ECF No. 129-34 at 38. Cross stated that he created the document on \"the share drive\" in the \"Centrix\" system, added some \"screen shots of BAT dossiers\" as examples, and put copies of the document in \"screeners' sub folders,\" but did not put the document on a thumb drive, did not make a copy of the document off of Centrix, and never plugged his thumb drive into the Centrix system.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Cross states that he gave Keenan and Jim Brown (who apparently assisted with the investigation) his thumb drive at their request. Cross Dep. 274: 17-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   28. Later that day at 16:17, Cross completed a second statement concerning the same training document. July 18, 2013 Statement, ECF No. 129-34 at 39. In this statement, Cross asserted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   I can't remember 100% because it was very hectic at the time but if I remember correctly, Jackie needed the document to use for training to show the bio-clerks the proper way to join dossiers. This was about the time that one of the other Bio-Clerks had made a slight mistake on the proper procedure for joining multiple dossiers. I thought I had just given it to her on Centrix, but looking back, I think that I did indeed give her a copy on my thumb drive for some reason. I plugged my thumb drive into BAT and retrieved the document without fully reviewing what was on it. I then gave the thumb drive to Jackie. Afterwards, I thought that I had completely deleted\n   the file on the thumb drive and had only my toolbox and some TV shows on it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=573%20P.2d%20559\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Cross states that he created this statement after Keenan and Brown returned to his office saying there was a training document on the thumb drive; Cross \"had to think about it for a second...and \"go back and kind of-kind of retrace [his] steps\" because he \"honestly didn't think that [he] put it on the thumb drive.\" Cross Dep. 275: 9-21. Cross went to Brown and Keenan, who were at the copy machine, and told them that he had forgotten but remembered copying the document onto the thumb drive and asked whether he could change his statement. Brown or Keenan answered that it was \"no problem\" and \"we'll just tear this up,\" referring to his first statement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   276: 1-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   29. Cross recalled later that about a week or two prior to utilizing the thumb drive for Conklin, Daniel had directed him to use a thumb drive to retrieve and copy training documents from the Centrix system. Cross Dep. 34: 23-36: 11; 39: 19-40: 16. Although Cross protested that he previously had been \"chewed once for doing that,\" Daniel \"assured him that it was okay.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   105: 14-106: 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   30. In or about August 2013, Plaintiff Wascher was asked to conduct an investigation of a person suspected of possessing a cell phone, which was not allowed on base absent military approval. Deposition of Steven Wascher, January 23, 2017 (\"Wascher Dep.\") 107: 8-108: 10. Wascher interviewed the suspect and, during a break, Daniel approached Wascher and told him that he \"knew for a fact\" that \"she does have a cell phone\" because either \"Agron or Artan [Fana] gave her the phone\" to arrange \"meetings\" with her during lunch or in the evenings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   110: 17-111: 13; 139: 17-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   31. Immediately following the interview with the suspect, Wascher completed a dossier on the BATS, in which he included the information Daniel reported to him.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202409\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   111: 20-25, 112: 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   32.

Cross also points to an interview of Spann two days after Hobbs and Brown emailed the findings and recommendations of the Vectrus investigation, at which Spann mentioned the investigation and stated, \"Some people will get counseled including Security Investigator Lead Paul Cross, which is a surprise, but he lied about something so HR says we're doing [a final written warning].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The record-including Hobbs' August 29, 2013 email recommending termination, Brown's September 4, 2013 email noting Cross' termination request is supported by Diaz and Scott, and Brown's September 9, 2013 email noting that \"the project...recommended termination\"-makes clear that the termination decision came initially from program management and was later confirmed by HR and Employee Relations.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   September 12, 2013 Email (in referencing the findings of the NISPOM investigation, Melanie White stated that \"the program...recommended termination.\"). Thus, Cross must show factual issues as to whether Diaz and/or Hobbs knew he engaged in protected activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Importantly, Cross testified that he did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   report any potential security violations to Vectrus management other than to Spann and Daniel. The fact that Diaz instructed Hobbs and others on August 21, 2013 to work together to complete an investigation into NISPOM violations and to recommend corrective actions does not demonstrate that Vectrus management knew Cross had reported possible security violations. However, Spann's knowledge about the investigation's findings (including that Cross \"lied\") just two days after the recommendations were made demonstrates that Spann had discussed the findings with someone who knew them; Spann testified that person was \"Venola Riley\" (Scott) who purportedly told him \"things were wrapping up, and that something happened with Paul Cross and Fluor was directing pretty much the punishments and that we were probably going to do a Final Written Warning on him. And that she told me I was gonna get one too.\" Deposition of Brandon Spann, March 20, 2017 (\"Spann Dep.\") 218: 13-219: 15. Scott testified not only that she did not speak with Spann about the investigation, but also that he lied in saying she did. Deposition of Venola Scott, May 18, 2017 (\"Scott Dep.\") 80: 5-16. The Court finds this dispute raises a material issue of fact as to with whom Spann discussed the NISPOM investigation\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and as to whether Spann, to\n   whom Cross reported potential security violations in allowing Brown access to classified information, had involvement in the investigation leading to Cross' termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Furthermore, Cross testified without rebuttal that Jim Brown \"lied\" by reporting that Cross recanted his statement to Fluor only after it was discovered that the thumb drive contained classified information, when \"in reality\" Cross asked to revise his statement when he remembered that he had, in fact, retrieved documents for Conklin, and Brown told him, \"Oh, that's no problem. We'll just tear up the old statement. It's not a big deal.\" Cross Dep. 261: 1-262: 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Finally, Cross argues that he and Spann committed essentially the same conduct, but only he was terminated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The record reflects a September 9, 2013 email from White to Doug Brown following his request for approval of Cross' termination asking Brown to \"[p]lease explain why Mr. Cross was sent forward for termination but the following employees were recommended for either suspension or FWW.\" ECF No. 137-1 at 18-19. White listed all of the employees involved in the investigation, except Blanchard and including Spann.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Doug Brown responded that \"unlike the others, [Cross] obstructed an official investigation by providing false information, which was later found through a subsequent interview and inspection of his storage device.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. Cross contends that the evidence reflects Spann engaged in the same conduct, but was not terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The Court is not persuaded by this final argument, primarily because the evidence reflects Cross' and Spann's conduct were not the same and they cannot be reasonably compared. For example, where the Fluor investigator initially asked Cross whether he used a thumb drive to access documents on BATS/Centrix (ECF No. 129-34 at 38), there is no indication that Spann was initially asked whether he had used a thumb drive and denied it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 137-1 at 5, 7. In addition, the evidence shows that the material Spann retrieved by thumb drive was not classified and his retrieval of the material was directed and approved by military oversight.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. Conversely, the material Cross downloaded on his personal thumb drive contained classified information and he retrieved it at the request of Conklin, another security investigator.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 137-1 at 16. Cross testified that he had been previously directed by Daniel to retrieve materials from the BATS onto his thumb drive but, again, Cross admits that the documents were not classified. The Court finds Cross fails to raise a material factual issue in this regard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   In sum, the Court finds Cross raises a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Spann, to whom he reported potential violations of Army Regulation 381-12 and DOD Directive 5240.06, was involved with the investigation leading to Cross' termination and whether Jim Brown, who conducted Fluor's investigation and who was the target of Cross' reports, manipulated the findings of the investigation such that Cross' conduct was inaccurately reported.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Outrageous Conduct\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   On March 9, 2016, the Court issued an order dismissing all of the Plaintiffs' claims for outrageous conduct except those relating to \"the impairment of Cross' security clearance\" and the \"transfers of Walker and Wascher to dangerous forward operating bases.\" Order, ECF No. 35. Here, Vectrus argues Cross has not met his burden to demonstrate genuine issues of material fact demonstrating any action taken on his security clearance was \"outrageous.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   To prove outrageous conduct under Colorado law, a plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) the defendant engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct; (2) the defendant engaged in the conduct recklessly or with the intent of causing the plaintiff severe emotional distress; and (3) the plaintiff incurred severe emotional distress which was caused by the defendant's conduct.\n   <em>\n    Culpepper v.

Cross contends that Vectrus did not notify the military about the adverse report, as it was \"required\" to do. Cross Dep. 289: 19-290: 2. Cleary testified that, had Vectrus reported the \"derog\" to military oversight, it would have conducted its own investigation as \"owners\" of the \"classified information.\" Cleary Dep. 143: 13-22. But, both Wilson and Koji Del Conte (Vectrus security manager) testified, and the NISPOM states, that reports must be made only to \"the CSA.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NISPOM \u00a7 1-302 (a) (report adverse information to CSA); Del Conte Dep. 82: 18-25 (\"The cognizant security activity for a military is the customer on the military installation. Then off the military installation is the DSS.\"); Wilson Dep. 90: 13-20 (reporting requirement is to DSS). Cross provides nothing rebutting this requirement, nor any policy or regulation demonstrating a requirement that Vectrus report the NISPOM violation and/or adverse information to military oversight at the base.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Nevertheless, the Court finds that Cross has failed to raise any material factual issues demonstrating that Vectrus' \"failure\" to report the adverse information to military oversight is \"outrageous.\" First, there is no documentary evidence showing Vectrus was required to do so. Second, the evidence reflects that Vectrus reported adverse information on JPAS for all employees involved in the NISPOM investigation, and there is no evidence that any failure to report this information to the military affected the other employees, including Blanchard who was also terminated. ECF No. 129-32. Third, to survive summary judgment on this claim, Cross must present evidence \"that the defendant[ ] engaged in outrageous conduct with\n   <em>\n    the specific intent\n   </em>\n   of causing\n   <em>\n    severe emotional distress\n   </em>\n   or that the defendant[ ]\n   <em>\n    acted recklessly\n   </em>\n   with the knowledge that there was a substantial probability that their conduct would cause\n   <em>\n    severe emotional distress\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Culpepper v.

Cross testified that \"as a result of his experience with Vectrus,\" he suffered \"[a] little bit of emotional\" trouble, including \"[a] little bit of sleeplessness, [l]ack of trust in pretty much anybody, [and] [a] little bit of depression every now and then.\" Cross Dep. 313: 23-314: 8.
