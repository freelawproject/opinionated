(Doc. 171.) The remaining claims involve trademark and trade dress dilution under federal and state law, as well as trademark and trade dress infringement under federal and state law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court held a four-day bench trial beginning on October 2, 2017. Pursuant to Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, having heard the evidence and determined the credibility of the witnesses,\n   <strong>\n    THE COURT NOW FINDS BY A PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE THE FOLLOWING FACTS AND STATES ITS CONCLUSIONS OF LAW.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court finds in favor of Defendant and against Plaintiff on all remaining claims. Consequently, the Court will grant Defendant's requests and order permanent injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. PARTIES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   1. Plaintiff VIP Products, LLC, (\"VIP\") designs, manufactures, markets, and sells chew toys for dogs. VIP sells various brands of dog chew toys, including the \"Tuffy's\" line (durable sewn/soft toys), the \"Mighty\" line (durable toys made of a different material than the Tuffy's line), and the \"Silly Squeakers\" line (durable rubber squeaky novelty toys). (Doc. 242 at 3.) VIP is an Arizona limited liability company with its principal place of business in Phoenix, Arizona. (Docs. 49 \u00b6 1; 204-1, Ex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A.) President of VIP Steven Sacra and his wife are the principal owners of VIP. (Doc. 234 at 24.) Mr. Sacra is a talented entrepreneur who developed the line of VIP dog toys. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30-37.) His talent and creativity often lead to \"of the moment\" inspiration, such as toys Mr. Sacra believes are parodies of other companies' products. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Doc. 237 at 102.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   2. Defendant Jack Daniel's Properties, Inc. (\"Jack Daniel's\") is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in San Rafael, California. (Docs. 1 \u00b6 2, 15-1 \u00b6 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PRE-LITIGATION FACTUAL FINDINGS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   3. Jack Daniel's owns and licenses the trademarks and trade dress used in connection with Jack Daniel's products. (Docs. 105; 204-1, Ex. A.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   4. Jack Daniel's Tennessee whiskey has been sold in the United States continuously since at least 1875, except during Prohibition. (Doc. 105; U.S. Trademark Reg. No. 42,663.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   5. Jack Daniel's Tennessee whiskey has borne the JACK DANIEL'S trademark and the OLD NO. 7 trademark since 1875. (Doc. 234 at 51-52 (discussing U.S. Trademark Reg. Nos. 42,663, 582,789, and 1,923,981).) Jack Daniel's federal registrations of its trademarks and trade dress for whiskey also includes Trademark Reg. No. 4,106,178 for the three-dimensional configuration of a square shape bottle container. (Doc. 12 at 7.) Jack Daniel's trade dress has included these trademarks for many decades. (Doc. 234 at 55-56, 68.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   6. Jack Daniel's has maintained an active brand licensing program for many years. (Docs. 105, Ex. 1; 234 at 68-69; 111-113.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   7. Jack Daniel's trademarks and trade dress have appeared on thousands of products other than whiskey, including food, apparel, and a limited number of pet products. (Doc. 230-16 thru 231-7.) Jack Daniel's offers branded dog leashes, collars, and dog houses. (Docs. 234 at 113, 230-9 thru 230-12.) Jack Daniel's has offered these dog accessories since before the events giving rise to this case. (Doc. 241 at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   8. Initially launched in approximately 2007, VIP's Silly Squeakers line of dog toys includes a variety of toys in the shapes of beer, wine, soda, and liquor bottles. (Doc. 236 at 31-38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   9. Mr. Sacra's intent behind producing the Silly Squeakers line of toys was to develop a creative parody on existing products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45-47, 56.) Mr. Sacra provided examples of this line of toys, including \"Smella R-Crotches\" a parody of Stella Artois, \"Heini Sniff'n\" a parody of Heineken, and \"Pissness\" a parody of Guinness. (Doc. 237 at 96-98.) According to Mr. Sacra, these parodies are just harmless, clean fun, and are not distasteful or harmful. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 99.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   10. VIP created and marketed the \"Bad Spaniels\" silly squeaker dog toy. (Doc. 158.) The \"Bad Spaniels\" toy is in the shape of a liquor bottle and features a wide-eyed spaniel over the words \"Bad Spaniels\", \"the Old No. 2, on your Tennessee Carpet.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At the bottom of the \"Bad Spaniels\" toy, it reads: \"43% POO BY VOL.\" and \"100% SMELLY\". On the back of the Silly Squeakers label for the \"Bad Spaniels\" toy, it states: \"This product is not affiliated with Jack Daniel Distillery.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   11. VIP's intent behind designing the \"Bad Spaniels\" toy was to match the bottle design for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Sour Mash Whiskey (\"Old No. 7 Brand\"). (Doc. 157.) These design elements include the size and shape of the product, the use of white lettering over a black background, and font styles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   12. Mr. Sacra originally coined the name \"Bad Spaniels\", and then requested Designer Elle Phillips to work on a proposed design. (Doc. 236 at 55-56.) Ms. Phillips understood that \"Bad Spaniels\" was a reference to \"Jack Daniel's.\" (Doc. 233-1 at 47, 49-50.) Ms. Phillips was familiar with that brand and had consumed Jack Daniel's Tennessee whiskey in bars and in her home. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52-53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   13. Prior to starting the design for \"Bad Spaniels,\" Ms. Phillips recalled various Jack Daniel's packaging features from memory, including \"[t]he black and white label, sort of a cursive font for Tennessee, simple type,\" and the square shape of the bottle, as well as the use of a number on the neck label. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53-54.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   14. Ms. Phillips then retrieved a bottle from her liquor cabinet, examined it, and placed it on her desk while she developed a sketch. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54-55, Docs. 104-1 at 101-02, 225-17.) She referenced the Jack Daniel's bottle \"every now and then throughout the process.\" (Doc. 233-1 at 66-67.) Ms. Phillips wanted her sketch to be close to the same as the Jack Daniel's bottle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 67.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   15. When finished, the \"Bad Spaniels\" product featured all the elements of the Jack Daniel's Trade Dress, including the bottle shape, color scheme, and trademark stylization, as well as the word \"Tennessee,\" and the font and other graphic elements. (Doc. 158.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   16. \"Bad Spaniels\" was introduced in 2014 and in the VIP catalogs, the \"Bad Spaniels\" product appears in a bar setting alongside various hanging bottles, one of which can be recognized as a Jack Daniel's bottle. (Docs. 227-7 and 227-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    III. LITIGATION HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   17. After VIP introduced \"Bad Spaniels,\" Jack Daniel's promptly demanded that it stop selling the new toy. (Doc. 47.) VIP responded by filing a complaint seeking a declaratory judgment that \"Bad Spaniels\" did not infringe or dilute any trademark or trade dress rights owned by Jack Daniel's. (Doc. 49 at 9-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   18. Subsequently, the parties filed dispositive motions. (Docs. 101, 110.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   19. In ruling on the motions, the Court ruled in favor of Jack Daniel's and against VIP, rejecting VIP's defenses of nominative and First Amendment fair use, and that VIP failed to rebut the validity of the Jack Daniel's bottle design registration. (Doc. 171.) In addition, the Court found as a matter of law that Jack Daniel's trade dress and bottle design are distinctive, not generic, and that they are nonfunctional. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   );\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kendall-Jackson Winery, Ltd. v. E. &amp; J. Gallo Winery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1540571\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/150/1042/#p1047\">\n    150 F.3d 1042\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1047 (9th Cir. 1998) (stating that whether it be a trademark or a trade dress claim, a plaintiff must meet three basic elements: (1) distinctiveness, (2) nonfunctionality, and (3) likelihood of confusion).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   20. The Court left for trial the remaining issues of Jack Daniel's claim for dilution by tarnishment and Jack Daniel's claim for infringement-the remaining issue of likelihood of confusion. (Doc. 171.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   21. At this point in the litigation, VIP does not contest the validity of Jack Daniel's prior trademarks and trade dress registrations. (Doc. 242 at 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. DILUTION BY TARNISHMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   22. On October 6, 2006, the Trademark Dilution Revision Act of 2006 (the \"TDRA\"), was signed into law. See Pub.L. 109-312,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20Stat.%201730\">\n    120 Stat. 1730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Oct. 6, 2006). The TDRA defines dilution as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Subject to the principles of equity, the owner of a famous mark that is distinctive, inherently or through acquired distinctiveness, shall be entitled to an injunction against another person who, at any time after the owner's mark has become famous, commences use of a mark or trade name in commerce that is\n   likely to cause dilution by blurring or dilution by tarnishment of the famous mark, regardless of the presence or absence of actual or likely confusion, of competition, or of actual economic injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) (establishing a likelihood of dilution standard).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   23. The phrase \"likely to cause dilution\" used in the TDRA significantly changes the meaning of the law from \"causes actual harm\" under the preexisting law to \"likely\" or \"likelihood\" which means probably.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    V Secret Catalogue, Inc. v. Moseley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4230507\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/605/382/#p388\">\n    605 F.3d 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 388 (6th Cir. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   24. The TDRA further defines dilution by tarnishment, as follows: \"For purposes of [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) ], 'dilution by tarnishment' is association arising from the similarity between a mark or trade name and a famous mark that harms the reputation of the famous mark.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(C) ;\n   <em>\n    Mattel, Inc. v.

To prove dilution by tarnishment under the TDRA, Jack Daniel's must prove that at least one of its asserted trademark and trade dress rights was not only valid but also famous before the accused use began, and that the accused use is likely to cause negative associations that harms the reputation of the famous mark.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) ; A.R.S. \u00a7 44-1448.01 ;\n   <em>\n    Jada Toys, Inc. v.

Ariz. 2016) (stating that the \"elements necessary to prove [an Arizona] state law trademark dilution counterclaim are basically identical\" to federal trademark dilution claims).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (A) Fame\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   26. A trademark or trade dress is famous if \"it is widely recognized by the general consuming public of the United States as a designation of source.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(A). All relevant factors may be considered, including: \"the duration, extent, and geographic reach of advertising and publicity of the mark\"; \"the amount, volume, and geographic extent of sales of goods or services offered under the mark\"; \"the extent of actual recognition of the mark\"; \"and whether the mark [has been] registered...on the principal register.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(A)(i)-(iv) ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 44-1448.01(A)(1-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   27. Based on the relevant fame factors,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(A)(i)-(iv), advertising, sales, actual recognition, and prior registration, the Court finds that Jack Daniel's trademarks and trade dress are famous and were famous before VIP introduced \"Bad Spaniels\" in July 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   28. Regarding advertising, Jack Daniel's spent hundreds of millions of dollars to promote Jack Daniel's whiskey. (Docs. 234 at 55-56, 59-69, 80;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Docs. 220, Exs. 105-24; Doc. 229-5 thru 229-9, 229-13, and 229-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   29. Regarding sales, Jack Daniel's is the best-selling whiskey in the United States since 1997, exceeding 75 million cases and 10 billion dollars in sales. (Doc. 234 at 48-50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   30. Regarding actual recognition, Jack Daniel's trademarks have been used continuously for over a century, except during Prohibition. (Doc. 234 at 49-52.) Jack Daniel's trademarks and trade dress have been seen by millions of Americans in movies, and television programs. (Doc. 234 at 62-66, 68; Doc. 220, Exs. 107, 109-11, and 146.) Jack Daniel's is prominently featured at jackdaniels.com, which was visited more than four million (4,000,000) times during\n   2014. (Docs. 234 at 66; Docs. 220, Ex. 112, and 229-8.) Jack Daniel's trade dress is prominently featured on social media pages for the brand. (Doc. 234 at 66, Doc. 229-9.) Based on Jack Daniel's internal records, aided consumer awareness of the Jack Daniel's brand is consistently around 98%.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 234 at 50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   31. Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Jack Daniel's carried its burden of demonstrating that its trademarks and trade dress were famous before VIP's \"Bad Spaniels\" use began in July 2014. Jack Daniel's trademark and trade dress were widely recognized by the general consuming public of the United States in July 2014. Thus, Jack Daniel's established its fame under both the federal TDRA and Arizona state law, A.R.S. \u00a7 44-1448.01(A)(1-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (B) Similarity\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   32. Under the TDRA's likelihood of dilution standard, in order to establish similarity in a dilution by tarnishment case, a party must show only \"similarity,\" not substantial similarity or nearly identical, between the famous mark and the accused mark.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Levi Strauss &amp; Co. v.

The factors under consideration for determining similarity in a dilution by tarnishment case have not been clearly defined.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nordstrom, Inc. v.

Wash. Mar. 25, 2013). To resolve the question of similarity, the Court considers \"the factors of appearance, sound and meaning,\" factors that are also relevant in evaluating infringement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nordstrom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%201196948\">\n    2013 WL 1196948\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   34. Here, VIP intended and produced a dog toy that included and was similar to Jack Daniel's trademarks and trade dress. (Doc. 241 at 13-15.) VIP appropriated the Jack Daniel's trade dress in every aspect: \"Jack Daniel's\" became \"Bad Spaniels, \" \"Old No. 7\" became \"Old No. 2,\" and \"Tennessee whiskey\" became \"Tennessee carpet.\" Meanwhile, the square bottle shape, the nearly identical size of the two products, the ribbed neck, arched lettering, filigreed border, black-and-white color scheme, fonts, shapes, and styles remain virtually unchanged. \"With a single glance...one is immediately struck by their similarity.\"\n   <em>\n    GoTo.com, Inc. v.

VIP does not contest similarity; rather, despite some minor artistic variations, VIP concedes that it used Jack Daniel's trademarks and trade dress as a model for its \"Bad Spaniels\" dog toy. (Doc. 242 at 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   36. Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Jack Daniel's established the requisite similarity between VIP's \"Bad Spaniels\" and Jack Daniel's trademark and trade dress. Thus, the Court finds similarity between the two products under both the federal TDRA and Arizona state law, A.R.S. \u00a7 44-1448.01(A)(1-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (C) Reputational Harm\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   37. Finally, under the TDRA, the last factor focuses on reputational harm, that is, whether associations from VIP's \"Bad Spaniels\" product \"harms the reputation of the famous mark,\" Jack Daniel's trademarks\n   and trade dress.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (2)(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   38. Reputational harm \"generally arises when the plaintiff's trademark is linked to products of shoddy quality, or is portrayed in an unwholesome or unsavory context likely to evoke unflattering thoughts about the owner's product.\"\n   <em>\n    Tiffany (NJ) Inc. v. eBay Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223051\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/600/93/#p111\">\n    600 F.3d 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 111 (2d Cir. 2010) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Deere &amp; Co. v.

For example, there is a strong consensus among courts across jurisdictions that a famous mark is tarnished when it is semantically associated with a new mark that it is using to sell sex-related products.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    V Secret\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4230507\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/605/382/#p388\">\n    605 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   388 (citing cases in support).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   39. A trademark may also be tarnished if the mark loses its ability to serve as a \"wholesome identifier\" of the plaintiff's product.\n   <em>\n    Starbucks Corp. v.

The Second Circuit found that the relevant inquiry is how the junior mark's product affects the positive impressions about the famous mark's product, and not whether a consumer simply associates a negative sounding junior mark with the famous mark.\n   <em>\n    Starbucks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3494843\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/588/97/#p110\">\n    588 F.3d at 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   40. Regarding reputational harm, both parties engaged experts. The determination of an expert's credibility and the weight to be given expert testimony and evidence is a matter within the discretion of the trier of fact, which in a bench trial like the instant case, is a matter for the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fox v.

Jack Daniel's engaged Dr. Itamar Simonson, a Professor of Marketing at Stanford University. (Doc. 234 at 154-62.) Dr. Simonson, relying on consumer psychology research, concluded that VIP's introduction of \"Bad Spaniels\" into the marketplace resulted in Jack Daniel's trademarks and trade dress being diluted by tarnishment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 162-74.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   42. VIP engaged Mr. Bruce Silverman, an advertising, marketing, and branding consultant for the past 40-50 years, to rebut the opinion of Dr. Simonson and his findings. (Doc. 238 at 9-31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    Dr. Itamar Simonson, Credentials and Findings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   43. Dr. Simonson has served as an expert witness on numerous occasions, providing testimony on issues related to marketing, consumer behavior, trademark-related matters, false advertising, and branding. (Doc. 234 at 161.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   44. Dr. Simonson has conducted, supervised, or evaluated over one thousand marketing research studies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 155-59, 61-62.) Such studies related to consumer behavior, consumer information processing, brand equity, trademarks, branding, marketing strategies, and advertising. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   45. Dr. Simonson's opinions here are supported by empirical studies in which there are two stages to establish a likelihood of dilution by tarnishment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 162-63.) One, whether the allegedly diluting product will bring to mind or call to mind the allegedly diluted mark, and two, assuming that the allegedly diluting product does call to mind the allegedly diluted mark, has it affected the brand equity and brand association of the allegedly diluted mark. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   46. The first stage was satisfied because the whole point of VIP's product was to bring \"Jack Daniel's Old No. 7 to mind.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 163.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   47. Consumer psychology research utilized to evaluate the second stage was\n   based on numerous empirical studies: The Court credits that the studies relied upon by Dr. Simonson support certain conclusions that apply to all products and services regarding the impact of adding a negative association onto the association of the existing brand. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   48. The Associative Network Model has been empirically tested and verified numerous times since the 1970's. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 164-66.) Regarding application of the Associative Network Model, the Court credits Dr. Simonson that when consumers are evaluating brands certain mental associations come to mind. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 164.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   49. In accordance with the Associative Network Model and based upon Dr. Simonson's review of Jack Daniel's commercials and advertisements, his understanding about the Jack Daniel's brand, and the key messages Jack Daniel's communicates regarding its brand values (namely authenticity, integrity, independence, loyalty), the Court credits Dr. Simonson's testimony of documented positive mental associations that come to mind when evaluating Jack Daniel's before VIP introduced the \"Bad Spaniels\" dog toy. (Doc. 234 at 169-70.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   50. Based upon the Associative Network Model, the Court credits Dr. Simonson's conclusion regarding the effects of \"Bad Spaniels\" and the negative mental associations that come to mind when you include defecation, feces, and poo upon consumers who are evaluating Jack Daniel's whiskey. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 170-72.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   51. Dr. Simonson relied on consumer psychology research to establish that when you associate any food or beverage with defecation, you are creating disgust in the mind of the consumer with respect to that food or beverage associated with defecation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 172-74, 180.) Well documented empirical research supports that the negative associations of \"Old No. 2\" defecation and \"poo by weight\" creates disgust in the mind of the consumer when the consumer is evaluating Jack Daniel's whiskey. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 171-72.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   52. Dr. Simonson relied on consumer psychology research in his evaluation of the second phase regarding likelihood of dilution by tarnishment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   53. Based on the Associative Network Model, the Court credits Dr. Simonson that the \"Bad Spaniels\" product is likely to tarnish the Jack Daniel's trademarks and trade dress by creating negative associations, either consciously or unconsciously, and undermining the pre-existing positive associations with its whiskey (\"Old No. 2 on your Tennessee carpet\"). (Doc. 234 at 172-74, 220.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   54. The Court credits Dr. Simonson's conclusion that such negative associations are particularly harmful for a company such as Jack Daniel's because the goods it offers for sale involves human consumption and human consumption and canine excrement do not mix. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 172-74.) Further, because Jack Daniel's brand name along with its equity is a very important asset. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 160.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    Mr. Bruce Silverman, Credentials and Findings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   55. VIP engaged its own expert, Bruce Silverman, to rebut the opinion of Dr. Simonson and his findings. (Doc. 238 at 31.) Mr. Bruce Silverman has been an advertising, marketing, and branding consultant for the past 40-50 years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-31.) He has worked with companies that manufacture or produce goods and services, as well as his main work with advertising and public relations agencies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   56. In West Los Angeles, Mr. Silverman arranged four focus groups\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   to test\n   consumer reactions to \"Bad Spaniels\" which according to Mr. Silverman had an overall favorable impression of Jack Daniel's upon discussing the \"Bad Spaniels\" dog toy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44-50.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   57. Mr. Silverman's reliance on the West Los Angeles focus groups is flawed because the groups were initially directed by the moderator that the product under evaluation, \"Bad Spaniels\", was a joke, a spoof product, and as a result the focus groups produced predetermined results. (Doc. 234 at 181, 183.) This tainted the group's conclusions. Moreover, Mr. Silverman did not have expertise or specialized knowledge in trademark dilution matters; rather, his experience was in advertising. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 208.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   58. Finally, Jack Daniel's trademarks and trade dress are tarnished by associating them with toys, particularly the kind of toys that might appeal to children. (Doc. 238 at 96-97, 110-11.) The Court finds that while an association with toys may not ordinarily cause reputational harm, Jack Daniel's is in the whiskey business, and does not market to children, does not license goods for children, and does not license goods that might appeal to children. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   59. Here, the Court credits and gives prevailing weight to Dr. Simonson's specialized knowledge and specific expertise in consumer psychology to evaluate and conclude a likelihood of dilution by tarnishment regarding the effect of the \"Bad Spaniels\" dog toy upon the Jack Daniel's trademarks and trade dress.

Accordingly, Dr. Simonson established that, the \"Bad Spaniels\" product is likely to tarnish the Jack Daniel's trademarks and trade dress by creating negative associations, either consciously or unconsciously, and undermining the pre-existing positive associations with its whiskey (\"Old No. 2 on your Tennessee carpet\"). (Doc. 234 at 172-74, 220.) This negative association is particularly harmful for a company such as Jack Daniel's because the goods it offers for sale involves human consumption and human\n   consumption and canine excrement do not mix. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 172-74.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   61. The Court further finds that dilution by tarnishment will occur due to Jack Daniel's trademarks and trade dress being associated with toys, particularly the kind of toys that might appeal to children; Jack Daniel's is in the whiskey business and its reputation will be harmed due to the negative mental association of evoking whiskey with children, something Jack Daniel's has never done. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 96-97, 110-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   62. Thus, under the federal TDRA and Arizona state law, A.R.S. \u00a7 44-1448.01(A)(1-8), Jack Daniel's has established the requisite reputational harm to its trademarks and trade dress as a result of VIP's creation and introduction of \"Bad Spaniels\" into the pet toy market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (D) Conclusion-Dilution by Tarnishment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   63. The Court finds that Jack Daniel's established by a preponderance of the evidence all the requisite elements for dilution by tarnishment: fame, similarity, and reputational harm, caused by VIP's \"Bad Spaniels\" against Jack Daniel's trademark and trade dress under both the federal TDRA and Arizona state law, A.R.S. \u00a7 44-1448.01(A)(1-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    V. TRADEMARK/TRADE DRESS INFRINGEMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   64. Whether a trademark or trade dress claim, Jack Daniel's must meet three elements in order to establish infringement: (1) distinctiveness; (2) nonfunctionality, and (3) the likelihood of confusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kendall-Jackson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1540571\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/150/1042/#p1047\">\n    150 F.3d at 1047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   65.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Ford designed and executed surveys relating to intellectual property matters, including trademark, false advertising, patent, and other related matters. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Ford was familiar with accepted principles of survey research, as well as the tests for trustworthiness of properly conducted surveys or polls.

In this matter, Dr. Ford designed an internet survey to measure whether the \"Bad Spaniels\" product is likely to confuse consumers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.)

Dr. Ford conducted a double-blind survey, meaning that not only is the interviewer unaware of the purpose of the survey, the interviewing firm is also unaware, and also the supervisor who instructs the interviewers is unaware of the purpose or the sponsor of the survey. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8, Doc. 230-3 at 6.) In addition, the responding consumers were not informed that this was being done for this or that company. (Doc. 230-3 at 6.) Dr. Ford's designed internet survey was a neutral survey. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   83. The stimuli Dr. Ford utilized in his survey's test cell were photographs of VIP's \"Bad Spaniels\" dog toy. (Doc. 230-3 at 4.)

In the results of Dr. Ford's survey, over 29% of those in the test cell-who had been shown the \"Bad Spaniels\" product-identified Jack Daniel's in response as to who had made, sponsored, or approved the product pictured. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-30.) By contrast, almost none of those in the control cell-who had been shown the fictitious dog toy-identified Jack Daniel's in response to these questions.

The Court credits and gives prevailing weight to Dr. Ford's conclusion that \"approximately twenty-nine percent...of potential purchasers...are likely to be confused or deceived by the belief that Plaintiff's Bad Spaniels dog toy is made or put out by Jack Daniel's, or made or put out with the authorization or approval of Jack Daniel's, or that whoever makes or puts out Plaintiff's dog toy has a business affiliation or business connection with Jack Daniel's, and that such confusion is due in particular to Plaintiff's use of Jack Daniel's indicia or trade dress on the Bad Spaniels dog toy.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   87.

Therefore, the Court does not credit Dr. Nowlis's generalized objections. Moreover, the Court finds that Dr. Nowlis has never written any articles on trademark surveys, or trademark survey design, or on the issue of likelihood of confusion in trademark law which undercuts his opinions. (Doc. 233-3 at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   92.

Here, VIP intended to produce a dog toy that included and was similar to Jack Daniel's trademarks and trade dress so that its \"Bad Spaniels\" dog toy would call to mind Jack Daniel's Tennessee whiskey. VIP appropriated the Jack Daniel's Trade Dress in every aspect: \"Jack Daniel's\" became \"Bad Spaniels,\" \"Old No. 7\" became \"Old No. 2,\" \"Tennessee whiskey\" became \"Tennessee carpet.\" Meanwhile, the square bottle size and shape, ribbed neck, arched lettering, filigreed border, black-and-white color scheme, fonts, shapes, and styles remain virtually unchanged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   104.

Here, Jack Daniel's asserted trademark and trade dress protection are extremely strong: the Jack Daniel's trademarks have been used continuously for over a century, except during Prohibition (Doc. 234 at 49-52); Jack Daniel's Tennessee whiskey has been the best-selling whiskey in the United States since 1997 (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ); and between 1997 and April 30, 2015, Jack Daniel's whiskey sales in the United States exceeded seventy-five million (75,000,000) cases of various sizes, and resulting revenues exceeded ten billion dollars ($10,000,000,000) (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 50).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   109.

Consumers are not likely to exercise significant care and attention when purchasing the \"Bad Spaniels\" product due to its retail value of approximately $15.

Jack Daniel's merits a permanent injunction in this case. The \"Bad Spaniels\" product has caused a likelihood of confusion and reputational harm.
