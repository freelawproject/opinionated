Plaintiffs allege that the County's 2011 redistricting plan impermissibly dilutes the Latino vote in Kern County and thereby denies Latinos the opportunity to elect representatives of their choice. After the court denied plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment (Doc. No. 79), the action proceeded to an eleven-day bench trial, which concluded on December 19, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   At trial, plaintiffs offered the testimony of three experts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   David Ely, plaintiffs' demography\n   expert, testified that a second majority-Latino supervisorial district in Kern County could have been created in 2011. Dr. Morgan Kousser, plaintiffs' statistical expert, testified regarding the presence of racially polarized voting in Kern County. Finally, Dr. Albert Camarillo, plaintiffs' expert historian, testified about the history of discrimination against Latinos in Kern County and throughout the state of California. In addition, plaintiffs offered the testimony of Dorothy Velazquez, Gary Rodriguez, Dolores Huerta, Sam Ramirez, Leticia Perez, and Allan Krauter. Ms. Velazquez and Mr. Rodriguez are plaintiffs in this action and Latino registered voters of Kern County. Ms. Huerta is a renowned civil rights and labor activist, and a long-time Kern County resident. Mr. Ramirez is a former candidate for Kern County Board of Supervisors representing District 2, and Supervisor Perez is currently on the Board of Supervisors representing District 5, the sole majority-Latino district in Kern County. Mr. Krauter, who was called by plaintiffs as an adverse witness, was a legislative analyst in the Kern County Administrative Office (\"CAO\") at the time of the 2011 redistricting and was primarily responsible for assimilating input, creating the redistricting map options for the Board's consideration, and making recommendations concerning which map should be adopted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At trial, defendants also offered the testimony of three experts. In their testimony, demographer Dr. Douglas Johnson and the County's Planning &amp; Natural Resources Department director Lorelei Oviatt rebutted the feasibility of creating a second majority-Latino supervisorial district in Kern County that would also maintain communities of interest. Defendants' statistical expert Dr. Jonathan Katz testified in rebuttal to plaintiffs' evidence of racially polarized voting in Kern County. Defendants also offered the testimony of Allan Krauter, John Nilon, Michael Gleason, Zack Scrivner, William Maggard, Jonathan McQuiston, Raymond Watson, Alan Christensen, Kimberly Salas, Teresa Hitchcock, and Karen Rhea. Mr. Nilon was the head of the CAO at the time of the 2011 redistricting, overseeing the work of Mr. Krauter. Mr. Gleason, Mr. Scrivner, and Mr. Maggard are all current members of the Kern County Board of Supervisors, representing Districts 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Mr. McQuiston is a former District 1 Supervisor, and Mr. Watson is a former District 4 Supervisor. Mr. Christensen, Ms. Salas, Ms. Hitchcock, and Ms. Rhea are all Kern County employees. Mr. Christensen is currently the Chief Deputy County Administrative Officer, while Ms. Salas works for the Migrant Education Program with the Kern County Superintendent of Schools. Ms. Hitchcock is employed with the Employers' Training Resource Department, and Ms. Rhea works with the Elections Division.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Over the course of the eleven-day trial, the court heard from the roughly two dozen witnesses listed above and admitted over 150 exhibits.

This case arises from the 2011 redrawing of those district boundaries. Pertinent to the analysis that follows is the manner in which the 2011 redistricting plan was adopted. Much of the evidence comes from the testimony of Allan Krauter, who at the time was a legislative analyst in the CAO. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr., Vol. 3, 391:19-392:11.) The County designated Mr. Krauter as the person most knowledgeable about the 2011 redistricting process, as well as the person most knowledgeable regarding use of the County's redistricting software.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 392:12-393:19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   At trial, Mr. Krauter testified at length regarding the factors the County took into account in redrawing the supervisorial map.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, since 1991, in order to comply with the Voting Rights Act, the County has maintained one majority-Latino district. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 501:18-19.) One of Mr. Krauter's goals in redrawing the County's districts in 2011 was to maintain one majority-Latino district, referred to by some County employees as the County's \"Voting Rights Act district,\" which was and remains District 5. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 427:19-24.) Second, Mr. Krauter considered \"compactness, contiguity[,] preservation of geographic boundaries, and other communities of interest.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 398:20-25.) Third, Mr. Krauter attempted to maintain roughly equivalent populations across all five districts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 398:12-16.) Fourth, Mr. Krauter and the County considered input from the community, which was expressed at workshops held across the County. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 398:8-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The 2011 redistricting process was based on the 2010 Census, which was released on March 8, 2010. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 399:20-400:5; JX 6 at 1.) Those census numbers indicated that the County had experienced a population increase of roughly 178,000 residents from 2000 to 2010. (JX 6 at 1.) Moreover, because this population increase did not occur evenly across all five districts, district boundaries needed to be altered somewhat \"to achieve relatively equal representation within the legally acceptable range.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The 2010 Census population number included prisoners, non-citizens, and children, and also included a breakdown of the percentage of the Kern County population that was Hispanic. (Trial Tr., Vol. 3, 401:12-24, 402:9-403:5; JX 6 at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In attempting to draw the 2011 district boundaries in accordance with the factors already discussed, Mr. Krauter employed map-drawing software known as Maptitude. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 405:2-7.) Maptitude contained the 2010 Census data, as well as the County district boundaries that had been in place since 2001. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 405:8-19.) The Maptitude program was able to distinguish between Latino and non-Latino residents, as well as between residents who were of voting age and those who were not. Notably, however, according to Mr. Krauter, the data contained in Maptitude was unable to load citizenship data available through the American Community Survey (\"ACS\"), an annual survey administered by the Census Bureau that collects demographic information, including age, income, education, and citizenship, from a sample of the population. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 405:20-406:21; Trial Tr., Vol. 1, 61:17-62:17.) Mr. Krauter attempted to add ACS citizenship data to Maptitude, but was ultimately unsuccessful. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 482:3-17.) For this reason, Maptitude as employed by Mr. Krauter was unable to calculate the citizen voting age population (\"CVAP\") of the County or any of the supervisorial districts therein.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 440:10-16.) Instead, Mr. Krauter merely estimated that across the County, the Latino\n   CVAP was roughly 20 percent lower than the Latino voting age population. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 440:20-441:8.) Thus, Mr. Krauter was forced to rely on these rough estimates of the Latino CVAP in each district, conceding at trial that he was unable to determine the number with precision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 441:9-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Using Maptitude, as well as a presentation he prepared, Mr. Krauter conducted a series of public workshops in various locations across the County to solicit public input in generating various redistricting maps. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 394:25-395:6, 408:5-414:11; JX 4 at 4-5.) Use of Maptitude at these workshops allowed Mr. Krauter to instantly generate multiple permutations of potential district maps (referred to as \"Options\") based upon feedback he received from those in attendance at these workshops. (Trial Tr., Vol. 3, 490:21-491:4.) In preparation for the workshops, Mr. Krauter began by creating Option 1 as a \"rough draft exercise,\" which made the absolute minimum changes necessary to bring the existing supervisorial map into compliance with equal population requirements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 444:14-18, 466:18-24; DX 504 at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Several of these workshops were held in the eastern part of the County, and included workshops in Boron, Ridgecrest, and Inyokern. (JX 4 at 4.) At the meetings held in eastern Kern County, Mr. Krauter observed that the majority of attendees expressed support for maintaining two separate supervisorial districts in the eastern part of the County, one covering the northeastern portion and another covering the southeastern portion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Trial Tr., Vol. 3, 409:22-410:6.) Mr. Krauter explained that Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake is located in northeastern Kern County, while Edwards Air Force Base is located in southeastern Kern County. (Trial Tr., Vol. 3, 410:2-13.) Although both are active military bases, the comments from attendees at the public workshops in eastern Kern County suggested that these bases \"have different missions,\" and that the residents of the area were \"fiercely devoted to their corner of Kern County.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It was therefore generally the preference of those attending workshops in eastern Kern County to maintain two districts in the east. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 444:8-21.) Accordingly, most of the attendees at the workshops in eastern Kern County expressed support for Option 1, which maintained such a configuration with little change. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   JX 4 at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Mr. Krauter also conducted a public workshop in Oildale, near Bakersfield. (Trial Tr., Vol. 3, 410:14-16.) The consensus expressed at this workshop, according to Mr. Krauter, was that the Oildale residents did not want Oildale divided up between multiple districts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 410:17-21.) They also no longer wanted to be represented by someone from Ridgecrest, located in northeast Kern, because of a belief that they received lower quality county services as a result. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 410:22-411:3.) Options 2, 3, and 4 were, therefore, all drawn by Mr. Krauter in a way that unified Oildale. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 411:4-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Mr. Krauter also conducted a workshop in Shafter, in northwestern Kern County. (JX 4 at 5.) Mr. Krauter testified that the opinions expressed there were strongly in favor of creating a \"westside district\" that did not include any portions of eastern Kern County. (Trial Tr., Vol. 3, 411:22-23.) This new district would, according to its proponents, include Shafter, Delano, McFarland, and Wasco. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 411:23-25.) Such a map was reflected in Option 5 created by Mr. Krauter in response to this input. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JX 4 at 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Mr. Krauter's final public workshop was held in Bakersfield. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) Opinions at this meeting were apparently more divided because some attendees supported Option 5, while others opposed it because it separated Oildale into multiple districts. (Trial\n   Tr., Vol. 3, 412:7-25.) In response to these concerns, Mr. Krauter created Option 6, with the goal of unifying the towns of Delano, Shafter, Wasco, McFarland, Lost Hills, and Buttonwillow, while also preserving two separate districts in eastern Kern County. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 413:9-414:11; 479:1-480:2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Kern County advertised the public workshops through radio, print, and television news media, including Spanish language media outlets, and also reached out to \"service clubs\" in outlying towns, requesting that they circulate the news release about the workshops to their members. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 463:15-464:4, 465:13-466:7.) The evidence at trial established that the public attendance at the workshops put on by County staff with respect to the 2011 redistricting process varied widely. At some workshops-such as in Inyokern, Tehachapi, East Bakersfield, Taft, and South Bakersfield-no more than two people attended. (JX 4 at 4-5.) At the workshops offered in California City, Arvin, Delano, and McFarland, no residents attended. (Trial Tr., Vol. 3, 512:24-513:25.) Other workshops saw more robust attendance, with 40 individuals attending the workshop in Mojave, located in southeastern Kern County. (JX 4 at 4-5.) Of the sixteen workshops conducted by Mr. Krauter, only 126 individuals attended in total, out of a total county population of more than 839,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5; JX 6 at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Following these public workshops, Mr. Krauter participated in hearings before the Board of Supervisors, at which members of the public were permitted to discuss the Options he had developed. Initially, Mr. Krauter presented the Board with Options 1 through 5. (Trial Tr., Vol. 3, 484:22-485:2.) However, in response to \"overwhelming\" testimony against Option 5 at a public hearing before the Board on July 5, 2011, Option 5 was withdrawn from consideration and replaced with Option 6. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 485:3-7.) Option 6 united Delano, Shafter, Wasco, McFarland, Lost Hills, and Buttonwillow into a westside district, while still preserving two eastside districts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 412:11-414:11.) Following the July 5, 2011 public hearing, it became clear to County Administrative Officer John Nilon that none of these options had the support of a majority of the Kern County Board of Supervisors. (Trial Tr., Vol. 7, 1078:4-24.) Accordingly, sometime following that meeting, Mr. Nilon instructed Mr. Krauter to draft an Option 7 that would be acceptable to the Board. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Trial Tr., Vol. 3, 425:22-426:2.) Pursuant to this direction, Mr. Krauter created Option 7, which was intended to modify the existing districts as little as possible, while depopulating District 4 to the extent necessary in light of anticipated population growth. (Trial Tr., Vol. 3, 437:13-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   At a hearing before the Board on August 2, 2011, Steven Ochoa, the National Redistricting Coordinator for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund (\"MALDEF\"), proposed redistricting that would include a second majority-Latino district. (Trial Tr., Vol. 3, 485:23-486:3; JX 27 at 16-18.) Mr. Ochoa presented the Board a new map (the \"MALDEF Map\") that could serve as the basis for drawing the district boundaries so as to create a second majority-Latino district. (Trial Tr., Vol. 3, 487:5-18; PX 204.) Because of these new proposals (i.e., Option 7 and the MALDEF Map), multiple attendees at the August 2, 2011 Board hearing spoke and requested that the Board delay voting on the redistricting options in order to further study the issue. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , JX 27 at 16, 26, 27.) Nonetheless, the Board rejected the requests for further study of the newly presented options, instead voted to adopt the new Option 7 as an introduced ordinance, and slated it for formal adoption at a public hearing one week later. (JX 27 at 58-60; Trial Tr., Vol. 3, 453:19-454:9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Following the August 2, 2011 hearing, and using the MALDEF proposed map as a starting point, Mr. Krauter attempted to draw a map containing a second majority-Latino district, but, after devoting five hours to the project, was ultimately unable to do so. (Trial Tr., Vol. 3, 440:3-9, 487:19-24, 489:1-7.) Mr. Krauter explained that much of his difficulty at the time was due to the fact that the MALDEF Map had included roughly 18,000 prisoners in its calculation of equal population distribution among the five districts, while Kern County does not include prisoners in its calculations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 488:1-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   After Option 7 was created by Mr. Krauter at Mr. Nilon's direction, but prior to the final vote by the Board, Kern County Counsel determined that Options 3 and 6 were not viable because those maps dropped the Latino CVAP in District 5 below 50 percent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 428:24-429:10.) Mr. Krauter was unaware of the methodology employed by County Counsel in reaching this conclusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 510:25-512:1.) As described above, because Mr. Krauter could not load citizenship data into Maptitude, he was unable to confirm County Counsel's conclusions. Invoking attorney-client privilege, defendants presented no evidence at trial regarding the methodology employed by County Counsel in determining the CVAP district by district with respect to any of the options or redistricting proposals, nor any explanation as to why CVAP percentages were never provided to Mr. Krauter despite their apparent relevance to his assignment of fashioning new district boundaries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   At a public Board hearing the following week, on August 9, 2011, members of the public in attendance again urged the Board to delay its final vote on the district boundaries. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , JX 30 at 24, 29-31, 34, 38.) Instead, the Board voted to formally adopt Option 7 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \"Adopted Map\" below), which had not been created until after the public workshops had all been held, maintained two eastern districts, and preserved the one majority-Latino district. (PX 201 at 5; JX 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiffs initiated this action on April 22, 2016, alleging that the redistricting plan adopted by Kern County in 2011 unlawfully fractured a second Latino voting community between two supervisorial districts. Plaintiffs argue that the 2011 redistricting plan dilutes the strength of Latino voters by depriving them of a second district in which they would constitute a majority of eligible voters and from which they could elect a candidate of their choice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendants contend that, based on population data and public testimony, Kern County was under no legal obligation in 2011 to create a second majority-Latino district. Defendants deny that a supervisorial district map could have been drawn in 2011 that created two majority-minority districts, each with a compact and politically cohesive Latino population, and which did not violate traditional redistricting criteria. Defendants further argue that this court should deny relief under well-known principles of equity, including the doctrine of laches, given that the County must redraw its districting lines in 2021 in any event in accordance with the 2020 Census. Against this background, the court will address the legal standards applicable to plaintiffs' claim as well as the court's findings based upon the evidence presented at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Gingles\n    </em>\n    I-Latino Numerosity and Compactness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The first\n   <em>\n    Gingles\n   </em>\n   precondition requires a showing that the Latino voting population in Kern County is both sufficiently large and geographically compact so as to constitute a numerical majority in a second single-member supervisorial district.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gingles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203777\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/30/#p47\">\n    478 U.S. at 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203777\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/30/#p47\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Ely, and which they contend establish that a second majority-Latino supervisorial district in Kern County was clearly possible in 2011. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Illustrative Map 1\" and \"Illustrative Map 2\" below; PX 103 at 2-3.) In drawing the Illustrative Maps, Mr. Ely used data from the 2010 decennial census for total population and voting age population by race and ethnicity, and data from the 2005-2009 and 2011-2014 ACS Special Tabulations for citizen voting age population. (Trial Tr., Vol. 1, 57:3-21.) Mr. Ely drew the Illustrative Maps in accordance with the traditional redistricting criteria of equal population and contiguity, with reference to underlying topography as well as state legislative and congressional districts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 67:18-23, Trial Tr., Vol. 2, 102:5-103:21.) Although Mr. Ely did not rely upon socioeconomic data to draw the two Illustrative Maps initially, he did consult socioeconomic data after the fact to confirm that the illustrative districts reflected similar socioeconomic characteristics, including educational attainment, income, homeownership, immigration status, and Spanish language ability. (Trial Tr., Vol. 2, 132:22-133:5; PX 110.) Below, the court will address the specific characteristics of plaintiffs' two illustrative maps individually.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Illustrative Map 1\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Illustrative Map 1 modifies the County's 2011 Adopted Map in three notable ways. First, it adjusts the boundaries of District 5, while still maintaining it as a majority-Latino district. Second, it combines cities in northwestern Kern County with the City of Arvin and areas immediately south of Bakersfield to create a second majority-Latino district (\"Illustrative District 1\").

(Trial Tr., Vol. 1, 79:12-25; PX 106 at 2.) Specifically, Latinos would comprise 53.2 percent of the CVAP in District 1, and 54.5 percent of the CVAP in District 5. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Illustrative Districts\" Table below.) Although defendants' demography expert Dr. Douglas Johnson produced slightly different CVAP estimates, even Dr. Johnson's estimates similarly show that Latino voting age citizens would constitute a numerical majority in Districts 1 and 5 of Illustrative Map 1. (Trial Tr., Vol. 9, 1499:24-1500:6; DX 565 at 26.) In fact, Dr. Johnson's estimates of Latino CVAP in Districts 1 and 5, using the 2009 Special Tabulation data, were marginally higher than those of Mr. Ely.

(Trial Tr., Vol. 2, 132:22-133:5; PX 110.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiffs also presented testimony at trial from various lay witnesses that Latinos in Illustrative District 1 share a historical and present-day connection to\n   farmworker and immigrant communities. Consequently, Latinos across Illustrative District 1 face similar issues with respect to immigration (Trial Tr., Vol. 2, 233:19-234:6, 235:10-236:22 (testimony of Dolores Huerta regarding fear of deportation);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 261:21-263:24 (testimony of Dorothy Velazquez regarding the same) ), language (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 234:7-235:9 (testimony of Dolores Huerta regarding an English-only resolution proposed by the Bakersfield City Council) ), and educational disparities (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 237:23-239:13 (testimony of Dolores Huerta regarding the \"school-to-prison pipeline\"); Trial Tr., Vol. 5, 793:7-794:2 (testimony of Supervisor Leticia Perez regarding the literacy, educational, and skills gap among Latino students in Kern County) ). Ms. Huerta further testified that farmworkers travel seasonally between Arvin and the northwestern Kern communities based on the available crops and labor needs. (Trial Tr., Vol. 2, 240:7-16.) District 5 Supervisor Leticia Perez testified that Latinos in the northern Kern communities are indistinguishable from the Latinos in Arvin, and that these communities share the same history, origin, culture, and socioeconomic indices. (Trial Tr., Vol. 5, 795:2-796:12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiffs also presented evidence of shared concerns in Illustrative District 1 with respect to economic development, air and water pollution, and environmental concerns including those surrounding the issue of hydraulic fracturing. (Trial Tr., Vol. 2, 280:8-287:10.) Supervisor Perez testified that constituents from Delano, Shafter, Arvin, and Lamont have the most in common in terms of infrastructure issues, and that constituents from those communities appear before the Board of Supervisors every budget cycle calling on Supervisor Perez and District 1 Supervisor Mick Gleason to address flooding and other infrastructure challenges in their communities. (Trial Tr., Vol. 5, 788:1-789:10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Defendants' demography expert Dr. Douglas Johnson criticized the configuration of District 1 as it appears in plaintiffs' Illustrative Map 1, which \"hooks\" around Bakersfield to unite territory south of Bakersfield with the northern communities of Delano, Shafter, Wasco, and MacFarland. (Trial Tr., Vol. 9, 1455:1-6.) Dr. Johnson conceded on cross-examination, however, that these communities have shared the same state legislative and congressional districts since 1991, and that this is a factor that could be considered from a traditional redistricting perspective. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1523:16-1528:14.) Indeed, the court notes that the maps of state legislative and congressional districts share the same \"hook\" configuration as Illustrative District 1 in plaintiffs' Illustrative Map 1 which Dr. Johnson criticized. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX 103 at 2; PX 116-18.) The court therefore concludes that the existence of the \"hook\" in District 1 of plaintiffs' Illustrative Map 1 does not, on its face, divide communities of interest, and in fact comports with the communities of interest contemplated by other district boundaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The court also finds that the configuration depicted in plaintiffs' Illustrative Map 1 is distinguishable from the illustrative district rejected in\n   <em>\n    LULAC\n   </em>\n   , where the Supreme Court determined that a newly-drawn majority-Latino congressional district, which included a 300-mile gap between two major Latino communities, was not compact.\n   <em>\n    LULAC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500400\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/399/#p433\">\n    548 U.S. at 432-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500400\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/399/#p433\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    LULAC\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that \"the enormous geographical distance separating [two minority populations], coupled with the disparate needs and interests of these populations-not either factor alone,\" rendered that district non-compact for \u00a7 2 purposes.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500400\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/399/#p433\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500400\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/399/#p433\">\n    at 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500400\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/399/#p433\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, Mr. Ely testified that the distance between Arvin and Delano was roughly 55 miles, far less than the distance at issue in\n   <em>\n    LULAC.\n   </em>\n   (Trial Tr.,\n   Vol. 2, 164:18-165:9.) Moreover, as summarized above, several witnesses testified credibly regarding the shared communities of interest among Latinos in Arvin and northern Kern County. The court concludes that the inadequacies of the district boundaries identified in\n   <em>\n    LULAC\n   </em>\n   are simply not present here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Defendants challenge plaintiffs' representation that Illustrative Map 1 more effectively groups communities of interest. In this regard, at trial, defendants presented various witnesses who testified to the differing communities of interest grouped in plaintiffs' illustrative districts. Most notably, defendants' expert witness Lorelei Oviatt, director of the Kern County Planning &amp; Natural Resources Department, testified at great length about communities of interest throughout each of the current supervisorial districts, including communities of interest related to oilfields, highways, public transit, commercial developments, crops, and environmental concerns. (Trial Tr., Vol. 7, 1135:1-1147:10, 1190:20-1226:7.) The court will not recount each of these communities of interest in detail. However, the overall import of Ms. Oviatt's testimony is that each Kern County supervisorial district has at least\n   <em>\n    something\n   </em>\n   in common with every other. This is hardly surprising in the context of a single county. Defendants argue that plaintiffs' assertion of the communities of interest reflected in District 1 of their Illustrative Map 1 are really concerns that are shared county-wide, and that plaintiffs therefore have not proven that they are entitled to their own separate district. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr., Vol. 11, 1795:3-8.) Yet the first\n   <em>\n    Gingles\n   </em>\n   precondition does not require plaintiffs to show that they are entitled to their own district because of unique communities of interest, but only that it is possible to draw an alternative map that maintains communities of interest. Even if plaintiffs were required to identify communities of interest unique to Latinos in Kern County, they have met that higher burden with evidence of shared concerns among Latinos in the areas of immigration, language, culture, and persistent socioeconomic disparities, which evidence was not rebutted by defendants. Plaintiffs are moreover not required to accommodate every conceivable community of interest in Kern County in order to draw a sufficient illustrative map that satisfies the first\n   <em>\n    Gingles\n   </em>\n   precondition. Certainly, the County itself did not attempt to do so in its own redistricting efforts: Mr. Krauter testified that, when drawing the map options for the 2011 redistricting process, he did not consider oilfields, commercial developments, public transit, tourism, or other local considerations aside from what residents raised at the redistricting workshops. (Trial Tr., Vol. 3, 445:7-447:23.) The court finds no logical or legal basis to impose such a requirement on plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Defendants further emphasize the absence during the 2011 redistricting process of any public comment by Kern County residents requesting that Arvin be joined with the communities in northern Kern County. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr., Vol. 3, 483:22-25; 485:11-14.) Defendants contend that the absence of any such suggestion indicates that Arvin does not share a community of interest with the Latino communities in northern Kern County, and that plaintiffs' arguments to the contrary are simply post hoc justifications for Illustrative Map 1. This argument is unpersuasive. First, the court notes that plaintiffs presented evidence that the unification of the Latino communities proposed in Illustrative Map 1 was not invented for the purposes of this litigation. Dolores Huerta testified that there was discussion during the 2011 Lamont redistricting workshop about including Oildale or Arvin with the northern Kern communities to create a second majority-Latino district. (Trial Tr., Vol. 2, 222:12-25.) Plaintiffs also introduced evidence that, as early as 1991, the Kern\n   County Latino Redistricting Coalition proposed a district that \"would include the Delano/McFarland area, the Shafter/Wasco Area, Lost Hills, Button Willow [sic], a minor portion of East Bakersfield, Arvin and Lamont.\" (JX 12 at 37-40.) In any event, the court would note that the small number of Kern County residents who attended either the public workshops or the public hearings on redistricting diminishes any significance the claimed lack of public suggestion could have.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Second, even if there was an absence of specific public comment suggesting the precise configurations proposed in plaintiffs' Illustrative Map 1, the court rejects the notion that it is the obligation of County residents to propose where districting lines should be drawn. At the public hearings before the Board of Supervisors on August 2 and August 9, 2011, several members of the public spoke in favor of the creation of a second majority-Latino district. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JX 27 at 16-18, 30-32; JX 30 at 23-31, 37-38.) Simply because these citizens did not identify which specific communities should be included within the second majority-Latino district does not negate a showing of a community of interest among Latinos in Kern County, especially in light of the evidence presented by plaintiffs at trial. The court therefore finds that plaintiffs' Illustrative Map 1 preserves communities of interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Connectedness\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   One factor that Mr. Ely considered in constructing Illustrative Map 1 is what he referred to as \"connectedness,\" or residents' ability to easily interact with one another. (Trial Tr., Vol. 2, 174:19-25.) Mr. Ely testified that all communities in Kern County have connections to Bakersfield, but two communities-one in northern Kern County and another in eastern Kern County-are internally connected by highways and public transit without the need to pass through Bakersfield. (Trial Tr., Vol. 1, 82:7-21.) Mr. Ely observed that the County's 2011 Adopted Map splits each of these two communities into different districts and combines each with dissimilar communities apparently in order to meet the population requirements. (PX 112 at \u00b6\u00b6 9-12.) In contrast, plaintiffs' Illustrative Map 1 keeps the northern and eastern Kern County communities intact in their own respective districts, combining each with small communities with similar shared interests. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   As defendants' expert Dr. Johnson points out, plaintiffs' Illustrative Map 1 does separate Arvin from the nearby communities of Lamont and Weedpatch. (Trial Tr., Vol. 9, 1549:6-12; DX 558 at \u00b6 52.) Mr. Ely acknowledged that Arvin is well connected to both Lamont and Weedpatch, but opined that there is, nonetheless, a sufficiently large community of interest among Latinos in Kern County to comprise the majority in two supervisorial districts. (Trial Tr., Vol. 2, 179:1-16.) Therefore, according to Mr. Ely, the boundary line separating Arvin from Lamont could be drawn in many different ways and still maintain majority-Latino CVAP in two districts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The court concludes that plaintiffs' Illustrative Map 1 respects the principle of connectedness as defined by Mr. Ely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Preservation of Kern County's Preexisting Majority-Latino District\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The parties' experts present slightly different Latino CVAP estimates for each of the supervisorial districts as they appear under plaintiffs' Illustrative Map 1. There is no dispute, however, that District 5,\n   Kern County's preexisting majority-Latino district, remains a majority-Latino district under Illustrative Map 1, with a 54.5 percent Latino CVAP according to Mr. Ely's estimates. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Illustrative Districts\" Table above.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   d.\n   <em>\n    Preservation of Two Eastern Districts and Minimizing Change\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Lastly, in assessing plaintiffs' showing of compactness, the court considers two additional districting principles specific to Kern County: the desire to retain two supervisorial districts in eastern Kern County and to avoid dramatic change in drawing new boundaries. Since at least 1981, the eastern half of Kern County has been represented by two supervisors. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX 210; PX 236; Trial Tr., Vol. 7, 1071:4-23.) Mr. Krauter testified at trial that during the 2011 redistricting process, a number of eastern Kern County residents expressed concerns that it would be extremely difficult for one supervisor to adequately represent the entirety of eastern Kern County. (Trial Tr., Vol. 3, 409:22-410:13.) Plaintiffs' Illustrative Map 1, however, creates one eastern district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Defendants also argue that Kern County has for decades adhered to a broader principle that new district maps should maintain the core of existing districts and minimize changes. (DX 565 at \u00b6 19; Trial Tr., Vol. 9, 1466:6-1467:15.) These principles, defendants contend, help preserve relationships between elected officials and their constituents over time. (Trial Tr., Vol. 9, 1466:6-1467:15.) According to defendants' expert Dr. Johnson, plaintiffs' Illustrative Map 1 would move 42 percent of Kern residents into new supervisorial districts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1462:11-1463:3; DX 565 at \u00b6 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   These points, raised by defendants, are valid and worthy of consideration. On the one hand, it has been long recognized that local legislative bodies-rather than federal courts-play the primary role in fashioning reapportionment plans.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bush v.

The County's local districting preferences are certainly relevant. However, to the extent the County desires to leave existing district boundaries as unchanged as possible, this principle cannot effectively override any finding of \u00a7 2 liability, especially where such a principle is inescapably linked to the fragmentation of the Latino population. The court finds that Kern County's preferences in these regards are, therefore, better and more properly addressed at the remedial stage of this litigation, if plaintiffs establish a violation of \u00a7 2.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4044737\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/964/686/#p745\">\n    964 F.Supp.2d at 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Under this scheme, the ultimate viability and effectiveness of a remedy is considered at the remedial stage of litigation and not during analysis of the\n   <em>\n    Gingles\n   </em>\n   preconditions.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4342765\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/40/1377/#p1399\">\n    40 F.Supp.3d at 1400-01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   For all of the reasons set forth above, the court concludes that plaintiffs have satisfied their burden of showing that, under their Illustrative Map 1, the Latino population in Kern County is sufficiently numerous and geographically compact for Latinos to form an effective voting majority in a second supervisorial district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Illustrative Map 2\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The court now turns to plaintiffs' Illustrative Map 2. In developing Illustrative Map 2, Mr. Ely sought to maintain the existing districting scheme as much as possible. (Trial Tr., Vol. 1, 86:21-87:11.) Illustrative Map 2 shifts existing District 1 to the western side of the County, excluding the eastern communities of Ridgecrest and Lake Isabella, while extending the northern boundary of District 2 to capture these communities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; PX 103 at 3.) Illustrative District 1 in this map constitutes a second majority-Latino district by combining cities in northwestern Kern County with unincorporated areas of East Bakersfield (hereinafter \"East Bakersfield\"). (Trial Tr., Vol. 2, 147:25-149:13 (describing the boundaries of East Bakersfield).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   i.\n   <em>\n    Numerosity\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Under Illustrative Map 2, and using data from the 2009 Special Tabulation, the Latino CVAP would constitute a numerical majority in Districts 1 and 5. (Trial Tr., Vol. 1, 84:5-85:3; PX 106 at 3.) Latinos would comprise 51.6 percent and 52 percent of the CVAP in District 1 and District 5, respectively. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \"Option 2 Districts\" Table below.) Defendants' expert Dr. Johnson again generated slightly different CVAP estimates, but did not dispute that Latino voting age citizens would constitute a numerical majority in Districts 1 and 5 of Illustrative Map 2. (DX 565 at 27.) Dr. Johnson's estimates of Latino CVAP in Districts 1 and 5, using the 2009 Special Tabulation data, were again marginally higher than those of plaintiffs' expert, Mr. Ely. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4342765\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/40/1377/#p1399\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (estimating 53 percent Latino CVAP in District 1 and 52 percent Latino CVAP in District 5 under Illustrative Map 2).)

(Trial Tr., Vol. 2, 132:22-133:5; PX 110.) Plaintiffs also introduced evidence of the major employment sectors shared among East Bakersfield, Delano, McFarland, Shafter and Wasco: the largest industries in each of these communities are agriculture and education, health, and social services. (PX 123 at 1.) In addition, plaintiffs presented testimony from Ms. Huerta, who opined that the northwestern communities of Kern County shared a community of interest with East Bakersfield because of the large number of farmworkers residing in East Bakersfield, who travel seasonally between the two areas for work. (Trial Tr., Vol. 2, 242:4-16.) Ms. Huerta further testified that residents of the northwestern Kern communities interact with the residents in East Bakersfield through various cultural festivals celebrating Latino food and music. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 242:23-243:8.) Moreover, Supervisor Perez reiterated in her testimony that the Latino populations in northern Kern and East Bakersfield are \"completely indistinguishable,\" and that \"every issue imaginable\" is shared equally between these populations. (Trial Tr., Vol. 5, 796:13-797:15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Defendants offered little compelling evidence at trial suggesting that East Bakersfield would be an inappropriate fit with the northern Kern communities under plaintiffs' Illustrative Map 2. Ms. Oviatt, the director of the Kern County Planning and Natural Resources Department, testified\n   that although 16 percent, a \"healthy portion,\" of East Bakersfield's population works in agriculture, this percentage is not comparable to that of other northern cities, where the portion is 34 percent or more. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr., Vol. 7, 1204:5-1205:7.) District 3 Supervisor Mike Maggard, who currently represents East Bakersfield, expressed the opinion that East Bakersfield and Delano are significantly different communities because they are roughly 30 miles apart, and Delano is the second largest incorporated city in Kern County while only parts of East Bakersfield are incorporated. (Trial Tr., Vol. 8, 1306:12-1307:8.) Kim Salas, an employee with the Kern County Superintendent of Schools, similarly disapproved of linking East Bakersfield with Delano on the basis that East Bakersfield is an urban area while the outlying areas are more rural. (Trial Tr., Vol. 8, 1406:3-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The evidence presented by defendants would seem to suggest that any identifiable difference, no matter how small, between the communities grouped in plaintiffs' Illustrative Map 2 negates a showing of a community of interest. This court concludes that plaintiffs' burden under\n   <em>\n    Gingles\n   </em>\n   prong one is not and cannot be one that requires plaintiffs to establish there are no identifiable differences between the communities joined in their illustrative map. It is simply too easy to identify at least some differences between any two communities, because no one community is exactly the same as another. The testimony offered by Ms. Oviatt and Supervisor Maggard does not disprove the notion that the communities appearing in District 1 of plaintiffs' Illustrative Map 2 undoubtedly have significant shared interests. Moreover, the supposed urban/rural incompatibility identified by Ms. Salas in her trial testimony is directly at odds with the County's own purported preference to combine both urban and rural areas into a single district. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Trial Tr., Vol. 7, 1169:1-1170:12 (testimony of Zack Scrivner regarding the County's practice of having each supervisorial district take a portion of urban Bakersfield to avoid concentration of power in Bakersfield); Trial Tr., Vol. 10, 1600:3-1601:1 (testimony of Mick Gleason regarding the same).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Defendants once again note the alleged absence during the 2011 redistricting process of any public comment by Kern County residents suggesting that East Bakersfield be joined with the communities in northern Kern. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr., Vol. 3, 483:18-484:5.) Defendants contend that the absence of such a suggestion by members of the public indicates that East Bakersfield does not share a community of interest with the Latino communities in northern Kern, and that any proposal to the contrary is plaintiffs' post-hoc justification for their Illustrative Map 2. This argument is unavailing for the reasons already articulated by the court above. Moreover, the possibility of a community of interest between East Bakersfield and the northern Kern County communities was in fact suggested in 2011: Mr. Krauter testified at trial that the redistricting map put forth by MALDEF at the August 2, 2011 hearing before the Board of Supervisors created a northern district that dipped into East Bakersfield. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr., Vol. 3, 486:4-25.) Even if such evidence had not been introduced at trial, public comment can hardly be considered an exhaustive accounting of what communities of interest exist, particularly where, as here, public comment from certain Kern County communities was clearly scant. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JX 4 at 4-5 (summary of redistricting workshops, indicating that one person attended the East Bakersfield workshop).) Accordingly, the court concludes that plaintiffs' Illustrative Map 2 preserves communities of interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Connectedness\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The analysis of Mr. Ely's \"connectedness\" principle applies with equal force to\n   plaintiffs' Illustrative Map 2 as with Illustrative Map 1. Illustrative Map 2 similarly maintains in separate districts the communities in northern Kern County and eastern Kern County, which are internally connected by highways and public transit that need not pass through Bakersfield. The County's 2011 Adopted Map, as Mr. Ely noted, splits each of these two communities into different districts, and combines each with dissimilar communities to meet population requirements. Accordingly, Mr. Ely credibly opined that plaintiffs' Illustrative Map 2 better complies with the principle of connectedness than the Adopted Map. The court finds that Illustrative Map 2 respects the principle of connectedness as defined by Mr. Ely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Preservation of Kern County's Preexisting Majority-Latino District\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Again, the parties' experts present slightly different Latino CVAP estimates for each of the districts under Illustrative Map 2, but there is no dispute that District 5 remains a majority-Latino district under plaintiffs' Illustrative Map 2, with a 52 percent Latino CVAP according to Mr. Ely's estimates.

Given Kern County's size and geographical makeup, the court believes that it would be impossible to create a map that perfectly reflected distinct communities of interest, and yet still satisfied equal population requirements and all other traditional redistricting principles.

(Trial Tr., Vol. 8, 1334:16-1335:5.) HPA requires no statistical inferences: in homogeneous Latino precincts, whatever percentage of the vote a candidate receives represents the percentage of Latinos who voted for that candidate. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. Vol. 4, 544:11-545:14.) Likewise, in homogeneous white precincts, the percentage of the vote a candidate receives represents the percentage of whites who voted for that candidate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Because precincts, of course, are usually not perfectly segregated by race, statisticians have employed other methodologies to estimate individual voting behavior in precincts with heterogeneous racial populations. In 1959, statistician Leo Goodman introduced ecological regression (\"ER\"), which remains widely used by social scientists and political scientists to estimate group-wide voting behavior. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 564:8-16.) ER takes precinct-level election results and correlates those figures with the racial or ethnic composition of the electorate. ER plots the vote percentage in each precinct for a Latino candidate against the percentage of Latino voters, and calculates the line of best fit through all those points-that is, the line that minimizes the distance between the line and each of the plot points. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 554:7-17.) The line can be extrapolated in each direction to estimate how precincts that are 100 percent Latino or 100 percent non-Latino would have voted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 555:2-15). ER has two major deficiencies, however. First, it sometimes produces estimates that are less than 0 percent or greater than 100 percent. (PX 136 at \u00b6 20.) Second, it does not take advantage of \"bounds\" information, which puts some limits on possible voting behavior based on the minimum and maximum percentage of votes a candidate could have received. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 22-27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Ecological inference (\"EI\"), developed by political scientist Gary King in 1997, seeks to overcome some of the shortcomings of ER, and is \"similar to, but largely regarded as an improvement upon\" the ER methodology endorsed in\n   <em>\n    Gingles.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hall v.

To do so, he examined 22 non-partisan\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   elections involving Latinos candidates in Kern County from 2004 to 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 2.) Latinos were identified by their Spanish surnames, based on a list originally compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau and used in California for several decades to match lists of registered voters and those who turned out at the polls. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15 &amp; n.8.) Dr. Kousser concluded that of the 22 elections he analyzed in Kern County, 19 were racially polarized to a statistically significant degree.

Under all three methodologies employed by Dr. Kousser-unweighted ER, weighted ER, and EI-Moreno received over 80 percent of the Latino vote, but only about 13 percent of the non-Hispanic white and black vote.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (PX 137 at Table V-1.) Dr. Kousser concluded that the 2004 District 4 election was racially polarized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Dr. Kousser next analyzed the 2010 primary and runoff elections for District 2 Supervisor. Zack Scrivner was the Latino-preferred candidate, garnering 43 percent, the plurality, of the Latino vote using EI, while garnering over 70 percent of the Latino vote using weighted ER. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Table V-2.) In what Dr. Kousser described as an anomaly in Kern County, the Latino candidate Steve Perez polled better with non-Latino voters in the primary election, receiving nearly 30 percent of the non-Hispanic white and black vote under all three methodologies. (PX 136 at \u00b6 32; PX 137 at Table V-2.) Dr. Kousser concluded that the 2010 primary election for District 2 Supervisor was polarized, but in the opposite direction as would be expected, that is, with Latino voters favoring the non-Latino candidate, and non-Hispanic white and black voters favoring the Latino candidate. (PX 136 at \u00b6 32.) In the 2010 runoff election between Zack Scrivner and Steve Perez, the two candidates split the Latino vote and non-Hispanic white and black vote fairly evenly. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; PX 137 at Table V-3.) Dr. Kousser therefore concluded that the runoff election was not racially polarized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   In the 2012 primary election for District 1 Supervisor, with eight candidates in the race, Latino candidate Sam Ramirez received approximately two-thirds of the Latino\n   vote, but only 1-2 percent of the non-Hispanic white and black vote. (PX 136 at \u00b6 33; PX 137 at Table V-4.) Finally, in the 2012 election for District 5 Supervisor, Latino candidate Leticia Perez approximately 80 percent of the Latino vote under all three methods of estimation, but only about one-third of the non-Hispanic white and black vote. (PX 136 at \u00b6 34; PX 137 at Table V-5.) Dr. Kousser concluded that the 2012 elections for District 1 and District 5 supervisor were both racially polarized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   In sum, Dr. Kousser concluded that Latino voters cohered around a particular candidate in four of the five endogenous Kern County elections that he analyzed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   ii.\n   <em>\n    Exogenous Elections\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Exogenous elections-contests for any other office aside from the Kern County Board of Supervisors-may also be considered in assessing racial polarization, though they are not as probative as endogenous elections as to whether the minority group is politically cohesive.\n   <em>\n    Montes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4342765\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/40/1377/#p1399\">\n    40 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1401-02 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Of these seventeen, four were local elections, while the remaining thirteen were statewide elections in which Dr. Kousser analyzed only the Kern County voting results. (PX 136 at \u00b6\u00b6 35, 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The four local elections Dr. Kousser examined were a 2006 Sheriff's race, a 2010 runoff for the Board of Education, a 2012 election for Kern County Community College Board, and a 2014 election for Assessor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35.) In the 2006 Sheriff's race, Latino candidate Chevy Garza received about half of the Latino vote, even in a seven-person contest, but only about 10 percent of the non-Hispanic white and black vote. (PX 137 at Table VI-1.) In the 2010 Board of Education runoff, Latino candidate Marco Flores garnered roughly 80 percent of the Latino vote, but less than 20 percent of the non-Hispanic white and black vote. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Table VI-2.) The 2014 election for Assessor had a clear Latino-preferred candidate, with Lupe Esquivias receiving approximately two-thirds of the Latino vote, but only 6 percent of the non-Hispanic white and black vote. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Table VI-4.) By contrast, the 2012 race for Kern County Community College Board did not appear to have a Latino-preferred candidate, as Latinos cast votes in roughly equal percentages for candidates Marco Flores and Ruben Hill. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Table VI-3.) Dr. Kousser concluded that all but the 2012 race for Kern County Community College Board were racially polarized. (PX 137 at Table R-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Dr. Kousser next analyzed thirteen statewide contests that took place between 2004 and 2014. (PX 136 at \u00b6 39.) Generally, he found that in races involving two or three candidates, Latino candidates received approximately 60-90 percent of the Latino vote. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PX 137 at Tables VII-1; VII-2; VII-3; VII-4; VII-8; VII-11; VII-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Only the 2010 contest for Superintendent of Public Instruction defied this pattern, with Larry Aceves receiving a statistically significantly level of higher support from non-Hispanic whites and blacks than he did from Latinos. (PX 136 at \u00b6 39; PX 137 at Table VII-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Even in races with more than three candidates, Latino candidates consistently earned a broad share of the Latino vote. For instance, in the 2010 primary for Superintendent of Public Instruction, a twelve-person race, Latino candidates Gloria Romero and Lydia Gutierrez together garnered about 65 percent of the Latino vote. (PX 137 at Table VII-5.) In the six-candidate Republican primary for Lieutenant Governor in 2010, the top vote-getter, Abel Maldonado, received approximately 60 percent of the Latino vote, and a statistically significantly different level of support from Latinos and non-Latinos. (PX 136 at \u00b6 42; PX 137 at Table VII-7.) The 2010 Democratic primary for Attorney General, a seven-person contest, had three Latino candidates who drew disproportionate support from Latino voters, collecting about 85 percent of the Latino votes altogether, compared to roughly 20 percent of non-Hispanic white and black votes. (PX 136 at \u00b6 42; PX 137 at Table VII-9.) The 2014 primary for Secretary of State, an eight-person contest, saw Alex Padilla garner approximately 68 percent of the Latino vote, but only 8 percent of the non-Hispanic white and black vote. (PX 137 at Table VII-10.) In the six-person primary for state Controller in 2014, John Perez garnered about 68 percent of the Latino vote, and only 8 percent of the non-Hispanic white and black vote.

The court therefore rejects the notion that county-wide exogenous election data is irrelevant in the context of \u00a7 2 cases such as this one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Dr. Katz's Critique\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Defendants do not dispute the results that Dr. Kousser generated through the application of ER and EI. In fact, defendants' expert Dr. Jonathan Katz testified that he achieved similar estimates of racial polarization when he conducted his own analyses of Kern County supervisorial elections. (Trial Tr., Vol. 8, 1380:7-14.) Defendants do dispute, however, what conclusions may be drawn from those estimates. Dr. Katz critiques Dr. Kousser's conclusions primarily on the ground that, due to the lack of homogeneous precincts in Kern County, ER and EI produce potentially inaccurate results. (DX 622 at 7.) According to Dr. Katz, the method of bounds-one of EI's chief advantages over ER-is only effective when there are \"sufficient\" homogeneous precincts such that the bounds are informative. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) However, Dr. Katz also testified that Kern County lacks a sufficient number of homogeneous Latino precincts, resulting in estimates that \"may be wildly off.\" (Trial Tr., Vol. 8, 1378:4-10.) Defendants rely on this testimony of Dr. Katz in arguing that because Dr. Kousser's analyses are insufficiently reliable, the court cannot draw any statistically valid conclusions from them. (DX 622 at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   To illustrate the potential inaccuracy of ER and EI as applied to Kern County, Dr. Katz performed ER and EI analyses of Latino Democratic registration in Kern County and compared those estimates to the true values. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-9.) Dr. Katz's ER and EI analyses, which Dr. Kousser does not dispute, estimated Democratic registration among Latinos in Kern County to be over 70 percent, whereas the true values hover over 50 percent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to Dr. Katz, this disparity casts serious doubt on the accuracy of Dr. Kousser's findings of racially polarized voting in Kern County elections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Although \"absolute perfection on the base statistical data is not to be expected, a trial court should not ignore the imperfections of the data used nor the limitations of statistical analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    Overton v. City of Austin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10530658\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/871/529/#p539\">\n    871 F.2d 529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 539 (5th Cir. 1989). Though Dr. Katz's critiques are worthy of consideration, the court is unpersuaded that these criticisms preclude plaintiffs from demonstrating Latino political cohesiveness by a preponderance of the evidence. The court certainly recognizes the obvious-that larger numbers of homogeneous precincts produce more accurate EI estimates. But the court finds no basis to conclude that there is some minimum number of homogeneous precincts required before ER and EI analysis have any probative value in a \u00a7 2 case. Dr. Katz admitted that Gary King, the political scientist who developed EI, indicated no\n   bright line percentage of homogeneous precincts is necessary in order for ecological inference estimates to be reliable. (Trial Tr., Vol. 8, 1374:1-12.) Plaintiff's expert Dr. Kousser also could not identify any scholarly articles on ecological inference that set a threshold of homogeneity, below which the methodology should be rejected as unreliable. (PX 137 at \u00b6 50.) Dr. Kousser acknowledged that tomography plots, as discussed in Gary King's seminal book introducing ecological inference, provided one means of assessing the reliability of ecological inference. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants' expert, Dr. Katz, also acknowledged that tomography plots could have been used to assess whether there were sufficient homogeneous precincts here, but he did not produce any such plots at trial or otherwise. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr., Vol. 8, 1345:6-17.) Dr. Katz himself did not opine on what the threshold of homogeneity would need to be here in order to produce reliable statistical results. Indeed, at trial, he went so far as declining to concede that even a hypothetical county with 990 homogeneous precincts out of 1,000 precincts total would have sufficient homogeneity to render ER and EI analyses reliable. (Trial Tr., Vol. 8, 1372:12-1373:1.) Yet, if courts required this high degree of homogeneity as a prerequisite for considering ER and EI evidence, that evidence would be unnecessary, as an HPA analysis could simply be conducted instead and would provide superior estimates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   In addition to this position lacking support in the field of statistics, numerous cases finding racial polarization have relied on statistical analyses that did not include HPA and made no mention of homogeneous precincts whatsoever.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Patino v.

City of Irving\n   </em>\n   , the court explicitly acknowledged that \"[t]here are no homogeneous Hispanic precincts in any of these elections in Irving, so this methodology cannot be applied to derive estimates of Hispanic voter's candidate preferences.\" 638 F.Supp.2d at 723 (N.D. Tex. 2009). Despite the lack of homogeneous Hispanic precincts, the court went on to credit the ER and EI analyses conducted by plaintiff's expert.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Teague v. Attala County\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit held that the district court erred when it concluded that plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate racial polarization in Attala County.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7625824\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/92/283/#p291\">\n    92 F.3d 283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 291-92 (5th Cir. 1996). In that case, the district court had criticized the methodology employed by the plaintiffs' experts because there were no homogeneously black precincts with a 90 percent black voting age population. As the Fifth Circuit noted, however, \"such a district does not exist in Attala County.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7625824\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/92/283/#p291\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7625824\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/92/283/#p291\">\n    at 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Despite the lack of any 90 percent homogeneous black precincts, the Fifth Circuit reviewed the statistical evidence from the regression analysis and found \"overwhelming evidence of racial polarization.

However,\n   the court is not persuaded that the methodologies employed by Dr. Kousser here have been undermined in any way. The court finds that Dr. Katz's insistence on \"sufficient\" homogeneous precincts is undercut by his own work in previous cases, where he performed ER and EI analyses without any reference to the number of homogeneous precincts in the relevant jurisdiction. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr., Vol. 8, 1356:1-1359:5.) Moreover, in the present case, Dr. Katz failed to provide the court with any method for determining how many homogeneous precincts would be sufficient in order to obtain reliable results by way of ER and EI. Defendants have provided the court with no basis upon which to depart from those cases which have relied upon ER and EI analyses even in the absence of HPA. The court acknowledges the disparity between the estimates produced by ER and EI in Dr. Katz's analysis of Latino Democratic registration compared to the known values, but is not persuaded as to the implications that defendants would have the court draw therefrom. Notably, Dr. Katz was unable to explain the relationship between registration and voting-only to say that they are \"related\"-while also acknowledging that they are different and may have different geographical distributions. (Trial Tr., Vol. 8, 1379:4-16.) The court has no reason to believe that the cause of the inflated estimates of Latino Democratic registration is due to insufficient homogeneous precincts as suggested by Dr. Katz, rather than to accept Dr. Kousser's rational explanation-that in heavily Latino precincts, non-Latinos tend to register as Democrats at a higher rate than non-Latinos in other precincts.

Even recognizing the limitations of these methodologies, however, the court need not insist on mathematical exactitude in assessing racial polarization. As one district court has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   [A]n approach might yield an inexact result for purposes of a hypothetical mathematical challenge, but could still be correlative, probative, and sufficiently accurate to bear on the ultimate issue of racial bloc voting.

Several lay witnesses involved in canvassing for Latino candidates for the Board of Supervisors testified that\n   Latino voters supported Latino candidates. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr., Vol. 2, 246:17-25; 293:17-294:3.) Other lay witnesses testified about the very different receptions they received canvassing in Latino communities versus Anglo communities. For example, plaintiff Gary Rodriguez observed that unlike in Anglo communities, Latino communities were excited about having \"a like person\" run for office, not simply by virtue of being Latino, but because a Latino candidate was \"somebody that lives on your side of town that understands the issues that are facing your side of town.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr., Vol. 2, 291:5-292:5.) Plaintiff Dorothy Velazquez testified that when she canvassed in 2016 for Emilio Huerta for the 21st congressional district, Latino communities in Wasco, Delano, and McFarland were excited and receptive about Huerta's candidacy, whereas in Anglo communities in Bakersfield, some residents would shut the door and refuse to speak to her. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr., Vol. 2, 264:1-266:16.) Support by Latino voters for Latino candidates was also expressed at the August 9, 2011 public hearing on redistricting before the Board of Supervisors, where one Latino resident took to the microphone and stated, \"I would love the opportunity of being able to see people up there on the Board of Supervisors to look more like me than not like me.\" (JX 30 at 39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Plaintiffs also presented testimony from two individuals who ran for the Kern County Board of Supervisors, Sam Ramirez and Leticia Perez, both of whom echoed the differences in campaigning in Latino versus Anglo communities. Mr. Ramirez, who ran for District 1 Supervisor in 2012, testified that the communities emphasized different concerns: in Bakersfield and Ridgecrest, which had more Anglo voters, constituents were most interested in parks, water rates, and base realignment and closure, respectively. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr., Vol. 3, 370:4-16.) By contrast, in Delano, McFarland, and Shafter-communities with heavy Latino populations-constituents primarily expressed concerns about the need for jobs, ways to address crime, and water quality. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ramirez also described differences in his experiences while campaigning, observing that he had a \"better connection\" with Latino constituents in Delano, McFarland, and Shafter in part because he, like the majority of those constituents, is of Mexican descent, and could communicate with them in Spanish if needed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 370:17-371:13.) Mr. Ramirez also noted that those communities were largely agriculture-focused and the residents were familiar with the history of the United Farm Workers and Cesar Chavez. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ramirez testified that in Ridgecrest, a predominantly Anglo community, he felt more disconnected from those constituents because he did not grow up near there and did not work or know anyone who worked at the Naval Air Weapons Station. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 371:14-18.) Ramirez was ultimately unsuccessful in his campaign for District 1 Supervisor, coming in fourth in the June 2012 primary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 372:2-7.) Analyzing precinct results post-election, Ramirez learned that he received the most votes of any primary candidate in both Delano and McFarland, and the second-most votes in Shafter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 372:8-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Supervisor Leticia Perez testified that during her campaign for District 5 Supervisor in 2012, she received a very warm and positive reception while campaigning in Latino neighborhoods in East Bakersfield, Arvin, and Lamont. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr., Vol. 5, 808:8-16.) In Oleander, however, an Anglo neighborhood that had been moved into District 5 in 2011, Supervisor Perez described her reception as \"the exact opposite.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 808:19-20.) Supervisor Perez testified that in her experience campaigning throughout the state of California over two decades, Oleander was the first and only place where she had registered Democrats slam the door in her\n   face, unlike in the Latino communities of her district, where she was able to have meaningful conversations with constituents regarding the concerns of the community, including street lights and stray dogs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 808:22-810:2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The foregoing anecdotal evidence of Latino political cohesiveness in Kern County was not rebutted by any of the witnesses presented by defendants at trial. Defendants argue in their post-trial brief that testimony from Mr. Ramirez and Supervisor Perez amounted to only \"vague insinuations of racial motivation,\" in contrast to the explicit racial statements made in connection with campaigns presented, for instance, by the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Patino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269773\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/230/667/#p691\">\n    230 F.Supp.3d at 685-86, 714-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Doc. No. 186 at 5 n.10.) In advancing this argument, defendants misapprehend the scope of the second\n   <em>\n    Gingles\n   </em>\n   precondition.

Although the results in two out of five elections would not normally suffice to demonstrate the usual defeat of Latino-preferred candidates, the characteristics of those other three elections must be taken into account here. Specifically, the three remaining elections in this sample were atypical: the Latino-preferred candidate won the 2012 election for District 5 Supervisor, but this election took place in a majority-Latino district and should therefore be disregarded in examining usual defeat.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    De Grandy\n   </em>\n   , 512 U.S. at 1003-04,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"39646\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/512/997/#p1011\">\n    114 S.Ct. 2647\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Old Person I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1094453\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/230/1113/#p1120\">\n    230 F.3d at 1122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, both the 2010 primary and runoff for District 2 Supervisor included candidate Steve Perez, whom Dr. Kousser characterized as an anomaly because he was the only Latino candidate in the elections analyzed who consistently fared better with non-Hispanic white and black voters than Latino voters, or whose support evidenced no racial polarization. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr., Vol. 4, 601:12-602:2.) Steve Perez made it to the top two in the 2010 District 2 primary with significant support from non-Hispanic white and black voters, and though he lost the District 2 runoff, he received roughly equal support from Latino and non-Latino voters.

The court is left with, in sum, two elections that support a finding in plaintiffs' favor, one election that weighs neither for nor against plaintiffs, and two elections-albeit elections the court is persuaded were anomalous-that support a finding in defendants' favor.

(PX 137 at Tables VI-1, VI-2, VI-3, VI-4.) Therefore, Latino-preferred candidates lost three out of the four local exogenous elections analyzed by Dr. Kousser. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Table R-1.) Of the remaining exogenous statewide elections, Dr. Kousser found that the Latino-preferred candidate lost nine times out of thirteen elections. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Defendants argue that the exogenous elections analyzed by Dr. Kousser are not sufficiently similar to the endogenous elections to be probative of typical voting outcomes in Kern County. Defendants' witness Karen Jeanne Rhea, Assistant Registrar of Voters for Kern County, testified that for state elections, candidates may have their party labels printed on the ballot, as well as any party endorsements. (Trial Tr., Vol. 10, 1640:6-22). Defendants argue that the state exogenous elections therefore contain partisan cues that make them sufficiently dissimilar from local, non-partisan elections. Defendants' expert Dr. Katz testified that voting behavior varies in high profile versus low profile elections, as well as in partisan versus non-partisan elections. (Trial Tr., Vol. 8, 1338:25-1339:13.) He also criticized Dr. Kousser's examination of Democratic primary elections, because primaries \"are restricted to a subset of eligible voters unlike the supervisor races.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   However, defendants proffered no evidence or satisfactory explanation at trial as to why a primary election, even if limited to a particular subset of voters, is sufficiently dissimilar to an election for Board of Supervisors to have no probative value with respect to the relevant inquiry in this case. Moreover, defendants presented no evidence at trial suggesting that partisanship, rather than race, drives the results in the exogenous elections and better explains\n   the usual defeat of Latino candidates in those elections in Kern County.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cisneros\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%201668500\">\n    2014 WL 1668500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *19, *22 (finding partisan, exogenous elections to be of limited probative value because results from exogenous elections ran counter to the results from endogenous elections, and the defense expert presented evidence that polarization in exogenous elections was driven by the party, rather than the race or ethnicity, of the candidate). Finally, defendants only presented evidence of partisan cues on the ballots for certain statewide contests. Thus, even if the court were to limit its consideration of exogenous elections only to local contests without such partisan cues, plaintiffs have shown that three out of four of the local exogenous elections analyzed by Dr. Kousser featured legally significant racial polarization where the Latino-preferred candidate lost.

In Kern County, the only Latino candidate to have been elected to the Board of Supervisors outside of the majority-Latino district is Steve Perez, who was elected in 1994 and re-elected in 1998-roughly two decades ago. Notably, Dr. Kousser's analyses indicate that of the five endogenous elections and the four local exogenous elections, the Latino candidate was defeated in seven of nine elections. (PX 137 at Tables V-1-VI-4.) In the two elections that Latino candidates won, one took place in District 5, the majority-Latino district; the other was a District 2 primary where the Latino candidate garnered second place, and thus \"won\" advancement to a top-two runoff, where he was eventually defeated by a non-Latino candidate.

Strictly proportional representation would require Latinos to make up the majority in 1.5 supervisorial districts, which is not possible.

Dr. Camarillo's testimony was both persuasive and essentially unrebutted. The court summarizes that testimony as follows. Kern County was settled as an agricultural community in the early 1900s, which attracted Mexican immigrants who sought work in the County's growing agricultural economy. (Trial Tr., Vol. 6, 850:19-852:19.) Although people from all across the country settled in Kern County, both Kern and Fresno County were unique in attracting a substantial out-migration of southerners from former confederate states, who brought with them not only their knowledge of farming, but also their racial attitudes, including a white supremacist ideology. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 853:2-854:20.) This ideology manifested in the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s, which had some of its largest chapters within Kern County. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 873:22-874:13.) Klan members were prominent members of the community, and included Stanley Abel, an outspoken Klan member who served on the Kern County Board of Supervisors for nearly three decades. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 874:23-875:14.) In the 1960s, the Kern County White Citizens Council emerged in Bakersfield to push back against the civil rights movement in Kern County. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 898:21-899:8; Trial Tr., Vol. 7, 1035:1-11; PX 168 at 3.) The Bakersfield City Council moreover refused to censure the Kern County White Citizens Council at that time, despite pleas to do so from black and Mexican-American community leaders. (PX 168 at 3; Trial Tr., Vol. 6, 899:9-900:10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   From the beginning of Kern County's history, race relations were inseparable from labor relations: owners and operators of farms occupied the upper class of Kern County society, while the farm workers and laborers-largely Mexican-Americans-occupied the lower class. (Trial Tr., Vol. 6, 855:3-22.) This stratification by race and class was not limited to the labor sector. The \"color line\" extended to housing, public accommodations, law enforcement, and education. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 857:3-23.) This de facto system of racial exclusion of Mexican-Americans, for which Dr. Camarillo coined the term \"Jaime Crow,\" was present throughout the state of California from the 1920s into the 1960s, in the form of racially restrictive covenants, segregation in education, and \"whites only\" pools, parks, restaurants, and movie theaters. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 858:11-24; 881:25-884:22.) Classified advertisements about real estate for sale and rental, published in the\n   <em>\n    Bakersfield Californian\n   </em>\n   newspaper throughout the 1940s and 1950s, stated explicitly whether properties were suitable \"for colored,\" \"for Spanish,\" or for the \"white race only.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 864:23-867:9; PX 167 at 19-21.) A 1969\n   <em>\n    Fresno Bee\n   </em>\n   article quoted the former Chief of Police of Bakersfield, Robert Powers, claiming Bakersfield to be \"sociologically a backward, racist community,\" where the police can be used to harass private citizens. (Trial Tr., Vol. 6, 910:25-911:22; PX 167 at 173.) The racial divide was also apparent through explicit signs, posted at the city limits of so-called \"sundown towns,\" which warned people of color, typically African-Americans, that they had to leave town by sundown. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 875:15-876:12.) One such sign was documented as being displayed in the city of Taft in Kern County in the 1930s. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Even in later decades, there was evidence of intense racial discord in Kern County, including an incident as late as 1975 at Taft Community College. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 879:16-880:11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Dr. Camarillo also testified about lawsuits in Kern County challenging segregation\n   in education, including a case brought by the state of California and the Department of Justice against the Delano School District for employing explicit policies to relegate Mexican-American elementary students to the west side of Delano while maintaining the elementary schools on the east side almost exclusively white. (Trial Tr., Vol. 6, 902:3-904:7.) Evidence presented at trial suggests that Latino students continue to experience present-day discrimination in education. Dolores Huerta testified that the Dolores Huerta Foundation recently reached a settlement with Kern High School District, after discovering that African-American and Latino students were being disproportionately suspended or expelled compared to white students. (Trial Tr., Vol. 2, 237:23-238:16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   According to Dr. Camarillo, the history of discrimination in Kern County fits within a larger pattern of discrimination against Mexican-Americans across the state of California. Specifically in the context of voting and democratic participation, this pattern of discrimination was evidenced by successful efforts in the late nineteenth century by the California legislature to overturn a provision of the state constitution that had required all public legal documents to be printed in both English and Spanish, as well as the adoption of a literacy test in order to register to vote, which primarily targeted Chinese-Americans and Mexican-Americans. (Trial Tr., Vol. 6, 848:12-849:8.) In the late nineteenth century, there were explicit efforts in southern California counties to dilute the voting strength of Mexican-Americans through the gerrymandering of districts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 849:17-25.) Meanwhile, in San Jose in the late 1870s, Mexican-Americans were explicitly forbidden to attend a Democratic Party convention. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 850:2-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   Defendants contend that Dr. Camarillo's testimony regarding historical evidence of discrimination statewide is irrelevant because it does not focus exclusively on discrimination occurring within Kern County. The court rejects such a myopic view. Evidence of statewide discrimination is clearly relevant and may provide context for understanding instances of discrimination within the political subdivision at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gomez v.

Plaintiffs' expert Dr. Kousser testified that a majority vote requirement, such as that imposed by California law, allows a majority to band together to defeat a minority candidate in a runoff election. (Trial Tr., Vol. 4, 539:2-22; PX 136 at \u00b6 46.) The Ninth Circuit similarly acknowledged the dilutive effect of a majority vote requirement and has also noted that \"the runoff requirement increases the expense and other burdens of minority candidates by requiring them to run a second time, at-large.\"\n   <em>\n    Badillo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520103\" index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/956/884/#p889\">\n    956 F.2d at 890\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Defendants argue first that the majority vote requirement is imposed by state law, and is neither devised by Kern County nor within its control. (Doc. No. 137 at 19.) The court acknowledges this is the case, but also recognizes that the reason for the existence of the majority vote requirement is irrelevant to the totality of the circumstances inquiry: \"[t]his Senate Factor directs the Court to inquire into the existence and effect of [an enhancing mechanism], not its purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Euclid\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3891355\" index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/580/584/#p596\">\n    580 F.Supp.2d at 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Defendants next argue that the adoption of an enhancing mechanism has no probative value on its own, and that plaintiffs must prove that the majority vote requirement \"[has] actually, in real life, prevented minority voters in the jurisdiction from electing their candidates of choice.\" (Doc. No. 137 at 19.) The court disagrees. Defendants do not cite any controlling authority for this proposition. Moreover, defendants' interpretation of this Senate Factor is belied by the text itself, which merely inquires as to whether such mechanisms \"may enhance the opportunity for discrimination,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   S. REP. NO. 97-417 at 28-29, not whether such mechanisms are the but-for cause of a minority candidate's electoral defeat. Thus, the Ninth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Badillo\n   </em>\n   held that \"[t]he district court correctly found that [the challenged electoral system]'s runoff requirement and majority vote requirement\n   <em>\n    increased the opportunity\n   </em>\n   for discrimination against minorities in Stockton.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520103\" index=\"235\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/956/884/#p889\">\n    956 F.2d at 890\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). The Ninth Circuit's conclusion did not rest on any evidence that the majority vote requirement and runoff requirement had in fact prevented minority candidates from being elected.

REP. NO. 97-417 at 29 n.114 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Dr. Kousser testified at trial that although Latinos constitute the majority of the population in Kern County (50.4 percent in 2014), they have been unable to influence elections commensurate with their population size because they form a much smaller percentage of the electorate and are socioeconomically disadvantaged compared to non-Hispanic whites. (Trial Tr., Vol. 4, 660:15-661:2; PX 136 at \u00b6\u00b6 47-48.) According to 2014 ACS data, the most recent data available when he prepared his analyses, Dr. Kousser found that Latinos in Kern County comprise only about 38 percent of the citizen population and 32 percent of registered voters, and cast only 22 percent of the votes in the 2014 general election. (Trial. Tr., Vol. 4, 660:15-661:2; PX 136 at \u00b6\u00b6 47-48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   Dr. Kousser drew a direct relationship between depressed Latino political participation in Kern County and the socioeconomic disadvantages faced by Latinos in housing, income, and education. (PX 136 at \u00b6 49.) For example, 2014 ACS data shows that while 65 percent of non-Hispanic whites in Kern County own the houses in which they live, only 49 percent of Latinos do. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) With respect to income, about 15 percent of non-Hispanic whites in Kern County have incomes below the poverty level, while that figure is double for Latinos, at about 30 percent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) With respect to educational attainment, in 2014, 1.4 percent of non-Hispanic whites in Kern County had received a ninth grade education or less, and 22 percent of non-Hispanic whites had achieved a bachelor's degree or higher. (Trial Tr., Vol. 4, 655:2-17.) In contrast, 27.8 percent of Latinos in Kern County had received a ninth grade education or less, and only 7.1 percent had achieved a bachelor's degree or higher. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs' expert historian Dr. Camarillo echoed Dr. Kousser's findings regarding a persistent educational gap between Latinos and non-Hispanic whites, which Dr. Camarillo testified was documented in reports by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights in the 1970s, and continues today. (Trial Tr., Vol. 6, 903:16-907:14.) Dolores Huerta also testified at trial about a recent lawsuit brought against Kern High School District, which eventually resulted in a settlement, challenging the disproportionate suspension and expulsion of African-American and Latino students. (Trial Tr., Vol. 2, 237:23-238:16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   Defendants' expert Dr. Johnson disputed the evidence of educational disparities with data demonstrating that Latino educational attainment in Kern County had improved by several percentage points between the release of the 2005-2009 ACS five-year data and the 2011-2015 ACS five-year data. (Trial Tr., Vol. 9, 1474:9-24.) Defendants argue that this data indicates an upward trend, precluding any conclusions about Latinos' ability to participate effectively in the political process. (Doc. No. 137 at 20.) This argument lacks merit. Defendants provided no comparative evidence at trial regarding the change, if any, to educational attainment among non-Hispanic whites in Kern County. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr., Vol. 9, 1542:8-17.) If, for example, educational attainment among non-Hispanic\n   whites improved at the same rate as that of Latinos during this period, the educational gap between those groups would still persist to the same degree. And if educational attainment among non-Hispanic whites has improved at a faster rate than that of Latinos, the educational gap would in fact be more egregious today than that reflected in Dr. Kousser's 2014 figures. More fundamentally, even if an improvement in the education gap has been made in recent years, it does not mean an education gap no longer exists. Defendants did not present evidence at trial that there currently is no education gap between Latinos and non-Hispanic whites in Kern County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   Moreover, Dr. Johnson provided no testimony rebutting the disparities in income and homeownership presented by Dr. Kousser.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Johnson testified that Latino businesses in Kern County are thriving, as documented by data between 2002 and 2012 indicating that Latino businesses increased their sales and their number of employees, at the same time that white businesses exhibited slower growth or even declined in these categories. (Trial Tr., Vol. 9, 1472:17-1473:7; DX 558 at \u00b6\u00b6 70-75.) Dr. Kousser's report noted, however, that despite these increases in sales by Latino businesses, sales of white businesses still dwarf those of their Latino counterparts, at almost twelve times greater in 2012. (PX 137 at \u00b6 48.) Ultimately, the evidence proffered by defendants through Dr. Johnson's testimony is insufficient to negate the compelling evidence of socioeconomic disparities between Latinos and non-Hispanic whites in Kern County. Consideration of this factor, therefore, also weighs in plaintiffs' favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Overt or Subtle Racial Appeals (Senate Factor Six)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   The sixth Senate Factor asks whether political campaigns have been characterized by overt or subtle racial appeals.\n   <em>\n    Gingles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203777\" index=\"241\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/30/#p47\">\n    478 U.S. at 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203777\" index=\"242\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/30/#p47\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Little evidence regarding this factor was adduced at trial; the court notes, however, that Dr. Camarillo related one anecdote to this effect. In the early 1970s, the Kern Council for Civic Unity sought to mobilize voters around Raymond Gonzales, the first Mexican-American to be put forward as a candidate for State Assembly in the area. (Trial Tr., Vol. 6, 915:3-12.) While successful in his 1972 campaign, Gonzales served for only one term, which, according to Dr. Camarillo, was due in part to a concerted effort by the Republican Party and other opponents to vote Gonzales out of office in 1974. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 915:12-22.) Notably, in 1974, Gonzales was defeated by William Thomas, who commented in a reported interview that Kern County had a \"vested interest\" in maintaining the racial status quo. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 916:4-10.) The editor of the Bakersfield Californian, a strong supporter of Thomas, also publically observed that Bakersfield was the \"most harmoniously segregated community in America,\" that \"there is absolutely no crossing of racial and cultural lines,\" and that prominent community members \"literally deny the existence of blacks and Mexican Americans.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 916:13-21.) Defendants did not refute or deny these explicit racial appeals, but offered evidence that other factors contributed\n   to Gonzales' defeat in 1974. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1003:16-1006:13; 1009:16-1010:1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   The court finds that plaintiffs have produced some evidence that political campaigns in Kern County have been characterized by racial appeals. Given that the evidence at trial pertained to only one campaign that occurred over four decades ago, the court affords this evidence very limited weight. Moreover, because there is otherwise no evidence of racial appeals in Kern County elections, the court concludes that consideration of this factor, overall, weighs slightly in favor of defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   vi.\n   <em>\n    Lack of Responsiveness (Additional Factor)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   An additional factor that may be probative in establishing a \u00a7 2 violation is whether there is a lack of responsiveness on the part of elected officials to the particularized needs of the minority community.\n   <em>\n    Gingles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203777\" index=\"243\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/30/#p47\">\n    478 U.S. at 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203777\" index=\"244\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/30/#p47\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Plaintiffs presented evidence at trial that the Kern County Board of Supervisors has been, at times, unresponsive to the particularized needs of the Latino community, specifically in the area of immigration. Dorothy Velazquez noted the concern within predominantly Latino communities that undocumented individuals could be detained and deported for simple traffic violations, and the hesitation among undocumented immigrants to report anything to law enforcement for fear of being subsequently deported. (Trial Tr., Vol. 2, 262:7-15.) Several of plaintiffs' witnesses also testified about their support for Senate Bill 54 (\"S.B. 54\"), a state legislative proposal that would have made California a \"sanctuary state\" and which, among other provisions, would have repealed existing laws requiring arresting agencies to notify Immigration and Customs Enforcement when an undocumented individual is arrested. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr., Vol. 2, 235:12-24, 263:3-22.) Dolores Huerta had previously testified before the Board of Supervisors, requesting their support for S.B. 54. Ms. Huerta then testified at the trial in this case that the Latino community supported the bill, as evidenced by the many organizations working in the Latino community that demonstrated on behalf of S.B. 54, and the buses of Latino Kern County community members who went to Sacramento to lobby in favor of the bill. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 236:13-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   District 5 Supervisor Perez echoed the support of S.B. 54 within the Latino community, testifying that her vote in favor of S.B. 54 was consistent with the response she received from Latinos in Kern County. (Trial Tr., Vol. 5, 803:8-10.) Supervisor Perez noted that, in response to S.B. 54, she received feedback \"from more people than [she] had ever heard from as supervisor,\" and that she had \"never seen an outpouring like [she] did during that conversation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 803:10-19.) The feedback regarding S.B. 54 was not uniform among all her constituents, however: Supervisor Perez's office also received what she described as \"very ugly\" mail during that time, including a postcard depicting a Latino gang member, which Supervisor Perez interpreted as a serious threat, and which caused her to fear for her safety and that of her family. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 800:7-801:24;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr., Vol. 7, 1174:2-1175:2.) Ultimately, despite strong support for the legislation from the Latino community, the Board of Supervisors voted to formally oppose passage of S.B. 54 by a 4 to 1 vote, with only Supervisor Perez voting in favor. (Trial Tr., Vol. 2, 236:6-12; Trial Tr., Vol. 5, 803:3-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Plaintiffs presented additional evidence at trial that current and former supervisors serving District 1, as it is configured in the County's 2011 Adopted Map-which combines the predominantly white community\n   of Ridgecrest with the predominantly Latino communities of Delano, Shafter, and McFarland-have been unresponsive to their Latino constituents. For example, although District 1 Supervisor Mick Gleason testified regarding the various projects he has worked on in Delano, Shafter, and McFarland (Trial Tr., Vol. 10, 1601:13-1604:15), he also admitted that neither his field representative nor his chief of staff covering the Central Valley towns of Delano, Shafter, and McFarland within his district speak fluent Spanish. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1607:8-15.) Plaintiffs' witness Sam Ramirez, who formerly served on the Delano City Council, also testified that former District 1 Supervisor John McQuiston was unresponsive to the particularized needs of the Latino community in Delano, failing to consistently address requests to clean up a park and to renovate other County property within Delano city limits. (Trial Tr., Vol. 3, 362:15-364:8; 376:4-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   Plaintiffs further presented evidence about environmental concerns within the Latino community, including pollution stemming from a hazardous waste facility outside Buttonwillow (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr., Vol. 3, 307:21-309:3); water contamination flowing from pesticide facilities in Arvin and Shafter (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr., Vol. 2, 281:18-282:7); by right dairies\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   in Arvin, Lamont, Shafter, and Wasco (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr., Vol. 3, 304:12-305:24); hydraulic fracturing in the outskirts of Shafter and Wasco (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 303:23-304:4); and safety violations with a composting facility located between Arvin and Lamont, which ultimately resulted in the deaths of two Latino employees (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr., Vol. 2, 228:1-18). That said, defendants presented significant evidence that these needs were addressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   Defendants, for their part, presented evidence that the County worked diligently to address the problems faced by all of its citizens. Ms. Oviatt testified that the County entered into a settlement in the early 1990s concerning the hazardous waste facility outside Buttonwillow, and that since that time, the facility has been in full compliance with the law, and the County has not received any complaints from County residents regarding that facility. (Trial Tr., Vol. 7, 1226:8-1229:2.) Ms. Oviatt further testified about the cleanup efforts regarding the pesticide facilities in Arvin and Shafter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1240:10-1242:9.) She also explained that the County has not permitted the construction of a new dairy in fifteen years, and that any new dairy would need to undergo an environmental impact review, followed by a hearing before the Planning Commission. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1235:5-7, 15-23.) Ms. Oviatt testified as to an incident in 2012 involving illegal disposal of debris from a hydraulic fracturing operation near Shafter, and explained that as soon as the incident came to its attention, the County contacted the responsible state agency and the industry. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1237:24-1240:9.) The state agency fined the industry and ordered a cleanup of the site, and there have not been any similar incidents in the County since that time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   With respect to the composting facility between Arvin and Lamont, Ms. Oviatt testified that the County began receiving complaints about the facility in 2006, and discovered other violations regarding\n   which the County held a series of public hearings and for which the facility was extensively fined. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1229:19-1231:13.) In 2011, following the two deaths that plaintiffs' witness Ms. Huerta testified to, the County revoked the facility's permit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1231:21-1232:18.) The County was sued for that decision by the facility owner, and lost in that suit at the trial court level. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1232:18-21.) While its appeal of that decision was pending, the County reached a settlement in 2013 with the owner of the facility, who agreed to turn over the project to a \"more responsible\" company. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1232:21-1233:6.) Since that time, the County has not received any complaints about the facility. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1233:7-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   In sum, plaintiffs presented some evidence at trial that the County has, at times, been unresponsive to the Latino community, most notably with the Board of Supervisors' vote in opposition to S.B. 54. Based on the credible trial testimony of the County's witnesses, however, the court finds that the County has made good faith efforts to respond to at least some of the particularized needs of the Latino community. The court therefore concludes that this factor weighs slightly in defendants' favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   vii.\n   <em>\n    Tenuousness of Rationales (Additional Factor)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   A court may also examine whether the rationale underlying the jurisdiction's challenged voting scheme is tenuous.\n   <em>\n    Gingles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203777\" index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/30/#p47\">\n    478 U.S. at 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6203777\" index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/30/#p47\">\n    106 S.Ct. 2752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

REP. NO. 97-417 at 29 n.117 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   Here, Mr. Krauter testified that during the public redistricting workshops, some comments by eastern Kern County residents reflected \"very loyal adherence\" to the different branches of the armed service, and that eastern County residents are \"pretty fiercely devoted to their corner of Kern County.\" (Trial Tr., Vol. 3, 410:2-13.) According to Mr. Krauter, public input from eastern Kern County residents supported a supervisorial district map that would maintain the existing lines as closely as possible, and that as long as two eastern districts were preserved, those residents did not care how the map was redrawn in any other respect. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 444:8-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that the Adopted Map is the result of the County's pandering to residents in the east, based on the tenuous rationale that the two military installations in eastern Kern County each require their own supervisor. Plaintiffs presented evidence at trial demonstrating that both military installations are located in California's 23rd Congressional District. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Trial Tr., Vol. 7, 1180:22-1181:4.) Plaintiffs' mapping expert David Ely also testified that eastern Kern County does not have sufficient population to comprise one district by itself, much less two. (Trial Tr., Vol. 1, 83:17-19; 207:20-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   Defendants insist that the decision to maintain two eastern districts reflects a longstanding, substantive policy of the County. John McQuiston, former District 1 Supervisor, testified about Base Realignment and Closure (\"BRAC\"), and the severe economic impact that earlier rounds of BRAC had on communities in eastern Kern County in terms of loss of employment, loss of population, loss of businesses, and declining home values. (Trial Tr., Vol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   9, 1555:1-20.) District 2 Supervisor Zack Scrivner further testified that the two military installations in Kern County tend to have different interests in the BRAC process, which could put a single supervisor in what he characterized as \"an impossible position\" if the BRAC proposal favors one base but disfavors the other. (Trial Tr., Vol. 7, 1165:5-1167:12.) District 1 Supervisor Gleason, the former commanding officer for Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, reiterated the likely conflict in having one supervisor represent both the Navy and Air Force bases in eastern Kern County, given their differing attitudes toward BRAC. (Trial Tr., Vol. 10, 1595:6-1597:12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   In addition, defendants presented testimony that the current configuration of the district lines, with two eastern districts, bolsters a separate traditional redistricting principle employed by the County-that is, to balance among districts the responsibility over metropolitan Bakersfield and the outlying areas. Allan Krauter testified that having several compact urban districts and very large outlying districts would result in disproportionate control over County government held by Bakersfield, with County resources unlikely to be distributed equitably to the outlying districts. (Trial Tr., Vol. 3, 502:5-19.) District 2 Supervisor Scrivner and District 1 Supervisor Gleason similarly testified to the advantage of having each district share responsibility over a portion of Bakersfield, such that each district contains urban communities, rural communities, and unincorporated areas, to encourage each supervisor to consider the welfare of the County as a whole. (Trial Tr., Vol. 7, 1169:1-1170:12; Trial Tr., Vol. 10, 1600:3-1601:1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   Although the court does not doubt the sincerity of the County's convictions in the purported necessity of two eastern districts, the court is unpersuaded that such a justification may override other legal requirements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court is unconvinced that a single supervisor would be placed in an impossible position concerning the two military bases, as evidenced by the fact that one congressional representative currently represents both bases. The court therefore concludes that this factor should be afforded neutral weight, at best.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   viii.\n   <em>\n    Summary\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   In summary, five of the nine factors relevant to Kern County weigh in favor of plaintiffs, including the two most important factors: the extent of racial polarization and the electoral success of Latino candidates. Three factors weigh in favor of defendants, and one factor weighs in favor of neither party. On balance, the court finds based upon the evidence presented at trial that the totality of the circumstances analysis weighs in plaintiffs' favor. Thus, the court will find that plaintiffs have met their burden in establishing a \u00a7 2 violation, absent any affirmative defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
