Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff, who was born in 1967, has been employed as a hospital admitting clerk and accounting clerk. (A.R. 98-99, 106). In 2012, Plaintiff filed an application for disability insurance benefits. (A.R. 174-75).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff's application alleged that on August 27, 2012, she became unable to work due to (i) severe migraines; (ii) seizures; (iii) lung tumors; (iv) insomnia/sleeplessness; and (v) \"migraine-related nausea and vomiting.\" (A.R. 106). Social Security denied the application on January 29, 2013. (A.R. 133-35). In October 2013, upon Plaintiff's request for reconsideration, Social Security affirmed the denial of benefits. (A.R. 137-40). Plaintiff sought further review by an ALJ, who conducted a hearing in January 2015. (A.R. 85-104, 143-44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In his March 25, 2015 decision, the ALJ found that Plaintiff is not disabled within the meaning of the Social Security Act. (A.R. 61-74). The Appeals Council denied Plaintiff's request for review, making the ALJ's decision the final decision of the Social Security Commissioner. (A.R. 1-7, 55-56). On September 1, 2016, Plaintiff filed a Complaint (Doc. 1) requesting judicial review and reversal of the ALJ's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Step One: Engagement in \"Substantial Gainful Activity\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The ALJ determined that Plaintiff has not engaged in substantial gainful activity since May 11, 2012, the alleged disability onset date. (A.R. 63). Neither party disputes this determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Step Two: Presence of Medically Severe Impairment/Combination of Impairments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The ALJ found that Plaintiff has the following severe impairments: (i) status-post right lung surgery ; (ii) migraine headaches; and (iii) history of non-specific versus pseudo seizures. (A.R. 63). This determination is undisputed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Step Three: Presence of Listed Impairment(s)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The ALJ determined that Plaintiff does not have an impairment or combination of impairments that meets or medically equals an impairment listed in 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1 of the Social Security regulations. (A.R. 64). Neither party challenges the ALJ's determination at this step.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Step Four: Capacity to Perform Past Relevant Work\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The ALJ found that Plaintiff retained the residual functional capacity (\"RFC\") to perform sedentary work as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1567\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), except that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [Plaintiff] can stand or walk for up to two hours out of a typical workday day [sic]; can sit for at least six hours in a typical workday; can occasionally climb stairs and ramps; should never climb ropes, ladders, or scaffolds; can occasionally stoop, kneel, and crouch; should avoid exposure to extreme cold and moving and dangerous machinery; and should avoid all exposure to unprotected heights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   (A.R. 64-65). Based on the assessed RFC and the testimony of the Vocational Expert (\"VE\"), the ALJ concluded that Plaintiff is capable of performing her past relevant work as a hospital admitting clerk and accounting clerk. (A.R. 73). Plaintiff disputes this determination, asserting that the ALJ improperly weighed the opinions of her treating physician and improperly discounted her testimony regarding her symptoms. (Doc. 16 at 13-22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    5.

On June 4, 2014, Dr. Fechtel completed a Headache Questionnaire in which he stated that Plaintiff has \"medically intractable chronic migraines\" and indicated that Plaintiff's condition would last at least twelve months. (A.R. 555-56). Dr. Fechtel indicated that Plaintiff would generally be precluded from performing \"even basic work\" activities during the times she has a headache. (A.R. 556). Dr. Fechtel indicated on the form that Plaintiff has had \"minimal response to multiple treatment trials\" and opined that Plaintiff would miss work more than three times a month. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The ALJ gave Dr. Fechtel's opinions little weight. (A.R. 71). Because Dr. Fechtel's opinions are contradicted by other acceptable medical sources,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the ALJ's reasons for discounting Dr. Fechtel's opinions must be specific and legitimate and supported by substantial evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In explaining why Dr. Fechtel's opinions were discounted, the ALJ stated \"First, the headache form was completed eight months after the claimant's last appointment with Dr. Fechtel. Though the claimant testified that she saw him monthly, there is no documentary evidence in the record that she saw Dr. Fechtel after October 2013 ....\" (A.R. 71).

The Court finds that\n   the ALJ's first reason for discounting Dr. Fechtel's opinions is invalid as it is not supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The ALJ's second reason for discounting Dr. Fechtel's opinions is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Dr. Fechtel's December 10, 2012 form drastically overstates the claimant's limitations. For example, he opines that claimant can walk, sit, or stand for zero hours. On the same day he completed that form, he noted that the claimant \"arises readily and has a normal gait and posture.\" (10F/13). His opinion and his observation directly contradict one another. Indeed, none of Dr. Fechtel's notes reflect anything near the degree of limitation he allegeg [sic] in his opinions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   (A.R. 72). The Court finds that the ALJ's statements above mischaracterize the record. Dr. Fechtel did not opine on the December 2012 disability form that Plaintiff had limitations relating to her gait or posture. Dr. Fechtel opined that Plaintiff's \"migraines coupled with the threat of seizure makes it unlikely that she will be able to return to work even in a sedentary capacity.\" (A.R. 190). This opinion is also reflected in Dr. Fechtel's December 2012 treatment note in which Dr. Fechtel states: \"Plaintiff has not been able to return [to work] due to a combination of intractable migraine which has not subsided since surgery and her seizures.\" (A.R. 476). The Court does not find that the notation in Dr. Fechtel's December 10, 2012 treatment record that Plaintiff had a normal gait and posture contradicts his opinion that Plaintiff is unable to perform even sedentary work as a result of migraines and possible seizures. The Court finds that Dr. Fechtel's opinions expressed in the December 2012 disability form are consistent with Dr. Fechtel's examination notes. The ALJ's second reason for discounting Dr. Fechtel's opinions is invalid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The ALJ also stated that the limitations expressed in the December 2012 disability form were \"far more extreme than the claimant's self-reports as to her activities (6E, 7E, and 8E).\" (A.R. 71). The ALJ does not explain the reasons for reaching this conclusion. The Ninth Circuit has instructed that a court \"cannot substitute [the court's] conclusions for the ALJ's, or speculate as to the grounds for the ALJ's conclusions. Although the ALJ's analysis need not be extensive, the ALJ must provide some reasoning in order for [the court] to meaningfully determine whether the ALJ's conclusions were supported by substantial evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown-Hunter v. Colvin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358706\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/806/487/#p495\">\n    806 F.3d 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 495 (9th Cir. 2015) (internal quotations marks and citation omitted). Moreover, although Plaintiff stated that she could stand/walk for 1.5 hours and sit for three to four hours before pain occurs, Plaintiff reported that she is \"in bed most all of the day, and unable to sleep most nights\" as her \"migraines cause vomiting and nausea, and prevent sleep.\" (A.R. 220, 227). Plaintiff also reported that while she \"occasionally\" does the laundry, her husband cares for her children and does \"all of the cooking, cleaning, shopping and school-related duties\" because her condition has worsened. (A.R. 224). The Court does not find that the ALJ's conclusion that Dr. Fechtel's opinions regarding Plaintiff's limitations are \"far more extreme\" than Plaintiff's reported limitations is based on substantial evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   To further explain why he gave little weight to Dr. Fechtel's opinions, the ALJ expressed concern regarding Dr. Fechtel's motivation for making his opinions. The ALJ discussed a January 27, 2012 treatment record in which Dr. Fechtel stated that disability was \"probably appropriate given the level and intensity of medicines required to keep her reasonably comfortable.\" (A.R. 72; 437). The ALJ observed that this note pre-dates Plaintiff's alleged disability onset date and was made when Plaintiff was working full time. (A.R. 72). The ALJ also noted that on August 9, 2012, Dr. Fechtel wrote: \"Given the amount of work time she was losing because of her headache and the complication of her lung surgery and persistent post-surgical pain, I think at this point she would be best served to consider Social Security Disability.\" (A.R. 72; 426). The ALJ found that \"[t]hese statements indicate a potential motivation on the part of Dr. Fechtel to secure benefits for the claimant, which, when viewed in conjunction with the exceptionally severe limitations expressed in his opinions, support assessing little weight to his opinions as to the claimant's functional abilities.\" (A.R. 72). The Court does not find that this is a legitimate reason for discounting Dr. Fechtel's opinion. Dr. Fechtel's statements do not indicate that Dr. Fechtel was so sympathetic to Plaintiff as to impair his professional judgment or was acting as Plaintiff's agent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Haulot v.

However, the opinions in the 2014 Headache Questionnaire and December 2012 disability form are supported by Dr. Fechtel's examination notes.

The Ninth Circuit, however, has adopted a test to determine when a case should be remanded for payment of benefits in cases where an ALJ has improperly rejected claimant testimony or medical opinion evidence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055813\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/775/1090/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1100-01 ;\n   <em>\n    Garrison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4157089\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/759/995/#p1013\">\n    759 F.3d at 1020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

At the administrative hearing, the VE testified that if Plaintiff were to miss three or more days of work a month, she would not be able to retain employment. (A.R. 99). The VE's testimony establishes that if Dr. Fechtel's opinions were credited-as-true, the ALJ would be required to find that Plaintiff is disabled.
