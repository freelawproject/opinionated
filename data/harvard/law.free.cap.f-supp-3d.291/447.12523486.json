After the firm failed to remit taxes it was holding in trust for the Government, the Internal Revenue Service (the \"IRS\") assessed penalties against the firm's shareholders for the amounts owed. One such shareholder, Alex Spizz, initiated this action to seek an abatement of the penalties; the Government then counterclaimed\n   against Spizz and filed a third-party complaint against the two other shareholders, Martin Todtman and Barton Nachamie, seeking judgment against them in the amount of the outstanding tax liabilities. Before the Court is the Government's motion for summary judgment with respect to its claims against Spizz and Todtman. For the reasons that follow, the Court grants the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Law Firm and Its Failure to Pay Trust Fund Taxes\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   From 2009 through mid-September 2012, Spizz, Todtman, and Nachamie were the named shareholders of the law firm Todtman, Nachamie, Spizz &amp; Johns, P.C., in which they each held a one-third interest. (Spizz 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 1). In mid-September 2012, Todtman left the firm, which then became Nachamie Spizz Cohen &amp; Serchuk, P.C., with Spizz and Nachamie becoming equal shareholders. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14). Nachamie then left the firm in or about December 2013, at which point the firm became Spizz Cohen &amp; Serchuk, P.C., with Spizz becoming sole shareholder. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15). The firm ceased operations in April 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The firm employed between 28 and 33 employees from 2009 through 2012, and hired a payroll service that calculated each employee's net pay and prepared payroll checks for the firm. (Spizz 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 2-3). The payroll service also calculated the firm's tax obligations, including its trust fund taxes, i.e., the federal income, social security, and Medicare taxes that the firm was required to withhold from its employees and pay to the IRS each pay period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 4). The firm failed to pay trust fund taxes in a timely manner to the IRS for the following quarterly tax periods in the following amounts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   \u2022 For the period ending June 30, 2009, $221,671.30;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   \u2022 For the period ending September 30, 2009, $180,379.87;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \u2022 For the period ending December 31, 2009, $265,147.23;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 For the period ending March 31, 2010, $189,998.67;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 For the period ending June 30, 2010, $122,685.01;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 For the period ending December 31, 2011, $216,040.11; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 For the period ending March 31, 2012, $205,669.11.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 6-13).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The issue in this litigation is whether the Government is entitled to hold Spizz or Todtman personally liable for the portions of these amounts that remain outstanding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Todtman's Role at the Firm\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   By way of background, Todtman established the law firm that eventually became Todtman, Nachamie, Spizz &amp; Johns, P.C. in the mid-1970s. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Todtman Dep. 12:10-13:21). From 2009 through mid-September 2012, Todtman was a shareholder at the firm, controlling one-third of its voting stock, and an officer holding the title of President. (Todtman 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 17-18). Although Todtman now contends that he \"was denied independent access to the firm's checkbooks and check authorization from 2008\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 110), the record overwhelmingly proves the contrary. For starters, other members and colleagues of the firm recognized Todtman as having an outsized role in the firm's management. Mitchell Lynn, an outside accountant for the firm who prepared the firm's annual tax return, testified during a deposition that Todtman was \"the managing officer of the firm.\" (Lynn Dep. 28:5-6). Indeed, Todtman himself testified that he \"started th[e] firm,\" and \"[i]f it wasn't for Todtman, there wouldn't have been a firm.\" (Todtman Dep. 148:17-18, 160:18-19). Spizz's testimony likewise emphasized that as President, Todtman \"held himself out as, and everybody [who ever] worked for the firm knew that Marty Todtman, who's the first name on the letterhead, was the managing Partner. He was the Todtman firm.\" (Spizz Dep. 29:5-12).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Documentary evidence also underscored Todtman's managerial role. In September 2012, on behalf of the firm, Todtman completed an IRS form entitled, \"Report of Interview with Individual Relative to Trust Fund Recovery Penalty or Personal Liability for Excise Taxes.\" (Tong. Decl., Ex. 14). On the form, Todtman checked boxes indicating that he performed the following duties at the firm from 1978 through 2010:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 \"Determine[d] financial policy for the business\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 \"Direct[ed] or authorize[d] payments of bills/creditors\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 \"Open[ed] or close[ed] bank accounts for the business\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 \"Guarantee[d] or co-sign[ed] loans\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 \"Sign[ed] or counter-sign[ed] checks\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 \"Authoriz[ed] or ma[de] Federal Tax Deposits\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 \"Prepare[d], review[ed], sign[ed], transmit[ted] payroll tax returns\"; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 \"Hir[ed]/fir[ed]\" employees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He also signed the firm's corporate income tax return for 2009, and the firm's quarterly federal tax return for the third and fourth quarters of 2009 and the first quarter of 2010. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 4, 10, 11; Todtman 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 26-27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In the course of discharging these responsibilities, Todtman made consequential decisions concerning the firm's tax payments. Outside accountant Lynn testified that in 2009, he discovered that the firm was failing to pay trust fund taxes. (Lynn Dep. 22:10-23). Upon discovering the underpayment, Lynn brought the issue solely to Todtman's attention, who responded \"that he [Todtman] could not pay his taxes and pay the bills of the firm, so he was making a hard choice.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23:5-17;\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 24:14-23). Laurie Newman, the firm's former bookkeeper and office manager, testified similarly that when she discussed the issue with Todtman, rather than providing an explanation, he replied, \"fuck them.\" (Newman Dep. 77:4-20;\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 14:2-18:15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Todtman denies that either of these conversations occurred. (Todtman 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 30-31). However, as discussed more fully below, once Spizz discovered that the firm had fallen behind on tax payments, he and Nachamie identified Todtman as the source of the problem and revoked his managerial authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Spizz's Role at the Firm\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   From 2009 through mid-September 2012, Spizz was a shareholder at the firm, controlling one-third of the firm's voting stock, and was an officer with the title of Vice President. (Spizz 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 33-35). During his deposition, Spizz testified that as a small business, the shareholders ran the firm \"very informally,\" but if any \"major decisions had to take place, [they] would meet, and ... generally agree on something.\" (Spizz Dep. 37:2-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Like Todtman, Spizz's submissions in this case bespeak a desire to distance himself from any awareness of the firm's financial difficulties from 2009 to its 2015 demise. In this regard, Spizz maintains that prior to June 2010, \"his primary role at the Firm was practicing law.\" (Spizz 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 36). At least as early as June 2010, however, Spizz was involved with major financial decisions at the firm, including paying creditors and trust fund taxes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35). Spizz also admits to participating in hiring and compensation decisions at the firm, but maintains that before June 2010, Todtman had authority to hire and fire employees and determine attorney compensation levels without the approval of other shareholders. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 36-38; Spizz Dep. 147:22-148:3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Spizz Decl. \u00b6 5 (\"[P]rior to June of 2010, Todtman was the President and Managing Partner of the firm, and the person who alone was responsible for ... running the day to day operations of the firm.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Spizz acknowledges that he had authority to sign checks from the firm's operating and payroll accounts; however, he asserts that before June 2010, he only did so upon Todtman's authorization. (Spizz 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 38-39). From at least 2009 until the firm closed in April 2015, Spizz was authorized to, and did in fact, guarantee loans on behalf of the firm. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40). Spizz also had authority to review and sign the firm's corporate tax returns and quarterly tax returns, and he signed the firm's quarterly tax return for the second quarter of 2010. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 41-42).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On or before June 10, 2010, Spizz discovered that the firm had failed to pay the trust fund taxes it had been withholding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   (Spizz 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 44). Before that date, according to Spizz, Todtman had directed a tax lawyer at the firm, Robert Tolz, to prepare an Offer in Compromise to present to the IRS in an effort to settle the firm's tax liabilities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 78). While preparing the Offer in Compromise, Tolz conferred only with Todtman and Nachamie. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 80). Tolz then approached Spizz to request his signature on the Offer in Compromise, at which point Spizz learned of the amounts owed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 78-81; Spizz Dep. 86:4-22). Spizz then confronted Nachamie and told him that he (Spizz) would only remain at the firm if Todtman no longer managed the firm's finances. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Spizz 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 81-82; Spizz Dep. 87:13-89:3). Soon thereafter (by June 14 according to Spizz and June 16 according to the Government), Spizz and Nachamie revoked Todtman's managerial responsibilities. (Spizz 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 45).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   After revoking Todtman's management authority, Spizz and Nachamie began managing the firm's finances. (Spizz 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 48-49). Spizz initially assumed at least some responsibility for these tasks, but claims to have passed these duties on to Nachamie around mid-2011. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 48, 84 (\"Nachamie assum[ed] management responsibilities in or about the middle of 2011[.]\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Spizz Decl. \u00b6 14 (\"[B]eginning sometime in early to mid-2011 Nachamie began to assume responsibility for the Firm's finances.\") ). As Spizz explained, because of the demands of his litigation practice, he could not devote sufficient time to tend to the firm's finances, while Nachamie's practice allowed him to oversee such matters. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Spizz Dep. 92:18-93:23, 133:16-134:4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Spizz claims that on June 10, 2010, when he learned from Tolz of the firm's trust fund tax liabilities, the firm lacked sufficient unencumbered assets to pay the outstanding amounts. (Spizz 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 76). In particular, Spizz contends that Sterling National Bank held a lien against all of the firm's assets, and he points out that on that date, the firm's operating account carried an ending balance of negative $20,314.16. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 77, 79;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Operating Account June 2010). Yet Spizz fails to mention that the account began that day with a positive balance of $63,762.83. (Operating Account June 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Although this chapter in the firm's history began with an effort by firm management (i.e., Spizz and Nachamie) to stay current with respect to the firm's tax liabilities, the transition of financial responsibility to Nachamie brought with it a relapse into tax debt. (Spizz 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 84-89). During this period, the firm paid trust fund taxes for the third and fourth quarters of 2010 and for the first, second, and third quarters of 2011, but failed to pay the full amount of trust fund taxes for the fourth quarter of 2011 and first quarter of 2012. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 59).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   According to Spizz, he learned on April 13, 2012, that the firm had not fully paid its trust fund taxes for those latter periods, after he was copied on an email from the firm's accountant to Nachamie, in which the accountant announced that he would no longer serve the firm because of its failure to pay taxes. (Spizz 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 61, 89). Spizz again reclaimed responsibility for the firm's finances and obtained an affidavit from Nachamie stating that he (Nachamie) was responsible for the firm's trust fund tax obligations for the 2011 and 2012 quarters during which the firm failed to make complete payments to the IRS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 62, 94).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   For this period, too, Spizz makes statements concerning the firm's ability to pay\n   its debts. Of note, Spizz claims that on April 13, 2012, the firm lacked sufficient unencumbered assets to pay overdue taxes: Its operating account was overdrawn with a negative balance of $131,332.82, and Sterling National Bank continued to hold a lien on the firm's assets. (Spizz 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 91-93). Also in April 2012, the firm restructured a preexisting $500,000 loan with Sterling National Bank after defaulting on the loan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 63). Nevertheless, the firm made payments under an Offer in Compromise that it submitted to the IRS, along with payments to other creditors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 54).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The non-IRS payments included compensation to firm shareholders, state taxes, employee salaries and benefits, rent, insurance, professional dues, and subscriptions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 55-58). Spizz contends that many of these payments were necessary to support the firm's continued operations and, in turn, payments to the IRS under the Offer in Compromise. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 58).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The Discovery of Nachamie's Malfeasance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   According to Spizz, he came to learn that the firm's financial difficulties were attributable to more than simple downturns in business. In or about December 2013, Spizz noticed an inconsistency in one of the firm's client escrow accounts; further investigation, with the assistance of a forensic accountant, revealed that Nachamie had looted almost $1 million from the firm's accounts. (Spizz 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 95). After Spizz reported Nachamie's misconduct, law enforcement authorities investigated the matter; Nachamie was eventually convicted of grand larceny and falsifying business records, sentenced to a term of imprisonment, disbarred, and ordered to pay restitution amounting to $430,556.00. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 97).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Nachamie thereafter declared bankruptcy, during which the judgment the firm had obtained against him was found to be non-dischargeable. (Spizz 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 99-100). During the bankruptcy proceedings, the IRS accepted an Offer in Compromise to settle Nachamie's personal tax liabilities as well as the trust fund penalties against him arising out of the same facts as those that spurred the instant litigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 101). This agreement resulted in Nachamie paying $185,646.00 of the over $1.6 million he owed in personal income tax and trust fund penalties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 102).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

On March 21, 2016, the Government filed a third-party complaint against Todtman and Nachamie seeking to obtain a judgment on the outstanding tax penalties assessed against them. (Dkt. # 29). On April 28, 2016, the Government voluntarily dismissed its claims against Nachamie after he entered an Offer in Compromise with the Government to resolve the trust fund penalties assessed against him.

Todtman Was a Responsible Person\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Viewed within this legal framework, the record eliminates any genuine dispute of fact as to whether Todtman was a responsible person under \u00a7 6672. Todtman not only founded the firm that eventually became Todtman, Nachamie, Spizz &amp; Johns, P.C., but was also President and one-third owner of that firm for the periods for which the Government assessed tax penalties against him. And even taking as true Todtman's assertion that he \"was denied independent access to the firm's checkbooks and check authorization from 2008,\" he admits that \"he could still sign checks when it was demanded of him by, or authorized by, the other partners.\" (Todtman 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 110).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   As it happens, Todtman's current assertion that he required the other shareholders' approval to sign checks on the firm's behalf is undercut by his testimony that he would sign checks if other shareholders were unavailable. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Todtman 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 5 (\"Todtman was denied independent access to the firm's checkbooks and check authorization from 2008, though he could still sign checks when it was demanded of him by, or authorized by, the other partners.\"),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Todtman Dep. 60:14-25 (\"[I]f no one was in the office, if [Nachamie] was not in the office and [Spizz] was not available, and the bills or checks had to be sent out, they would bring them in to me.\") ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The record as a\n   whole negates Todtman's claim that he was not a responsible party at the firm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fiataruolo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513832\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/8/930/#p938\">\n    8 F.3d at 939\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (A responsible party need not have \"absolute authority\" or \"the final word on which creditors are to be paid or how funds are to be allocated.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Indeed, Todtman's own admissions both during and before this litigation support the Court's conclusion. Todtman completed a tax form related to the tax penalties at issue in which he admitted to satisfying nearly every factor courts examine in determining responsibility for trust fund tax payments, including-from 1978 through 2010-determining the firm's financial policy, paying bills and creditors, opening or closing bank accounts, guaranteeing loans, signing checks, making federal tax deposits, submitting payroll tax returns, and making employment decisions. (Tong Decl., Ex. 14).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fiataruolo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513832\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/8/930/#p938\">\n    8 F.3d at 939\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As Todtman stated during his deposition, \"If it wasn't for Todtman, there wouldn't have been a firm.\" (Todtman Dep. 148:17-18). And this testimony comports with that of his coworkers and colleagues, who indicated that they viewed Todtman as the firm's manager and that they interacted primarily with Todtman upon discovering the firm's tax delinquencies. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lynn Dep. 23:5-17;\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 24:14-23; Newman Dep. 77:4-20). In short, Todtman would be unable to disprove at trial, and has not even raised a genuine dispute of fact, that he was a responsible person under \u00a7 6672(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Spizz Was a Responsible Person\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Although Spizz may not have exercised his authority over the firm's finances to the same extent as Todtman, the Court's analysis is not so constrained that it can disregard the authority he did possess: \"The inquiry focuses on whether an individual\n   <em>\n    could have\n   </em>\n   exerted influence\" to avoid tax delinquency, and \"a person\n   <em>\n    need not ... actually exercise authority\n   </em>\n   to be held a responsible party for the payment of withheld taxes.\"\n   <em>\n    Fiataruolo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513832\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/8/930/#p938\">\n    8 F.3d at 939\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphases added). Abundant evidence in the record proves this point. Like Todtman, from 2009 through 2011, Spizz controlled one-third of the firm's shares, and during that period he was acting Vice President of the firm. And he, along with Nachamie, exercised their managerial authority in June 2010, first by removing financial responsibility from Todtman and then by assuming that same responsibility. This evinces, as was true all along, that Spizz held more than mere \"technical authority,\" and that he could have been more involved in the firm's financial decisions had he earlier so chosen.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513832\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/8/930/#p938\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Spizz argues that other shareholders at the firm were responsible persons during the relevant time period; Todtman controlled the firm's finances during the relevant tax quarters of 2009 through 2010, while Nachamie controlled the firm's finances during the relevant tax quarters of 2011 and 2012.

Indeed, he admitted during his deposition that he \"ha[d] an understanding that the firm was required to make employer tax payments on a quarterly basis[.]\" (Todtman Dep. 102:11-14).

But even taking this as true-and one could be forgiven for any difficulty in so doing-Todtman's purported ignorance on this point amounts to a reckless disregard for the risk that the firm would fail to pay the trust fund taxes, given Todtman's responsibility over the firm's tax payments in conjunction with his signing-off on the tax forms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7393729\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/717/188/#p191\">\n    717 F.Supp. at 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And had Todtman taken greater care, he would have been on notice of the firm's existing tax delinquencies and thus could have been more vigilant in shoring up the firm's tax payments during subsequent quarters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11554728\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/196/339/#p346\">\n    196 F.3d at 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Willful conduct may also include a ... failure to investigate ... after having notice that withholding taxes have not been remitted to the Government.\" (first ellipses added) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) );\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7393729\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/717/188/#p191\">\n    717 F.Supp. at 194-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that failure to examine known fiscal problems such as recordkeeping \"constitutes the reckless disregard that meets the willfulness requirement\").

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Todtman 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 23). Todtman contends that he \"did not have the authority during the subject period to determine which checks were written.\" (Todtman Br. 8). But such authority is not required for a finding of willfulness, and even if it were, as discussed above, Todtman had sufficient authority within the firm to be responsible for the firm's handling of tax collection and payment. Todtman also takes issue with \"the Government['s] ... stance, that any payment not to the Trust Fund is unlawful, even an ordinary business expenditure if taxes are outstanding.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). But courts have long recognized that payments such as wages and other ordinary business expenses, if paid while trust fund taxes remain outstanding, support a finding of willfulness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hochstein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10532658\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/900/543/#p546\">\n    900 F.2d at 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (collecting cases);\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7393729\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/717/188/#p191\">\n    717 F.Supp. at 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Therefore, the record negates any claim by Todtman that he did not willfully withhold trust fund taxes for the relevant periods of 2009 and 2010, and, having defeated\n   both elements of his claim, the Government is entitled to summary judgment in its favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Spizz Willfully Failed to Remit Trust Fund Taxes\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The analysis of Spizz's conduct proceeds in a slightly different manner. Because Spizz learned of his firm's tax delinquencies no later than June 10, 2010, the Court shall bifurcate its analysis of his mental state, first analyzing this element for the tax periods before June 2010, and then applying the same inquiry to the tax periods after that time. Although the record supports a finding of willfulness both before and after June 2010, as explained below, these conclusions follow from distinct theories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Pre-June 2010 Tax Periods\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   As stated above, a responsible person with a reasonable belief that a company is current on its tax payments may nonetheless be liable for tax delinquencies if, when the person learned of the delinquencies, the company had unencumbered assets that the person failed to apply toward the delinquencies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11554728\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/196/339/#p346\">\n    196 F.3d at 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For the tax periods before June 2010, although Spizz may have had a reasonable belief that the firm was current in remitting trust fund taxes, he cannot establish on this record (or, again, raise a genuine dispute of material fact) that the firm lacked unencumbered assets to pay off the existing tax liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Spizz testified that he first learned of the firm's 2009 and 2010 tax delinquencies on June 10, 2010 (Spizz Dep. 86:4-22), and the Government presents no evidence to rebut this contention (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Gov't 56.1 \u00b6 44 (\"No later than June 10, 2010, Spizz learned that [the firm] had not been remitting trust fund taxes to the IRS since June 2009.\") ). Nor does the Government present any evidence of financial activity at the firm that would have put Spizz on notice of outstanding tax liabilities at an earlier time. Spizz thus presents sufficient evidence to establish his reasonable belief that the trust fund taxes were current before June 2010. Given this reasonable belief, the Court must determine whether, at that time, the firm had unencumbered assets available to pay down the outstanding tax liability, in which case Spizz's failure to apply those assets toward the trust fund taxes would constitute willfulness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11554728\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/196/339/#p346\">\n    196 F.3d at 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court answers this inquiry in the affirmative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The Second Circuit has not settled on a definition of \"unencumbered assets\" in this setting. But, as the most recent circuit to consider this issue in detail has observed, \"[e]very other circuit to have addressed the issue has established a narrow rule that only a legal prohibition on the expenditure of funds renders the assets encumbered.\"\n   <em>\n    Nakano v.

For purposes of this motion, this Court adopts the standard proffered by those Circuits to have addressed the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   In support of his claim of encumbrance, Spizz presents evidence to suggest that as of June 2010, (i) Sterling National Bank held a lien against all of the firm's assets and (ii) the firm's operating account carried a negative balance of over $20,000. (Spizz 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 77, 79). Considering first the former, this Court notes that the Second Circuit has not opined as to the degree to which a lien can be considered an encumbrance. However, the Sixth Circuit-the Court of Appeals to have addressed this issue most directly-has recognized that, even under a broader definition of \"encumbered assets\" that it ultimately declined to follow, \"[t]he existence of a superior lien, without more, does not create an encumbrance for purposes of \u00a7 6672 [ ], [as] there must be conditions\n   imposed by the lender which render the funds unavailable for payment to the IRS of the trust fund taxes for the time period in question.\"\n   <em>\n    Bell v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9059383\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/355/387/\">\n    355 F.3d 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 395 n.7 (6th Cir. 2004) (alterations in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Premo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6112023\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/116/515/\">\n    116 B.R. 515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 535 n.34 (Bankr. E.D. Mich. 1990) ). Spizz presents no evidence that the lien here carried such conditions. The lien therefore does not render the firm's assets encumbered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   As to the firm's supposed negative operating account balance, the bank statement from June 10, 2010, the date on which Spizz learned of the tax deficiency, establishes only that the firm arrived at a negative balance after disbursing over $80,000 on that date. Although the account's ending balance on June 10, 2010, was overdrawn by $20,314.16, the beginning balance on June 10 was $63,762.83. (Operating Account June 2010). Indeed, the largest deduction from the firm's operating account on that date was a transfer to another one of the firm's accounts in the amount of $79,117.70, which funds the firm then debited toward payroll. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6112023\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/116/515/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; Payroll Account June 2010). The record thus establishes not only that, on the date that Spizz became aware of the tax liability, the firm had funds available to pay trust fund taxes, but also that the firm diverted those funds to other creditors. The record thus negates Spizz's claim that the firm lacked unencumbered funds, and, by extension, his claim that he did not willfully fail to remit trust fund taxes accruing before June 10, 2010.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Callaghan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7652411\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/943/320/#p324\">\n    943 F.Supp. at 326-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Plaintiff's admission that company \"had at least $17,500 in assets that could have been used to reduce its tax liability\" that were used \"to run the business rather than pay the Government constitutes willfulness.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Post-June 2010 Tax Periods\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Spizz contends that after June 2010, while Nachamie was overseeing the firm's finances, he (Spizz) \"reasonably believed that the payroll taxes were being paid.\" (Spizz Br. 16). But courts have found willfulness where a responsible person fails to assure that a company timely remits trust fund taxes after having notice of previous tax delinquencies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11554728\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/196/339/#p346\">\n    196 F.3d at 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, after Spizz became aware of the firm's tax liabilities in June 2010, he could no longer maintain a reasonable belief that other members of the firm would timely remit trust fund taxes. To the contrary, \"these problems gave rise to the duty to follow up and see that the taxes were paid,\" and Spizz's \"[f]ailure to do so constitutes the reckless disregard that meets the willfulness requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7393729\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/717/188/#p191\">\n    717 F.Supp. at 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted). Therefore, the record negates Spizz's claim that he did not willfully withhold trust fund taxes for the relevant periods both before and after June 10, 2010.

This assertion misperceives the information contained in the Tong Declaration. The amounts listed in the text are the amounts the law firm failed to pay for those periods. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tong Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-24). The Tong Declaration also specifies the amounts the IRS assessed as penalties against both Spizz and Todtman and the remaining liability as of March 27, 2017.

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Todtman 56.1 Opp. \u00b6 108). Nevertheless, the Court interprets references to Todtman as \"managing partner\" of the firm in a functional rather than formal sense.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    Todtman adds that this demotion was in addition to his previous loss of access to and authority over the firm's checkbooks.

Spizz's declaration clarifies that he \"do[es] not take issue with the amounts the Government claims,\" but \"contend[s] that payments that were earmarked to be applied to the tax obligation for the first quarter of 2012 were misapplied to the second and fourth quarters of 2009.\" (Spizz Decl. \u00b6 22). The Government concedes that Spizz directed revenue to pay down the trust fund taxes, but maintains that this effort \"correspondingly reduced the amount of the trust fund recovery penalty assessments against Spizz and Todtman.\" (Gov't Br. 9 n.2).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    In any event, because the Court grants summary judgment against Spizz and Todtman for the entirety of the claimed amounts, and because the Government assessed penalties against Spizz for tax periods in both 2009 and 2012, the challenged allocation of payments is immaterial to Spizz's liability.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    In his opposition to the Government's statement of undisputed material facts, Todtman argues that the assessments against him \"were devoid of predicate notice pursuant to [26 U.S.C.] \u00a7 6672(b), and thus were not duly assessed.\" (Todtman 56.1 Opp. \u00b6\u00b6 71-72, 75).
