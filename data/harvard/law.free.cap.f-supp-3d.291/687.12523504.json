This is a tenuous case involving a technical violation, and the harm is difficult to pinpoint. Nonetheless, in a motion for class certification, it is established law that \"merits inquiry is not permissible when [the] merits issue is unrelated to a Rule 23 requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Cmty. Bank of N. Va.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787748\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/622/275/#p294\">\n    622 F.3d 275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 294 (3d Cir. 2010) (alteration in original) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Consequently, because the plaintiff has Article III standing and the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 have been met, the court will reluctantly grant the motion for class certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 30, 2016, the plaintiff, Corine O'Dell, filed a complaint alleging that the defendant, National Recovery Agency (\"NRA\"), violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\"). Doc. No. 1. NRA filed an answer to the complaint on December 9, 2016. Doc. No. 4. O'Dell filed an amended complaint on December 16, 2016. Doc. No. 7. NRA filed an answer to the amended complaint on December 30, 2016. Doc. No. 9. As this matter was originally scheduled to proceed to compulsory arbitration under this court's local civil rules, the court entered an order on January 17, 2017, which required the parties to complete all discovery by the date of the arbitration hearing. Doc. No. 17. On March 29, 2017, the court granted the parties' joint motion to extend the discovery period and directed the clerk of court to reschedule the arbitration hearing for on or about June 13, 2017. Doc. No. 21. At NRA's request, the court later entered an order on May 12, 2017, continuing the arbitration hearing for an additional period of approximately 60 days. Doc. No. 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   O'Dell filed a motion to amend the amended complaint on May 16, 2017, which the court granted without opposition after a telephone conference with counsel for the parties on June 8, 2017. Doc. Nos. 36, 42. On the same date, and at the court's direction, the clerk of court docketed\n   O'Dell's second amended complaint. Doc. No. 43. In the second amended complaint, O'Dell brought claims for violations of the FDCPA in two individual counts and one class action count.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Am. Compl. at 13-15. Under the class action count, O'Dell indicated that she would ask the court to certify two separate classes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Account return class:\n   </strong>\n   (a) all consumers with a Pennsylvania address; (b) that incurred a debt from Lancaster General Health; (c) for which Defendant sought to collect on the debt; (d) that thereafter the debt was returned to Lancaster General Health; (e) and subsequently placed back with Defendant; (f) after which Defendant placed a trade line on the consumers' credit reports for the returned debt; (g) that reported the date placed for collection as the date it had received the account the second time; (h) during a period beginning one year prior to the filing of this initial action and ending 21 days after the service of the initial complaint filed in this action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Improper date reported:\n   </strong>\n   (a) all consumers with a Pennsylvania address; (b) that incurred a debt from Lancaster General Health; (c) for which Defendant sought to collect on the debt by placing a trade line on the consumers' credit reports; (d) and reporting the date placed for collection as the date of first delinquency (e) during a period beginning one year prior to the filing of this initial action and ending 21 days after the service of the initial complaint filed in this action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   NRA filed an answer to the second amended complaint on June 16, 2017. Doc. No. 46. The court entered an order on July 6, 2017, which,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , (1) directed the parties to engage in fact and class certification discovery, and (2) set a schedule for O'Dell to move for class certification and for NRA to respond to the motion. Doc. No. 49. The court granted NRA's motion to file an amended answer to the second amended complaint on July 24, 2017. Doc. Nos. 50-51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   O'Dell filed a motion for class certification on September 14, 2017. Doc. No. 59. In the motion, O'Dell clarified that she is now only seeking certification of one class, rather than two.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. for Class Certification at 1. NRA responded to the motion for class certification on October 13, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc. No. 67. O'Dell filed a reply to NRA's response on October 23, 2017. Doc. No. 69. On October 31, 2017, the court heard oral argument on the motion. Doc. No. 72.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On February 1, 2017, the court held a telephone conference with counsel for the parties during which O'Dell stipulated to dismissal of her individual claims in counts I and II of the second amended complaint. Doc. Nos. 74, 75. The court then entered an order dismissing those counts from the second amended complaint without prejudice. Doc. No. 75. Thus, the only remaining claim is the class claim and the motion for class certification is now ripe for adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The plaintiff, Corine O'Dell, owed eight medical debts to Lancaster General Health (\"LGH\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Am. Compl. at 2, Doc. No. 43. After O'Dell failed to pay LGH, LGH assigned these debts to NRA for collection.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   In its effort to collect these debts, NRA placed eight trade lines\n   on O'Dell's credit report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. for Class Certification at Ex.

In accordance with LGH's request, NRA returned the accounts to LGH.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dickinsheets Dep. at 42, 51. Among those accounts were O'Dell's eight accounts, accounts belonging to the putative class members, and others.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 42-52;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. at ECF pp. 6-7; Def. National Recovery Agency's Br. in Opp. to Pl.'s Mot. for Class Certification (\"Def.'s Br.\") at ECF pp. 8-9, Doc. No. 68. Eventually, after LGH finished the computer upgrades, LGH turned the accounts back over to NRA for collection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dickinsheets Dep. at 50-52. Once NRA received the accounts from LGH, NRA listed the accounts as new, rather than returned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Specifically, \"NRA issued new account numbers, reported the 'date placed for collection' as the date the accounts were returned and inputted, and also reported the 'date of first delinquency' as the date the accounts were returned and inputted.\" Pl.'s Mem. at ECF p. 6 (citation omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at Exs. A, B, Doc. Nos. 59-5, 59-6 (listing placement date as December 12, 2015, for most of the LGH accounts); Dickinsheets Dep. at 51-54. O'Dell contends that NRA made this mistake with thousands of accounts and that \"[b]y changing these dates and making them more recent, NRA's conduct resulted in lowering Plaintiff's credit score and credit worthiness.\" Pl.'s Mem. at ECF p. 7;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. A (listing returned LGH accounts). O'Dell further contends that by \"making the debts more recent it had the effect of 're-aging' the debts so that they would stay on Plaintiff's credit report two years longer than they should.\" Pl.'s Mem. at ECF p. 7. She alleges that NRA's actions, as to these returned LGH accounts, violated the FDCPA.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at ECF pp. 6-8. She asks this court to certify a class for individuals residing in zip code 17512-a putative class of approximately 1,130 members.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at ECF p. 14;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. for Class Certification at Ex.

NRA contends that O'Dell does not meet the requirements of Article III standing. Def.'s Br. at ECF p. 9. A class representative in a putative class action must show\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   that they personally have been injured, not that injury has been suffered by other, unidentified members of the class to which they belong and which they purport to represent.

The only claim she now seeks to bring is the same as the class claim,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that NRA violated the FDCPA when it inaccurately reported the dates on her trade lines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Am. Compl. at 15-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Factually, O'Dell's claim as it relates to this legal theory is substantially similar, if not identical, to the claims of the other class members. Legally, both O'Dell and the class members need to show that improperly aging accounts is a violation of the FDCPA. While it is unclear whether O'Dell and the class members need to show that NRA intended to re-age the accounts or whether this is a strict liability violation, the court can find no reason why O'Dell would pursue a different legal theory than the other class members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   O'Dell contends that this is a strict liability violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Reply at ECF pp. 22-23. She argues that 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(c) is an affirmative defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22. She further contends that it does not apply here because this was not a bona fide error and NRA did not have procedures in place to prevent it from occurring.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Section 1692k(c) prevents a finding of liability in cases where the violation was an unintentional, bona fide error and the defendant had procedures in place that were \"reasonably adapted to avoid any such error[s].\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(c) (alteration to original). In light of this provision, O'Dell and the other class members may need to show that the purported error was either intentional or not bona fide. But this is unlikely to impact the legal theory O'Dell pursues. Because each account in this case was part of the same event (LGH returning accounts to NRA and NRA re-aging them), each class member (and O'Dell) will have to prove the same level of intent. As the same intent requirement will apply to O'Dell's and all the other class members' claims, the same legal theory will almost certainly apply to O'Dell's and all the other class members' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The only possible relevant legal or factual difference here is the\n   <em>\n    number\n   </em>\n   of improperly aged trade lines. NRA contends that because O'Dell had more trade lines, her damages are potentially greater than most of the other class members. Def.'s Br. at ECF p. 18. NRA's argument is not compelling because the number of trade lines is unlikely to affect any potential damages award in this case because it appears O'Dell is pursuing statutory damages under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k. Under this provision, the court can award \"such amount as the court may allow for all other class members, without regard to a minimum individual recovery, not to exceed the lesser of $500,000 or 1 per centum of the net worth of the debt collector.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(a)(2)(B). Thus, NRA's attempts to characterize the damages award as compensatory-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that 8 trade lines equals more damages-is most likely inaccurate. Under the statutory award scheme pursued by O'Dell, it is unlikely that she would recover more damages on the basis of the number of trade lines on her credit report.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Reply at ECF p. 26\n   (\"Plaintiff is not entitled to more damages than any Class Member because Plaintiff is pursuing only statutory damages provided by the FDCPA.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   NRA's other argument, that \"Plaintiff's class definitions completely ignore her FCRA allegations and additional FDCPA claims against NRA,\" Def.'s Br. at ECF p. 18, is irrelevant in light of her stipulation to dismiss her individual claims. For these reasons, the court finds that O'Dell's claim is typical of the claims of the putative class members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

The majority of NRA's arguments center on potential conflicts between O'Dell's individual claims and the class claim. Def.'s Br. at ECF pp. 18-20. Because O'Dell has dropped her individual claims, these arguments are no longer relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   On the class claim, the only conflict NRA identifies is that O'Dell \"has significantly greater damages under the FDCPA due to the number of LGH accounts she alleges were re-aged by NRA on her credit report.\" Def.'s Br. at ECF p. 20. This argument is unavailing for the same reasons discussed in the section on typicality. Namely, because O'Dell and the class are only pursuing statutory damages, the number of trade lines placed on O'Dell's account will not cause her to recover greater damages. Moreover, even if they did, this would not be a sufficient conflict to destroy adequacy. O'Dell would still be incentivized to maximize her recovery under her claim, and because she is pursuing the same legal theory as the rest of the class, she would also be pursuing a maximum recovery for the class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The court cannot find, nor has NRA identified, any other potential conflicts that would destroy O'Dell's adequacy as a class\n   representative. There is no indication in the record that she is unfamiliar with the facts of this case or that she is insufficiently interested in litigating this action.

Zemel Law's lengthy and detailed briefs in this case are indicative of adequate resources, time, and personnel, and the court can find no reason why Zemel Law will not continue devoting sufficient resources to this case. Moreover, this case is not a particularly complex class action lawsuit. It involves a single legal question: whether NRA's re-aging of these LGH accounts was a violation of the FDCPA.

In oral argument, NRA contended that its net worth is $84,000. A net worth this low could foreseeably result in a\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   recovery for each individual class member (one percent of $84,000 is $840; $840 split amongst a class of 1,300 members is approximately $0.65 per class member). If the putative class members were to pursue these claims on their own, they could recover actual damages or statutory damages up to $1,000.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(a)(2)(A).

At oral argument, O'Dell contended that NRA is about to receive a windfall recovery in a pending claim (purportedly in the millions of dollars).

R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(B) advisory committee's note to 2003 amendment (\"The opportunity to request exclusion from a proposed settlement is limited to members of a (b)(3) class.\"). Because Rule 23(b)(3) gives class members the option to opt out of the class, class members who desire to bring their own claims can still do so. Thus, NRA's professed concern is adequately protected even when the class is certified,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , class members who desire to win greater awards from NRA can still pursue them. Consequently, the court finds that the first factor weighs in favor of a finding of superiority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Second, the court is not aware of, nor has NRA identified, any class members who have initiated \"any litigation concerning the controversy....\" Fed.

Additionally, the events giving rise to this case occurred in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and O'Dell and the defendant reside in this district. And finally, because the class has been limited to class members with a 17512 zip code, it is very likely that all (or at least, most) of class members will reside within this district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   NRA, however, has argued that O'Dell's decision to limit the class to zip code 17512 actually cuts against a finding of superiority. Specifically, NRA argues that by limiting the putative class to \"approximately 1,600 members in one Pennsylvania zip code....Plaintiff's counsel failed to adequately protect the right [sic] and interests of the other 63,000 consumers that were allegedly affected by NRA's reporting of\n   LGH debts in 2016.\" Def.'s Br. at ECF pp. 20-21 (internal citation omitted). This argument is also unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   While the Third Circuit has yet to address whether a class action brought under section 1692k can be limited by geography, the Seventh Circuit persuasively addressed that question in\n   <em>\n    Mace v.

In that case, the court rejected the defendant's argument that the statutory cap of $500,000 should be interpreted to exclude multiple classes based on geography.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"833947\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/109/338/#p343\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"833947\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/109/338/#p343\">\n    at 344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court noted that the plain language of the statute did not prohibit multiple classes.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"833947\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/109/338/#p343\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court also noted that there is \"no way of telling whether...repeated class actions are possible or likely....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"833947\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/109/338/#p343\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The court agrees with the Seventh Circuit's focus on the text of the statute. The statute broadly states: \"in the case of a class action....\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(a)(2)(B). It does not cabin the number of class actions that can be pursued or prohibit the use of geographical limitations in the definition of the class. Because the unrestrictive language of the statute is clear, the court does not need to wade into the well-articulated policy arguments presented by NRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Brief at ECF p. 20-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Fourth, \"the likely difficulties of managing [this] class action\" are small. As discussed above in the sections on commonality and typicality, there is only one relevant legal issue and there are few, if any, factual differences. Moreover, the answer to that legal question will likely resolve every single claim in this case. Consequently, the managerial challenges presented by this class action are small.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Ascertainability\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The Third Circuit has held that \"the members of a [23(b)(3) ] class [must be] identifiable at the moment of certification.\"\n   <em>\n    Shelton v.
