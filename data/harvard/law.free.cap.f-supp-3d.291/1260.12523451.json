Based on that detailed review and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving parties, I find that there are numerous, genuine issues of material fact that preclude summary judgment on all of these motions. Thus, the Plaintiff's motion and the BOP's motion for summary judgment are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As to the individual Defendants' motion for summary judgment, they invoke the defense of qualified immunity, thus, I begin my analysis with the doctrine's relevant standards. \"In civil rights actions seeking damages from governmental officials, those officials may raise the affirmative defense of qualified immunity, which protects all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Holland ex rel.

Once the affirmative defense is raised by a defendant, the burden shifts to the plaintiff to come forward with facts or allegations sufficient to show both \"that the defendant's actions violated a constitutional or statutory right\" and that the right \"was clearly established at the time of the defendant's unlawful conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Medina v.

Kan. July 24, 2008) (unpublished) (\"a delay in providing medical care does not violate the Eighth Amendment unless the plaintiff has suffered 'substantial harm' from the delay\"; lifelong handicap, permanent loss, or considerable pain amounts to substantial harm). \"[P]rison officials who 'actually knew of a substantial risk to inmate health or safety may be found free\n   from liability if they responded reasonably to the risk, even if the harm ultimately was not averted.' \"\n   <em>\n    Howard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064418\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/534/1227/#p1235\">\n    534 F.3d at 1239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 2008) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Farmer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147494\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/825/#p834\">\n    511 U.S. at 844-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147494\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/825/#p834\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). \"An official responds to a known risk in an objectively unreasonable manner if he knew of ways to reduce the harm but knowingly or recklessly declined to act.\"\n   <em>\n    Howard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4064418\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/534/1227/#p1235\">\n    534 F.3d at 1239-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations and modifications omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Here, Defendants argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity because there is no genuine issue of material fact that they subjectively understood the serious medical risk faced by Plaintiff, yet disregarded it. The Defendants contend that they provided Plaintiff with medical care that was not so deficient that it caused Plaintiff to suffer a serious harm or substantial risk of serious harm. The Defendants knew Plaintiff had Type I diabetes and provided medical treatment. However, I find that the record reflects numerous, genuine issues of material facts regarding whether a constitutional violation occurred. For example:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 Whether the Defendants appropriately administered Plaintiff's insulin.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 Whether the Defendants provided Plaintiff with appropriate medical supplies to manage his Type I diabetes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 Whether the Defendants appropriately responded to Plaintiff's symptoms and/or complaints regarding his Type I diabetes and whether Plaintiff has suffered serious harm or substantial risk of serious harm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Clearly Established Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   I next turn to whether the Defendants' actions violated clearly established law. \"A right is clearly established ... when a Supreme Court or Tenth Circuit decision is on point, or if the clearly established weight of authority from other courts shows that the right must be as the plaintiff maintains.\"\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

In a case where a prisoner suffered from both hypertension and diabetes and alleged that prison officials denied him insulin and proper medical treatment, the Tenth Circuit held that with regard to deliberate indifference, \"a plaintiff must establish that defendant(s) knew he faced a substantial risk of harm and disregarded that risk, 'by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it.' \"\n   <em>\n    Hunt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1753267\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/199/1220/#p1224\">\n    199 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1224 (citing\n   <em>\n    Farmer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147494\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/825/#p834\">\n    511 U.S. at 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147494\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/825/#p834\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Thus, viewing Plaintiff's evidence in the light most favorable to him, the law was clearly established that the Defendants' alleged conduct violated the Eighth Amendment. Accordingly, the Defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity, and the motion for summary judgment is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   IV.
