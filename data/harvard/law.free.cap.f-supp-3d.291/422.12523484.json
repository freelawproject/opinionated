(\"Kobalt Music)\" and Downtown Music Publishing LLC (\"Downtown Music\") move to dismiss for insufficient process and insufficient service of process. Twelve of the other Defendants move to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. For the reasons that follow, the motions are granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The Original Work: \"When the Revolution Comes\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Oyewole is a founding member of the spoken-word group The Last Poets. In that role, Oyewole created the song \"When the Revolution Comes\" in 1968. Dkt. No. 91 (FAC) at \u00b6\u00b6 1-4. The song, a poem\n   warning of a coming revolution when \"guns and rifles will be taking the place of poems and essays,\" has a back track that consists of a drum beat and chants. Dkt No. 73, Ex. G (Revolution Audio); Dkt. No. 73, Ex. J (Revolution Lyrics). The revolution that The Last Poets describe has clear racial dimensions. When the revolution comes, the Poets predict, \"Black cultural centers will [be] forts supplying the revolutionaries with food and arms,\" and \"White death will froth the walls of museums and churches breaking the lies that enslaved our mothers.\" Revolution Lyrics. At the end of the song, the instrumental backing stops, and together the performers chant,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   When the revolution comes afros gone be trying to straighten their heads and straightened heads gone be tryin' to wear afros\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   When the revolution comes\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   When the revolution comes\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   When the revolution comes\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   But until then you know and I know n*****s will party and bullshit and party and bullshit and party and bullshit and party and bullshit and party...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Some might even die before the revolution comes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Revolution Lyrics (ellipsis in original). According to Oyewole, the \"sole purpose\" of the lyrics is to \"challenge[ ] and encourage[ ] people to NOT waste time with 'party and bullshit,' but to move towards success.\" FAC at \u00b6 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Oyewole contends that he is the owner of copyright EU 188915 for the musical composition of \"When the Revolution Comes.\" FAC at \u00b6 2. However, the application for registration of copyright EU 188915 lists Douglas Music Corporation as the copyright claimant, though it lists \"Abiodun Oyewole c/o Douglas Music Corp.\" as the author. Dkt. No. 73, Ex. D (EU 188915 Application). According to Oyewole, \"Douglas Music Corporation's interest in the work of Abiodun Oyewole ceased in 1968 and all rights reverted to [Oyewole].\" FAC at \u00b6 5. Oyewole also states that he filed a \"Notice of Copyright Use\" for \"When the Revolution Comes,\" and that in 1996, he registered copyrights for a compact disk recording of \"When the Revolution Comes\" and for a book that contained the lyrics of \"When the Revolution Comes.\" FAC at \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The Secondary Works: \"Party and Bullshit\" and \"Party\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 1993, Christopher Wallace, better known as \"The Notorious B.I.G.\" or \"Biggie Smalls,\" released the song \"Party and Bullshit.\" FAC at \u00b6\u00b6 12-13. The song celebrates Wallace's hip hop lifestyle. It begins with Wallace rapping, \"I was a terror since the public school era / Bathroom passes, cuttin' classes, squeezing asses / Smoking blunts was a daily routine / Since thirteen, a chubby n***a on the scene.\" Dkt. No. 73, Ex. K (B.I.G. Lyrics). The song continues, \"Honeys want to chat / But all we wanna know is 'Where the party at?,' / And can I bring my gat?\" before eventually leading into the chorus: \"Dumbing out, just me and my crew / Cause all we want to do is... / Party... and bullshit, and...\" B.I.G. Lyrics (ellipses in original). The chorus repeats the phrase \"party... and bullshit, and...\" nine times. B.I.G. Lyrics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In 2012, Rita Ora released the pop song \"How We Do (Party),\" which begins, \"And party and bullshit / And party and bullshit / And party and bullshit / And party, and party.\" Dkt. No. 62, Ex. F (Ora Lyrics). The song begins with Ora waking up and asking, \"What went on last night?\" Ora Lyrics. She then sings to her partner, \"You look so sweet while you're dreaming (yeah) / Holding your bottle of Tanqueray (yeah) / It isn't even the weekend / Baby, that's how I know you're the one for me.\" Ora Lyrics. Later, Ora further describes her relationship:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   'Cause when the sun sets baby\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   On the avenue\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   I get that drunk sex feeling\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Yeah, when I'm with you\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   So put your arms around me, baby\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   We're tearing up the town\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   'Cause that's just how we do\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   We got that sweet, hot loving\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Dancing in the dark\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Out in the streets we're running\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Shut down every bar\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   So put your arms around me, baby\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   We're tearing up the town\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   'Cause that's just how we do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Ora Lyrics. The song repeats the lines, \"I wanna party and bullshit / And party and bullshit / And party and bullshit / And party, and party\" several times throughout the song. Ora Lyrics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   According to Oyewole, the use of the phrase \"party and bullshit\" in \"Party and Bullshit\" and in \"Party\" was intended to \"contraven[e]\" the \"original purpose\" of the phrase as used in \"When the Revolution Comes,\" which was to discourage people from partaking in \"party and bullshit.\" FAC at \u00b6 39. Oyewole did not give Defendants permission to use the words \"party and bullshit,\" and, given that Defendants intended to contravene the words' original purpose, they would not have received Oyewole's permission had they sought it. FAC at \u00b6 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    c. The Instant Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On March 14, 2016, Oyewole filed suit against Defendants alleging that \"Party and Bullshit\" and \"Party\" infringe on Oyewole's copyright for \"When the Revolution Comes.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 1. In response to several motions to dismiss, Oyewole filed an amended complaint on September 1, 2016. FAC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Defendants are individuals and entities who performed, composed, produced, published, or distributed \"Party and Bullshit\" or \"Party.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Oyewole claims that Defendants \"publish[ed] and distribute[d]\" the \"crescendo, hook, text, lyrics and sound\" of \"When the Revolution Comes\" without authorization to do so, that they used and sampled Oyewole's \"sound hook and lyrics,\" and that they \"wrongfully appropriated and exploited the punch line, performance, lyrics, poem, rhythmic line, and text.\" FAC at \u00b6\u00b6 35, 37, 42, 44. Specifically, Oyewole contends that \"Party and Bullshit\" samples \"When the Revolution Comes\" and remixes the refrain \"party and bullshit\" without authorization,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   FAC at \u00b6 13, and that \"Party\" \"borrow[s] the refrain, punch line, crescendo, and text hook 'Party and Bullshit' coined by\" Oyewole in \"When the Revolution Comes,\" FAC at \u00b6 19. Oyewole seeks to prevent any further infringement of the \"copyrighted coined hook rap phrase 'Party and Bullshit' by Defendants.\" FAC at \u00b6 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Oyewole includes four counts in his amended complaint: (1) a claim for copyright infringement and declaratory relief; (2) a request for the creation of a constructive trust to prevent unjust enrichment by Defendants from their unauthorized use of Oyewole's copyrights; (3) a demand for an accounting of the sales and distribution of Defendants' unauthorized recordings; and (4) a request for injunctive relief. FAC at \u00b6\u00b6 41-60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendants Kobalt Music and Downtown Music each filed motions to dismiss for insufficient process or insufficient service of process. Dkt. Nos. 45 &amp; 56. Roc Nation LLC has moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim, Dkt. No. 60, as have Jobete Music Co., Inc., Notorious B.I.G. LLC, Universal Music Corp., and Songs of Universal, Inc., Dkt. No. 72. Defendants Andrew Harr, Jermaine Jackson, Trac-N-Field Entertainment LLC, Andre Davidson, Sean Davidson, Warner/Chappell Music Publishing, Inc., and Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC joined the motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim. Dkt. Nos. 76 &amp; 77. Defendants Roc Nation LLC and those who have joined Roc Nation's motion to dismiss are referred to herein as the \"Rita Ora\" Defendants; Jobete Music Co., Inc., Notorious B.I.G. LLC, Universal Music Corp., and Songs of Universal, Inc. and those who have joined their motion to dismiss are referred to as the \"B.I.G. Defendants.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Court turns first to Kobalt Music's and Downtown Music's motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    II. MOTIONS TO DISMISS FOR INSUFFICIENT PROCESS OR INSUFFICIENT SERVICE OF PROCESS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On August 15, 2016, Kobalt Music filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction due to insufficient process and insufficient service of process. Dkt. No. 45. On August 17, 2016, Downtown Music filed a similar motion. Dkt. No. 56. For the reasons below, the Court grants those motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On March 14, 2016, Oyewole filed his original complaint. Dkt. No. 1. By June 20, 2016, more than 90 days after the filing of the complaint, Oyewole had not provided evidence that he had served any of the defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 4. The Court thus required Oyewole to serve the defendants and file proof of service no later than July 11, 2016. Dkt. No. 4. The Court warned Oyewole that the failure to serve defendants on or before July 11, 2016, would result in dismissal of the action. Dkt. No. 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In a letter dated July 13, 2016, Oyewole informed the Court that due to a miscommunication, the process server had delayed service, but the letter stated that as many defendants as possible were served on or before July 11, 2016. Dkt. No. 21. Oyewole warned, though, that there might be a delay in filing proof of service for some defendants. Dkt. No. 21. On July 15, 2016, the Court extended the deadline to file proof of service to July 22, 2016, and stated that \"[n]o additional extensions [would] be granted.\" Dkt. No. 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   On July 11, 2016, Oyewole filed purported proofs of service on, inter alia, Kobalt Music, Dkt. No. 7, and Downtown Music, Dkt. No. 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The proof of service on Kobalt Music consists of an affidavit in which the server swears that he served Zach Ayer at 220 West 42nd Street, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10036. Dkt. No. 7. The affidavit states that Ayer \"is a member of the legal department at Kobalt Music, authorized to accept service on behalf of Kobalt Music.\" Dkt. No. 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The proof of service on Downtown Music consists of an affidavit in which the sever swears that he served Molly Martin on July 8, 2016. Dkt. No. 10. The affidavit indicates that Martin is designated by law to accept service on behalf of Downtown Music. Dkt. No. 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Kobalt Music and Downtown Music have moved to dismiss the claims against them under Rules 12(b)(4) and (5) for insufficient process and/or insufficient service of process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 45 &amp; 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Kobalt Music and Downtown Music argue that the claims should be dismissed\n   under Rule 12(b)(5) because they were never actually served. According to Kobalt Music, Zach Ayer worked at Kobalt Music Publishing America, Inc., which is a different entity from Kobalt Music Publishing Ltd., the defendant in this action. Dkt. No. 49 (Kobalt Memo) at 3-4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 47 (Arnay Dec.) at \u00b6 2 (\"The office located at 220 West 42nd Street, 11th Floor, New York, New York is the place of business of Kobalt Music Publishing America, Inc.,\" not of Defendant Kobalt Music Publishing Ltd., \"an English entity which does not maintain an office in the City of New York.\"). Kobalt Music asserts that, in any event, Ayer had no managerial or supervisory authority and was not authorized to accept service of process for either company. Kobalt Memo at 3-4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 46 (Ayer Dec.) at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4 (Ayer stating that (1) he never told the process server that he was authorized to accept service on behalf of Kobalt Music, and (2) he is not in fact authorized to accept service on behalf of Kobalt Music); Arnay Dec. at \u00b6\u00b6 3-4 (General Counsel of Kobalt Music Publishing America, Inc. stating that Ayer has never been authorized to accept service on behalf of Kobalt Music). Similarly, Downtown Music states that Molly Martin was working as a receptionist at the time that service was allegedly effectuated, that she is not a member of Downtown Music's legal department, and that she has never been authorized to accept service on behalf of Downtown Music. Dkt No. 59 (Downtown Memo) at 3-5; Dkt. No. 58 (Bergman Dec.) at \u00b6\u00b6 2-4. Martin has submitted a declaration to the same effect, and she swears that she never told the process server that she was authorized to accept service on behalf of Downtown Music. Dkt. No. 57 (Martin Dec.) at \u00b6\u00b6 2-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Both defendants also argue that the claims should be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(4) because the summons did not include all of the items required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4. Kobalt Memo at 2; Downtown Memo at 2. Specifically, the defendants assert that the summons did not contain the name of the court, list all of the parties, state the name and address of the plaintiff's attorney, contain a signature from clerk of the court, or bear the court's seal. Kobalt Memo at 2; Downtown Memo at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Because the Court concludes that service on Ayer and Martin did not constitute sufficient service of process on Kobalt Music or Downtown Music, it does not consider the arguments that the process was insufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In deciding a Rule 12(b)(5) motion, a court must look to Rule 4, which governs the content, issuance, and service of a summons.\n   <em>\n    DeLuca v.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4 provides that service of process on a corporation may be completed \"by delivering a copy of the summons and of the complaint to an officer, a managing or general agent, or any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(h)(1)(B). Alternatively, a corporation may be served in the same manner allowed by the state in which the district court is located or service is made-here, New York.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(e)(1), (h)(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Under New York law, a corporation may be served through an \"officer, director, managing or general agent, or cashier or assistant cashier or ... any other agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service.\" N.Y. C.P.L.R. 311(a)(1). Additionally, service may be made on the secretary of state as agent of a corporation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4023542\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/695/54/#p64\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Bus.%20Corp.%20Law%20%C2%A7%20306\">\n    N.Y.

Ayer Dec. at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4; Arnay Dec. at \u00b6\u00b6 3-4. Indeed, in their declarations, Ayer and the General Counsel of Kobalt Music Publishing America, Inc. state that Ayer did not work for-and had no affiliation with-Kobalt Music at all. Ayer Dec. at \u00b6 4; Arnay Dec. at \u00b6 4. Oyewole has not provided any evidence to rebut those statements. Accordingly, Oyewole has not shown that he effected sufficient service of process on Kobalt Music.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Likewise, Downtown Music has provided evidence that (1) Molly Martin never told the process server that she was authorized to accept service on behalf of Downtown Music, and (2) Martin is not an officer or director of Downtown Music, has no managerial or supervisory authority, and has never been authorized to accept service on behalf of Downtown Music. Martin Dec. at \u00b6\u00b6 2-3; Bergman Dec. at \u00b6\u00b6 2-3. In response, Oyewole suggests that Martin was in fact authorized to accept service, or at least indicated to the process server that she was. Dkt. No. 107 at \u00b6\u00b6 7-8. However, Oyewole has offered no evidence to support this claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Oyewole has thus failed to demonstrate that service of process on Downtown Music was sufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In response to Kobalt Music's and Downtown Music's motions, Oyewole emphasizes that he had difficulty with the service company he hired, that he should not be penalized for their mistakes, and that the Court should allow him to perfect service, if necessary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

Although Oyewole complains of his process server's negligence, Opp. to Kobalt at 6, he has not demonstrated that he actively monitored the server's performance. Indeed, Oyewole submitted a letter dated July 13, 2016, stating that Oyewole's counsel contacted the process service company\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the Court issued its June 20, 2016 Order and only at that point \"ascertain[ed] the status of service.\" Dkt. No. 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In addition, the Court declines to grant a discretionary extension of the time period to serve Kobalt Music and Downtown Music. Oyewole failed to serve any defendants within the time period required by Rule 4(m) and then, when given another opportunity to effect service, again failed to timely serve Kobalt Music and Downtown Music. When the Court extended the deadline for service, the Court cautioned Oyewole that failure to serve Defendants in that time period would result in dismissal. Dkt. No. 4. And when the Court gave Oyewole an additional 11 days to file proofs of service, it made clear that no further extensions would be granted. Dkt. No. 22.

Revolution Lyrics. The Last Poets want their listeners to prepare for the revolution, appreciate its gravity, and commit themselves to it; they explain that only things of substance will survive the revolution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Revolution Lyrics (\"When the revolution comes/ Transit cops will be crushed by the trains after losing their guns and blood will run through the streets of Harlem drowning anything without substance\"); (\"The cost of revolution is 360 degrees understand the cycle that never ends ... Speak not of revolution until you are willing to eat rats to survive.\"). At the end of the song, the Poets criticize those who \"will party and bullshit\" until the revolution comes, and they suggest that, as a result of the partying and bullshit, \"[s]ome might even die before the revolution comes.\" Revolution Lyrics. In \"When the Revolution Comes,\" therefore, the phrase \"party and bullshit\" is part of an admonishment, an expression of disgust and disappointment in those who are not readying themselves for the revolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   By contrast, \"Party and Bullshit\" embraces the \"party and bullshit\" culture, thereby transforming \"party and bullshit\" from something shunned to something glorified. The song begins with Wallace rapping, \"I was a terror since the public school era / Bathroom passes, cuttin' classes, squeezing asses / Smoking blunts was a daily routine / Since thirteen, a chubby n***a on the scene.\" B.I.G. Lyrics. As the song goes on, it becomes clear that Wallace continues to enjoy a dissolute lifestyle. For example, Wallace later raps, \"Honeys want to chat / But all we wanna know is 'Where the party at?' / And can I bring my gat?\" B.I.G. Lyrics. He continues, \"Dumbing out, just me and my crew / Cause all we want to do is... / Party... and bullshit.\" B.I.G. Lyrics (ellipses in original). In \"Party and Bullshit,\" then, \"party and bullshit\" is a desired activity, part of Wallace's hip hop lifestyle, which the song celebrates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Likewise, \"Party\" exalts \"party and bullshit\" rather than condemning it.

Ora cheerfully proclaims that she wants to \"party and bullshit.\" Ora Lyrics. Unlike \"When the Revolution Comes,\" \"Party\" does not denounce \"party and bullshit\" but instead suggests that it is fun, lighthearted, and enjoyable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Moreover, in addition to the songs themselves, the complaint supports the conclusion that \"Party and Bullshit\" and \"Party\" are transformative. Indeed, Oyewole acknowledges that the B.I.G. and Rita Ora Defendants use the phrase \"party and bullshit\" \"in contravention\" of Oyewole's original purpose, which was to \"encourage[e] people to NOT waste time with 'party and bullshit.' \" FAC at \u00b6 39. Thus even Oyewole recognizes that Defendants' songs change the meaning and purpose of the phrase \"party and bullshit.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   A comparison of the works at issue, along with Oyewole's own statement regarding\n   his use of the phrase \"party and bullshit,\" reveals that the B.I.G. and Rita Ora Defendants' works transform \"When the Revolution Comes,\" \"imbu[ing] it with a character, different from that for which it was created.\"\n   <em>\n    TCA Television Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175244\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/839/168/#p179\">\n    839 F.3d at 180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Instead, the song focuses on the upcoming revolution, describing what will happen and repeating \"when the revolution comes.\" The criticism of those who \"party and bullshit\" reinforces The Last Poets' message that their listeners should prepare for and commit to the revolution, but it is not essential to that message.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     4.

LLC, Universal Music Corp., Songs of Universal, Inc., Andrew Harr, Jermaine Jackson, Trac-N-Field Entertainment LLC, Andre Davidson, Sean Davidson, Warner/Chappell Music Publishing, Inc., and Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC are dismissed. In addition, because they have not yet been served, the claims against Kelly Sheehan, Berry Gordy, Jr., Osten Harvey, Jr., Bee Moe Easy Music, Emi Music Publishing, Justin Combs Company, and Stone Diamond Music Corp. are also dismissed. According to the docket, Defendants Rita Ora and Trevor Tahiem Smith, Jr. have each been served,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 14 &amp; 15, but they have not appeared or filed any documents in this case.

However, Oyewole did not electronically file proof of service of process for the alleged second service on or before July 22, 2016, as the Court required. In any event, even if the Court considers the second service, Oyewole has not shown that Martin was authorized-or indicated that she was authorized-to accept service on behalf of Downtown Music. Accordingly, Oyewole has failed to meet his burden to show adequate service.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    In response to Downtown Music's motion to dismiss, Oyewole submitted a declaration from his counsel,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Dkt.
