Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Presently pending before the Court are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. (ECF Nos. 31, 36.) Defendants Attorney General Jefferson B. Sessions, III, Acting Director Thomas E. Brandon, Director Christopher A. Wray, and the United States of America move for summary judgment on all currently pending counts\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the Second Amended Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 34 at 9.) Plaintiff Alton C. Franklin (\"Mr. Franklin\") likewise moves for summary judgment on all remaining counts of the Second Amended Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 40.) These motions have been fully briefed and are ripe for disposition. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 31-43, 47-52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case arises from Defendants' determination that Mr. Franklin's less-than-24-hour involuntary stay in a hospital for an involuntary emergency mental health examination pursuant to Section 302 of the Pennsylvania Mental Health Procedures Act (\"Section 302 of the MHPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20Pa.%20Stat.%20and%20Cons.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%207302\">\n    50 Pa. Stat. and Cons. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 7302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , resulted in a complete prohibition of Mr. Franklin's ability to ever legally acquire, possess, or use a firearm in his private capacity for the purposes of federal law, namely for the purposes of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(4) (\" Section 922(g)(4)\"). Mr. Franklin challenges Defendants' position on numerous grounds-on most of which the Court will not now offer an opinion. However, the Court is persuaded that, by its own terms, Section 922(g)(4) does not restrict Mr. Franklin's ability to possess firearms based on a brief emergency mental health examination pursuant to Section 302 of the MPHA that was justified by only the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   decisions of a police officer, an unspecified official in the county administrator's office, and a single physician.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Section 922(g)(4) bars firearms possession for only \"any person ... who has been adjudicated as a mental defective or who has been committed to a mental institution.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(4). Under the undisputed material facts presented to this Court, Mr. Franklin is not such a person. Therefore, similar to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Rehlander,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051243\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/666/45/\">\n    666 F.3d 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1st Cir. 2012), this Court concludes that Mr. Franklin's right to acquire, possess, and use firearms is unaffected by Section 922(g)(4) because Mr. Franklin was not \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" or \"committed to a mental institution.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This Court offers no opinion on any of the remaining claims or arguments of the parties, including,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   alleged violations of Mr. Franklin's rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and the Second Amendment. Rather, the undisputed material facts before this Court show that, by its plain terms and under the canon of constitutional avoidance, Section 922(g)(4) simply does not provide for a restriction of Mr. Franklin's ability to acquire, possess, or use firearms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For the reasons that follow, Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 36) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   only as to the inapplicability of the restrictions of Section 922(g)(4) to Mr. Franklin. Otherwise, the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment (ECF Nos. 31, 36) are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED AS MOOT\n   </strong>\n   at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Jurisdiction and Venue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   All of Mr. Franklin's claims arise under the Constitution and laws of the United States. The Court, therefore, has jurisdiction over this case pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And, because a substantial part of the events giving rise to Mr. Franklin's claims-namely, his emergency mental health examination-occurred in the Western District of Pennsylvania, venue is proper in this district pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201391\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mr. Franklin initiated this action by filing his Complaint on February 3, 2016 (ECF No. 1), which he followed with his First Amended Complaint shortly thereafter on March 15, 2016. (ECF No. 3.) Mr. Franklin's First Amended Complaint alleged four counts against all Defendants: (1) two separate violations of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act (\"NIAA\"), (2) a violation of the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution, (3) a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and (4) a violation of the Second Amendment. (ECF No. 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On April 11, 2016, Defendants filed their Partial Motion to Dismiss. (ECF No. 5.) By Memorandum Opinion and Order of November 18, 2016, the Court dismissed Count I and Count II of the Amended Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Franklin v. Lynch,\n   </em>\n   No. 3:16-CV-36,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206879265\">\n    2016 WL 6879265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (W.D. Pa. Nov. 21, 2016). The Court granted Mr. Franklin leave to replead his claim under Section 101 of the NIAA, which Mr. Franklin did in his Second Amended Complaint filed on November 30, 2016. (ECF No. 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mr. Franklin's Second Amended Complaint added some additional content and reorganized its prior claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 26.) The Second Amended Complaint is organized into five counts: (1) a violation of Section 101(c) and Section 105 of the NIAA; (2) a violation of Section 101(a)(4)(D) and Section 101(b)(2)(B) of the NIAA; (3) a violation of the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution; (4) a violation of Franklin's Fifth Amendment right to due process; and (5) a violation of the right to keep and bear arms under the Second Amendment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 49-109.) However, Mr. Franklin concedes that Count I and Count III of the Second Amended Complaint were dismissed by the Court's Memorandum Opinion and Order of November 18, 2016 (ECF No. 23) and explains that he included those two counts only \"to preserve the issue for appeal, should it become necessary.\" (See ECF No. 26 at 12 n. 3, 19 n. 7.) Mr. Franklin's request for relief is extensive, featuring various forms of declarative and injunctive relief and attorney fees and costs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Most pertinent here, Defendants filed their Motion for Summary Judgment on January 31, 2017. (ECF No. 31.) Mr. Franklin responded with his own Motion for Summary Judgment on March 2, 2017. (ECF No. 36.) All briefing and responses to these two motions concluded on April 14, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 31-43, 47-52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Factual History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The following facts are undisputed unless otherwise noted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The present case arises from Mr. Franklin's involuntary stay in two Pennsylvania hospitals for an emergency mental health examination, in accordance with Section 302 of the MPHA. (ECF No. 35 \u00b6 1; ECF No. 43 \u00b6 1; ECF No. 42 \u00b6 1; ECF No. 50 \u00b6 1.) On September 22, 2002, Mr. Franklin arrived at a local police station in Bedford, Pennsylvania with approximately 20 cuts on his arms. (ECF No. 35 \u00b6\u00b6 2-4; ECF No. 43 \u00b6\u00b6 2-4; ECF No. 42 \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3; ECF No. 50 \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3.) These lacerations resulted from a \"drinking game\" in which Mr. Franklin, who was distraught from a recent breakup, and a friend would hit the other person with a butter knife during the course of a card game. (ECF No. 35 \u00b6\u00b6 2-4; ECF No. 43 \u00b6\u00b6 2-4; ECF No. 42 \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3; ECF No. 50 \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Upon arrival at the police station, Mr. Franklin spoke with Officer Chris Simons (\"Officer Simons\") and said that he \"need[ed] to talk to someone.\" (ECF No. 35 \u00b6 2; ECF No. 43 \u00b6 2; ECF No. 42 \u00b6 4; ECF No. 50 \u00b6 4.) Officer Simons noted that Mr. Franklin \"appear[ed] distraught from a recent break-up in a relationship\" and \"appear[ed] to be delusional,\" at which\n   point Officer Simons completed \"an application for involuntary commitment.\" (ECF No. 35 \u00b6\u00b6 3, 5; ECF No. 43 \u00b6\u00b6 3, 5; ECF No. 42 \u00b6 4; ECF No. 50 \u00b6 4.) By completing the application, Officer Simons attested that Mr. Franklin was \"severely mentally disabled\" and \"pose[d] a clear and present danger of harm to others or to himself.\" (ECF No. 35 \u00b6 5; ECF No. 43 \u00b6 5.) Officer Simons's application indicated that Mr. Franklin had \"[s]ubstantially mutilated [himself] or attempted to mutilate [himself] substantially and that there is [a] reasonable probability of mutilation unless adequate treatment is afforded.\" (ECF No. 35 \u00b6 6; ECF No. 43 \u00b6 6.) Officer Simons's application further stated that Mr. Franklin:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   has acted in such manner as to evidence that [he] would be unable, without care, supervision, and the continued assistance of others, to satisfy [his] need for nourishment, personal or medical care, shelter, or self-protection and safety, and that there is a reasonable probability that death, serious bodily injury or serious physical debilitation would ensue within 30 days unless adequate treatment were afforded under the act[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (ECF No. 35 \u00b6 6; ECF No. 43 \u00b6 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   James W. Redmond, \"an official in the county administrator's office,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   reviewed Officer Simons's application and completed a warrant for Mr. Franklin to be admitted to a medical facility for treatment for up to 120 hours. (ECF No. 35 \u00b6 8; ECF No. 43 \u00b6 8.) Officer Simons then transported Mr. Franklin to UPMC Bedford Memorial Hospital (\"UPMC Bedford\"), where Franklin was involuntarily admitted for a mental health examination at approximately 1:50 a.m. (ECF No. 35 \u00b6 10; ECF No. 43 \u00b6 10; ECF No. 42 \u00b6\u00b6 4-5; ECF No. 50 \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Mr. Franklin's treating physician, Dr. Christine M. Pluto (\"Dr. Pluto\") observed Mr. Franklin's lacerated arms, opined that Franklin \"is severely mentally disabled and in need of treatment,\" and added that \"[Mr. Franklin] should be admitted to a facility designated by the County Administrator for a period not to exceed 120 hours.\" (ECF No. 35 \u00b6 10; ECF No. 43 \u00b6 10.) Dr. Pluto diagnosed Mr. Franklin with \"acute psychosis\" and Mr. Franklin was transferred to Somerset Hospital at approximately 4:00 a.m. on September 22, 2002. (ECF No. 35 \u00b6\u00b6 10-11; ECF No. 43 \u00b6\u00b6 10-11; ECF No. 42 \u00b6 6; ECF No. 50 \u00b6 6.) Mr. Franklin was released at an unspecified time later that same day, i.e., September 22, 2002, with a total hospital stay of less than 24 hours. (ECF No. 42 \u00b6\u00b6 1, 6; ECF No. 50 \u00b6\u00b6 1, 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In the following years, Mr. Franklin obtained a Bachelor's Degree in Criminal Justice, a paralegal certification, and became a Certified Nursing Assistant. (ECF No. 42 \u00b6 10; ECF No. 50 \u00b6 10.) Mr. Franklin became a Corrections Officer in the State of Kentucky-a job in which he was authorized to possess a handgun while in his official capacity pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20925\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 925\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). (ECF No. 42 \u00b6\u00b6 11, 14; ECF No. 50 \u00b6\u00b6 11, 14.) Mr. Franklin has since been terminated from that position. (ECF No. 42 \u00b6 11; ECF No. 50 \u00b6 11.) The termination of Mr. Franklin's employment as a Corrections Officer in Kentucky was, at least, in part due to Defendants' actions and interpretations of law because the correctional facility required that Mr. Franklin take his firearm home at night.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 42 \u00b6 11; ECF No. 50 \u00b6 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On March 11, 2013, Mr. Franklin was informed that he was prohibited from possessing a firearm in a private capacity after he challenged the determination by the FBI National Instant Check System (\"NICS\") that he was prohibited from purchasing a firearm. (ECF No. 42 \u00b6 12; ECF No. 50 \u00b6 12.) Defendants contend that Mr. Franklin lost his private capacity firearm rights by operation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20Pa.%20Stat.%20and%20Cons.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%206105\">\n    18 Pa.

On October 14, 2014, the Honorable Travis Livengood (\"Judge Livengood\") issued an order finding that Mr. Franklin \"may possess a firearm without presenting a danger to himself or others.\" (ECF No. 35 \u00b6 13; ECF No. 43 \u00b6 13; ECF No. 42 \u00b6 16; ECF No. 50 \u00b6 16.) Judge Livengood added that Mr. Franklin \"no longer suffers from the mental health condition that was the basis of the original civil commitment,\" that Mr. Franklin was \"fully released and discharged from all treatment, supervision, and monitoring from said commitment and has been since September 2002,\" and that Mr. Franklin's \"involuntary confinement for evaluation and treatment was based solely on a medical finding of mental disability and not after hearing by a court, board, commission, or other authority and that Petitioner has not been adjudicated as a 'mental defective.' \" (ECF No. 42 \u00b6 16; ECF No. 50 \u00b6 16.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lastly, Judge Livengood ordered that Mr. Franklin was \"hereby fully relieved of any and all firearms disabilities imposed in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania deriving from his civil commitment ... in September 2002,\" and that this \"civil commitment ... in September 2002 shall not be a basis of a denial of a Pennsylvania license to carry firearms.\" (ECF No. 42 \u00b6 17; ECF No. 50 \u00b6 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Despite receiving state relief, Mr. Franklin has refrained from purchasing, possessing and using firearms in his private capacity because he reasonably fears arrest, prosecution, incarceration, and fine for allegedly violating\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(4). (ECF No. 42 119; ECF No. 50 \u00b6 19.) Confirming Defendants' position on this issue, Kevin White-Philadelphia Division Counsel for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (\"ATF\")-informed Mr. Franklin that, regardless of his receipt of state relief, Mr. Franklin remains prohibited under federal law from purchasing, possessing, and using firearms in his private capacity, but could continue to possess and use firearms in his official capacity as a state correctional officer. (ECF No. 42 \u00b6 20; ECF No. 50 \u00b6 20.) ATF Division Counsel White also stated that no mechanism for relief exists for Mr. Franklin for his federal prohibition of private firearm possession. (ECF No. 42 \u00b6 20; ECF No. 50 \u00b6 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Mr. Franklin wishes to purchase both a handgun and a long gun for the purpose of defending himself, his home, and his family. (ECF No. 42 \u00b6 23; ECF No. 50 \u00b6 23.) Mr. Franklin is over the age of 21; not under indictment; has no record of felony or misdemeanor domestic violence; has never been convicted of a crime punishable\n   by more than a year; is not a fugitive from justice; is not addicted to or using any controlled substance; has no history of being adjudicated a mental defective; has never been dishonorably discharged from the Armed Forces; has never renounced his citizenship; and is not the subject of a restraining order relating to an intimate partner. (ECF No. 42 \u00b6 24; ECF No. 50 \u00b6 24.) Mr. Franklin has never been involuntarily examined for any mental health purposes since the aforementioned involuntary emergency mental health examination on September 22, 2002.

The Court's holding regarding the inapplicability of Section 922(g)(4) restrictions to Mr. Franklin moots the other issues raised in this case and, thus, the Court does not decide or offer any opinion on them.

The first three types of \"adjudicators\" in this list are clearly not implicated under the undisputed material facts of this case. The decision to submit Mr. Franklin to a 120-hour involuntary mental health examination was made by a police officer, an unspecified officer in the county administrator's office, and a physician-not a court, board, or commission.

Section 3863 provides for temporary hospitalization following ex parte procedures-that is to say, without an adversary proceeding. The procedures include an application by a health or law enforcement officer, a certifying medical examination by a medical practitioner, and an endorsement by a judge or justice of the peace confirming that these procedures have been followed.

Stat. tit. 34-B, \u00a7 3863(1)-(3).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   For full-scale commitments (as opposed to temporary hospitalization), Maine requires a traditional adversary proceeding, Me.

Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 15, \u00a7 393(1)(E).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   In May 1998, Small was twice hospitalized under section 3863-at the request of his mother and an emergency mental health worker, respectively-based on suicidal tendencies and other signs of mental illness. In March 2009, the police found Small in possession of an Astra .357 revolver. In April 2009, Small was again hospitalized under section 3863 and then committed on a longer-term basis under section 3864. Small was indicted in November 2009 for violation of section 922(g)(4), based solely on his May 1998 section 3863 hospitalizations and March 2009 possession.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   In March 2007, Rehlander was involuntarily hospitalized under section 3863 at the request of a crisis clinician, also based primarily on suicidal impulses. After then submitting to voluntary hospitalization for a few days, Rehlander changed his mind, and in early April 2007 he was again involuntarily hospitalized under section 3863 at the request of hospital personnel. Section 3863 hospitalizations are subject to strict time limits, so the hospital applied for longer-term involuntary commitment under section 3864.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   A full-scale section 3864 proceeding followed at the end of which the Maine state court ordered Rehlander discharged, concluding that at this point Rehlander needed treatment but did not pose a risk of serious harm. In December 2008, police responding to an assault complaint found Rehlander with a 9 mm. caliber pistol.

The procedures provided for by Section 302 of the MHPA and the processes applied to Mr. Franklin on September 22, 2002 simply do not meet those specific requirements.
