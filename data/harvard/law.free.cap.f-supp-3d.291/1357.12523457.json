LAND, CHIEF U.S. DISTRICT COURT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   One hundred forty-three county jails are spread throughout the state of Georgia, housing tens of thousands of detainees on any given day.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Many (perhaps most) of these detainees are awaiting trial and have been convicted of no crime. Thus, they are presumed to be innocent. Someone must address their essential needs during their detention, including the provision of constitutionally mandated food and healthcare. Generally, county sheriffs and the county in which these jails are located share that responsibility-the sheriff operates the jail and the county funds it. Although operational and fiscal responsibility may be clearly demarcated under Georgia law, legal responsibility when something goes wrong apparently is not. And thus, the federal reporters are filling up with cases explaining who can be liable when a county jail detainee's federal constitutional rights are violated because of a failure to provide the detainee with essential needs such as food and medical care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The issue presently before the Court is whether a county detainee may recover money damages in a federal court against a county sheriff in his official capacity to compensate him for injuries he suffered as a result of the violation of his federal constitutional right to receive constitutionally mandated medical care. The resolution of this issue depends upon whether a county sheriff acts as a state officer when he provides medical care in a county jail. If he does, the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution protects him from liability in his official capacity in federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The implications of a ruling that shields a county sheriff from liability for his unconstitutional conduct in the operation of a county jail are significant. Such a ruling would deprive a detainee in a county jail who is injured because of the conscious indifference to his medical needs by the county sheriff of a meaningful remedy in federal court against the sheriff for this federal constitutional violation. And if a finding that the sheriff is a state actor\n   means that he is not a county actor, the detainee may also have no remedy against the county pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The undersigned previously rejected the notion that neither the county nor the\n   <em>\n    county\n   </em>\n   sheriff could be liable for money damages arising from the failure to provide constitutionally mandated medical care to a\n   <em>\n    county\n   </em>\n   detainee in a\n   <em>\n    county\n   </em>\n   jail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Youngs v.

Oct. 30, 2008). But the Eleventh Circuit has laid additional bricks in the \"immunity wall\" since the Court rendered that decision, and in light of recent Eleventh Circuit precedent, it appears that the Eleventh Amendment blocks a detainee from vindicating his federal constitutional rights against a Georgia sheriff under such circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lake v.

Palmer alleges that he did not receive adequate medical treatment while he was a detainee at the Muscogee County Jail and that he suffered serious injuries as a result. He sued those parties who he claims are legally responsible for his injuries, including the Muscogee County Sheriff and his commanding officer in the county jail. Palmer sued the sheriff and his commander in their official and individual capacities. They seek dismissal of the official capacity claims based on Eleventh Amendment immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Palmer makes a compelling argument that the Eleventh Amendment was never intended to shield a county sheriff and his officers from liability arising from their failure to provide adequate, constitutionally mandated medical care to those persons entrusted to their care. But Eleventh Amendment precedent in this Circuit has evolved to provide an almost insurmountable wall protecting Georgia sheriffs sued in their official capacities for violating the federal constitutional rights of county jail detainees. Whether that precedent is well-reasoned is of no concern to this Court; the Court is duty bound to apply it. Based on that precedent, this Court must find that the sheriff and his jail commander are entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity on Palmer's official capacity claims. Their motions to dismiss those claims (ECF Nos. 2 &amp; 17) are therefore granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Under the Eleventh Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, \"[a] state is immune from a suit for damages in federal court by one of its own citizens.\"\n   <em>\n    Lake I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175979\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/1334/#p1339\">\n    840 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1337 (citing\n   <em>\n    Hans v.

Therefore, when a government actor's unconstitutional conduct causes harm, zealous lawyers fight mightily over whether that official's conduct arises from the performance of a state function or a local one. This battle is particularly intense when the government official appears to wear two hats from time to time-one for certain state functions and one for local ones. County sheriffs have found themselves in the middle of this fight. Because official capacity claims against a sheriff and his deputies are considered claims against the office of the sheriff, the fundamental question generally becomes whether the office of sheriff was engaged in a state function when its officers committed the alleged unconstitutional conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The precise issue that the Court must resolve today is whether a Georgia sheriff acts as an arm of the State when providing medical care to county jail detainees. If the sheriff acts as an arm of the State when performing this function, then Palmer's official capacity claims against the sheriff and his jail commander are barred by the Eleventh Amendment, and the Court lacks jurisdiction over these claims.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    McClendon v.

But we have learned that it is not enough that the sheriff is the \"Sheriff of Muscogee\n   <em>\n    County\n   </em>\n   \" or that his law enforcement responsibilities are restricted primarily to the geographic boundaries of the\n   <em>\n    county\n   </em>\n   which he serves. It appears to matter little that he is in charge of the\n   <em>\n    county\n   </em>\n   jail and that this jail is funded by the\n   <em>\n    county\n   </em>\n   taxpayers. In fact, recent precedent suggests that it is not terribly important that the\n   <em>\n    county\n   </em>\n   sheriff's budget is funded by the taxpayers who reside within the\n   <em>\n    county\n   </em>\n   in which the sheriff serves and who elect the\n   <em>\n    county\n   </em>\n   sheriff. Such facts are brushed aside as the product of superficial analysis that must yield, of course, to one of those \"sophisticated\" multipart balancing tests loved by law professors and appellate judges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The four factors that we district judges have been instructed to balance are: \"(1) how state law defines the entity; (2) what degree of control the State maintains over the entity; (3) where the entity derives its funds; and (4) who is responsible for judgments against the entity.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9106284\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/338/1304/#p1327\">\n    338 F.3d at 1309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In response to Judge Martin's dissent, Judge William Pryor, who authored the panel opinion in\n   <em>\n    Lake I\n   </em>\n   , noted that the\n   <em>\n    Lake I\n   </em>\n   panel \"did not decide whether the sheriff is entitled to sovereign immunity when he provides medical care,\" and he stated that \"a review of Georgia law might lead to a different result in a case about the provision of medical care.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266893\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/1340/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266893\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/1340/\">\n    at 1344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But he did not explain how the provision of medical care was distinguishable from the provision of food for Eleventh Amendment purposes. While it was unnecessary to make that distinction in\n   <em>\n    Lake I\n   </em>\n   , it cannot be ignored that\n   <em>\n    Lake I\n   </em>\n   (1) examined Georgia statutes that govern both the provision of medical care and the provision of food in Georgia county jails and (2) analogized the sheriff's duty to provide food to county jail detainees to the sheriff's duty to provide medical care to county jail detainees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lake I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175979\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/1334/#p1339\">\n    840 F.3d at 1339-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, while\n   <em>\n    Lake I\n   </em>\n   may not mandatorily bind future panels on the issue of Eleventh Amendment immunity from county jail detainee medical claims, it certainly will constrain them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Bound by the holding in\n   <em>\n    Lake I\n   </em>\n   and constrained by its rationale, this Court can find no distinction for Eleventh Amendment purposes between a county sheriff feeding county detainees in a county jail and a county sheriff taking care of the medical needs of those same county detainees in that same county jail. Thus, with reservations as to whether this analysis reaches the proper constitutional result but with no hesitation that it is required by current binding precedent in this Circuit, the Court finds that the sheriff and his commander are entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   It is likely sufficient to rest today's holding on a simple proposition: because the provision of medical care cannot be distinguished from the provision of food for Eleventh Amendment purposes,\n   <em>\n    Lake I\n   </em>\n   requires a finding of immunity in this case.

Other Georgia statutes further specify the sheriff's duties with regard to inmate health in a facility under the sheriff's supervision. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 42-4-32(c) requires regular health inspections of jail facilities and requires \"adequate separation [of] and treatment given [to]\" new inmates. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 42-4-32(d) requires that each inmate be \"observed daily\" and that \"a physician shall be immediately called if there are indications of serious injury, wound, or illness.\" And O.C.G.A. \u00a7 42-4-51(b) requires the sheriff to \"provide a sick, injured, or disabled inmate access to medical services.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Although state law mandates that a sheriff must provide a minimum level of medical care to detainees in his custody, a strong argument can be made that state law does not clearly establish that the provision of medical care is solely the responsibility of the sheriff. Georgia law also indicates that the county that must fund the county jail shares responsibility for the persons detained in the county jail. Georgia law generally provides that \"it shall be the responsibility of the governmental unit, subdivision, or agency having the physical custody of an inmate to maintain the inmate, furnishing him food, clothing, and any needed medical and hospital attention[.]\" O.C.G.A. \u00a7 42-5-2(a).

The same rationale extends to the provision of medical care in a county jail. As discussed above, Georgia law contains specific provisions governing the provision of medical care to county jail inmates; state law gives the sheriff, who is the officer in charge of the county jail, the function of providing inmates with medical care. In fact, \"Georgia courts have interpreted [ O.C.G.A. \u00a7 42-4-4(a)(2) ] as giving sheriffs exclusive control vis-\u00e0-vis the county over choosing vendors for medical care.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175979\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/1334/#p1339\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175979\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/1334/#p1339\">\n    at 1339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, \"[t]he training and discipline\n   of deputies provides further evidence of control by the state.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175979\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/1334/#p1339\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175979\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/840/1334/#p1339\">\n    at 1343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining how the state has control over training and discipline of sheriff's deputies). Thus, following\n   <em>\n    Lake I\n   </em>\n   , the Court concludes that, under Georgia law, the State controls the provision of medical care in a county jail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court does note, however, that Palmer's argument to the contrary is not frivolous. The five dissenters in\n   <em>\n    Manders\n   </em>\n   read Georgia law to provide that county jails in Georgia are \"quintessentially local institutions that exist separate and apart from the state's integrated system of prisons [and that] [t]heir operation is among the responsibilities of the county and, specifically, the county sheriff.\"\n   <em>\n    Manders,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9106284\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/338/1304/#p1327\">\n    338 F.3d at 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Barkett, J., dissenting). The Court also observes that the sheriff's operation of the county jail is not unfettered. County governing authorities have oversight over a sheriff's operation of the county jail through the investigative powers of grand juries, which must inspect jails annually and make recommendations to the county government.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   O.C.G.A. \u00a7 15-12-71(b) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   O.C.G.A. \u00a7 15-12-78 (\"Grand juries shall carefully inspect the sanitary condition of the jails of their respective counties at each regular inspection[.]\"). Moreover, a county may be answerable to the federal government for the operation of county jails. Palmer asserts that in a 1999 consent decree between the U.S. Department of Justice and the Columbus Consolidated Government (\"CCG\"-the consolidated government of Muscogee County and the City of Columbus), the parties agreed that Muscogee County has a duty to provide medical care at the jail and that the sheriff acts on behalf of the county in providing medical care.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   While not dispositive, the United States Justice Department's recognition of the county's substantial responsibility for providing medical care to county jail detainees should not be ignored in evaluating the weight to give to the factor of where the state vests control. As noted previously, it is the undersigned's view that the county and the sheriff share responsibility for the provision of medical care in the county jail. This sharing of responsibility supports an argument that this factor is not decisive under the\n   <em>\n    Manders\n   </em>\n   calculus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Candidly, the Court does not understand how this can be. The panel in\n   <em>\n    Lake I\n   </em>\n   found that state law required the county to pay to provide food to detainees.

With all due respect to the Court of Appeals, it is sheer speculation to conclude that state funds would ever be used in a material way to pay off a judgment against a sheriff in his official capacity for his failure to provide constitutionally mandated medical care to county jail detainees. On the other hand, it is reasonable to conclude that a county, which is mandated to fund the sheriff's operation of a county jail and the provision of medical care to county jail detainees, would have to appropriate sufficient funds to operate the jail taking into consideration that part of those county funds will be used to pay an adverse judgment arising from the operation of that county jail. Thus, it is more likely that the county, not the state, would have to pay for an adverse judgment against the sheriff. Accordingly, this most important factor in the\n   <em>\n    Manders\n   </em>\n   analysis would seem to support a denial of Eleventh Amendment immunity. But the\n   <em>\n    Lake I\n   </em>\n   panel brushed off this factor concluding that\n   <em>\n    Manders\n   </em>\n   supports (or perhaps requires) it to do so.

The Court does not need to decide that issue here because Plaintiff has not sued CCG.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Palmer also points out that the sheriff previously sued the Columbus Consolidated Government for failing to appropriate sufficient funding for inmate medical care. He alleged in that action that he was a county officer\n    <em>\n     within the meaning of O.C.G.A. \u00a7 45-9-21(e).\n    </em>\n    Perhaps he was mistaken, but a more reasonable reconciliation of his opinion of his position and Georgia law is that a Georgia sheriff sometimes wears a state hat, but he sometimes wears two hats, a state one and a county one.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    The Court acknowledges that the\n    <em>\n     Manders\n    </em>\n    court did not go this far, and specifically stated, \"[w]e stress that this case does not involve medical care, which counties have a statutory obligation to provide to inmates in county jails.\"\n    <em>\n     Manders\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9106284\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/338/1304/#p1327\">\n     338 F.3d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1323 n.43.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
