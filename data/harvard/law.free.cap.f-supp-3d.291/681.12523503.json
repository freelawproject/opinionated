Many courts have held that privilege is to be narrowly construed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Communications with the subordinate of an attorney, such as a paralegal, are also protected by the attorney-client privilege so long as the subordinate is \"acting as the agent of a duly qualified attorney under circumstances that would otherwise be sufficient to invoke the privilege.\"\n   <em>\n    Dabney v.

Further, the privilege only protects communications from discovery. Facts are discoverable, even if discussed in privileged communications. Communications between client and counsel about draft contracts, and proposed contract language, are privileged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In order to guide the parties' privilege determinations, below is a set of hypothetical email scenarios:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   1. President of Food Service Corporation A sends email to General Counsel, \"What are the requirements of a binding contract for food service contract with College X?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   2. General Counsel emails the President-with a list of the requirements for such a contract.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   3. President to Corporation A's VP, who as part of her job is engaged in negotiations with College X, \"Our General Counsel has advised me that in order to form a binding contract with College X, we need to agree on requirements 1, 2, and 3.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Emails 1, 2, and 3 above are all privileged communications that can be appropriately withheld from production.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   4. VP to Corporation A's Sales Manager: \"President has instructed us to proceed to negotiate a contract for food services with College X. Get to this ASAP.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   5. Sales Manager to VP: \"I've just met with Manager of College X and we have a handshake deal. How much detail do we need in the written contract?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   6. VP to President: \"Sales Manager reached a great deal for us. Let's keep the written contract simple and direct to close the deal ASAP.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   7. President to General Counsel: \"Draft this contract as quickly as possible. Draft a contract including 1, 2, 3 and also 4, 5 and 6.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   8. General Counsel to in-house Paralegal: \"The President wants a contract with 1 through 6. Please take language from our prior contract with College Z to get the process started.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   9. VP to Paralegal: \"I heard you are working on our contract with College X. Please write these exact words into provision 6: 'It is hereby agreed that the amount is $400.' \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   10. General Counsel to VP: \"Here is my proposed contract attached to this e-mail. Show this to College X, but tell them it is non-negotiable.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   11. VP to College X: \"Here is our proposed contract. Our General Counsel says since we are giving you such a good deal, we must insist on these terms as written. Please send it back with your signature.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   12. Emails by non-lawyers within each party, and between Corporation A and College X, following execution of the contract, disputing its interpretation, and at times indicating they rely on their counsel's advice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   13. As a result of a dispute on contract interpretation between the parties, VP discusses this with President and then contacts General Counsel about her interpretation of the contract and GC responds. VP forwards this email to College X.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Emails 4, 5, and 6 are not privileged communications. No legal advice is requested or provided. Email 7, on the other hand, is privileged. The President asks for legal services from the General Counsel. Similarly, Email 8 is privileged. The General Counsel is communicating with a\n   Paralegal to \"get the process started\" of drafting a contract (i.e., providing legal services). Email 9 is not privileged. The Paralegal is working as a scrivener, making changes that the VP requests but not providing legal advice. Email 10 is a privileged communication between the General Counsel and the VP in furtherance of legal services. However, the attachment to this email is not privileged. Email 11 is not privileged because the communication is no longer confidential. Email 12 is not privileged even if the representatives rely on their in-house counsel's prior privileged advice, unless the counsel's interpretation is repeated in essentially verbatim language in the email. In this event, only the content of the communication with counsel is privileged and may be redacted. The rest of the document must be produced. Email 13 would be privileged only as to the communication with counsel and while confidential within Corporation A. Once sent to College X, it loses its privileged status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   With these principles as its guide, the Court assessed all fifty documents submitted for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review. Below is a detailed explanation of the Court's privilege determinations as to a sample of those documents:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Sodexo document # 5\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   : This is not privileged. There is no lawyer on the chain, and Sodexo has not met its burden of showing that Thomas Stanton, the lawyer whom Sodexo claims provided legal advice during this communication, in fact provided such legal advice. Moreover, the communication itself does not appear to have as its primary purpose the provision of legal advice. In fact, the chain at no point demonstrates any legal services being rendered or requested. Thus, privilege cannot shield this document from production.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Sodexo document # 23\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   : This is not privileged. Alison Heilig is acting in the role of a \"scrivener,\" receiving edits from businesspeople and inputting those edits. Thus, privilege cannot shield this document from production.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Drexel document # 2\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   : In contrast with the two Sodexo documents mentioned above, this document is privileged. Melissa Brown, a lawyer, provides legal advice, which Joe Campbell (a non-lawyer) forwards to Rita LaRue (a non-lawyer), while making clear that his response is based on Ms. Brown's counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Drexel document # 5\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   : This document is not privileged. It is an email to a large group of individuals, including lawyers, but it is clear that the email communication is not for the primary purpose of seeking legal advice and therefore cannot be protected by the attorney-client privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Drexel document # 9\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   : This document is not privileged. It reflects a scheduled appointment in which a lawyer is invited. There is not request for legal advice associated with a meeting request, even though the discussion at the meeting might be privileged. The chain continues, but without any provision of legal advice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The principles applied above should be employed by both parties to meet their respective discovery obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   An appropriate Order follows.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
