According to Senator Lieberman, the \"goal of this provision ... was to increase free public access to [court] records.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Given that PACER fees had increased since 2002, and that \"the funds generated by these fees [were] still well higher than the cost of dissemination,\" he asked the Judicial Conference to \"explain whether the Judicial Conference is complying with Section 205(e) of the E-Government Act, how PACER fees are determined, and whether the Judicial Conference is only charging 'to the extent\n   necessary' for records using the PACER system.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   On behalf of the Judicial Conference and its Rules Committee, the Committee Chair and the Director of the AO responded that the judiciary was complying with the law because EPA fees are \"used only to fund public access initiatives,\" such as \"CM/ECF, the primary source of electronic information on PACER,\" and the \"EBN system, which \"provides access to bankruptcy case information to parties listed in the case by eliminating the production and mailing of traditional paper notices and associated postage costs, while speeding public service.\" (Taylor Decl.

In addition, he specifically questioned the use of EPA receipts for courtroom technology, acknowledging that the Appropriations Committees had approved this use in 2007, but expressing his opinion that this was \"an initiative that [was] unrelated to providing public access via PACER and against the requirement of the E-Government Act.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In 2011, the Judicial Conference, \"[n]oting that ... for the past three fiscal years the EPA program's obligations have exceeded its revenue,\" again amended the PACER fee schedule, raising the per-page cost from 8 to 10 cents.

APPLICATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Applying the \"ordinary principles of statutory construction,\" the parties arrive at starkly different interpretations of this statute. Plaintiffs take the position that the statute \"prohibits the AO from charging more in PACER fees than is necessary to recoup the total marginal cost of operating PACER.\" (Pls.' Mot. at 12.) Under plaintiffs' interpretation, defendant's liability is established because with the exception of the category of expenditures labeled Public Access Services (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Attachment 1), most, if not all, of the other expenditures covered by PACER fees are not part of the \" 'marginal cost of disseminating records' through PACER.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mot. at 17;\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pls.' Facts \u00b6\u00b6 32, 34, 36, 38, 41, 43, 45 (fiscal year 2010).) Defendant readily admits that PACER fees are being\n   used to cover expenses that are not part of the \"marginal cost\" of operating PACER (\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Def.'s Resp. to Pls.' Facts \u00b6\u00b6 32, 34, 36, 38, 41, 43, 45), but it rejects plaintiffs' interpretation of the statute. Instead, defendant reads the statute broadly to mean that the Judicial Conference \"may charge [PACER] fees in order to fund the dissemination of information through electronic means.\" (3/23/18 Tr. at ----;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 11 (Judicial Conference may \"charge fees, as it deems necessary, for the provision of information to the public through electronic means\").) Under defendant's interpretation, it is not liable because \"every single expenditure ... [is] tied to disseminating information through electronic means.\" (3/23/18 Tr. at ----.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   If the Court agreed with either proposed interpretation, the ultimate question of defendant's liability would be relatively straightforward. If PACER fees can only be spent to cover the \"marginal cost\" of operating PACER, defendant is liable most expenditures.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   If PACER fees can be spent on any expenditure that involves \"the dissemination of information through electronic means,\" defendant is not liable. But the Court rejects the parties' polar opposite views of the statute, and finds the defendant liable for certain costs that post-date the passage of the E-Government Act, even though these expenses involve dissemination of information via the Internet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Does the E-Government Act Limit PACER Fees to the Marginal Cost of Operating PACER?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   As noted, plaintiffs interpret the statute as prohibiting the AO \"from charging more in PACER fees than is necessary to recoup the total marginal cost of operating PACER.\" (Pls.' Mot. at 12.) Plaintiffs concede, as they must, that this is not what the text of the statute actually says. But they argue that this is the best reading of the statutory language in light of its \"plain language,\" its \"history,\" and the need to \"avoid[ ] two serious constitutional concerns that would be triggered by a broader reading.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Reply at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Plaintiffs first argue that it is clear from the text that the words \"these services\" in the last sentence of subparagraph (b), where it provides that the fees collected must be used \"to reimburse expenses incurred in providing\n   <em>\n    these\n   </em>\n   services,\" include only the services that the AO is actually charging fees for as set forth in the EPA Fee Schedule, i.e., the PACER system, the PACER Service Center, and the provision of printed copies of documents \"accessed electronically at a public terminal in a courthouse.\" (Pls.' Reply at 3-4; 3/23/18\n   Tr. at ----.) The Court does not agree that the text dictates this constraint. The term \"these services\" could also mean any service that provides \"access to information available through automatic data processing equipment,\" whether or not it is expressly part of the EPA fee schedule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Plaintiffs' next argument is based on the legislative history of the 2002 amendment, which consists of the following single paragraph in a Senate Committee Report:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   The Committee intends to encourage the Judicial Conference to move from a fee structure in which electronic docketing systems are supported primarily by user fees to a fee structure in which this information is freely available to the greatest extent possible. For example, the Administrative Office of the United States Courts operates an electronic public access service, known as PACER, that allows users to obtain case and docket information from Federal Appellate, District and Bankruptcy courts, and from the U.S. Party/Case Index. Pursuant to existing law, users of PACER are charged fees that are higher than the marginal cost of disseminating the information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   2002 S. Rep. at 23. Plaintiffs argue that this paragraph \"makes clear that Congress added this language because it sought to prevent the AO from 'charg[ing] fees that are higher than the marginal cost of disseminating the information,' \" as it had been doing for several years, and that \"although the E-Government Act does not refer to PACER by name, Congress clearly had PACER in mind when it passed the Act.\" (Pls.' Mot. at 11 (quoting 2002 S. Rep. at 23).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The Court finds this argument unconvincing for several reasons. First, there is no mention in the statute of PACER or its \"marginal cost,\" and in the 2002 Senate Report, the reference to PACER and \"marginal cost\" follows the words \"For example,\" suggesting that the amendment was not intended to apply only to PACER.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pension Benefit Guar. Corp. v. LTV Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125138\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/633/#p649\">\n    496 U.S. 633\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 649,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125138,6121531\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/110/2668/\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12125138\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/496/633/#p649\">\n    110 L.Ed.2d 579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990) (\"[T]he language of a statute-particularly language expressly granting an agency broad authority-is not to be regarded as modified by examples set forth in the legislative history.\"). And, in fact, the 2002 Senate Report recognizes that PACER is only a subset of a larger system when it stated: \"[t]he Committee intends to encourage the Judicial Conference to move from a structure in which\n   <em>\n    electronic docketing systems\n   </em>\n   are supported primarily by user fees to a fee structure in which this information is freely available to the greatest extent possible.\" 2002 S. Rep. at 23 (emphasis added). The use of the phrase \"electronic docketing systems\" appears to envision more than just PACER, and to at least encompass CM/ECF, given that it, unlike PACER, is an electronic docketing system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Second, a single committee's report reflects only what the committee members might have agreed to, not the \"intent\" of Congress in passing the law. As the Supreme Court observed, \"[u]nenacted approvals, beliefs, and desires are not laws.\"\n   <em>\n    P.R. Dep't of Consumer Affairs v. Isla Petrol. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"13909\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/495/#p501\">\n    485 U.S. 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 501,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"13909\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/495/#p501\">\n    108 S.Ct. 1350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"13909\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/495/#p501\">\n    99 L.Ed.2d 582\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988). As the Supreme Court observed in rejecting reliance on \"excerpts\" said to reflect congressional intent to preempt state law, \"we have never [looked for] congressional intent in a vacuum, unrelated to the giving of meaning to an enacted statutory text.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"13909\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/485/495/#p501\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Perhaps most tellingly, the E-Government Act changed only one phrase in the first sentence of the first paragraph-replacing \"shall hereafter\" with \"may, only to the extent necessary.\" It did not alter the third sentence of paragraph (b), which\n   is the part of the statute that governs what expenses can be reimbursed by PACER fees. Thus, even though the 2002 Senate Report correctly observes that PACER fees exceeded the marginal cost of operating PACER, the amendment to the statute did not address which services could be reimbursed, but only the amount of fees for services that could be charged. In addition, at the time the E-Government Act was passed, CM/ECF had been in operation for at least four years, PACER fees were already being used to pay for non-PACER costs, such as EBN and CM/ECF (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   2d Skidgel Decl. Tabs 30-32), and there is nothing in the statute's text or legislative history to suggest that Congress intended to disallow the use of PACER fees for those services. In the end, a single sentence in a committee report, which has been taken out of context, is not enough to persuade the Court that Congress intended the E-Government Act to impose a specific limitation on the judiciary's collection and use of EPA fees to the operation of only PACER.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Plaintiffs also point to \"[p]ost-enactment history\"-the letters from the E-Government Act's sponsor, Senator Joseph Lieberman, in 2009 and 2010. (Pls.' Mot. at 11-12 (\"The Act's sponsor has repeatedly expressed his view, in correspondence with the AO's Director, that the law permits the AO to charge fees 'only to recover the direct cost of distributing documents via PACER,' and that the AO is violating the Act by charging more in PACER fees than is necessary for providing access to 'records using the PACER system.' \").) But, as plaintiffs essentially conceded during the motions hearing, the post-enactment statements of a single legislator carry no legal weight when it comes to discerning the meaning of a statute.

Finally, as will be discussed in Section C,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , the Court finds that the statute does clearly state that the judiciary has the authority to use its PACER fees for services that may not directly benefit a particular PACER user.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sebelius v. Auburn Reg'l Med.

We consider context ... as probative of [Congress' intent].\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   For these reasons, the Court will not adopt plaintiffs' interpretation of the statute as limiting PACER fees to the total marginal cost of operating PACER.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Does the E-Government Act Allow PACER Fees to Fund Any \"Dissemination of Information Through Electronic Means\"?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Defendant's interpretation of the statute embraces the other extreme, positing that the statute allows PACER fees to be used for any expenditure that is related to \"disseminating information through electronic means.\" (3/23/18 Tr. at ----;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 11.) It is not entirely clear to the Court how the defendant arrived at this definition. Most of the reasons defendant gives to justify its interpretation are really just arguments against plaintiffs' interpretation, such as (1) the authority to charge EPA fees and use them to reimburse \"services\" predated the E-Government Act and that language was not changed by the Act; (2) there is no mention of PACER or \"marginal cost\" in the 2002 amendment; and (3) the legislative history discussed PACER only as an \"example.\" As for defendant's affirmative arguments, addressed below, none demonstrates that defendant's conclusion is correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Defendant's first argument is based on the fact that the text of the statute requires that EPA fees be deposited in the JITF, which is the fund that the judiciary is allowed to use for \"broad range of information technology expenditures.\" (Def.'s Mot. at 10.) According to defendant, the fact that EPA fees are deposited in this fund \"informs how Congress intended the fees received from PACER access to be spent.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, while the statute provides that PACER fees are to be deposited in the JITF, it also directs that they are to be used to \"reimburse expenses incurred\" in providing \"access to information available through data processing equipment.\" That statutory language cannot be ignored as defendant attempts to do.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hibbs v. Winn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5856684\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/88/#p101\">\n    542 U.S. 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 101,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5856684\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/88/#p101\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5856684\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/88/#p101\">\n    159 L.Ed.2d 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004) (\"A statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous, void or insignificant.\"). Notably, it is clear that the judiciary has never treated its EPA fees in the JITF as fungible with the rest of the money in the JAF. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FY 2006 JITF Annual Report; FY 2007 Financial Plan; 3/26/2009 AO Letter at 3-4 (\"While fee collections from the EPA program are also deposited into the JITF, they are used only to fund electronic public access initiatives and account for only a small portion of its balance.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Defendant's main argument is that its interpretation of the statute has been accepted by Congress because the Appropriations Committees, either explicitly or implicitly, endorsed, mandated, or approved every request pertaining to the use of EPA fees. For example, defendant points out that the 1996 House Report stated that the Committee \"expect[ed] available balances from public access fees\" to be used\n   for electronic bankruptcy noticing and electronic case filing, 1996 H.R. Rep. at 89; the 2003 House and Senate Committee Reports \"expressly directed the AO to use PACER fees to update the CM/ECF system,\" 2003 H.R. Rep. at 116; 2003 S. Rep. at 118; those same Committees endorsed the Judiciary's FY 2007 Financial Plan, which set forth the AO's plan \"to use receipts from PACER fees to fund courtroom technology and to perform infrastructure maintenance consistent with Congressional actions\" (FY 2007 Financial Plan at 45; FY 2007 Senate Approval Letter; FY 2007 House Approval Letter); and the 2006 Senate Report, which urged the judiciary to undertake a study about the feasibility of sharing CM/ECF technology with states,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   2006 S. Rep. at 176, which the judiciary then did via its State of Mississippi study (FY 2009 EPA Expenditures). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 17-18.) More generally, and applicable at least as to the expenditures that post-date the passage of the E-Government Act, congressional approval is reflected by the fact that after the judiciary submitted its proposed budget to Congress and Congress appropriated money to the judiciary, the judiciary was then required to submit its proposed financial plan, which included its intended use of EPA fees, to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees for approval. (Def.'s Reply at 3; 3/23/18 Tr. at ----.) Looking at this entire process as a \"totality,\" defendant argues, establishes that by implicitly approving certain expenditures, Congress agreed with the Judicial Conference's interpretation of the statute. (3/23/18 Tr. at ---- (\"[W]e have 26 years where the only legislative history that has gone to the judicial conference, but for Senator Lieberman's letter, says the judicial conference's interpretation is correct. The judicial conference's interpretation of that language that PACER fees may be used more broadly is correct.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   For a number of reasons, defendant's argument is flawed. First, the record does not reflect meaningful congressional approval of each category of expenditures. Each so-called \"approval\" came from congressional committees, which is not the same as approval by Congress \"as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tenn. Valley Auth.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178325\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/153/#p191\">\n    437 U.S. at 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178325\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/153/#p191\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the Court questions whether it is even possible to infer approval of a specific expenditure based solely on committee-approval of the judiciary's financial plans, where the record does not show any particular attention was paid to this itemization of intended uses of EPA fees. For almost of all the years for which defendant has included copies of approvals, the \"approvals\" consist of a mere line in an email or letter that indicates, without any elaboration or specification, that the Appropriations Committee has \"no objection.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 2d Skidgel Decl. Tab 16 (2010);\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178325\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/153/#p191\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Tabs 15, 17, 20-27 (2011, 2013-2016).) In 2009 and 2012, there are letters from the Appropriations Committees which reflect a closer analysis of some parts of the financial plan, but neither mentions the judiciary's planned uses of PACER fees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Tabs 14, 18-19.) By contrast, in July 2013, the AO sent an email to the Senate Appropriation Committee at 1:02 p.m. noting that \"[i]n looking through our records we don't seem to have approval of our FY 2013 financial plan. Would you be able to send us an email or something approving the plan? The auditors ask for it so we like to have the House and Senate approvals on file.\" (2d Skidgel Decl. Tab 20.) Less than an hour later, at 1:47 p.m., an email came from a staff member on the Senate Appropriations Committee stating \"Sorry about that and thanks for the reminder. We have no objection.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Second, even if the record established approval of the various uses of EPA fees, there is nothing to support the leap from approval of specific expenditures to defendant's contention that the Appropriations Committees were cognizant and approved of the Judicial Conference's \"interpretation.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   3/23/18 Tr. at ----). In fact, the AO never used the definition defendant now urges the Court to adopt-the \"dissemination of information through electronic means\"-to explain its use of EPA fees for more than PACER. Rather, it used terms like \"public access initiatives\" to describe these expenditures. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FY 2007 Financial Plan (\"collections are used to fund information technology initiatives in the judiciary related to public access\"); 2d Skidgel Decl. Tab 12 (FY 2009 Financial Plan at 45) (EPA revenues \"are used to fund IT projects related to public access\"); Taylor Decl. Ex. J at 10 (AO document, entitled Electronic Public Access Program Summary, December 2012, stating that EPA revenue \"is dedicated solely to promoting and enhancing public access\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Finally, as defendant acknowledges, the post-enactment action of an appropriations committee cannot alter the meaning of the statute, which is what controls what expenditures are permissible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tenn. Valley Auth.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178325\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/153/#p191\">\n    437 U.S. at 191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178325\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/437/153/#p191\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Expressions of committees dealing with requests for appropriations cannot be equated with statutes enacted by Congress.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the fact that appropriations committees expressly or implicitly endorsed the use of EPA fees for certain expenditures cannot establish that those expenditures are permissible uses of EPA fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   For these reasons, the Court is not persuaded that the statute permits the collection of EPA fees to fund any expense that involves the \"dissemination of information through electronic means.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    C. What Limitation Did the E-Government Act Place on the Use of PACER Fees?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Having rejected the parties' diametrically opposed interpretations, the Court must embark on its own analysis to determine whether defendant's use of PACER fees between 2010 and 2016 violated the E-Government Act. The Court concludes\n   that defendant properly used PACER fees to pay for CM/ECF\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   and EBN, but should not have used PACER fees to pay for the State of Mississippi Study, VCCA, Web-Juror, and most of the expenditures for Courtroom Technology. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Attachment 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The statutory language in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201913\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   note is clear that, to be paid for with PACER fees, a \"service\" must be one that provides the public with \"access to information available through automatic data processing equipment.\" An examination of this statutory provision's history-dating from its enactment in 1990 and culminating in its amendment by the E-Government Act in 2002-resolves any ambiguity in its meaning and allows the Court to determine which expenditures between 2010 and 2016 were properly funded by PACER fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   When the\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201913\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   note was first enacted in 1989,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pub.

Rep. at 83 (Sept. 14, 1988); EPA Chronology at 1; Jud. Conf. Rep. at 19 (Mar. 14, 1989); Jud. Conf. Rep. at 21 (Mar. 13, 1990); 1990 S. Rep. at 86.) Yet, there was no mention of PACER in the statute, nor was there any suggestion that the judiciary was precluded from recouping expenses beyond the cost of operating PACER. In fact, it is apparent that Congress recognized the possibility that fees would cover the costs of making court records available to the public electronically.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1990 S. Rep. at 86 (\"language ... authorizes the Judicial Conference to prescribe reasonable fees for public access to case information, to reimburse the courts for automating the collection of the information\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   1992 H.R. Rep. at 58 (noting that \"the Judiciary's investments in automation have resulted in enhanced service to the public and to other Government agencies in making court records relating to litigation available by electronic media\" and \"request[ing] that the Judiciary equip all courts, as rapidly as is feasible, with the capability for making such records available electronically and for collecting fees for doing so\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The first federal court experiment with electronic case filing began in the Northern District of Ohio in 1996. (1997 AO Paper at 4.) Later that year, both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees made clear that they expected the judiciary to use its EPA fee collections for more than just paying for the cost of PACER. (1996 H.R. Rep. at 89 (\"The Committee supports the ongoing efforts of the Judiciary to improve and expand information made available in electronic form to the public. Accordingly, the Committee expects the Judiciary to utilize available balances derived from electronic public access fees in the Judiciary Automation Fund to make information and services more accessible to the public through improvements to enhance the availability of electronic information. The overall quality of service to the public will be improved with the availability of enhancements such as\n   <em>\n    electronic case documents, electronic filings, enhanced use of the Internet, and electron\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ic bankruptcy noticing\n   </em>\n   .\") (emphasis added); 1996 S. Rep. at 88 (\"The Committee supports efforts of the judiciary to make electronic information available to the public, and expects that available balances from public access fees in the judiciary automation fund will be used to enhance availability of public access.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   While these statements in the reports of the Committee on Appropriations predated the passage of the E-Government Act, they are not dispositive in terms of discerning what Congress intended the statute to mean. They are part of a bigger picture and an important backdrop to the passage of the E-Government Act. Contemporaneously with Congress's prompting the judiciary to use EPA fees to pay for public access to electronically-stored case documents \"[t]he transition towards electronic case files (\"ECF\") in the federal courts [wa]s underway\" by March 1997. (1997 AO Paper at v.) Over the next few years, relying expressly on the 1996 House and Senate Reports relating to fiscal year 1997 appropriations, the judiciary began using EPA fees to fund the development of a national case management and electronic case filing system, CM/ECF, which would allow federal courts to maintain complete electronic files. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , FY 2002 Budget Request (\"Fiscal year 1997 appropriations report language expanded the Judiciary's authority to use these funds to finance automation enhancements that improve the availability of electronic information to the public.\").) The judiciary anticipated that CM/ECF would \"produce an impressive range of benefits ... including ... public access to case file information.\" (1997 AO Paper at v.) For instance, in 1998, the Judicial Conference created a web interface for PACER and added a per page fee for accessing case dockets and electronic filings via the Internet. (Jud. Conf. Rep. at 64-65 (Sept. 15, 1998); EPA Chronology at 1.) At that time, the Judicial Conference noted in its report that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   The revenue from these fees is used exclusively to fund the full range of electronic public access (EPA) services. With the introduction of Internet technology to the judiciary's current public access program, the Committee on Court Administration and Case Management recommended that a new Internet PACER fee be established to maintain the current public access revenue\n   <em>\n    while introducing new technologies to expand public accessibility to PACER information\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   (Jud. Conf. Rep. at 64-65 (Sept. 15, 1998) (emphasis added).) By no later than fiscal year 2000, the judiciary was spending substantial sums of money, derived from EPA fees, on CM/ECF and EBN. (2d Skidgel Decl. Tab 30 (FY 2000 EPA Expenditures).) In fact, over $10 million was spent on case management/electronic case files, infrastructure and electronic bankruptcy noticing in 2000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Then in 2002, Congress passed the E-Government Act. This Act encompassed far more than \u00a7 205(e)'s limitation on the charging of fees. The overall purpose of the section pertaining to the judiciary was to \"require federal courts to provide greater access to judicial information over the Internet.\" 2002 S. Rep. at 23. To that end, the Act mandated that the judiciary expand the public's access to electronically stored information that was accessible via PACER:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   \u2022 \u00a7 205(a), \"Individual Court Websites,\" \"require[d] the Supreme Court, each circuit court, each district court, and each bankruptcy court of a district to establish a website that would include public information such as location and contact information for courthouses, local rules and standing orders of the\n   court, docket information for each case, and access to written opinions issued by the court, in a text searchable format.\" 2002 S. Rep. at 22.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   \u2022 \u00a7 205(b), \"Maintenance of Data Online,\" required that \"[t]he information and rules on each website ... be updated regularly and kept reasonably current.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   \u2022 \u00a7 205(c), \"Electronic Filings,\" required, subject to certain specified exceptions, that courts provide public access to all electronically filed documents and all documents filed in paper that the court converts to electronic form.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   \u2022 \u00a7 205(d), \"Dockets with Links to Documents,\" directed the Judicial Conference to \"explore the feasibility of technology to post online dockets with links allowing all filing, decision, and rulings in each case to be obtained from the docket sheet of that case.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Subsection 205(e), entitled \"Cost of Providing Electronic Docketing Information,\" changed the language that required the judiciary to charge fees (\"shall, hereafter\") to make its decision to charge fees discretionary and to limit those fees \"to the extent necessary.\" Even though the judiciary was already using EPA fees to pay for the costs of CM/ECF and EBN, no changes were made to the last sentence of subparagraph (b), which defined the scope of services that can be reimbursed with EPA fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   As is clear from the E-Government Act, Congress intended in 2002 for the judiciary to expand its capability to provide access to court information, including public information relating to the specific court and docket information for each case, including filings and court opinions. With certain exceptions, documents filed electronically were to be made available publicly, and the judiciary was to explore the possibility of providing access to the underlying contents of the docket sheets through links to filings, decisions and rulings. This ambitious program of providing an electronic document case management system was mandated by Congress, although no funds were appropriated for these existing and future services, but Congress did provide that fees could be charged even though the fees could be \"only to the extent necessary.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Consistent with this view the Appropriations Committees reiterated their support for allowing EPA fees to be spent on CM/ECF in 2003. 2003 H.R. Rep. at 116; 2003 S. Rep. at 118; 2003 Conf. Rep. at H12515.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Although congressional \"acquiescence\" as an interpretative tool is to be viewed with caution, the Court is persuaded that when Congress enacted the E-Government Act, it effectively affirmed the judiciary's use of EPA fees for all expenditures being made prior to its passage, specifically expenses related to CM/ECF and EBN. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the E-Government Act allows the judiciary to use EPA fees to pay for the categories of expenses listed under Program Requirements: CM/ECF, EBN, Court Allotments and Telecommunications/Communications Infrastructure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Attachment 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   However, Congress' endorsement of the expenditures being made in 2002, in conjunction with the statutory language, the evolution of the E-Government Act, and the judiciary's practices as of the date of the Act's passage, leads the Court to conclude that the E-Government Act and its predecessor statute imposed a limitation on the use of PACER fees to expenses incurred in providing services, such as CM/ECF and EBN, that are part of providing the public with access to electronic information maintained and stored by the federal courts on its CM/ECF docketing system. This interpretation recognizes that PACER cannot be divorced from CM/ECF, since PACER is merely the portal to the millions of electronically-filed documents that are housed by the judiciary on CM/ECF and are available to the public via the Internet only because of CM/ECF.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   With this understanding, the Court will consider whether the judiciary properly used PACER fees for the remaining categories of expenses, which the judiciary now identifies as Congressional Priorities: Courtroom Technology, the State of Mississippi study, Web-Juror, and VCCA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Attachment 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The judiciary only began using EPA fees for these expenses five or more years after the E-Government Act. Defendant's first attempt to justify the use of EPA fees for each of these categories focused almost exclusively on purported congressional approvals. As previously discussed, post-enactment legislative history as a general rule is of limited use in statutory interpretation, particularly when the action comes from a committee-especially an appropriations committee-rather than Congress as a whole. Compounding that problem here, also as previously noted (with the exception of courtroom technology,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   supra note 22), is the questionable substance of the congressional approvals for several of these expenditures with the exception of courtroom technology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Even if defendant could rely on congressional approvals, the Court would still have to decide whether the expenses fit within the definition of permissible expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <em>\n    State of Mississippi\n   </em>\n   : The category labeled \"State of Mississippi\" is described by defendant as a study that \"provided software, and court documents to the State of Mississippi, which allowed the State of Mississippi to provide the public with electronic access to its documents.\" (Def.'s Resp. to Pls.' Interrogs. at 5.) It is apparent from this description that this study was not a permissible expenditure since it was unrelated to providing access to electronic information on the federal courts' CM/ECF docketing system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <em>\n    VCCA\n   </em>\n   : The category labeled Victim Notification (Violent Crime Control Act) refers to \"[c]osts associated with the program that electronically notifies local law enforcement agencies of changes to the case history of offenders under supervision.\" (Def.'s Resp. to Pls.' Interrogs. at 11.) Via this program, \"[l]aw enforcement officers receive electronic notification of court documents that were previously sent to the through the mail.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant first defended the use of EPA fees to pay for this program on the ground that it \"improves the overall quality of electronic service to the public via an enhanced use of the Internet.\" (Def.'s Resp. to Pls.' Facts \u00b6\u00b6 34, 53, 69, 87, 105, 123, 141.) Defendant has also argued that this program benefits the public because by sharing this information electronically, the\n   information gets to law enforcement agencies more quickly, and they in turn may be able to revoke supervision, if warranted, more quickly. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   3/23/18 Tr. at ----.) But neither of these justifications establishes that VCCA is a permissible expenditure of PACER funds. While this program disseminates federal criminal case information, and its outcome may indirectly have some benefit to the public, it does not give the public access to any electronically stored CM/ECF information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <em>\n    Web-Juror\n   </em>\n   : The category labeled Web-Based Juror Services refers to the costs associated with E-Juror, a juror management system. (Def.'s Resp. to Pls.' Interrogs. at 11.) It \"provides prospective jurors with electronic copies of court documents regarding jury service.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant's justification for using EPA fees to pay for these costs is that the E-Juror program \"improves the overall quality of electronic service to the public via an enhanced use of the Internet.\" (Def.'s Resp. to Pls.' Facts \u00b6\u00b6 71, 89, 107, 125, 143.) Again, whether a program \"improves the overall quality of electronic service to the public via an enhanced use of the Internet\" does not establish that it is permissible use of EPA fees where there is no nexus to the public's ability to access information on the federal court's CM/ECF docketing system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <em>\n    Courtroom Technology\n   </em>\n   : The category labeled \"Courtroom Technology\" funds \"the maintenance, cyclical replacement, and upgrade of courtroom technology in the courts.\" (Def.'s Resp. to Pls.' Interrogs. at 11.) The expenses in this category include \"the costs of repairs and maintenance for end user IT equipment in the courtroom; obligations incurred for the acquisition and replacement of digital audio recording equipment in the courtroom; costs for audio equipment in the courtroom, including purchase, design, wiring and installation; and costs for video equipment in the courtroom, including purchase, design, wiring and installation.\" (Def.'s Resp. to Pls.' Interrogs. at 32.) Defendant argues that EPA fees are appropriately used for courtroom technology because \"it improves the ability to share case evidence with the public in the courtroom during proceedings and to share case evidence electronically through electronic public access services when it is presented electronically and becomes an electronic court record.\" (FY 2007 Financial Report at 46.) Again, there is a lack of nexus with PACER or CM/ECF. From the existing record, it would appear that the only courtroom technology expenditure that might be a permissible use of EPA fees is the \"digital audio equipment\" that allows digital audio recordings to be made during court proceedings and then made part of the electronic docket accessible through PACER. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Taylor Decl. Ex. A (2013 EPA Fee Schedule) (charging $2.40 \"for electronic access to an audio file of a court hearing via PACER\").) But, the Court does not see how flat-screen TVs for jurors or those seated in the courtroom, which are used to display exhibits or other evidence during a court proceeding, fall within the statute as they do not provide the public with access to electronic information maintained and stored by the federal courts on its CM/ECF docketing system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Accordingly, with the exception of expenses related to digital audio equipment that is used to create electronic court records that are publicly accessible via PACER, the Court concludes that the expenses in the categories listed as Congressional Priorities are not a permissible use of EPA fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Court will deny plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment as to liability and will grant in part and deny in part defendant's cross-motion for summary judgment as to liability.
