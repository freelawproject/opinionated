First, it asks me to reconsider my holding that Oregon's manufacture/delivery statute is overbroad as to delivery with respect to the ACCA's definition of \"serious drug offense.\" In the alternative, it contends that even if the statute is overbroad as to delivery, it is divisible. The government argues that a review of the\n   <em>\n    Shepard\n   </em>\n   documents in this case shows that petitioner has three prior convictions for\n   <em>\n    manufacture\n   </em>\n   of a controlled substance, so that the Oregon statute's overbreadth as to\n   <em>\n    delivery\n   </em>\n   has no bearing on the appropriateness of petitioner's designation as an armed career criminal. The government has failed to show clear error or manifest injustice as to the first argument. And I decline to consider the second argument because the government waived it by failing to raise divisibility in its response to the \u00a7 2255 petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   With respect to the government's first argument, I acknowledge-as I did in the order granting the \u00a7 2255 petition-that whether Oregon's manufacture/delivery statute is overbroad as to delivery with respect to the ACCA's definition of \"serious drug offense\" is a \"close question.\"\n   <em>\n    Ernst v.

Or. Nov. 13, 2017).

Second,\n   <em>\n    Harms\n   </em>\n   expressly acknowledged that\n   <em>\n    Sandoval\n   </em>\n   creates doubt as to whether Oregon delivery/manufacture of a controlled substance is properly classified as a controlled substance offense under the Guidelines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harms\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204918513\">\n    2017 WL 4918513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *2 (\"The Ninth Circuit's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Sandoval\n   </em>\n   suggests, but does not require[,] a different result.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Third,\n   <em>\n    Harms\n   </em>\n   was a Guidelines case, not an ACCA case.

The Guidelines state that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [t]he term \"controlled substance offense\" means an offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that prohibits the manufacture, import, export, distribution, or dispensing of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) or the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b). The application notes expressly state that the definition of \"controlled substance offense\" is \"not identical\" to the ACCA's definition of \"serious drug offense.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4B1.4 cmt. n.l. Notwithstanding that statement, however, it is hard to see much daylight between the two statutes on the point relevant in this case. The application notes provide that the \"offenses of aiding and abetting, conspiring, and attempting to commit such offenses\" are included in the Guidelines' definition of \"controlled substance offense.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It is clear that\n   <em>\n    some forms\n   </em>\n   of solicitation to commit drug crimes qualify as both \"serious drug offense[s]\" under the ACCA and \"controlled substance offense[s]\" under the Guidelines. The question is whether the\n   <em>\n    full scope\n   </em>\n   of solicitation offenses penalized by Oregon law, as elucidated in\n   <em>\n    Self\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Sandoval\n   </em>\n   , are categorically within those definitions. Indeed, if I were deciding this case pre\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sandoval\n   </em>\n   , I likely would have been persuaded that\n   <em>\n    Shumate\n   </em>\n   was the most on-point authority.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   But\n   <em>\n    Sandoval\n   </em>\n   pulls in the other direction. As set forth in detail in the order granting the \u00a7 2255 petition, even though\n   <em>\n    Sandoval\n   </em>\n   was not an ACCA case, its examination of\n   <em>\n    Self\n   </em>\n   strongly suggests that the Ninth Circuit would conclude that the Oregon law sweeps too broadly, capturing acts that do not bear a close enough relationship to the illegal drug trade to constitute conduct \"involving\" controlled substance manufacture, distribution, or possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In other words, no precedential Ninth Circuit decision speaks directly to the overbreadth/ACCA question presented here. And the two most relevant authorities, if extended to the ACCA context, point to diametrically opposed results. Faced with that difficulty, I chose to apply\n   <em>\n    Sandoval\n   </em>\n   , which is the more recent decision and the decision that more exhaustively explores the reach of the Oregon statute. The fact that a strong argument exists for resolving this case in a different manner does not justify reconsideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The government notes that Judge Fisher, who authored\n   <em>\n    Sandoval\n   </em>\n   , sat on the three-judge panel that affirmed petitioner's conviction and sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ernst\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=623%20Fed.%20Appx.%20333\">\n    623 Fed.Appx. at 334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That panel considered and rejected petitioner's argument that his manufacture/delivery convictions were not ACCA predicates.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=623%20Fed.%20Appx.%20333\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   I am not persuaded by the government's suggestion that Judge Fisher's participation in affirming petitioner's conviction is evidence he would reject petitioner's\n   <em>\n    Sandoval\n   </em>\n   argument. Petitioner's direct-appeal argument regarding the designation of his prior convictions as ACCA predicates was about the penalty attached to those convictions; his \u00a7 2255 argument, by contrast, focuses on the swath of conduct the statute of conviction penalizes. There is no reason to think that the direct-appeal panel considered the argument petitioner now advances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   I decline to consider the government's argument that Oregon's manufacture/delivery statute is divisible and that the\n   <em>\n    Shepard\n   </em>\n   documents in this case establish that petitioner has three prior convictions for the \"functionally separate crime[ ]\" of manufacture of a controlled substance.\n   <em>\n    Rendon v.
