As contemplated by the Magistrate Judge's Order of March 3, 2017, the parties have filed Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment. (Doc. Nos. 23 &amp; 25.) Trane has filed a Response. (Doc. No. 26.) The motions are ready for decision. For the following reasons, Trane's motion will be granted and Neblett's motion will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Agreed Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The parties have filed agreed stipulations of fact for purposes of the cross-motions for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. No. 21.) They are as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On or about November 14, 2012, Neblett was injured while cutting trees. The safety\n   lanyard that Neblett was wearing broke and allowed him to fall. He sustained injuries in the fall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Neblett was a participant and beneficiary of a self-funded employee welfare benefit plan sponsored by Trane. At all times relevant to this action, the Trane Employee Welfare Benefit Plan (the \"Plan\") was an employee welfare benefit plan as defined by ERISA. The Plan was established and maintained by Trane for the purpose of providing its employees and retirees certain medical benefits. The Plan was administered by Horizon Blue Cross/Blue Shield of New Jersey (\"Horizon BCBS\"). Xerox Recovery Services (\"Xerox\") was the authorized agent for representing Horizon BCBS in collection of the subrogation/reimbursement amounts from the payment of medical expenses for Neblett.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Plan excludes coverage for medical expenses incurred as a result of injuries that are the result of the actions of a third party that is or may be liable for all or part of such medical expenses. By the terms of the Plan, if it provides benefits under circumstances where a third party is or may be liable for such expenses, the Plan is granted subrogation and reimbursement rights and an equitable lien against any funds a participant recovers from the third party. The Plan paid $148,240.00 in medical expenses incurred by Neblett as a result of his accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Neblett and his spouse brought a separate lawsuit in this Court, alleging that the lanyard Neblett was wearing was defective or unreasonably dangerous. Medical expenses of approximately $300,000.00 were an item of damages claimed in that lawsuit. That case was mediated on May 3, 2016. Following the mediation, the Nebletts' claim was settled for an amount in excess of the amount in dispute in this case. The settlement by the Nebletts was a settlement of any and all claims and one in which they gave a complete release of all claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Neblett's counsel sent correspondence to Horizon BCBS on April 13, 2016, and requested a claims listing, from November 14, 2012 to present, setting forth claims paid on Neblett's behalf related to his fall. On April 19, 2016, Xerox, on behalf of Horizon BCBS, sent correspondence to Spicer Rudstrom, PLLC, Neil Sambursky, Esq., and Neblett's counsel, and advised that the Plan that paid for Neblett's treatment was a self-funded employee welfare benefit plan under ERISA with subrogation and/or reimbursement rights. On April 21, 2016, Neblett's counsel sent correspondence to Xerox and expressed frustration at being unable to get information from Xerox regarding any subrogation/reimbursement interest for purposes of settling Neblett's separate products liability injury claim. On April 25, 2016, Neblett's counsel again wrote Xerox, acknowledged the notice of lien, and requested an itemization of the claimed lien amount. Xerox replied with an itemization of the amounts paid by the Plan for medical expenses incurred in Neblett's treatment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On April 27, 2016, Neblett's counsel sent correspondence to Xerox acknowledging the itemization of the subrogation/reimbursement claim and asking that the lien amount be reduced.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On April 29, 2016, James D. Kay, Jr., Esq., the mediator of Neblett's products liability case, wrote to Xerox. Kay advised that mediation of the case had been difficult, and he requested that the amount of $75,000.00 be accepted for the subrogation/reimbursement\n   claim. On May 3, 2016, Neblett's counsel sent correspondence to Xerox, asserted that some of the medical claims ($3,795.00) were not related to Neblett's accident, requested that those be removed to lower the claim to $148,240.00, and asked that a settlement of the claim be accepted in the amount of $115,642.02 (21.99% less).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In a letter dated May 3, 2016, Brianne Santiago of Horizon BCBS wrote to Neblett's counsel and stated that Horizon BCBS would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be filing a lien for Mr. Neblett's medical expenses. Neblett had settled his product liability claims prior to receipt of this letter. The letter stated that \"[i]f the member is part of a self-insured group or government plan, you will need to contact the group directly to determine whether the group will be filing a lien.\" (Doc. No. 21-10 at 2.) Neblett's counsel did not contact his self-funded group after receipt of Santiago's May 3 letter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On May 5, 2016, Neblett's counsel wrote to Xerox stating that he understood Xerox had denied his request to reduce the lien amount of $148,200.00 and that the refusal to reduce the lien amount was disputed. In a letter written the dame day, Xerox advised Neblett's counsel that the subrogation/reimbursement claim was $148,240.00 and sent an itemization of the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In a letter dated May 18, 2016, and sent via fax on May 23, 2016, Neblett's counsel wrote Xerox, attached a copy of the Horizon BCBS letter of May 3, 2016 (which stated that no subrogation/reimbursement claim was going to be made), and advised that he considered the subrogation/reimbursement claim concluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The next day, May 24, 2016, Ms. Santiago of Horizon BCBS called Neblett's counsel and advised him that Horizon BCBS would indeed be asserting a subrogation/reimbursement claim. On that same day, Santiago sent correspondence stating that the May 3 letter that indicated that no subrogation/reimbursement claim would be made was sent erroneously and that Horizon BCBS would still be making its subrogation/reimbursement claim through Xerox.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Legal Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In reviewing a motion for summary judgment, this Court will only consider the narrow question of whether there are \"genuine issues as to any material fact and [whether] the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Neblett was badly injured; the Plan, which is governed by ERISA, paid his medical bills; Neblett recovered an amount in excess of the medical bills in litigation with a third party; and Trane seeks reimbursement from Neblett for $148,240.00 as a result. Trane's initial right to recover in these (common) circumstances is not disputed; rather, Neblett contends that Trane's cannot recover because it disclaimed its interest in the subrogration lien. More specifically, it appears that Neblett contends that the May 3, 2016 correspondence from Horizon BCBS to Neblett's counsel-stating that Horizon BCBS would not be filing a lien for Neblett's medical expenses-waived or estopped Trane's right to reimbursement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Trane maintains that these defenses are either unavailable or inapplicable here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   While ERISA preempts state law claims of waiver and estoppel,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201144\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), the ERISA statute itself does not specifically address whether the theories of waiver and estoppel under federal common law apply to actions brought under the statute.\n   <em>\n    Otero v.

Even assuming that agency principles could overcome the hurdle of Trane having \"knowingly\" acted through the activity of Horizon BCBS, it is clear to the Court from the stipulated facts that the May 3, 2016 letter cannot be considered by a reasonable jury to be a \"voluntary\" or \"intentional\" action. Rather, all of the facts establish that it was a mistake. The parties had exchanged correspondence amongst themselves for several months regarding the subrogation lien amount and proposed modifications thereto. Trane (through its agents) refused to compromise its reimbursement claim to the level requested by mediator Kay, but it did reduce the claim when Neblett's counsel pointed out some clarifications. Critically, on May 24, one day after Horizon BCBS became aware of the mistake and of Neblett's counsel's assertion that the matter was closed, Santiago explicitly clarified to Neblett that the May 3 letter stating no subrogation/reimbursement claim would be made was sent erroneously. Aside from the May 3 form letter, there is\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   evidence in the stipulated facts that Trane ever intended to reduce its claim below $148,240.00. In short, Neblett has not established a waiver that was voluntary or intentional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In addition, and perhaps even more importantly, even if this Court were to find a knowing and voluntary/intentional waiver, Neblett's claim would still fail because of the nature of the waiver. This would be a precise example of the \"something-for-nothing\" kind of waiver which the few courts that have entertained the possibility of waiver in the ERISA context have expressly disclaimed. Here, Neblett could not establish that Trane (via Horizon BCBS) did anything other than relinquish its own subrogation rights; Neblett has no evidence that Trane garnered\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   benefit for itself. To the contrary, Trane's purported waiver operated only to its own detriment and it still seeks reimbursement. Indeed, the facts suggest that Neblett merely seeks to take advantage of a lucky paperwork error. Trane received no consideration for its purported waiver and, because Neblett settled his products liability action prior to the purported waiver, Neblett did not act to his detriment in reliance upon it.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Glass\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10533198\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/33/1341/#p1347\">\n    33 F.3d at 1348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting waiver argument where the summary judgment record contained \"no evidence that [the insurance company] attempted to unjustly enrich itself\");\n   <em>\n    Witt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5919017\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/1269/#p1279\">\n    772 F.3d at 1279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting waiver argument where the plaintiff wanted the defendant to relinquish the benefit of the statute of limitations but had not given anything in return and noting that a waiver would not be found in a \"something-for-nothing\" situation where the defendant made a misrepresentation but did not attempt to receive an unjust benefit);\n   <em>\n    Thornton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5904925\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/797/796/#p806\">\n    797 F.Supp.2d at 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Thornton offers only\n   these employees' bare misrepresentations to establish waiver.

Moreover, Neblett has raised no argument as to ambiguity in his motion. As such, estoppel does not apply under the\n   <em>\n    Sprague\n   </em>\n   rule, because, as relevant here, the Plan is not ambiguous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Nor does the narrow exception to the\n   <em>\n    Sprague\n   </em>\n   rule apply. First, this is not a case involving \"calculation of benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Donati\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4257807\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/821/667/#p674\">\n    821 F.3d at 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (considering\n   exception where employee was originally notified retirement cash-out was $230,361.49 but was then told it was actually $38,840.34);\n   <em>\n    Bloemker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6053999\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/605/436/#p444\">\n    605 F.3d at 444\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (considering exception where retirement plan had miscalculated monthly benefit upon which retiree based retirement decision by more than five hundred dollars per month). Second, there is a missing \"traditional element of estoppel,\" as set forth in\n   <em>\n    Sprague\n   </em>\n   , because, on the undisputed facts, there was no reliance upon the May 3 letter to Neblett's detriment as Neblett had already settled his separate products liability case prior to its receipt (Stipulation No. 15).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Accordingly, the facts of this case do not support the application of equitable estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Neblett has not established that he is entitled to summary judgment on the ground of waiver or equitable estoppel. Given that there are no disputes of material fact, the Court finds that, on the basis of persuasive authority, Trane has established that it is entitled to summary judgment. Because Neblett has not avoided that, under the Plan, there is an unambiguous requirement to repay the benefits paid on Neblett's behalf, Trane is entitled to a judgment in the amount of $148,240.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Accordingly, Trane's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 23) will be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   and Neblett's Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 25) will be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .
