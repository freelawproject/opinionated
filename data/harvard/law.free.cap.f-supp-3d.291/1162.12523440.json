Plaintiff R. Alexander Acosta, Secretary of Labor (the \"Secretary\"), opposes the Motion. The Court heard oral argument on August 10, 2017 and ordered supplemental briefing, which was completed on August 16, 2017. For the reasons set forth below, the Court will deny the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 31, 2011, Penny Weymiller filed a whistleblower complaint with the U.S. Secretary of Labor, alleging that the District retaliated against her for raising concerns with asbestos removal plans, in violation of the whistleblower provisions of the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act of 1986 (\"AHERA\"). The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\") investigated Ms. Weymiller's claims and announced its determination on January 15, 2015. OSHA found that Ms. Weymiller had been subject to whistleblower retaliation in violation of both the Clean Air Act (\"CAA\") and AHERA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Under AHERA's whistleblower retaliation provisions, there is no private right of action beyond the filing of a complaint with the Secretary. However, if the Secretary determines that a violation has occurred, the statute requires that he file a complaint in the appropriate United Stated District court.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202651\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 2651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) ; 29 U.S.C. 660(c)(2). As such, after OSHA's determination that the District's actions violated AHERA' whistleblower provisions, the Secretary filed an action in this Court seeking both individual relief for Ms. Weymiller, and an injunction ordering the District to take certain steps to prevent future violations. Dkt. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the same time, the Secretary ordered individual relief for Ms. Weymiller pursuant to OSHA's determination that the District violated CAA's whistleblower retaliation provision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Exercising its rights under the CAA, the District requested a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   hearing on Ms. Weymiller's CAA claim before an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\"). On May 2, 2017, ALJ Richard M. Clark issued his Decision and Order denying Ms. Weymiller's whistleblower complaint. Dkt. 44-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Subsequently, the District sought a writ of mandamus in this Court ordering the ALJ to dismiss its review of the Secretary's determination that Ms. Weymiller had been subject to retaliation under the CAA. This Court declined to intervene, citing lack of jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. Decision and Order at 8, Dkt. 28 (finding that the Department of Labor and the courts of appeals have exclusive jurisdiction over CAA claims). After the ALJ ruled in favor of the District on Ms. Weymiller's CAA retaliation claim, neither Ms. Weymiller or the Secretary sought an appeal, though both had that right. The District then filed this motion on the grounds that the Secretary is precluded from pursuing the AHERA claim based on the doctrine of collateral estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate where a party can show that, as to any claim or defense, \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a). Here, the parties do not raise any genuine disputes of material fact. Rather, the District argues that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, because the Secretary's claim is barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The doctrine of collateral estoppel provides that \"[w]hen an issue of fact or law is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, and the determination is essential to the judgment, the determination is conclusive in a subsequent action between the parties, whether\n   on the same or a different claim.\" Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 27 (1982). Collateral estoppel applies to preclude an issue adjudicated in an earlier proceeding if: (1) the issue was necessarily decided at the previous proceeding and is identical to the one which is sought to be relitigated; (2) the first proceeding ended with a final judgment on the merits; and (3) the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted was a party or in privity with a party at the first proceeding.\n   <em>\n    Reyn's Pasta Bella, LLC v.

Neither party contests that relevant the issues of fact and law were actually litigated and determined by final judgment during the ALJ proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, the parties contest whether Ms. Weymiller and the Secretary were in privity.

In pursuing public enforcement actions, administrative agencies generally act both as a representative of a specific aggrieved individual and to vindicate a broader public interest. Aggrieved individuals therefore lack the required \"identity of interests\" with government agencies. Accordingly, few courts have found this kind of \"adequate representation\" privity between a governmental agency and private plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Secretary of Labor v.

These statements, however, do not preclude the Secretary from taking action independent of private litigants where such action is warranted. Here, the Secretary's pursuit of broader injunctive relief demonstrates a determination that the public interest would not be adequately served by vindication\n   of Ms. Weymiller's individual rights alone. Because there was no identity of interests, the Court finds that the Secretary was not in privity with Ms. Weymiller when she litigated her claim under the CAA, and is not estopped from pursing his claim under AHERA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Failure to Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The District argues that by failing to timely appeal the determination by the ALJ that no retaliation occurred, the Secretary adopted its findings as his own and thus is precluded from challenging them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2024.110\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 24.110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (\"if no timely petition for review [of the ALJ decision] is filed ... the decision will become the final order of the Secretary [and] is not subject to judicial review.\"). The ALJ's decision, and the Secretary's adoption of that decision do no more than reflect the agency's determination of Ms. Weymiller's claim against the District under the CAA. The Court has already found that previous agency determinations have no preclusive effect on the Secretary's ability to bring claims under AHERA, because Congress has expressly provided for the determination of such claims by a district court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court finds that the requirements for applying the collateral estoppel doctrine have not been satisfied by the particular circumstances of this case. Congress has limited the preclusive effect of prior agency determinations on claims under AHERA. Further, the Secretary does not represent the same legal interests as Ms. Weymiller, so as to establish privity between the two parties.

Given that the Secretary's order on the CAA claim is moot after the ALJ found for the District in that proceeding, whether such injunctive relief is appropriate under the CAA has no bearing on this matter.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    The parties do contest whether the Secretary had the \"full and fair opportunity\" to litigate the matter in front of the ALJ.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Pena v.
