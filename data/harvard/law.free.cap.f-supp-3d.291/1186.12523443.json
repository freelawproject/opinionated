The government argues that Gaspar-Juarez's conviction for rape in the third degree categorically fits the corresponding federal definition for sexual abuse of a minor, is an \"aggravated felony,\" and thus, Gaspar-Juarez's due process rights were not violated in his underlying deportation proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   To determine whether a conviction for rape in the third degree under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Or.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20163.355\">\n    Or.

The California statute defined a \"minor\" as someone under the age of 18. The Court agreed with the defendant that because the generic federal definition of \"sexual abuse of a minor\" requires that the victim be younger than 16, the California statute did not categorically fit within the federal definition and the conviction was not an aggravated felony.
