BROWNING, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS MATTER\n   </strong>\n   comes before the Court on the United States' Sealed Motion Regarding Attorney Conflict, filed May, 4, 2017 (Doc. 1126)(\"Attorney Conflict Motion\"). The Court held hearings on November 8-9, 2017, Transcript of Hearing (held November 8, 2017), filed November 20, 2017 (Doc. 1456)(\"Nov. 8 Tr.\"); Transcript of Hearing (held November 9, 2017), filed November 20, 2017 (Doc. 1457)(\"Nov. 9 Tr.\"), and again on November 27-29, 2017, Draft Transcript of Motion Hearing (taken November 27-29, 2017)(\"Second Hearing Tr.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The primary issue is whether Michael V. Davis' ethical duties to his former client, Defendant Roy Paul Martinez, prevent Mr. Davis from representing Defendant Carlos Herrera in this case. The Court determines that Mr. Davis' represented R.P. Martinez in a matter that is substantially related to this case and that R.P. Martinez' interests are materially adverse to Herrera's. Accordingly, the Court concludes that Mr. Davis' ethical duties to R.P. Martinez prevent him from representing Herrera in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Before setting out its findings of fact, the Court will provide background information regarding the Syndicato de Nuevo Mexico (\"SNM\") as well as background information regarding each of the Defendants in this case and the charges that they face. The Court takes its background facts from the Superseding Indictment, filed April 21, 2016 (Doc. 367). The facts are largely unchanged from those that the Court provided in its Memorandum Opinion and Order, filed October 28, 2016 (Doc. 753).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Court does not set forth these facts as findings or the truth. The Court recognizes that the factual background is largely the United States' version of events and that the Defendants are all presumed innocent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   This case deals with crimes that SNM allegedly committed through its members.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Superseding Indictment at 2. SNM, through its members, operated in the District of New Mexico at all relevant times, and its members engaged in acts of violence and other criminal activities, \"including murder, kidnapping, attempted murder, conspiracy to manufacture/distribute narcotics, and firearms trafficking.\" Superseding Indictment at 2. SNM constitutes an enterprise \"as defined in Title 18, United States Code, Section 1959(b)(2), that is, a group of individuals associated in fact that engaged in, and the activities of which affected, interstate and foreign commerce.\" Superseding Indictment at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   SNM is a violent prison gang formed in the early 1980s at the Penitentiary of New\n   Mexico (\"PNM\") after a violent prison riot at PNM during which inmates seriously assaulted and raped twelve correctional officers after taking them hostage. Superseding Indictment at 3. During the riot, thirty-three inmates were killed, and over 200 were injured.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Superseding Indictment at 3. After the PNM riot, SNM expanded throughout the state's prison system and has had as many as 500 members.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Superseding Indictment at 3. SNM has approximately 250 members, run by \"a 'panel' or 'mesa' (Spanish for table) of leaders who issued orders to subordinate gang members.\" Superseding Indictment at 3. SNM controls drug distribution and other illegal activities within the New Mexico penal system, but it also conveys orders outside the prison system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Superseding Indictment at 3. Members who rejoin their communities after completing their sentences are expected to further the gang's goals, the main one being the control of and profit from narcotics trafficking.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Superseding Indictment at 4. Members who fail \"to show continued loyalty to the gang [are] disciplined in various ways, [ ] includ[ing] murder and assaults.\" Superseding Indictment at 4. SNM also intimidates and influences smaller New Mexico Hispanic gangs to expand its illegal activities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Superseding Indictment at 4. If another gang does not abide by SNM's demands, SNM manages to assault or kill one of the other gang's members to show its power.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Superseding Indictment at 4. SNM's rivalry with other gangs also manifests itself in beatings and stabbings within the prison system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Superseding Indictment at 4. SNM further engages in violence \"to assert its gang identity, to claim or protect its territory, to challenge or respond to challenges, to retaliate against a rival gang or member, [and] to gain notoriety and show its superiority over others.\" Superseding Indictment at 4-5. To show its strength and influence, SNM expects its members to confront and attack any suspected law-enforcement informants, cooperating witnesses, homosexuals, or sex offenders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Superseding Indictment at 5. To achieve its purpose of preserving its power, SNM uses intimidation, violence, threats of violence, assaults, and murder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Superseding Indictment at 7. SNM as an enterprise generates income by having its members and associates traffic controlled substances and extort narcotic traffickers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Superseding Indictment at 7. SNM's recent activities in a conspiracy to murder high-ranking New Mexico Corrections Department Officials inspired the present investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The other relevant facts giving rise to this case are as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In March of 2014, a Do\u00f1a Ana County, New Mexico, grand jury indicted Defendants Jerry Montoya and Jerry Armenta on charges of first-degree murder and four other felonies related to the death of Javier Enrique Molina, Montoya and Armenta's fellow inmate during their incarceration at the Southern New Mexico state prison.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. DeLeon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207242579\">\n    2016 WL 7242579\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. The New Mexico Third Judicial District Attorney's Office accused Montoya and Armenta of fatally stabbing Molina with a shank in a gang-related attack.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Do\u00f1a Ana County District Attorney then dismissed the charges against Montoya and Armenta-as well as separate charges against alleged accomplice and Defendant Mario Rodriguez, who\n   had been charged with possession of a deadly weapon by a prisoner, tampering, and conspiracy-in November of 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Defendants Arturo Arnulfo Garcia, Gerald Archuleta, Benjamin Clark, Mario Rodriguez, Anthony Ray Baca, Robert Martinez, R.P. Martinez, and Daniel Sanchez are the alleged enterprise leaders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Superseding Indictment at 6.

In the Plea Agreement, R.P. Martinez admits the following facts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   In 1995, while incarcerated at the Penitentiary of New Mexico, I became a member of the Syndicato Nuevo Mexico (SNM) prison gang. The SNM is an ongoing criminal organization whose members, prospects and associates engage in acts of violence and other criminal activities, including murder, kidnapping, attempted murder, and conspiracy to manufacture/distribute narcotics. The SNM operates in the District of New Mexico and elsewhere. The SNM constitutes an enterprise (individuals associated in fact that engaged in, or the activities of which, affected interstate commerce) that is engaged in racketeering activity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   In 2013, I was an active member of the SNM. On or before 2013 I conspired with Robert Martinez, a.k.a. \"Baby Rob,\" Anthony Baca, a.k.a. \"Pup,\" and others to murder G.M. and D.S. Specifically, Anthony Baca was angry at the New Mexico Corrections Department (NMCD) for moving him out of State. Baca, as the purported leader of the SNM at the Time, ordered the murders of G.M. and D.S. As a result, in 2015, I agreed to write letters to SNM gang members ordering the murders and in fact, did write letters ordering the members to kill G.M. and D.S. I did this by virtue of my membership in the SNM and to maintain and increase my position in the SNM.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Thus, from 2013 to continuing into 2015, I conspired with members of the SNM gang to murder G.M[.] and D.S.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Plea Agreement \u00b6 7, at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   17.

As noted above, the Superseding Indictment charges Herrera with both conspiracy to murder J.M. and the murder of J.M., Counts 6 and 7, respectively.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Superseding Indictment at 20-21. Also as noted above, the Superseding Indictment charges R.P. Martinez with both conspiracy to murder D.S. and conspiracy to murder G.M., counts 9 and 10, respectively.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Superseding Indictment at 27-28. On May 3, 2016, the Honorable Karen B. Molzen, United States Magistrate Judge, appointed Mr. Davis to represent Herrera.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CJA Appointment, filed May 3, 2016 (Doc. 430). On September 7, 2016, Herrera asked the Court to \"provide him a second chair counsel in this matter,\" and noted that he \"is not requesting 'learned counsel' in this matter.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex Parte Motion for Second Counsel and Appointment Pro Hac Vice at 1, 3, filed September 7, 2017 (Doc. 674). The Court obliged, and appointed Carey Bhalla to represent Herrera.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex Parte Order Approving Second Counsel and Appointment Pro Hac Vice at 1, filed September 22, 2016 (Doc. 697).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   2. On September 15, 2016, Plaintiff United States of America and R.P. Martinez filed their Plea Agreement with the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plea Agreement at 8-9, filed September 15, 2016 (Doc. 686). Accordingly, R.P. Martinez pled guilty in a hearing before the Honorable Gregory B. Wormuth, United States Magistrate Judge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plea Minute Sheet, filed September 15, 2016 (Doc. 687). Conflict-of-interest issues remain, notwithstanding R.P. Martinez' guilty plea, because the United States \"anticipate[s] that Martinez will be a witness in this case and his testimony will include this murder,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the murder for which Mr. Davis represented R.P. Martinez.

On May 4, 2017, the United States filed the Attorney Conflict Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Attorney Conflict Motion at 15. The United States asserts that it has a duty to bring conflicts of interest to the Court's attention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Attorney Conflict Motion at 2. The United States also asserts that the Court has a duty to investigate once it is aware of a possible conflict of interest, and a duty to determine whether to disqualify an attorney if its investigation reveals a potential or actual conflict of interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Attorney Conflict Motion at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   4. The United States argues that a defendant's \"Sixth Amendment right to conflict-free counsel\" extends beyond situations where defense counsel simultaneously represents codefendants. Attorney Conflict Motion at 4. Instead, according to the United States, that right applies whenever defense counsel \" 'owes conflicting duties to the defendant and some other third person.' \" Attorney Conflict Motion at 4 (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v. Soto Hernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12041584\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/849/1325/#p1328\">\n    849 F.2d 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1328 (10th Cir. 1988) ). The United States acknowledges that \"[t]he Sixth Amendment also guarantees a defendant the right to counsel of his own choice,\" but contends that this right is not absolute, because, \" '[e]ven when a defendant seeks to proceed with conflicted counsel by waiving the conflict, a district court retains authority to reject the proffered waiver to preserve ethical standards and preserve a fair trial.' \" Attorney Conflict Motion at 5-6 (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v. Evanson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4066898\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/584/904/#p909\">\n    584 F.3d 904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 909 (10th Cir. 2009) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   5. The United States argues that Mr. Davis' prior representation of R.P. Martinez \"may be adverse to Herrera's interests in the instant case,\" because, \"[i]f Herrera goes to trial, Mr. Davis may be in a position where he would have to cross-examine his former client, and the scope of that cross-examination could include the murder in which Martinez pled guilty in 2002 while Mr. Davis represented him.\" Attorney Conflict Motion at 6-7. It follows, according to the United States, that \"Mr. Davis might not be able to uphold the duties of zealous advocacy and loyalty that he owes Herrera.\" Attorney Conflict Motion at 7. \"Due process requires that a criminal defendant be represented by conflict-free counsel[,] ... [so a] Defendant may not waive such an actual conflict, [and] new counsel would be necessary.\" Attorney Conflict Motion at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   6. The United States then notes that the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico applies the New Mexico Rules of Professional Conduct in its criminal proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Attorney Conflict Motion at 6.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   D.N.M. LR-Cr R. 57.2 (\"In all criminal proceedings, attorneys will comply with the Rules of Professional Conduct adopted by the Supreme Court of the State of New Mexico, unless modified by local rule or Court order.\"). The United States argues that-apart from any constitutional issues-those ethical rules mean that \"Mr. Davis' representation of Defendant may not continue, even if Defendant were to consent.\" Attorney Conflict Motion at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   7. The United States identifies three distinct ethical issues that prevent Mr.\n   Davis from representing Herrera. First, the United States contends that Mr. Davis cannot represent Herrera, because the New Mexico Rules of Professional Conduct state that attorneys \" 'should not represent a client whose interests are adverse to those of a present client, or whose interests are adverse to those of a former client on a matter that is the same or substantially related to the previous matter.' \" Attorney Conflict Motion at 8 (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Stein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784105\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/143/462/\">\n    2008-NMSC-013\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784105\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/143/462/\">\n    143 N.M. 462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784105\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/143/462/\">\n    177 P.3d 513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 519 ).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.M. R. Prof'l Conduct 16-109(A)(\"A lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter shall not thereafter represent another person in the same or a substantially related matter in which that person's interests are materially adverse to the interests of the former client unless the former client gives informed consent, confirmed in writing.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   8. Second, the United States argues that Mr. Davis cannot represent Herrera, because the New Mexico Rules of Professional Conduct prevent lawyers from using information related to a prior representation \"to the disadvantage of the former client except ... when the information has become generally known; or ... reveal[ing] information relating to the representation.\" N.M. R. Prof'l Conduct 16-109(C).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Attorney Conflict Motion at 8. The United States\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   does not pretend to know all of the information Mr. Davis has which relates to his representation of Martinez; however, neither Mr. Davis nor anyone else can say with any certainty that some aspect of such information is not, and will not later turn out to be, relevant to Herrera's case. Moreover, whether Mr. Davis has information relating to his representation of Martinez that is relevant in Herrera's case may well be later judged in hindsight by persons who will then know what Herrera and/or others will bring forth as relevant links between the cases.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Attorney Conflict Motion at 8-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   9. Third, the United States observes that the New Mexico Rules of Professional Conduct provide that \" 'a lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation involves a concurrent conflict of interest,' \" and that a concurrent conflict of interest exists when \" 'there is a significant risk that the representation of one or more clients will be materially limited by the lawyer's responsibilities to another client, a former client or a third person or by a personal interest of the lawyer.' \" Attorney Conflict Motion at 9 (quoting N.M. R. Prof'l Conduct 16-107(A) ). The United States asserts that Mr. Davis' duties to R.P. Martinez could limit Mr. Davis' representation of Herrera, because if R.P. Martinez testifies, then he\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   would likely be cross-examined about his involvement as an SNM member. During his representation of Martinez, Mr. Davis dealt with that very issue. Mr. Davis would be prohibited from using that information to assist Herrera in his defense because Mr. Davis acquired that information in connection with his representation of Martinez.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Attorney Conflict Motion at 11 n.6. The United States elaborates that, \" '[w]hen defense counsel has previously represented a government witness in a related case, the primary conflict-of-interest concern is that defense counsel may not be able to effectively cross-examine the witness for fear of divulging privileged information.' \" Attorney Conflict Motion at 12 (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v. Bowie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531883\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/892/1494/#p1501\">\n    892 F.2d 1494\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1501 (10th Cir. 1990) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   10. The United States asserts that those three ethical issues mean that, \"[e]ven assuming that the conflict in this case is 'potential' in nature, the negative consequences which would arise if the conflict\n   did develop are so significant that new counsel should be appointed,\" and that the \"issue should be addressed now in order to avoid such a significant injury to the administration of justice in this case.\" Attorney Conflict Motion at 12. The United States adds, in the alternative, that rule 44 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure indicates that \"a hearing should be held to permit the district court to affirmatively participate in a defendant's waiver decision ... to determine whether he knowingly and intelligently made the decision to continue with the conflicted counsel.\" Attorney Conflict Motion at 13. The United States also notes that the Court has discretion regarding whether to accept Herrera's waiver, even if the Court finds that such a waiver is knowing and voluntary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Attorney Conflict Motion at 14-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     The Response\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   11. Herrera filed his Response on May 25, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant Carlos Herrera's Response to Government's Ex Parte Motion to [sic] Regarding Attorney Conflict [Doc. 1126] at 14, filed May 25, 2017 (Doc. 1164)(\"Response\"). Herrera begins by noting that, \"[s]ince representing Mr. Martinez, [Mr. Davis] has handled thousands of cases, including murder cases, destroyed Mr. Martinez's file years ago, and has no recollection of any contact, direct or indirect, with Mr. Martinez other than what is a matter of public record in reports and court filings.\" Response at 2. Herrera supports those assertions by attaching the Davis Aff. to his Response, and that affidavit states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   5. Nearly seventeen (17) years ago, in 2000, while under contract with the New Mexico Public Defender Department, I was appointed to represent Defendant, Roy Martinez, on a State of New Mexico Murder charge related to the strangulation death of an inmate at the Bernalillo County Detention Center (BCDC).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   6. Although there were allegations that the murder was related to SNM, the existence of the SNM and Martinez' gang affiliation was never an essential part of the case, nor an element of the homicide charges.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   7. Martinez and others, were alleged to have strangled an inmate at BCDC in retaliation for some SNM information, the nature of which I do not recall.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   10. I destroyed my file many years ago and have no written records of my representation of Mr. Martinez.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   11. More importantly, I have absolutely no recollection of any communications I had with Mr. Martinez. In fact, all of the information I have placed in this affidavit regarding his case resulted from a public records search of Mr. Martinez' case. Consequently, I have no client confidences that would harm Mr. Martinez by my continued representation of Defendant Herrera.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   12.

In response to the United States' argument that the Court should hold a hearing under rule 44 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, Herrera argues that rule 44 does not apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 3. Rule 44 does not apply, according to Herrera, because it addresses the propriety of joint representation-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , where one lawyer represents two defendants in the same proceeding-whereas this case involves successive representation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 3-4. Herrera acknowledges, however, that \"the Court may proceed to\n   consider this motion within its inherent authority.\" Response at 4 (citing\n   <em>\n    Wheat v.

Herrera asserts that Mr. Davis has two duties to R.P. Martinez as a former client: (i) Mr. Davis cannot represent \" 'a client whose ... interests are adverse to [R.P. Martinez'] on a matter that is the same or substantially related to a previous matter,' \"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Response at 4-5 (quoting N.M. R.

Martinez] except ... when the information has become generally known,' \"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Response at 5 (quoting N.M. R. Prof'l Conduct 16-109(C) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   14. Herrera argues that neither of those duties prevent Mr. Davis from representing Herrera. As to the first duty, Herrera contends that this case is not substantially related to Mr. Davis' earlier representation of R.P. Martinez.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 6. Herrera states that two matters are substantially related \" 'if they involve the same transaction or legal dispute or if there otherwise is a substantial risk that confidential factual information as would normally have been obtained in the prior representation would materially advance the client's position in the subsequent matter.' \" Response at 6 (emphasis omitted)(quoting Committee Commentary to N.M. R. Prof'l Conduct 16-109 cmt. 3). Herrera also observes that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   Information that has been disclosed to the public or to other parties adverse to the former client ordinarily will not be disqualifying. Information acquired in a prior representation may have been rendered obsolete by the passage of time, a circumstance that may be relevant in determining whether two representations are substantially related.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Response at 6 (emphasis omitted)(quoting Committee Commentary to N.M. R. Prof'l Conduct 16-109 cmt. 3). Herrera concludes that, \"[s]ince this case does not involve the homicide seventeen (17) years ago and [Mr. Davis] has no confidential information, the cases are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   substantially related.\" Response at 7 (emphasis in original). As to Mr. Davis' second duty to R.P. Martinez, the duty not to use or reveal confidential information, Herrera contends that there is no danger that Mr. Davis will violate that duty, because Mr. Davis has no confidential information to use or reveal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 9 (citing Davis Aff. \u00b6 11, at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   15.

The Court articulated its understanding:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   (i) that \"the Government wants Mr. Davis off the case,\" Nov. 8 Tr. at 9:14-15 (Court); (ii) that \"Mr. Martinez is not consenting to [Mr. Davis] staying on the case and waiving any conflict,\" Nov. 8 Tr. at 9:20-21 (Court); (iii) that \"[i]t looks to me like it's an actual conflict\" of interest, because \"we're sitting right here in the same courtroom,\" and it \"was always [Edward] Bennett Williams' Rule on Conflicts, [that] if you're in the same room, then it's probably an actual conflict,\" Nov. 8 Tr. at 9:21-10:2 (Court); and (iv) that it could accept a waiver of an actual conflict of interest, \"[b]ut I'm not so certain I [can] cram [one] down ... over an objection,\" Nov. 8 Tr. at 10:8-9 (Court). The Court then asked the United States to confirm that its \"worst fear\" regarding Mr. Davis is that he will \"end up ... cross-examining Mr. Martinez.\" Nov. 8 Tr. at 10:21-21 (Court). The United States indicated that its concern was, indeed, based on R.P. Martinez' anticipated testimony and Mr. Davis' cross-examination:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   I think that what's important is-especially important in this case-is the fact that he represented Mr. Martinez on an SNM murder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   Mr. Martinez will be testifying in the trial that Mr. Herrera is set to be tried, the first group, the Javier Molina murder and the other conspiracy murders. He will be testifying in that case. He will be talking about the SNM. He will be talking about the racketeering activities, et cetera. And as part of that, he will be talking about murders that he committed. Specifically, he killed a person with the last name of Cavalier, at the Metropolitan Detention Center.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Nov. 8 Tr. at 11:10-23 (Armijo). The United States then clarified that Mr. Davis represented R.P. Martinez in the Cavalier murder, and that Mr. Davis' representation of R.P. Martinez in connection with that murder is \"the one that's the true issue.\" Nov. 8 Tr. at 12:1-2 (Armijo). The United States elaborated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   We based our [motion] upon the J &amp; C in his Cavalier murder case. But I learned this morning that [Mr. Davis] represented Mr. Martinez on two murder cases. One of the murder cases he got off on because, I believe, shortly before trial, one of the witnesses was a former client of Mr. Davis'.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   Then he went on to represent him in the other murder case, which is the case that I was telling you about, which will be testified about.....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Nov. 8 Tr. at 12:11-19 (Armijo). The United States elaborated further regarding R.P. Martinez' anticipated testimony:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   So we have Mr. Martinez testifying about this murder, talking about it with-talking about other people involved, other SNM gang members. And he will also be testifying that Carlos Herrera is an SNM gang member that he knows. So those are things that he will be testifying about. I'm sure that the defense team, Herrera defense team, may question him about how he knows Carlos Herrera, how he knows he's a gang member. I'm sure they'll test that, you know, to the best of their ability cross-examine him on all of his testimony regarding the gang, the enterprise, the racketeering activities, about the previous murders that he committed, which Mike Davis was involved in two of them; one that he already got off on because of the conflict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Nov. 8 Tr. at 13:1-16 (Armijo). The United States then informed the Court that \"Mr. Martinez has told me through his attorney that he is not willing to waive the conflict. One of his concerns is that Mr. Davis knows how to push his buttons\" in a way that \"would impact him being cross-examined\" by Mr. Davis. Nov. 8 Tr. at 14:19-22, 15:3-4 (Armijo).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   17. The United States closed by preemptively addressing two arguments that it anticipated from Mr. Davis. First, the United States addressed the argument that Mr. Davis could avoid the conflict-of-interest issue by permitting co-counsel to cross-examine R.P. Martinez.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 8 Tr. at 13:17-21 (Armijo). According to the United States, another witness will testify regarding the murder underlying Mr. Davis' representation of R.P. Martinez, which raises the question whether Mr. Davis would need to avoid cross-examining that witness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 8 Tr. at 13:22-14:7 (Armijo). The United States also observed that, in closing arguments, Mr. Davis will likely, \"want[ ] to talk about the veracity of Mr. Martinez' testimony, then does that mean he isn't allowed to argue that.\" Nov. 8 Tr. at 14:4-7 (Armijo). Second, the United States responds to \"[t]he fact that [Mr. Davis] indicates he doesn't really have an independent recollection of communications with Mr. Martinez,\" by raising the potential scenario where \"in the middle of [R.P. Martinez'] testimony things start to resonate, he starts to remember.\" Tr. 14:8-12 (Armijo). The United States concluded by stating that those two issues cast doubt on whether \"we can separate him and cure the problem.\" Nov. 8 Tr. at 14:16-18 (Armijo).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   18. Mr. Davis then came to the podium, and stated that \"I like to think I have a close relationship with all of my clients,\" but \"once 17 years passes, I have very little, if any, recollection, which is the case here.\" Nov. 8 Tr. at 15:15-19 (Davis). Mr. Davis argued that he does not have an actual conflict of interest, because he does not remember any confidential information regarding his representation of R.P. Martinez, and \"[a]n actual conflict would be, is if I represented a witness in the case in another separate legal matter, and in the course of that legal matter that I would receive some confidences that somehow I could use to benefit Mr. Herrera.\" Nov. 8 Tr. at 16:13-17 (Davis). According to Mr. Davis, that R.P. Martinez' testimony might refresh his memory is, at most, a potential conflict of interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 8 Tr. at 16:23-24 (Davis). Mr. Davis added that, even \"if the Court takes a different position,\" it could \"obviate any concern of a conflict by simply allowing [his co-counsel] to conduct the cross-examination.\" Nov. 8 Tr. at 22:25-23:1 (Davis).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   19. The Court then invited R.P. Martinez' attorney in this case, Marcia Milner, to speak on the conflict-of-interest issues, but she declined.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 8 Tr. at 23:6-10 (Court, Milner). The Court indicated that it had a few questions for her anyhow.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 8 Tr. at 23:11-12 (Court). \"Seriously, what do we mean here by Mr. Davis pushes [R.P. Martinez'] buttons?\" Nov. 8 Tr. at 16-17. She responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   I guess, during the course of their relationship-I mean, they were difficult cases, I'm sure that there were issues. But Mr. Martinez made it very clear to me, once he realized that Mr. Davis was on the case, that he had concerns that based on their relationship, Mr. Davis would know how to push his button, without disclosing what those actual issues were.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Nov. 8 Tr. at 23:18-25 (Milner).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   20. The Court gave \"the final word on this\" to the United States. Nov. 8 at Tr. 24:21-22. The United States took that opportunity to explain that this case is substantially related to R.P. Martinez' earlier prosecution:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   We have to prove that there was an enterprise, in this case the SNM. We have to prove our interstate commerce. We have to prove racketeering activity, the murder, and the motive in the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   And I'm just going to give the Court an example of how-why Mr. Davis' representation is important. He says that, you know, it was just a murder case. But\n   in that case, as I indicated before, it was an SNM hit. But if I am recalling-there could be something that Mr. Martinez told Mr. Davis back during that representation. For instance, he could have said: It isn't an SNM hit, it was a personal beef. I just wanted to kill this guy. So I'm taking the rap for anybody involved. Nobody else was involved. I'm pleading guilty. And this was not gang related.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   And I don't know if that conversation took place. But let's say for argument's purposes it did take place. And now Mr. Martinez is taking the stand, now that he is cooperating, and he's going to say that this was an SNM hit, and he's going to name other people that committed the crime with him, that were co-conspirators. And Mr. Davis then could say, you know what, he told me something different. He told me that it wasn't an SNM hit. And that's where the issue comes up.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Nov. 8 Tr. at 25:5-26:6 (Armijo).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   21. On the next day, Mr. Davis asked the Court to take up the conflict-of-interest issue again.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 9 Tr. at 48:17-19 (Davis). The Court agreed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 9 Tr. at 49:5-6 (Court). According to Mr. Davis, the Court should consider-before disqualifying Mr. Davis-three factors: (i) \"the likelihood that the conflict will occur,\" Nov. 9 Tr. at 78:8-9 (Davis); (ii) \"the severity of the threat to counsel's effectiveness to Mr. Herrera,\" Nov. 9 Tr. at 78:25-79:1 (Davis); and (iii) \"whether there are alternative measures available other than disqualifying\" Mr. Davis, Nov. 9 Tr. at 79:6-8 (Davis). Mr. Davis argued that each of those factors militated against disqualifying him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 9 Tr. at 78:8-79:16 (Davis). Mr. Davis added that \"there are some serious consequences to my removal, Judge.\" Nov. 9 Tr. at 79:17-18 (Davis). Mr. Davis explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   If you remove me from this, Ms. Bhalla is left alone on this case. And she was brought in as second chair. She's not the lead counsel on this case. She was to assist in research, writing, assisting me in the trial work on the case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   And, frankly, I don't even know who is left on the CJA panel, if I'm removed from this case. I've taken a quick look at the conflicts panel, and it's pretty thin pickings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   The next thing is, if I am replaced, the new attorney is going to need time to get up to speed on a case that I've been working for a year-and-a-half. And, Judge, I'm not ready, and I still have things I have to do, and the trial is in two months. That sets up a motion for a continuance, or a motion for severance from the main group, because Mr. Herrera will not be prepared to go to trial. And forcing him to trial could lead to a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Nov. 9 Tr. at 79:18-80:11 (Davis).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     Supplemental Authority\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   22. After the hearing, Herrera filed his Supplemental Authority in Support of Defendant's Response to Government's Motion Regarding Attorney Conflict [Doc. 1126], filed November 22, 2017 (Doc. 1469)(\"Supplement\"). Herrera asserts that he is \"prepared to state on the record that he waives any conceivable conflict and wishes to be represented by his attorney for last one and a half years, undersigned counsel.\" Supplement at 2. Herrera argues, however, that no conflict of interest exists.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supplement at 3. \"[T]he Government is unable to cite the Court to any instances of a conflict other than the mere fact that the current case involves the SNM and the prior representation of Martinez seventeen (17) years ago also involved the SNM.\" Supplement at 3. Herrera contends that Martinez, likewise, \"cites to no instances of conflict other than to\n   cavalierly state that undersigned counsel 'knows how to push his buttons.' \" Supplement at 3. Herrera asserts that \"the only connection with this case and the prior case is that both cases involve activities of the SNM,\" which is not enough to render them substantially related for the purposes of the New Mexico Rules of Professional Conduct, because \"a mere resemblance of the two cases is not sufficient to establish a conflict.\" Supplement at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   23. Herrera also argues that \"[t]he Court clearly recognizes a presumption in favor of Defendant's choice of counsel.\" Supplement at 6 (citing\n   <em>\n    Wheat v.

Herrera admits that Mr. Davis \"is appointed and not retained,\" but he argues that \"this is a distinction without a difference\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   Undersigned counsel has been working with the Defendant for over one and a half (1\u00bd) years. They have met well over thirty-five (35) times during this period. Counsel has become close with Defendant and his close friends. The attorney/client relationship is strong and undersigned counsel is Herrera's \"preferred attorney\". If the Defendant chose to hire an attorney, he would hire undersigned counsel. It is his counsel of choice, Michael Davis, that is the relevant inquiry. Not the fact that he's court appointed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Supplement at 6. According to Herrera, the Court can respect Herrera's choice of counsel while simultaneously resolving any potential conflict by having Mr. Davis' co-counsel cross-examine R.P. Martinez.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supplement at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   <strong>\n    5.\n    <em>\n     Notice Regarding Attorney Conflict\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   24. On November 22, 2017, R.P.

The Court held a second hearing on November 27-29, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Hearing Tr. at 1:9-11. As it began the hearing on November 27, 2017, the Court indicated that it was working on its opinion regarding the Attorney Conflict Motion and that \"right now it's drafted as a grant for the motion to disqualify.\" Second Hearing Tr. at 7:18-24 (Court). Mr. Davis then asked whether \"the Court considered the possibility of just disqualifying me from handling Mr. Martinez, as opposed to removing me from the entire case as an alternative to disqualification?\" Second Hearing Tr. at 8:12-16 (Davis). The Court answered that it considered that possibility, but \"I'm not sure I can really sort that out and leave you in the case.\" Second Hearing Tr. at 8:17-20 (Court). In response to a second question from Mr. Davis, the Court indicated that Mr. Davis should stay in court and continue representing Herrera until it issued its written opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Hearing Tr. at 8:24-9:7 (Davis, Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   26.

The Court then indicated that \"I want either three from each side as a batting order, or if y'all can agree ... give me your top three.\" Second\n   Hearing Tr. at 778:11-16 (Court).

LR-Cr R. 57.2. Those rules impose two distinct duties vis-\u00e0-vis an attorney's former clients. The first is a duty of confidentiality. Attorneys cannot \"use information relating to the representation\" of a former client to their disadvantage, unless \"the information has become generally known.\" N.M. R.

Martinez, because it involves the same legal dispute. Herrera is charged with two violations of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201959\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"VICAR\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Superseding Indictment at 20-21. To determine whether Mr. Davis' earlier representation of R.P. Martinez is substantially related to Herrera's prosecution under VICAR, it is important to understand what the United States must prove to obtain a VICAR conviction. A VICAR violation requires an underlying state-law offense,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , someone \"murders, kidnaps, maims, assaults with a dangerous weapon, commits assault resulting in serious bodily injury upon, or threatens to commit a crime of violence against any individual in violation of the laws of any State or the United States, or attempts or conspires so to do.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201959\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The underlying state-law offense becomes a federal VICAR violation only when it is committed: (i) \"as consideration for the receipt of, or as consideration for a promise or agreement to pay, anything of pecuniary value from an enterprise engaged in racketeering activity\"; or (ii) \"for the purpose of gaining entrance to or maintaining or increasing position in an enterprise engaged in racketeering activity.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201959\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). For VICAR purposes, an enterprise is a legal entity, or a \"union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity, which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201959\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Racketeering activity includes \"any act or threat involving murder, kidnapping, gambling, arson, robbery, bribery, extortion, dealing in obscene matter, or dealing in a controlled substance\" that is a state-law felony,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201961\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(A), and \"any act which is indictable under any\" one of myriad federal statutes, \u00a7 1961(1)(B)-(G). The United States must, thus, go beyond proving that\n   Herrera conspired to murder J.M. and murdered J.M.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Superseding Indictment at 20-21. To obtain a VICAR conviction the United States must show that the SNM exists, that it is a \"group of individuals associated in fact,\" that it engages in interstate commerce or that its activities affect interstate commerce,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201959\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2), and that it is engaged in racketeering activity,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201959\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), such as murder, extortion, and dealing drugs,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201961\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   49. To satisfy that burden, the United States will elicit testimony from R.P. Martinez that supports the essential elements that it must prove: (i) that the SNM exists as an enterprise, specifically a \"group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity, which is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201959\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2) ; (ii) that the SNM has a structure, hierarchy, and certain other customs; and (iii) that the SNM engages in racketeering activity,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Nov. 8 Tr. at 11:18-23 (Armijo)(\"He will be talking about the SNM. He will be talking about the racketeering activities, et cetera.\").\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Nov. 8 Tr. at 25:4-9 (Armijo)(\"We have to prove that there was an enterprise, in this case the SNM. We have to prove our interstate commerce. We have to prove racketeering activity, the murder, and the motive in the case.\"). The United States will try to elicit testimony from R.P. Martinez regarding the murder for which Mr. Davis represented R.P. Martinez, and R.P. Martinez will probably testify that the murder was gang-motivated and not the result of a personal grievance with the victim, which makes the murder relevant to the SNM's goals and operations. The United States plans to call another witness-Gerald Archuleta-to testify regarding the same murder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 8 Tr. at 13:22-14:3 (Armijo). Testimony regarding that murder is probative regarding both of the existence of the SNM as an enterprise and of the SNM's engagement in racketeering activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   50. Herrera, does not, however, want the United States to establish any of VICAR's elements, including the SNM's existence and its engagement in racketeering activity. Consequently, R.P. Martinez' impeachment will be an important part of Herrera's defense, which renders R.P. Martinez' earlier case, in which Mr. Davis represented R.P. Martinez, substantially related to this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pickney v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9237623\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/851/479/#p487\">\n    851 A.2d at 488\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[B]ecause impeachment of Mr. Henderson [a former client] would be an important part of the defense, issues concerning Henderson's credibility were therefore 'substantially related' to Mr. Wood's representation of appellant [a current client].\").\n   <em>\n    But\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9237623\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/851/479/#p487\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 488 n.9 (\"On the other hand, we cannot say that a refusal to disqualify Mr. Wood would have been an abuse of discretion, given the closeness of this case.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   51. Herrera's \"interests are materially adverse to the interests of\" R.P. Martinez. N.M. R. Prof'l Conduct 16-109(A). R.P. Martinez has accepted a plea bargain from the United States and is going to testify against Herrera.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Attorney Conflict Motion at 2. As stated above, Herrera will likely seek to discredit or otherwise undermine R.P. Martinez' testimony, including his testimony regarding the state case in which Mr. Davis represented R.P. Martinez.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Roach\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4292257\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/912/1153/#p1172\">\n    912 F.Supp.2d 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1173 (D.N.M. 2012) (Browning, J.)(stating that two codefendants' interests would become adverse if one of them accepted \"a plea deal requiring their testimony\"). Herrera would prefer R.P. Martinez not to testify, and \"[s]hould Mr. Martinez testify, counsel intends to vigorously cross examine him concerning any adverse testimony related to Defendant Herrera.\" Attorney Conflict Motion at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   52. Rule 16-109(A), thus, prohibits Mr. Davis' representation of Herrera unless R.P. Martinez \"gives informed consent, confirmed in writing.\" N.M. R. Prof'l Conduct 16-109(A). R.P. Martinez will not give such consent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 8 Tr. at 24:2-3 (Milner); Notice \u00b6 3, at 1. Consequently, Mr. Davis cannot represent Herrera no matter whether Mr. Davis remembers any confidential information regarding his representation of R.P. Martinez. Risks regarding confidential information can show that two matters are substantially related, but a confidential information analysis is not necessary here, because the Court's analysis of VICAR issues shows that Herrera's VICAR prosecution \"involve[s] the same transaction or legal dispute\" as R.P. Martinez' state-court prosecution. N.M. R. Prof'l Conduct 16-109 cmt. 3. Moreover, even if a confidential information analysis were necessary, the Court would reach the same result. Two matters are substantially related if there \"is a substantial risk that confidential factual information\n   <strong>\n    as would normally have been obtained\n   </strong>\n   in the prior representation would materially advance the client's position in the subsequent matter.\" N.M. R. Prof'l Conduct 16-109 cmt. 3 (emphasis added). That inquiry focuses applies an objective standard for determining whether two matters are substantially related, so Mr. Davis' subjective ignorance is irrelevant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Stein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784105\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/143/462/\">\n    2008-NMSC-013\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784105\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/143/462/\">\n    143 N.M. 462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784105\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/143/462/\">\n    177 P.3d at 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (applying \"[a]n objective standard\" to determine whether an attorney violated rule 16-109(A) ). That rule is sensible, because former clients, like R.P. Martinez, may have better recollections than their former lawyers regarding the confidential information revealed as part of the former representation, and they may have legitimate concerns that a presently ignorant attorney's recollection will be refreshed at a later date. Further, former clients should not be forced to accept representations that their former attorneys are presently aware of no confidential information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   53. Mr. Davis' ignorance and Herrera's willingness to have Mr. Davis' co-counsel, Ms. Bhalla, cross-examine R.P. Martinez,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Supplement at 7,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   are relevant to whether Mr. Davis will use or reveal R.P. Martinez' confidential information,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   N.M. R. Prof'l Conduct 16-109(C), but they are not relevant to whether Mr. Davis can represent Herrera without violating rule 16-109(A), because lawyers have distinct \"continuing duties to former clients with respect to confidentiality\n   <strong>\n    and\n   </strong>\n   conflicts of interest,\" N.M. R. Prof'l Conduct 16-109 cmt. 1 (emphasis added). Herrera's desire to continue to have Mr. Davis represent him is, likewise, immaterial to whether Mr.\n   Davis can continue to represent him, because no defendant, indigent or otherwise, can, under current constitutional law, \"insist on the counsel of an attorney who has a previous or ongoing relationship with an opposing party, even when the opposing party is the Government.\"\n   <em>\n    Wheat v.
