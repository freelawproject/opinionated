(\"Defendant\" or \"Uber\") on September 20, 2017. Plaintiff Jose Mejia (\"Plaintiff\" or \"Mejia\") filed an Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Compel Arbitration and Incorporated Memorandum of Law, ECF No. [20] (\"Opposition\"), and Defendant replied, ECF No. [30]. The Court has carefully reviewed the Motion, all supporting and opposing materials, the record, and is otherwise fully advised. For the reasons that follow, Plaintiff's Complaint is dismissed without prejudice for lack of standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff filed his Complaint, ECF No. [1] (\"Complaint\") on August 11, 2017, alleging a single cause of action styled as \"Violation of Section 790.251, Florida Statutes\" and seeking declaratory relief and damages on behalf of himself and a putative class. According to the Complaint, since June 2015, Uber has maintained a policy that \"prohibit[s] drivers and riders from carrying guns.\" ECF No. [1] \u00b6 7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mejia, who is licensed in the State of Florida to carry a concealed weapon or firearm, alleges that he began work as an \"Uber driver, offering transportation services primarily\n   in the Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach Counties\" in March 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8. Plaintiff \"wishes to carry a firearm in his vehicle while he provides transportation services through Uber.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. Based on these allegations, Mejia claims that Uber has violated his rights and the rights of a putative class of Uber drivers who offer transportation services in Florida and possess a license to carry a concealed weapon or firearm.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In response to the Complaint, Defendant moves to compel arbitration. Specifically, Defendant argues that before Plaintiff began providing transportation services as an Uber driver, he entered into a Technology Services Agreement with Raiser-DC, LLC, Uber's wholly owned subsidiary (the \"Raiser Agreement\"). ECF No. [11] at 2. The Raiser Agreement contains an arbitration provision and a class action waiver.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [11-1]. Uber notes that the Raiser Agreement allows any Uber driver to opt out of the arbitration provision by sending notice to Uber via mail or email, and Plaintiff never opted out.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   at 8-9. Uber thus argues that these provisions are binding on Mejia, and any claims he may have must be arbitrated individually pursuant to the Raiser Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In Opposition, Plaintiff argues that because of Florida's \"rigorous statutory framework enshrining the constitutional right to bear arms,\" the arbitration clause is unconstitutional as applied. ECF No. [20] at 6-7. Plaintiff further argues that the arbitration provision is procedurally unconscionable because there is no meaningful way to opt out of the arbitration provision since the process must be completed by mail or email and cannot be completed through Uber's smartphone application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. Plaintiff also argues that the Raiser Agreement is procedurally unconscionable because \"it is unreasonable to expect individuals to be able to read legal documents on a smartphone.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. Finally, Plaintiff argues that the arbitration provision is substantively unconscionable because it attempts to strip Plaintiff of rights that \"may not be infringed upon,\" namely Plaintiff's alleged right under Florida law to keep a concealed weapon in his vehicle while driving for Uber.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Plaintiff further pleads that \"[t]hrough its no-firearm policy, Uber has violated the rights of Plaintiff, and other members of the Class, as those rights are described under subsections 790.251(4)(c)-(d), Florida Statutes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. However, these allegations, without more, do not sufficiently plead an injury in fact, that is, the invasion of a legally protected interest that is \"concrete and particularized\" and \"actual or imminent\" as required by the\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   test. First, Plaintiff only alleges that he \"wishes\" to carry his firearm while driving for Uber, but does not allege that he tried to do so or that Uber has attempted to enforce the Policy against him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DiMaio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701966\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/1299/#p1301\">\n    520 F.3d at 1302-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"DiMaio's right to vote, protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, cannot be impaired by the DNC's failure to consider a ballot that he did not cast in the first place.\"). Second, the Policy states that Defendant \"prohibits riders and drivers from carrying firearms of any kind in a vehicle while using [Uber's] app...to the extent permitted by applicable law.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [20] at 15-16. The crux of Plaintiff's claim is that the Policy conflicts with Florida Statute 790.251(4)(c)-(d), even though the plain language of the Policy carves out the conflict Plaintiff complains of and Uber has not otherwise attempted to enforce the Policy against Mejia. Instead Plaintiff requests\n   this Court to extrapolate how, if at all, Uber might enforce the Policy against Plaintiff and the putative class. Plaintiff speculates that Uber may prohibit him from keeping his firearm in his vehicle while using the Uber application, allegedly in contravention of Florida law, but this hypothesis does not \"support a finding of the 'actual or imminent' injury that our cases require\" and defies the plain language of the policy.\n   <em>\n    Elend\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5251639\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/471/1199/#p1205\">\n    471 F.3d at 1209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks and citations omitted). Accordingly, Plaintiff cannot satisfy the first prong of the\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   test. Rather, the relief that Plaintiff seeks, \"that the Court declare that Defendant's conduct violates the statute referenced herein,\" ECF No. [1] at 6, is an impermissible \"exercise in purely advisory decision-making.\"\n   <em>\n    DiMaio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3701966\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/1299/#p1301\">\n    520 F.3d at 1303\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because Plaintiff lacks standing, the Court refrains from further consideration of the Motion and this action must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
