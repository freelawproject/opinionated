Specifically, Defendants admit that they do not operate on \"HIV+ patients taking antiretroviral medications.\" Defs. Mem. at 19 (\"The defendants do not deny that Dr. Asare's determination that HIV+ patients taking antiretroviral medications are medically unsuitable for his procedures constitutes an eligibility criterion that tends to screen out a class of individuals with disabilities (persons with HIV) from his cosmetic surgery services.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As such, the sole remaining dispute for the purposes of the \"screen-out\" claim is whether applying the criteria is \"necessary,\" and, therefore, permissible under the ADA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As the Second Circuit has not given much content to the \"necessary\" defense in \u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(i) of the ADA, the defense is a matter of first impression.

A[:] No.\"), including for Milano,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 308:7 (\"I didn't research on Mr. Milano's drugs.\"). Asare acknowledged that some antiretroviral drugs are not contraindicated for the drugs in his sedative protocol,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 152:15-154:23, but did not investigate further because, as he testified, \"I just don't feel comfortable,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 308:16-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendants' blanket refusal without individualized inquiry is insufficient to pass muster under the ADA.

Plaintiffs urge that Defendants should have (1) adjusted the sedative protocol preceding surgery, (2) hired an anesthesiologist to monitor or assist in the surgery, or (3) referred patients to another physician in the same practice. Gov't Mem. at 19; Milano Mem. at 18-19. However, as Defendants note, they are not in violation of the ADA if they \"can demonstrate that making such modifications would\n   <em>\n    fundamentally alter\n   </em>\n   the nature of such goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012182\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A)(ii) (emphasis added).

Cross-Motion on Non HIV-Related Disabilities\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendants cross-move for summary judgment against the Government only, arguing, essentially, that the Government has not demonstrated that Defendants have a policy or practice against\n   <em>\n    non\n   </em>\n   HIV-positive individuals with disabilities. Specifically, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' only evidence of a policy or practice is Asare's letter of December 2014 and a print-out of anonymous online reviews of Asare. Defs. Cross. at 7. Without identifying a disabled individual who was denied services for a disability unrelated to HIV, Defendants contend, the Government's reliance on the letter and print-out is insufficient.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As an initial matter, the Government is likely correct that the Defendants' distinction between HIV-related and non HIV-related claims is ill-advised. Gov. Reply at 25-26. The Government's complaint states claims for violations of the ADA, of which, as discussed above, Defendants' treatment of individuals living with HIV is proof. Nevertheless, to the extent that the Government's claims for individuals living with HIV and individuals living with other disabilities can be construed as distinct, the Government has failed to meets its burden with respect to the latter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Unlike above, Defendants have not conceded that they apply eligibility criteria that tend to screen out individuals with other disabilities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs. Cross. The Government is forced to rely solely on the December 2014 letter, print-out, and testimony from Asare which, in fact, details that he did perform surgery on an individual with another disability. Gov't Reply at 21-22. As the Government has not identified an instance where Asare has actually applied any screen-out criteria or refused reasonable modifications, this context presents a closer question than the HIV context. Even taking all facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, as the Court must,\n   <em>\n    Connecticut Ironworkers,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263842\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/92/#p98\">\n    869 F.3d at 98-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the documentary and testimonial evidence the Government presents only proves that Asare took a potential patient's medical conditions into account before performing surgery. Without more, therefore, the Court concludes that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on the Government's claims unrelated to HIV. Whether the Court's conclusion has any material effect on this litigation is left to the remedies stage of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   B. New York City Human Rights Law \u00a7 8-107\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Beyond the ADA claims, Plaintiff Milano argues that Defendants have violated the New York City Human Rights Law (the \"HRL\") in two ways. First, Milano argues that Defendants violated the provision making it unlawful for any person or provider of a public accommodation to \"refuse, withhold from or deny to such person the full and equal enjoyment, on equal terms and conditions, of any of the accommodations, advantages, services, facilities or privileges of the place or provider of public accommodation\" on the basis of disability. N.Y.C. Admin. Code \u00a7 8-107(4). Second, Milano argues that Defendants violated the provisions requiring Defendants \"to\n   make reasonable accommodation to the needs of persons with disabilities.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263842\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/92/#p98\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 8-107(15). As Defendants point out, Milano \"relies on the same arguments and evidence he asserts in connection with his ADA claim.\" Defs. Mem. at 33. But Defendants maintain that \"[e]ach of these points turns on disputed issues of material fact.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263842\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/92/#p98\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendants' argument must fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As Milano highlights, the relationship between federal law and the HRL \"is now a one-way ratchet.\"\n   <em>\n    Loeffler v.

Defendants have also violated the HRL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   For the reasons stated above, Plaintiffs' joint motion for summary judgment is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.
