In exchange for defendant\u2019s guilty plea, the state nolled count one and the violence specification of count two. On March 1, 1989, the trial court sentenced defendant to six months\u2019 definite sentence on count two and three years\u2019 actual incarceration for the gun specification. Defendant filed a timely notice of appeal assigning the following error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b504-7\">\u201cArnold Ellington was deprived of his liberty without due process of law when the trial court imposed a sentence of three years\u2019 actual incarceration for a gun specification when the underlying felony sentence was for a definite term in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 9, to the Ohio Constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">Defendant\u2019s sole assignment of error has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">Defendant argues the trial court erred when it sentenced defendant to three years\u2019 actual incarceration on a gun specification when defendant pled guilty to a fourth degree felony and defendant received a definite sentence. Defendant\u2019s argument is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">R.C. 2923.13, having a weapon under a disability, is a fourth degree felony. R.C. 2929.11(D) and 2929.11(D)(2) establish the sentence of a felony of the fourth degree to be a definite sentence of six months, one year or eighteen months, provided the offender has not been previously convicted of an offense of violence. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the original indictment contains a specification of violence; however, the state nolled the specification of violence during the course of the plea bargaining and the defendant plead guilty to only having a weapon under disability with a gun specification.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">R.C. 2929.71(A) provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b504-12\">\u201cThe court shall impose a term of actual incarceration of three years in addition to imposing a <em>life sentence </em>pursuant to section 2907.02, 2907.12, or 2929.02 of the Revised Code <em>or an indefinite term of imprisonment </em>pursuant to section 2929.11 of the Revised Code, if <em>both </em>of the following apply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>\u201c(1) The offender is convicted of, or pleads guilty to, <em>any felony </em>other than a violation of section 2923.12 of the Revised Code;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\">\u201c(2) The offender is <em>also </em>convicted of, or pleads guilty to, <em>a specification </em>charging him with having a firearm on or about his person or under his control while committing the felony. The three-year term of actual incarceration imposed pursuant to this section shall be served consecutively with, and prior to, the life sentence or the <em>indefinite term </em>of imprisonment.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">It is well established that a defendant may not be sentenced to a three-year term of incarceration under R.C. 2929.71(A) if the defendant is sentenced to a definite term of imprisonment for the underlying felony. <em>State v. Hall </em>(1984), 21 Ohio App.3d 52, 21 OBR 55, 486 N.E.2d 189; <em>State v. Maynard </em>(Oct. 17, 1985), Cuyahoga App. No. 49486, unreported, 1985 WL 8137; <em>State v. Catchings </em>(Dec. 24, 1987), Cuyahoga App. No. 53089, unreported, 1987 WL 30373. Defendant, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>was not eligible for a three-year mandatory sentence on the gun specification since he was sentenced to a definite term of six months pursuant to R.C. 2929.11(D)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Thus, defendant could have been sentenced to only a mandatory three-year term for the gun specification if he were given a life sentence or indefinite sentence. The penalty for a violation of R.C. 2923.13, having a weapon while under a disability, does not provide for a life sentence. Consequently, defendant could receive a sentence for the gun specification only if he were given an indefinite sentence under R.C. 2929.11(B)(7)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for the underlying felony. <em>Hall, supra; Maynard, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">However, R.C. 2929.11(G) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-9\">\u201cNo person shall be sentenced pursuant to division (B)(6) or (7) of this section to an indefinite term of imprisonment for a felony of the third or fourth degree unless the indictment, count in the indictment, or information charging him with the offense contains <em>a specification </em>as set forth in section 2941.143 of the Revised Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">R.C. 2941.143 sets forth the criteria necessary for a violence specification. R.C. 2929.11(G) provides that a fourth degree felony requires an indefinite sentence when the indictment contains a specification of violence and such specification is graphically depicted in R.C. 2941.143. R.C. 2929.71(A) requires a mandatory three years of actual incarceration for offenses involving firearms and also requires a specification which is set forth in R.C. 2941.141. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Both the above sections of the Revised Code require specifications; both R.C. 2941.141 and 2941.143 explain in great detail <em>where </em>the specification shall appear in the indictment, what it shall contain and how it shall be structured.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">A violence specification is a mandatory prerequisite to the imposition of an indefinite sentence for a fourth degree felony under R.C. 2929.11(B)(7). In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the state nolled the violence specification in count two during the course of defendant\u2019s entering a guilty plea on that count. Thus, defendant was ineligible for an indefinite sentence. <em>Maynard, supra, </em>at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The state argues the violence specification is unnecessary since that portion of the indictment which charges the defendant with having a weapon under a disability recites defendant was previously convicted of a felony of violence, to wit: felonious assault. The same argument could be used for the gun specification; however, the state did not nolle the gun specification. The recitation of the possession of a firearm and a previous offense of violence are the elements which sustain the main indictment for having a weapon under a disability and cannot be used to enhance the sentence. The state\u2019s contention is unpersuasive since R.C. 2941.141(A) and 2941.143 specifically mandate the use and requirements of the specifications including their placement in the indictment, form and content. It is only by the use of the specifications that the sentence is enhanced. The specifications also give defendant notice that his potential sentence is subject to enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">In sum, defendant could not be sentenced for the gun specification since he was given a definite sentence. <em>Hall, supra. </em>However, defendant could not receive an indefinite sentence since the indictment to which he pled guilty did not contain a violence specification. <em>Maynard, supra. </em>Therefore, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>court erred when it sentenced defendant to a mandatory three years\u2019 actual incarceration on the gun specification. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s sole assignment of error is well taken and sustained. Defendant\u2019s three-year sentence on the gun specification is vacated as void. \u201cAny attempt by a court to disregard statutory requirements when imposing a sentence renders the attempted sentence a nullity or void.\u201d <em>State v. Beasley </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 74, 75, 14 OBR 511, 512, 471 N.E.2d 774, 775.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Judgment modified and affirmed as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b507-7\">Krupansky, P.J., Francis E.
