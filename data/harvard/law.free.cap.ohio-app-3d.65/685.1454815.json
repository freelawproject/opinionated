We find none of the assignments of error is well taken and affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Maurice Dunklin, an erstwhile associate of Bobo, testified for the state. He related that on October 6, 1987, Dunklin, Bobo and William Harris drove to pick up some \u201cshort money\u201d \u2014 money due them from the sale of cocaine. Bobo carried an aluminum baseball bat and Harris a .44 magnum revolver, but Dunklin went in empty-handed.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">King invited the trio into the apartment. A \u201cfat chick,\u201d later identified as Billie Jean Finklin, and Dennis Yarborough were at the kitchen table \u201cgetting high.\u201d Yarborough fled after Bobo struck him on the head with the bat.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">Next, while Harris held the gun on King, Bobo rapped him on the legs. When Dunklin finally snatched the bat from Bobo, King escaped to the bedroom. Harris, however, kicked in the bedroom door and fired the gun. Dunklin, now in the kitchen, heard glass breaking, followed by a second shot. It was Bobo who carried the gun as the three ran from the apartment. Harris, Bobo and Dunklin drove to a house at East 55th Street and Hawthorne. While Dunklin remained in the car, Bobo went into the house. At that moment, Cleveland police, who were executing a search warrant at the house, seized Bobo.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">Melvin King, the victim\u2019s brother, told the court he saw Bobo at the apartment three to four days before the murder with money in his hands and a \u201crock\u201d of cocaine \u201cbehind him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b718-9\">Donald Styles, a maintenance man at the Longwood Apartments, found the victim outside the East 35th Street apartment. Styles swore King told him \u201cthe guys with Karlos\u201d shot him.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-10\">Billie Jean Finklin\u2019s testimony corroborated Dunklin\u2019s, except that she noticed each of the three visitors had a weapon. Finklin stated the trio demanded money and then started to hit King with \u201csticks.\u201d Billie Jean fled when she heard gunshots.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-11\">In defense, Bobo testified that, on the day in question, he asked Harris and Dunklin to drive him to East 79th Street and Kinsman to meet his father. They agreed to take him but told Bobo they first had to stop at an apartment on East 35th Street. Harris and Dunklin went into the apartment while Bobo sat outside on the hood of the car. Bobo heard a gunshot, followed by glass breaking, and then a second gunshot. He saw a man on the ground about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>twenty-five yards away. Bobo started to run. According to Bobo, he and Mike Townsend later went to the Hawthorne Street house where police arrested them during a drug raid.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">In assignments of error one, two and four, Bobo challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress statements he made to the police. He argues that his statements were both involuntary and the product of an illegal detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Bobo maintains that the statements he made to police were inadmissible because they were the fruit of an illegal seizure. This contention is incorrect. Although Bobo\u2019s initial detention was a seizure, we find it was lawful. Police arrived at 5801 Hawthorne to execute a search warrant while Bobo was in the house. A search warrant carries with it the limited authority to detain occupants of the premises while a proper search is executed, establishing probable cause to arrest. <em>Michigan v. Summers </em>(1981), 452 U.S. 692, 101 S.Ct. 2587, 69 L.Ed.2d 340. See, also, <em>State v. Schultz </em>(1985), 23 Ohio App.3d 130, 23 OBR 242, 491 N.E.2d 735. In <em>Summers, supra, </em>police stopped the defendant on the front porch. As we have noted, police seized Bobo inside the house. After executing the search warrant, police arrested Bobo, Mike Townsend and several others on drug charges. Thus, unlike the defendant in <em>Dunaway v. New York </em>(1979), 442 U.S. 200, 99 S.Ct. 2248, 60 L.Ed.2d 824, upon which Bobo relies, Bobo was legally detained.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">Bobo, a seventeen-and-one-half-year-old juvenile when arrested, urges that his statements to the police, which implicated him in King\u2019s death, were involuntary. He maintains that his remarks were coerced because police held him for twelve hours, with one hand cuffed to a chair, in the narcotics unit, without food, sleep, or the presence of his parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-8\">The state bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of evidence both the voluntariness of a defendant\u2019s custodial statements and waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>Colorado v. Connelly </em>(1986), 479 U.S. 157, 107 S.Ct. 515, 93 L.Ed.2d 473; <em>State v. Hill </em>(1987), 37 Ohio App.3d 10, 523 N.E.2d 885. See, also, <em>Nix v. Williams </em>(1984), 467 U.S. 431, 444, 104 S.Ct. 2501, 2509, 81 L.Ed.2d 377, 388, fn. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">We must examine the totality of the circumstances in order to determine whether there has been a waiver of the right to remain silent and to have the assistance of counsel, even where interrogation of a juvenile is involved. <em>Fare v. Michael C. </em>(1979), 442 U.S. 707, 99 S.Ct. 2560, 61 L.Ed.2d 197; <em>State v. Davis </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 51, 10 O.O.3d 87, 381 N.E.2d 641; <em>State v. Carder </em>(1966), 9 Ohio St.2d 1, 38 O.O.2d 1, 222 N.E.2d 620; <em>State v. Newell </em>(Aug. 8, 1980), Cuyahoga App. No. 41391, unreported.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>Bobo first argues that the presence of a parent is not only a circumstance we must consider, but an additional right accorded to juveniles. Though the greatest care must be taken to assure a juvenile\u2019s admissions are voluntary, parental presence is not constitutionally mandated. See <em>In re Gault </em>(1967), 387 U.S. 1, 55, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 1458, 18 L.Ed.2d 527, 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">We note that, in some jurisdictions, parental consultation is a prerequisite to the admission of a juvenile\u2019s statement. See, <em>e.g., People v. Saiz </em>(Colo.1980), 620 P.2d 15; <em>Lewis v. State </em>(1972), 259 Ind. 431, 288 N.E.2d 138. These states appear to rely on parental consent statutes which are not a part of Ohio juvenile law. In other jurisdictions, parental consent is one of the considerations in determining whether a confession is voluntary under the totality of the circumstances. See, <em>e.g., United States, ex rel., Riley, v. Franzen </em>(C.A.7, 1981), 653 F.2d 1153; <em>State v. Young </em>(1976), 220 Kan. 541, 552 P.2d 905; <em>Theriault v. State </em>(1974), 66 Wis.2d 33, 223 N.W.2d 850.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">Ohio decisions, considering the totality of the circumstances in juvenile cases, have not turned solely on the presence or absence of a parent. See, <em>e.g., Carder, supra; Davis, supra; Newell, supra. </em>In view of the fact that Ohio juvenile law does not specifically require the presence of a parent during a juvenile\u2019s interrogation, we hold that such presence is only one factor in the totality of the circumstances surrounding the statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">At the suppression hearing, John McKibben, a Cleveland detective, described the events which led to Bobo\u2019s statement to him. McKibben met with Bobo at 9:06 a.m. on October 7, 1987, to take him for trace metal detection and gunshot residue tests. He advised Bobo of his rights before they left. During the tests, Bobo made some statements to McKibben, and after they returned from the scientific investigation unit (\u201cSIU\u201d), McKibben readvised Bobo of his rights. Bobo made an oral waiver but asked to speak with his mother. McKibben admitted that he knew Bobo was a juvenile and that he did nothing to contact Bobo\u2019s mother. The detective averred that Bobo was alert and oriented when he made his statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">Bobo also testified at the suppression hearing, swearing that he was handcuffed to a chair in a room occupied by five to seven other police officers. He alleged that McKibben lied when he stated that Bobo initiated their conversation and that Bobo told McKibben he wanted to talk to his mother before he made a statement. Bobo claimed he was afraid.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">On cross-examination, Bobo admitted he had been arrested on two previous occasions and that both times police read him his rights. He acknowledged he did not request an attorney, only his mother. Bobo did not deny that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>McKibben advised him of his rights nor did he claim he was denied counsel. Bobo\u2019s sole complaint was that he could not talk with his mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">In view of all the circumstances before the trial court, we cannot say it erroneously denied the suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Bobo next claims the judge erred by denying his renewed motion to suppress at the close of the evidence. The state argues that Bobo could not renew the motion at the close of the evidence because Crim.R. 12(B)(3) mandates that suppression motions be made before trial. Bobo correctly argues that the trial court may extend the time for making a motion to suppress in the interests of justice. See Crim.R. 12(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Evidence adduced at trial revealed that police advised Bobo of his rights to counsel and silence immediately upon his detention. When arrested, Bobo told the police his name was Michael Townsend. After police learned Bobo\u2019s true identity and age, they removed him from the adult detention area and took him to the narcotics unit where they handcuffed one of his wrists to a chair.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">Shortly before midnight, Bobo spoke with John Bonner, an FBI agent working with the Cleveland narcotics unit. After another officer re-advised Bobo of his rights, Bobo volunteered to show the officers a guarded car on East 79th and Kinsman where the police might find drugs. Bonner, Bobo and Cleveland police officer Parkinson drove to the area. Later, they cruised past the murder site. The officers asked Bobo if he knew whether the East 35th Street apartment was a drug distribution point. Bobo acknowledged that it was. He also volunteered that he was at the East 35th Street apartment when, earlier that night, Richard King was beaten and thrown from a window. Police then returned Bobo to the narcotics unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">Parker Adrine, a Cleveland homicide detective, spoke with Bobo while he was held in the narcotics unit. His partner advised Bobo of his rights before they questioned him. Adrine swore Bobo was alert and did not request food, sleep or counsel. Adrine told the court that he finished talking with Bobo at about 6:00 a.m. No other officer spoke with Bobo until 9:00 a.m., when McKibben took Bobo to SIU for tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">Bobo does not deny that police repeatedly told him he had a right to counsel and to remain silent. He now claims he did not understand the police. At the time of the crime, Bobo was a seventeen-and-one-half-year-old attending high school and had two previous encounters with police.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-11\">We find that, in view of all the circumstances, the trial court properly denied Bobo\u2019s renewed motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-12\">The first, second and fourth assignments of error are not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>In his third assignment, the defendant posits that, because police did not take him to a juvenile detention center as required by R.C. 2151.311, the violation of the statute renders his confession inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">R.C. 2151.311 requires a person taking a juvenile into custody to bring the child to court, to a place of detention, or to release the child to his parents, with all reasonable speed. See, also, Juv.R. 7(B). A detention home admissions officer is required to contact the juvenile\u2019s family. Juv.R. 7(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Under the circumstances of this case, we cannot find that the delay between taking the defendant into custody and his subsequent release to the care of the juvenile detention facility was unreasonable. In addition, the fact that police did not immediately take Bobo to a juvenile facility does not render his statements inadmissible. <em>State v. Stewart </em>(1963), 120 Ohio App. 199, 29 O.O.2d 4, 201 N.E.2d 793, affirmed (1964), 176 Ohio St. 156, 27 O.O.2d 42, 198 N.E.2d 439; <em>State v. Dickens </em>(Sept. 23, 1987), Summit App. No. 12967, unreported, 1987 WL 17928; <em>In re Hawkins </em>(May 11, 1983), Lorain App. No. 3430, unreported, 1983 WL 4091.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">The third assignment of error fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">In the fifth and seventh assignments of error, Bobo claims the court improperly allowed the introduction of his \u201cother acts and wrongs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">Bobo posits that Dunklin\u2019s testimony regarding Bobo\u2019s alleged participation in the sale of drugs was an inadmissible \u201cother act\u201d and was more prejudicial than probative.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-10\">Evidence of a person\u2019s other criminal acts, crimes or wrongs is inadmissible to prove a person\u2019s propensity to commit crime. Evid.R. 404(B); <em>State v. Broom </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 277, 533 N.E.2d 682, certiorari denied (1989), 490 U.S. 1075, 109 S.Ct. 2089, 104 L.Ed.2d 653. Nevertheless, such evidence is admissible for other purposes in accordance in with R.C. 2945.59, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-11\">\u201cIn any criminal case in which the defendant\u2019s motive or intent, the absence of mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant\u2019s scheme, plan, or system in doing an act is material, any acts of the defendant which tend to show his motive or intent, the absence of mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant\u2019s scheme, plan, or system in doing the act in question may be proved, whether they are contemporaneous with or prior or subsequent thereto, notwithstanding that such proof may show or tend to show the commission of another crime by the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-12\">The \u201cother acts\u201d evidence must be relevant to some issue involving proof of guilt. <em>State v. Hill </em>(1987), 37 Ohio App.3d 72, 523 N.E.2d 894. See, also, <em>Broom, supra. </em>We find that, evidence of a defendant\u2019s activities in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>drug transactions is admissible in a murder trial to demonstrate that the defendant killed the victim to avenge theft of drug money. <em>Hill, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The state theorized that Bobo, Harris and Dunklin went to King\u2019s apartment to avenge the skimming of proceeds from the sale of drugs. To demonstrate Bobo\u2019s motive, the prosecutor elicited evidence of the defendant\u2019s recent participation in drug transactions. Dunklin swore that Bobo was a money courier and that Dunklin was his driver. In addition, Melvin King claimed he saw Bobo at the East 35th Street apartment with a large amount of money and some \u201crocks of cocaine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-6\">This testimony \u201ccreated a framework for considering whether * * * [Bobo] * * * was motivated by revenge.\u201d <em>Hill, supra, </em>at 75, 523 N.E.2d at 897. Thus, the testimony was admissible in support of the state\u2019s theory that Bobo was motivated to kill King in order to avenge the theft of the \u201cskimmed\u201d money. Moreover, we cannot say that the evidence was more prejudicial than probative. We hold that the probative value of the evidence of Bobo\u2019s past drug dealing substantially outweighed any possible prejudice. Cf. <em>Hill, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">Bobo also argues that the court abused its discretion by admitting the \u201cother acts\u201d testimony. Abuse of discretion implies an unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable attitude by the court. <em>State v. Adams </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 151, 16 O.O.3d 169, 404 N.E.2d 144. Our review of the record reveals that the details supplied by the state\u2019s witnesses concerning the existence of a Detroit-based drug conspiracy formed part of the immediate background of crime and concerned events \u201c \u2018inextricably related to the alleged criminal act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Broom, supra, </em>40 Ohio St.3d at 282, 533 N.E.2d at 690. We find no abuse of discretion by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">Accordingly, the fifth and seventh assignments of error are not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">In the sixth assignment of error, the defendant claims the court improperly admitted rebuttal testimony. Bobo contends that the state\u2019s rebuttal evidence was offered to demonstrate his criminal tendencies and not to impeach his credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">On rebuttal, the state offered the testimony of Officer Adrine and Agent Bonner. Both men related the statements Bobo made during the early morning hours of October 7, 1987, after Bobo heard his rights. Bobo claims that these statements were offered solely to prove he was a drug dealer.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-11\">Evid.R. 613(B) requires that, before extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by a witness is admissible, the witness must be afforded an opportunity to explain or deny the prior inconsistent statement. A proper foundation is laid when a witness denies making the statement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number><em>State v. Riggins </em>(1986), 35 Ohio App.3d 1, 519 N.E.2d 397; <em>State v. Talbert </em>(1986), 33 Ohio App.3d 282, 515 N.E.2d 968. \u201cWhether to admit a prior inconsistent statement which is collateral to the issue being tried and pertinent to the credibility of a witness is a matter within the trial court\u2019s sound discretion.\u201d <em>Riggins, supra, </em>35 Ohio App.3d at 3, 519 N.E.2d at 401-402.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">At trial, Bobo denied: (1) involvement with drug sales, (2) telling police about a guarded car at East 79th and Kinsman, and (3) telling police his father was in the drug business. The state\u2019s rebuttal witnesses testified that Bobo told them otherwise. Thus, the evidence offered by the state went to Bobo\u2019s credibility. We find no abuse of discretion by the court in admitting the rebuttal evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">The court denied Bobo\u2019s request for a limiting instruction that the rebuttal testimony was to be considered for impeachment purposes only. We first note that Bobo\u2019s alleged statements to police and his denials that he made them were already in evidence. As we have determined, these statements were properly admitted and thus no instruction was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">As to evidence of Bobo\u2019s drug involvement and Detroit connections, we reiterate our holding that this evidence was not only a demonstration of his motives but was also inextricably related to the crime. Further, the court instructed the jury that it was to consider evidence as to \u201cother crimes or wrongs\u201d only as it related to motive. Thus, any possible error in the court\u2019s refusal to limit this testimony to impeachment purposes only was harmless beyond a doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">Accordingly, the sixth assignment of error fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b724-11\">Patton and Francis E.
