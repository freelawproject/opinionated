Laird, sets forth four assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-4\">\u201cI. The Court erred when it allowed the prosecutor to introduce co-defendant confession through the testimony of Randy Walker.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-5\">\u201cII. The jury\u2019s finding of guilty on Count One of the Indictment was unsupported by the record and against the manifest weight of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-6\">\u201cIII. The Court erred when it allowed William Wilson to testify concerning the percentage of the population for certain blood type and when it allowed Exhibit 29 to be introduced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-7\">\u201cIV. The Trial Court committed error prejudicial to the appellant by continuing the trial with an alternate juror over the objection of the appellant where the original juror\u2019s absence was not due to any incapacity or other inability on the part of the juror.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">The undisputed facts giving rise to this appeal are as follows. * * * </p>\n<p id=\"b144-9\">In her first assignment of error appellant Laird asserts that the trial court erred in allowing the introduction of codefendant Robles\u2019 confession through the testimony of prosecution witness Randy Walker. Appellant argues essentially that certain statements admitted through Walker\u2019s testimony, when considered with the other evidence introduced at trial, constituted direct references to her having committed the murder of Stout and, therefore, their admission was in violation of <em>Bruton v. United States </em>(1968), 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">In <em>Bruton, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the admission at a joint trial of a codefendant\u2019s confession that implicates the other defendant, when the codefendant fails to take the stand, violates the other defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment Right to confrontation. <em>Id. </em>at 126, 88 S.Ct. at 1622-1623, 20 L.Ed.2d at 479. The <em>Bruton </em>court found that such admission constituted prejudicial error despite the fact that the trial court gave limiting instructions to the jury that the codefendant\u2019s confession could only be used against that codefendant and must be disregarded as to the other defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 126-128, 88 S.Ct. at 1622-1624, 20 L.Ed.2d at 479-481. The <em>Bruton </em>court reasoned that in situations such as this, which involve powerfully incriminating extrajudicial statements of codefendants of highly questionable credibility and reliability, the risks that the jury would not or could not follow even the clearest of jury instructions is so substantial that it could not accept limiting instructions as an adequate substitute for the other defendant\u2019s right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>confrontation and cross-examination. <em>Id. </em>at 136-137, 88 S.Ct. at 1628-1629, 20 L.Ed.2d at 485-486.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">In <em>State v. Moritz </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St.2d 150, 17 O.O.3d 92, 407 N.E.2d 1268, the Supreme Court of Ohio found the admission of certain extrajudicial statements made by a nontestifying codefendant to be a violation of <em>Bruton, </em>even though the statements alone were not altogether clear, but, when taken in context with other testimony and the totality of the evidence, were determined to be sufficient to inculpate the other defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 153, 17 O.O.3d at 94, 407 N.E.2d at 1271. The <em>Moritz </em>court determined that the rule espoused in <em>Bruton, supra, </em>should be applied equally to all statements that tend to significantly incriminate a codefendant, whether or not that defendant is actually named in the statement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">In <em>Richardson v. Marsh </em>(1987), 481 U.S. 200, 211, 107 S.Ct. 1703, 1709, 95 L.Ed.2d 176, 188, however, the United States Supreme .Court expressly declined to extend the protection of <em>Bruton </em>as far as the Supreme Court of Ohio did in <em>Moritz, supra, </em>holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-6\">\u201c * * * [T]he Confrontation Clause is not violated by the admission of a nontestifying codefendant\u2019s confession with a proper limiting instruction when, as here, the confession is redacted to eliminate not only the defendant\u2019s name, but any reference to his or her existence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">In so holding, the <em>Richardson </em>court noted an important distinction between the circumstances existing therein and those of <em>Bruton, </em>which placed the <em>Richardson </em>case outside the narrow exception created in <em>Bruton </em>to the general assumption that a jury follows its instructions:</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">\u201cIn <em>Bruton, </em>the codefendant\u2019s confession \u2018expressly implicat[ed]\u2019 the defendant as his accomplice. * * * Thus, at the time that confession was introduced there was not the slightest doubt that it would prove \u2018powerfully incriminating.\u2019 * * * By contrast, in this case the confession was not incriminating on its face, and became so only when linked with evidence introduced later at trial (the defendant\u2019s own testimony).\u201d (Citations and footnotes omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 208, 107 S.Ct. at 1707, 95 L.Ed.2d at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">The <em>Richardson </em>court reasoned that in these circumstances, where the contested confession is not incriminating on its face, but is only so when linked with other testimony at trial, there does not exist the overwhelming probability that the jurors will be unable to follow the court\u2019s limiting instructions to disregard the incriminating statements as to the other defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>dant. <em>Id. </em>at 211, 107 S.Ct. at 1708, 95 L.Ed.2d at 188. The statements in this case which appellant objected to at trial on the basis of <em>Bruton </em>are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-5\">\u201cQ. Let me rephrase that. Did Robles tell you about Stout\u2019s death?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-7\">\u201cQ. Did Robles tell you whether he was personally present when Stout was murdered?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-8\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-9\">\u201cQ. What did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-10\"><em>\u201cA. </em>That he was present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-11\"><em>it </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-12\">\u201cQ. Did he tell you anything about the abilities of his family?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-13\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-14\">\u201cQ. What would that be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-15\">\u201cA. That they had a lot of money, and that if need be he could \u2014 they could pay their next door \u2014 his next door neighbor to tell the authorities that he was carried into his house the night that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-16\">\u201cQ. That who was? You\u2019re using a pronoun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-17\">\u201cA. Bob was carried into his house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-18\">\u201cQ. Was carried in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-19\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-20\">\u201cQ. In what condition?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-21\">\u201cA. Passed out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-22\">\u201cQ. Did he tell you anything else about the ability of his family?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-23\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes. That if anybody testified that they could have them taken care of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-24\">\u201cQ. If anybody testified against him they\u2019d be taken care of?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-25\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-26\">None of Robles\u2019 statements testified to by the witness contained any direct reference to appellant Laird or her existence. Rather, as appellant herself argues, it is only when these statements are considered in context with all the other evidence at trial that they become potentially incriminating. The trial court gave clear instructions to the jury that any statement made by one defendant outside the presence of the other defendant would be admissible only as to the defendant making the statement, and could not be considered for any purpose as evidence against the other defendant. Given the context of the contested statement and the limiting instructions to the jury, this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>finds that <em>Bruton, supra, </em>is not applicable herein and that appellant Laird\u2019s Sixth Amendment right of confrontation has not been violated by the admission of the above testimony. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is found not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">* * * </p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Considering, finally, appellant\u2019s second assignment of error, wherein she challenges the jury\u2019s verdict as being against the manifest weight of the evidence, the court finds that due to its disposition of appellant\u2019s third assignment of error, this assignment of error is rendered moot and is therefore found not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">On consideration whereof, the court finds that the defendant was prejudiced and prevented from having a fair trial, and the judgment of the Sandusky County Court of Common Pleas is therefore reversed. This cause is remand- , ed to that court for a new trial. It is ordered that appellee pay the court costs of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b147-9\">Handwork, P.J., and Glasser, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b145-10\">. The <em>Moritz </em>court went on to find in that case, however, that the error in admitting the contested statement was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt due to sufficient independent evidence, properly admitted, of that defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
