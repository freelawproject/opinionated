The state\u2019s sole assignment of error follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">\u201cThe trial court erred in failing to imprison the defendant, as required by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">The state\u2019s assignment of error has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">R.C. 2903.11(B), felonious assault, provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-10\">\u201cWhoever violates this section is guilty of felonious assault, an aggravated felony of the second degree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">For an aggravated felony of the second degree, with no prior convictions, the minimum term which may be imposed as a term of actual incarceration is three through fifteen years. R.C. 2929.11(B)(2)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-12\">Moreover, R.C. 2951.02(F)(3) provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-13\">\u201c(F) An offender shall not be placed on probation or otherwise have his sentence of imprisonment suspended pursuant to division (D)(2) or (4) of section 2929.51 of the Revised Code when any of the following applies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-14\"><em>U </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-15\">\u201c(3) The offense involved was not a violation of section 2923.12 of the Revised Code and was committed while the offender was armed with a firearm or dangerous ordnance, as defined in section 2923.11 of the Revised Code.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-16\">In <em>State v. Beasley </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 74, 14 OBR 511, 471 N.E.2d 774 <em>(per curiam), </em>the court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-17\">\u201c \u2018Crimes are statutory, as are the penalties therefor, and the only sentence which a trial judge may impose is that provided for by statute * * *. A court has no power to substitute a different sentence for that provided for by law.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-18\">\u201cAny attempt by a court to disregard statutory requirements when imposing a sentence renders the attempted sentence a nullity or void.\u201d <em>Beasley, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number><em>supra, </em>at 75, 14 OBR at 512, 471 N.E.2d at 775, quoting <em>Colegrove v.

This offense was an aggravated felony of the second degree. R.C. 2903.11(B). Pursuant to R.C. 2929.11(B)(2)(a), the minimum and maximum terms of actual incarceration defendant could have been sentenced to were three to fifteen years. Furthermore, since defendant committed the felonious assault with a \u201cfirearm\u201d as defined by R.C. 2923.11, defendant was not eligible for probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The trial court erred when it suspended defendant\u2019s sentence, placed defendant on probation and sentenced him to a three-month term in the county jail. The trial court\u2019s disregard for the statutory requirements when imposing defendant\u2019s sentence for felonious assault renders defendant\u2019s sentence a nullity. <em>Beasley, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Accordingly, the state\u2019s sole assignment of error is well taken and sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">The sentence is vacated and the cause is remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b314-10\">Francis E.
