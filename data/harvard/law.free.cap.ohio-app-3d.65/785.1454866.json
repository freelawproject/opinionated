This application was denied by Moscow\u2019s zoning inspector, David W. Sturgeon, on May 23, 1988. Skeene appealed this denial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>to the board of zoning appeals, which resulted in a hearing set for June 8, 1988. However, on May 27, 1988, Moscow filed a complaint in the Clermont County Court of Common Pleas requesting that Skeene be permanently enjoined from placing his single-wide mobile home unit upon a certain lot situated within Moscow.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">At the June 8 hearing, Skeene presented evidence by way of a \u201cdata plate\u201d certifying that the unit in question was manufactured in accordance with all applicable federal standards in existence at the time of construction, and that the unit was to be placed upon a permanent foundation absent wheels, axles, and hitch. The board denied Skeene\u2019s application for a zoning permit even though he had been granted a flood hazard area development permit for the property and unit in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">An appeal was filed by Skeene on June 14, 1988 in the Clermont County Court of Common Pleas from the decision of the board of zoning appeals. By an agreed entry filed with the court on November 4, 1988, Moscow\u2019s case for injunctive relief and Skeene\u2019s appeal from the board of zoning appeals were consolidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Moscow maintains that its zoning code specifically excludes mobile homes and manufactured homes from its definition of a dwelling unit for which a zoning permit can be obtained and that, once a mobile home has been brought into the village on wheels, it can never lose its status as a mobile home. Skeene, on the other hand, argues that it does not matter how the unit is transported to the situs and, that once at the situs, it can lose its status as a mobile home.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">The court below, in holding that a zoning permit must be issued to Skeene, found that a mobile home can lose its status as a mobile home when wheels, axles, and tongue are detached. Further, the court also found that Skeene\u2019s mobile home met applicable federal standards, codified in the National Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974, Section 5401 <em>et seq., </em>Title 42, U.S.Code (\u201cMobile Home Act\u201d), preempting any state or local building code.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">Moscow brings this instant appeal, setting forth the following assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">First Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">\u201cThe trial court erred in concluding that the National Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 pre-empts the Village of Moscow\u2019s zoning ordinance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b818-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>Second Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">\u201cThe trial court erred in concluding that a manufactured home can lose its status as a mobile home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Third Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">\u201cThe trial court erred in concluding that the Village of Moscow may not enact a zoning ordinance regarding the zoning of mobile homes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">In its appeal, Moscow has mischaracterized the decision of the trial court, which concluded that a zoning permit must be issued to Skeene since a mobile home can lose its status as a \u201cmobile home.\u201d The lower court never held that the Mobile Home Act preempted Moscow\u2019s zoning ordinance or that Moscow could not legally enact a zoning ordinance in connection with the land use of mobile homes. Accordingly, we will hereinafter discuss Moscow\u2019s appeal in terms of its second assignment of error concerning the classification and status of a \u201cmobile home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">Moscow\u2019s zoning ordinances allow \u201csingle-family dwellings\u201d in residential \u201cA\u201d districts. See Village of Moscow Zoning Code Section 820, 1-1. \u201cDwelling\u201d for purposes of residential land use is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-9\">\u201cAny building or structure (except a house trailer or mobile home as defined by Ohio Revised Code Section 4501.01) which is wholly or partially used or intended to be for living or sleeping by one or more human occupants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-10\">R.C. 4501.01(L), which was in effect at the time of the zoning code\u2019s adoption in 1977, defined \u201chouse trailer\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-11\">\u201cAny non-self propelled vehicle so designed, constructed, reconstructed, or added to by means of accessories in such manner as will permit the use and occupancy thereof for human habitation, when connected to indicated utilities, whether resting on wheels, jacks, or other temporary foundation <em>and used or so constructed as to permit its being conveyed upon the public streets or highways.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b818-12\">Likewise, the zoning code itself defines a \u201cmobile home\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b818-13\">\u201cAny non-self-propelled vehicle so designed, constructed, reconstructed, or added to by means of accessories in such manner as will permit the use and occupancy thereof for human habitation, when connected to utilities, whether resting on wheels, jacks, blocks, or other temporary foundation <em>and used or so constructed as to permit its being used as a conveyance upon the public streets or highways and exceeding gross weight of four thousand five hundred (4,300) pounds and an overall length of thirty (30) feet.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Village of Moscow Zoning Code Section 820, 2-9.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b819-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>It is evident to us that Skeene\u2019s single-wide mobile home unit is a \u201csingle family dwelling\u201d rendering the lower court\u2019s order requiring issuance of a zoning permit binding and proper. In support of our conclusion, we find that Skeene\u2019s conduct in placing the mobile or manufactured home on a permanent foundation and removing the wheels, axles and hitch, caused the once mobile structure to be transformed into a permanent, residential dwelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">In <em>Sylvester v. Holland Twp. Bd. of Zoning Appeals </em>(1986), 34 Ohio App.3d 270, 518 N.E.2d 36, the Trumbull County Court of Appeals held that the enforceability of a zoning regulation, as applied to a former mobile home, must be based on the condition of the \u201cmobile home\u201d at the situs of the political subdivision so regulated and not upon the condition of the structure at some prior time. The court in that case determined that the structure was not a mobile home, and thus appellant should have been granted a permit to place the structure on her lot provided all other requirements for a family dwelling were met.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Similarly, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>Skeene has changed the character of his mobile home from one of mobility into a permanent, stationary structure. The zoning restrictions adopted by Moscow prohibit transportable or mobile structures in a residential area. Village of Moscow Zoning Code Section 820. However, under the facts in these proceedings, Skeene\u2019s \u201cmobile\u201d home ceases to have those features which would exclude the structure from a residential area. See <em>Kelleys Island v. Spinelli </em>(Nov. 28,1986), Erie App. No. E-85-45, unreported, 1986 WL 13374. Instead, Skeene\u2019s mobile home unit meets the definition of a \u201csingle-family dwelling\u201d permitted in a residential \u201cA\u201d district by the zoning code rather than the excluded \u201cmobile home\u201d which displays a temporary or mobile foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">Therefore, Skeene\u2019s single-wide mobile home unit complies with the zoning code and, as a result, must be issued a zoning permit consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">The argument advanced by Moscow confuses zoning and building code regulations. In effect, Moscow contends that the court below improperly concluded that the Mobile Home Act, specifically Section 5403(d), preempts local zoning laws. However, the Clermont County Court of Common Pleas, in an order dated June 6, 1989, found that Skeene\u2019s mobile home unit complied with Moscow\u2019s zoning definition of a \u201csingle-family dwelling\u201d and that the federal Mobile Home Act superseded any local building code restrictions concerning the construction and safety of mobile or manufactured homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">It is the opinion of this court that Section 5403(d) of the Mobile Home Act preempts state and local regulation of mobile or manufactured homes concerning safety and construction. See consent decree in <em>Ohio Manufactured </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number><em>Hous. Assn. v. Celebrezze </em>(Feb. 11, 1987), S.D. Ohio No. C2-85-1814, unreported.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">Zoning regulation is a recognized tool of community planning, allowing a municipality, in the exercise of its legislative discretion, to restrict the use of private property. <em>Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co. </em>(1926), 272 U.S. 365, 47 S.Ct. 114, 71 L.Ed. 303. Therefore, unless a zoning regulation is arbitrary, unreasonable, capricious, or in conflict with federal law, it will be upheld as a proper legislative function to ensure the health and safety of the community. R.C. 2506.04; <em>Dudokovich v. Hous. Auth. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 202, 12 O.O.3d 198, 389 N.E.2d 1113; Section 2, Article IV, United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Under the Mobile Home Act, Congress intended to establish federal standards for mobile or manufactured homes. <em>United States v. Anaconda Co. </em>(D.C.1977), 445 F.Supp. 486. Accordingly, the Mobile Home Act preempts the field of mobile home construction safety, leaving the land use or zoning aspects to the state and/or local governments. <em>Brookside Village v. Comeau </em>(Tex.1982), 633 S.W.2d 790.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">Moscow\u2019s appeal in this instance is misplaced and unpersuasive. The court below properly found that Skeene complied with and met the local zoning regulation in question. In addition, the court held that federal law codified in the Mobile Home Act preempted state and local regulation of mobile or manufactured homes regarding the construction and safety of said structures. We find Moscow\u2019s appeal not well taken and accordingly overrule the assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">The assignments of error properly before this court having been ruled upon as heretofore set forth, it is the order of this court that the judgment or final order herein appealed from be, and the same hereby is, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b820-9\">William W.
