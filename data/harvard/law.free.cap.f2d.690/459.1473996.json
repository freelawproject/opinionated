At the close of Wyatt\u2019s case presented before the jury, the district court granted Aetna\u2019s motion for directed verdict, upholding Aetna\u2019s contention that Wyatt\u2019s own evidence unequivocally showed that the damages sought by Wyatt were excluded from coverage under a \u201cfaulty workmanship\u201d clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">Wyatt appeals, contending that the district court erred (a) in finding that the exclusion clause applied to the damages sought and (b) at any rate, in granting a directed verdict at the close of the <em>plaintiff\u2019s </em>case, when the <em>defendant </em>had the burden of proving the exclusion. We affirm, finding that the evidence unequivocally demonstrated lack of coverage under the clause, as properly construed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-14\">\n<em>The Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b516-15\">The plaintiff Wyatt had contracted to fabricate and erect a steel cylindrical tower, 240 feet high and 15 feet in diameter (called a C2 Splitter).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant Aetna had issued a policy protecting Wyatt from \u201call risks of physical loss or damage\u201d to its property involved in the construction contract, except for certain specified exclusions \u2014pertinently, here, loss or damage \u201ccaused by or resulting from . .. faulty workmanship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-16\">Wyatt seeks some nine hundred thousand dollars damages, the cost of materials and labor used to replace the tower when it became deformed in the process of construction. The issue will be whether the cause of this damage-causing deformation was \u201cfaulty workmanship\u201d within the meaning of the policy or was instead in the nature of a (covered) fortuitous occurrence, even if resulting from negligence on the part of Wyatt\u2019s employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-17\">The uncontradicted testimony of the sole witness, Wyatt\u2019s president, shows:</p>\n<p id=\"b516-18\">The construction of the giant tower involved a number of steps. First, Wyatt fabricated semi-circular steel plates some two inches thick. These were then welded into twenty-one rings. The rings were placed on top of one another to the height of the tower. Prior to the damage that subsequently resulted, this portion of the tower-construction was successfully completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>However, this initial welding results in stresses in the plates from the cooling of the molten plate after welding. Consequently, a stress-relieving or post-weld heat-treatment operation is always necessary when plates of the present thickness are involved, in order to complete the construction and to have the completed tower meet the construction-code specifications. Essentially, the process involves heating the metal skin to a certain range of temperature (here, between 1100-1200 degrees) uniformly and to hold that the temperature stabilized for a certain period of time (here, about two and a half hours).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">If the temperature becomes too high or is maintained for too long a period, the metal deteriorates. Here, as is not disputed, some excessive heating occurred, and the tower developed a wrinkle and commenced to lean. Eventually, it had to be dismantled and was successfully rebuilt \u2014 and the costs of doing so are what the plaintiff Wyatt seeks to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Wyatt\u2019s testimony unequivocally shows that the excessive and uneven heating that caused deformation of the initial tower was due to certain factors, all within Wyatt\u2019s control and all of which were remedied on the second construction of the tower. These included: the thermocouples (attachments to the skin used to monitor the heat at various places) were improperly placed with regard to that tower so as to monitor the uniformity of the temperature; the burner used to inject hot air and gas into the interior tube of the tower to heat it, was installed so as to heat some portions of it much faster than other portions; the temperature was permitted to reach 1400 degrees on at least one portion of the skin, to the knowledge of Wyatt\u2019s foreman, although it was not supposed to exceed 1200 degrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">Wyatt had previously used the same stress-relieving technique in the construction of towers of similar size; however, they were of some differing design, in that the diameter of the present tower was not uniform from bottom to top. Wyatt does not contest that misjudgments and even negligence on the part of its employees caused the excess heating in the stress-relieving process used on the present tower, partially because techniques previously used were not suitable to the different characteristics of this tower.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">The thrust of Wyatt\u2019s argument is that the tower itself has been successfully constructed and that these misjudgments and negligent acts in the stress-relieving process that caused the <em>subsequent </em>damage to the tower, were in the nature of a fortuitous event extraneous to the construction process, so as not to be within the faulty workmanship exclusion clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">Aetna\u2019s position, which the district court upheld, is that the stress-relieving operation was an integral part of the fabrication and construction of the tower, so that defective procedures were as much.faulty workmanship as would have been a defective welding of the tower itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-11\">\n<em>The Builder\u2019s \u201cAll Risks\u201d Policy and the \u201cFaulty Workmanship\u201d Exclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b517-12\">Aetna\u2019s policy insured Wyatt\u2019s property, including all materials, equipment and machinery used in the construction, \u201c[ajgainst all risks of physical loss or damage from any cause howsoever and wheresoever occurring.\u201d The general purposes of this type of policy, as summarized by us in <em>Dow Chemical Company </em>v. <em>Royal Indemnity Co., </em>635 F.2d 379, 387 (5th Cir. 1981), are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AgS\">A policy of insurance insuring against \u201call risks\u201d creates a special type of coverage that extends to risks not usually covered under other insurance; recovery under an all-risk policy will be allowed for all fortuitous losses not resulting from misconduct or fraud, unless the policy contains a specific provision expressly excluding the loss from coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-13\"><em>See also Walter v. Travelers Indemnity Co., </em>289 So.2d 864, 868 n. 2 (La.App.1974). In <em>Morrison Grain Co., Inc. v. Utica Mutual Ins. Co., </em>632 F.2d 424, 431 (5th Cir. 1980), in upholding coverage under an all risks policy, we noted that \u201c \u2018[a] fortuitous event is an event which so far as the parties to the contract are aware, is dependent \u2022 on chance,\u2019 \u201d and that \u201ca loss may be fortui<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>tous even if it is occasioned by the negligence of the insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">The insurer Aetna here, however, relies upon a specific clause excluding coverage for \u201c[l]oss or damage caused by or resulting from faulty workmanship.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Two of the decisions relied upon by the plaintiff Wyatt (both of which rejected exclusion under the clause), shed some light on the meaning and apparent intent of the \u201cfaulty workmanship\u201d exclusion in a builder\u2019s all risks policy: \u201cA defect in workmanship is a defect in the way some part of the [insured property] is constructed,\u201d <em>Equitable Fire and Marine Insurance Company v. Allied Steel Construction Co., </em>421 F.2d 512, 514 (10th Cir. 1970); the clause excludes coverage for damages \u201cresulting from defects in the product caused by faults in the construction process.... It is the quality of the product which is excluded from coverage, and not damage to the product caused by negligence during the construction process.\u201d <em>City of Barre v. New Hampshire Insurance Co., </em>136 Vt. 484, 396 A.2d 121, 122-23 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Thus, Aetna does not dispute that fortuitous damage to construction property extraneous to the construction of the product itself (here, the tower), occasioned by negligence of the insured\u2019s employees, is not excluded from coverage by the \u201cfaulty workmanship\u201d clause in an all risks policy\u2014 such as, for example, if one of the insured\u2019s employees negligently ran a truck into the tower under construction and caused it to turn over. Here, however \u2014 Aetna contends, correctly in our opinion \u2014 the defective <em>workmanship </em>in the stress-relieving process (whether due to negligence, inadvertence, mis judgment, or whatnot) that caused the tower to become deformed, while it was in the course of construction, occurred during and before the completion of the tower as an integral part of the (faulty) workmanship in its construction. The defects of construction were as much \u201cfaulty workmanship\u201d in the tower\u2019s construction as would have been defective welding in the initial stages of its construction, which concededly, <em>cf., Dow Chemical, supra, </em>635 F.2d at 387-88, falls within the exclusion' clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">The insured, Wyatt, argues that the \u201cfaulty workmanship\u201d exclusion applies to defects actually built into the structure, but not to mis judgments or to negligent or ineffective procedures in doing the work that themselves do not become part of the completed product.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">In this argument, Wyatt relies upon <em>Equitable </em>and <em>City of Barre, </em>cited above. While some language in these decisions does support Wyatt\u2019s contention, such language must be viewed in the context of the facts presented to those courts for decision. In <em>Equitable, </em>a pipeline fell into the river across which it was being constructed, because a workman had replaced a fitting at one pier without first securing the pipe at another pier. In <em>City of Barre, </em>wooden arches blew down because the insured contractor had installed only two guy wires, where six were required by the plans. Although errors in workmanship contributed in the causation, the loss or damage in each case essentially resulted fortuitously from events extraneous to the construction process itself \u2014 the fall into the river <em>{Equitable), </em>the gusting of the wind from twelve knots to thirty <em>{City of Barre).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Here, unlike in <em>Equitable </em>and <em>City of Barre, </em>the damages are excluded from coverage, because the faulty workmanship comprehends \u201ca defect in the way some part of the [insured property \u2014 here, the tower] is constructed,\u201d <em>Equitable, supra, </em>421 F.2d at 514, and excludes damage \u201cresulting from defects in the product <em>[i.e., </em>the tower] caused by faults in the construction process,\u201d <em>City of Barre, supra, </em>396 A.2d at 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">\n<em>The Directed Verdict</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">To a large extent, Wyatt\u2019s argument as to the impropriety of a directed verdict at the close of its case depends upon its contentions as to the proper construction of the faulty-workmanship exclusion clause or as to its ambiguity (see note 4), which we have rejected above. As Wyatt\u2019s able counsel stated, in arguing against directed motion to the district court, a directed verdict would be appropriate \u201cif it is clear beyond question, and if there is no issue left in the plaintiff\u2019s case but that the loss is caused by an excluded risk.\u201d R. 76. In arguing against directed verdict, counsel relied solely upon Wyatt\u2019s construction of the exclusion clause, R. 76-83, and the only potential rebuttal evidence to which he adverted before the trial court seems to be that allegedly non-excluded \u201cnegligent construction\u201d practices, R. 80, rather than defective workmanship on the tower itself, may have caused or contributed to the defect \u2014 a construction of the exclusion clause that we have above rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">Wyatt essentially contends that it presented a prima facie case of coverage under the builder\u2019s all risk policy, thus shifting the burden of proof, like an affirmative defense, to the insurer to present evidence that the loss was within a policy exclusion. <em>See Myevre v. Continental Casualty Co., </em>245 So.2d 785, 786-87 (La.App.1971). Wyatt claims that a directed verdict before the insurer offers evidence asserting the exclusion is improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">The standard of review for motions for directed verdict under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50 are the same for a trial court and an appellate court, see <em>Alman Bros. Farms &amp; Feed Mill, Inc. </em>v. <em>Diamond Laboratories, Inc., </em>437 F.2d 1295, 1298 (5th Cir. 1971). The evidence and all inferences therefore must <em>be </em>reviewed in the light most favorable to the party against whom the motion is offered. <em>Boeing Co. v. Shipman, </em>411 F.2d 365, 374-75 (5th Cir. 1969) (en banc). While direction in favor of the party having the burden of proof is rarely granted, it is permitted where that party \u201chas established his case by testimony that the jury is not at liberty to disbelieve.\u201d 9 Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00b6 2535 at 591 (1971). <em>See Allen </em>v. <em>Seacoast Products, Inc., </em>623 F.2d 355, 360 n. 9 (5th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">At the close of Wyatt\u2019s case, the district court was presented a set of undisputed facts. No ambiguities existed as to the credibility of the sole witness, Wyatt\u2019s president, or as to facts needed to prove the exclusion. The decision as to whether the exclusion for faulty workmanship applied to this fact situation became a question of law. After the plaintiffs set forth a prima facie case of loss and coverage under the general provisions of the policy, the insurer Aetna did have the burden of proving that the risk was expressly excluded by a policy clause. However, here, where Wyatt\u2019s own evidence also overwhelmingly and unequivocally proved the conditions for exclusion of coverage, the defendant was not required to present further evidence after the plaintiff rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-12\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b519-13\">At the close of the plaintiff Wyatt\u2019s evidence, the district court did not err in granting Aetna\u2019s motion for a directed verdict. No reasonable jury could have failed to find that the insurance policy exclusion applied, since \u201cfaulty workmanship\u201d includes the defective handling of a heat treatment that is an integral part of the construction process of the insured property. We therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b516-11\">. We will refer in the opinion to the three plaintiffs (U.S. Industries, Inc., Wyatt Industries, Inc., and Steel Tank Construction Co.) as \u201cWyatt\u201d in the singular.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-12\">Wyatt Industries, Inc. is now the wholly-owned subsidiary of U.S. Industries (USI). Before the events leading to this litigation, it was the Texas division of USI. Steel Tank Construction Co. was a wholly-owned subsidiary of USI, but after USI had incorporated Wyatt Industries, USI transferred ownership of Steel Tank to Wyatt Industries.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b516-19\">. The defendant insurance companies are Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., Aetna Insurance Co. and Travelers Indemnity Co., Employers Surplus Lines Insurance Co., Lexington Insurance Co. and American Home Assurance Co.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b516-20\">. USI\u2019s Wyatt Texas Division fabricated the materials of the splitter and subcontracted the actual erection of the tower to Steel Tank, USI\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary. For convenience\u2019s sake, both operations will be described under the name Wyatt.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b518-6\">. The exclusion itself is limited. It excludes loss or damage resulting from \u201cfaulty workmanship but <em>not excluding resultant physical loss or damage to </em>other <em>property insured hereunder\" </em>(emphasis added). In a subsidiary argument, Wyatt relies upon the italicized argument in contending (a) that the damage to the initially constructed (but not stress-relieved) tower was damage to \u201cother\u201d property in<em>sured </em>\u2014 i.e., that faulty workmanship in the stress-relieving using some insured equipment and property did not fall within the \u201cfaulty workmanship\u201d exclusion, since it injured \u201cother\u201d property, and (b) that, at any rate, the provision is ambiguous so that under well settled principles the ambiguity should be resolved against the insurer. The short answer is that, as held in the body of the opinion, the stress-relieving was as much an integral part of the construction of the tower as was the initial fabrication and welding. Thus, faulty workmanship in the stress-relieving portion of the construction of the tower, was as much \u201cfaulty workmanship\u201d as would have been the concededly excluded defective welding in the initial phases of construction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
