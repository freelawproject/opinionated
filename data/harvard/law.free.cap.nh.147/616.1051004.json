The exclusion clause is included in the uninsured motorist provision of two policies issued by the defendant, State Farm Auto Insurance Company. We dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-16\">On January 5, 1999, George Libby, an employee of the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, was fatally injured when struck by a motor vehicle owned by the United States Navy and operated by a co-employee. The plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>applied for and received work injury compensation benefits for federal employees. <em>See 5 </em>U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 8101-8193 (1996). Under the federal work injury compensation statute, the plaintiff is barred from bringing an action for damages against Libby\u2019s employer or co-employee. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 8173.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">The plaintiff requested that the defendant, Libby\u2019s personal automobile insurance carrier, provide coverage under the policies\u2019 uninsured motorist provision. On August 19, 1999, the defendant denied coverage for two reasons. First, the defendant said that the vehicle involved in the accident is not an uninsured vehicle as defined by the policies because the federal work injury compensation statute bars the plaintiff from bringing an action against either the owner or operator of the vehicle and therefore the plaintiff is not legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of the vehicle. Second, the defendant denied coverage because the United States Navy owned the vehicle, and the \u201cpolicy clearly states that [uninsured motor vehicle] shall not include any land motor vehicle owned by \u2018the United States of America, Canada, a state, a political subdivision of any such government, or an agency of any of the foregoing.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">On September 2,1999, we decided <em>Gorman v. National Grange Mutual Insurance Co., </em>144 N.H. 157 (1999). The plaintiff in <em>Gorman, </em>like the plaintiff in this case, sought to recover uninsured motorist benefits from her personal insurer for injuries caused by a co-employee in the course of her employment. <em>Id. </em>at 158. The uninsured motorist policy at issue in that case provided coverage for \u201can insured [who] is <em>legally entitled to recover </em>from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 159 (quotations omitted). We observed that the phrase \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d as used in an uninsured motorist policy referred to whether the owner or operator of the uninsured motor vehicle was at fault. <em>Id. </em>at 159. Accordingly, in <em>Gorman, </em>we held that \u201cthe insured\u2019s right to recover will depend on her ability to establish fault on the part of the alleged tortfeasor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(brackets omitted). Because her right to coverage under her uninsured motorist policy depended upon her ability to establish fault, we further held that the State workers\u2019 compensation law, which provides that a plaintiff is conclusively presumed to have waived her common law rights against her employer and co-employee, did not prevent the plaintiff from obtaining coverage. <em>Id. </em>at 161. The plaintiff, in this case, is similarly barred from bringing an action for damages against Libby\u2019s employer or co-employee. Therefore, following our decision in <em>Gorman, </em>the federal work injury compensation statute did not prevent the plaintiff from obtaining coverage under Libby\u2019s uninsured motorist policies; whether the plaintiff was entitled to coverage depended upon its ability to establish fault on the part of the alleged tortfeasor. Following our decision in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number><em>Gorman, </em>however, the defendant continued to deny that the plaintiff is entitled to coverage based upon the \u201cgovernment vehicle\u201d exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">In January 2000, the plaintiff filed a declaratory judgment action in superior court, <em>see </em>RSA 491:22 (1997), asserting a claim for coverage under the uninsured motorist provision. In response, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment arguing \u201cthe plain and unambiguous language of the policies exclude a government vehicle from constituting an \u2018uninsured motor vehicle.\u2019\u201d The plaintiff filed a cross-motion for summary judgment contending that the \u201cgovernment vehicle exclusion is contrary to the Financial Responsibility Act, [and therefore] it should not be enforced.\u201d The superior court ruled that based upon the \u201cgovernment vehicle\u201d exclusion, \u201cand in the absence of any express statutory mandate to the contrary,\u201d the plaintiff was not entitled to coverage, and therefore granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. On February 1, 2001, the plaintiff filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">On January 11, 2002, prior to oral argument in this case, we decided <em>Matarese v. New Hampshire Municipal Association Property-Liability Insurance Trust, Inc.\u2019, </em>147 N.H. 396 (2002). In <em>Matarese, </em>we overruled <em>Gorman </em>and held instead \u201cthat the phrase \u2018legally entitled to recover\u2019 contained in New Hampshire\u2019s uninsured motorist statute and conforming insurance policies is clear and unambiguous and that the claimant cannot prevail against the insurer if the action against the uninsured motorist is barred.\u201d <em>Matarese, </em>147 N.H. at 403. Citing this holding, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss this appeal, arguing that the plaintiff \u201cis not \u2018legally entitled to recover\u2019 damages from the person allegedly responsible for this accident by virtue of the bar created by the Federal [work injury compensation statute].\u201d Therefore, the defendant contends, the plaintiff \u201cis not entitled to maintain a claim for uninsured motorist benefits against [the defendant].\u201d The defendant further contends that because the plaintiff is not entitled to benefits under the uninsured motorist provision, \u201cwhether the vehicle that struck him qualifies as an \u2018uninsured motor vehicle\u2019 is irrelevant and need not be decided by this Court at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">The plaintiff objected to the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. In its objection, the plaintiff noted that, at that time, a motion to reconsider the <em>Matarese </em>decision had been filed, and asserted that \u201cthe <em>Matarese </em>decision appears to be at odds with the legislature\u2019s clear intent with respect to the New Hampshire Uninsured Motorist statute.\u201d We deferred ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss and allowed the parties to address the issue at oral argument. At oral argument, the plaintiff did not suggest that the <em>Matarese </em>decision should not be retroactively applied to this case; rather, the plaintiff asserted that the court should address: (1) whether the decision to overrule <em>Gorman </em>should stand; and (2) whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>\u201cgovernment vehicle\u201d exclusion violates the New Hampshire Financial Responsibility Act and public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">On February 20, 2002, the <em>Matarese </em>plaintiffs motion for reconsideration and rehearing was denied, thereby making the <em>Matarese </em>decision final. After consideration of the plaintiffs arguments in this case, we reaffirm and adopt our decision in <em>Matarese </em>and, accordingly, decline the plaintiffs invitation to reconsider whether <em>Gorman </em>should have been overruled. Because the plaintiff does not argue that <em>Matarese </em>should not be applied retroactively to this case, we hold that the phrase \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d contained in Libby\u2019s policies means that the plaintiff cannot prevail in its claim for uninsured motorist coverage because, under the federal work injury compensation statute, the action against Libby\u2019s employer and co-employee is barred. Therefore, whether the \u201cgovernment vehicle\u201d exclusion contained within the uninsured motorist provision violates the Financial Responsibility Act or public policy is moot and we dismiss the plaintiffs appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b655-6\">BRODERICK, J., sat for oral argument but did not take part in the final vote; Brock, C.J., and Dalianis, J., concurred; Nadeau, J., dissented.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b655-7\">NADEAU, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AcR\">dissenting. Respectfully, I dissent from the majority opinion for the reasons set forth in my dissent in <em>Matarese v. New Hampshire Municipal Association Property-Liability Insurance Trust, Inc., </em>147 N.H. 396, 405 (2002). As I stated in <em>Matarese:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-8\">I do not believe that we should treat all substantive defenses that could be asserted by the uninsured tortfeasor alike or adopt a uniform rule that permits the insurer to assert any such defense to bar a plaintiffs recovery of uninsured motorist benefits. Rather, I believe that we should weigh the policy and goals of the defense against those of the uninsured motorist statute to determine whether permitting the insurer to assert the defense, in the context of a specific case, would be consistent with these policies and goals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 407. Accordingly, I believe that we cannot decide whether the federal work injury compensation statute bars the plaintiffs recovery of uninsured motorist benefits from the defendant without balancing the public policies underlying the federal statute and the uninsured motorist statute and determining whether there is a persuasive reason why the existence of an immunity from tort liability for the decedent should mean <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>that the defendant is not liable under the decedent\u2019s uninsured motorist policy. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
