(Camcar), appeals, <em>see </em>Sup. Ct. R. 8, from an order of the Superior Court <em>(McHugh, </em>J.) denying its motion to dismiss the plaintiffs, Strafford Technology, Inc.\u2019s (STI), suit for breach of contract. Camcar sought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>dismissal on the basis that the parties had agreed to resolve any contractual disputes in the courts of Illinois and that New Hampshire, therefore, lacked jurisdiction to hear the case. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">The record supports the following facts. STI, a New Hampshire corporation, and Camcar, an Illinois corporation, entered into a written contract under which STI was to provide services for the development of a computer database. When Camcar allegedly failed to pay in full for services rendered, STI filed suit in New Hampshire for breach of contract. Based on a forum selection clause in the contract, Camcar moved to dismiss the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The forum selection clause, entitled, \u201cGOVERNING LAW,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-6\">The contract resulting from this Order is to be construed according to the laws of the state from which this Order issues [Illinois], as shown by the address of [Textron] printed on the face of this Order. The parties agree that any controversy arising under this Order <em>shall be determined by the courts of [Illinois] </em>and [STI] hereby submits and consents to the jurisdiction of [Illinois] courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">(Emphasis added.) The contract also contained a separate choice of law provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">In response to Camcar\u2019s contention that the phrase \u201cshall be determined by the courts of [Illinois]\u201d was enforceable under RSA 508-A:3 (1997), STI argued, relying upon <em>Dancart v. St. Albans Rubber Co., </em>124 N.H. 598 (1984), that the forum selection clause was permissive only and did not confer exclusive jurisdiction in Illinois. The trial court agreed, finding the provision in question synonymous with the operative language, \u201cshall be subject to the jurisdiction of the English courts,\u201d in <em>Dancart, </em>124 N.H. at 601. It concluded that although the provision granted jurisdiction in Illinois, it did not grant <em>exclusive </em>jurisdiction in the courts of that State. This interlocutory appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">The sole issue before us is whether the trial court erred in its interpretation of the forum selection clause and, specifically, whether our decision in <em>Dancart </em>is controlling. Because the issue before us is a matter of contract interpretation, it is ultimately a question of law for us to decide. <em>Merrimack School Dist. v. Nat\u2019l School Bus Serv., </em>140 N.H. 9, 11 (1995). When interpreting a written contract, we read the document as a whole and give its terms their reasonable meaning. <em>Id. </em>We independently review the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the contract and generally defer to its factual findings, unless they are unsupported by the evidence or legally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>erroneous. <em>Bezanson v. Hampshire Meadows Dev. Corp., </em>144 N.H. 298, 306-07 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">In <em>Dancart, </em>our decision turned, in part, on the meaning of the word \u201cshall\u201d in the phrase, \u201cshall be subject to the jurisdiction of the English courts.\u201d We held that the use of \u201cshall\u201d had the \u201cobvious effect of making [the] clause sufficient of its own force to confer jurisdiction, but [left] open the question of exclusiveness.\u201d <em>Dancart, </em>124 N.H. at 602. STI relies upon this similarity \u2014 the presence of the term \u201cshall\u201d in the forum selection clause at issue \u2014 in arguing that the clause in this case is nonexclusive. This narrow construction, however, overlooks the remainder of the clause \u2014 most notably, \u201cshall <em>be determined </em>by\u201d \u2014 and its effect on the overall meaning of the clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">The use of the phrase, \u201cbe determined by,\u201d distinguishes this case from <em>Dancart </em>by clearly defining what jurisdiction is to exclusively decide the outcome of all disputes arising from the parties\u2019 agreement. We agree with Camcar that there is a plain difference between \u201call claims shall be determined by court X,\u201d and \u201call claims shall be subject to the jurisdiction of court X.\u201d The former dictates what court will decide the outcome of all claims; the latter simply allows one court to hear all claims, along with any other court having jurisdiction over the claims. In the context of the present case, the phrase \u201cbe determined by\u201d modifies the word \u201cshall\u201d and instructs that any controversy be resolved solely in the Illinois courts. Therefore, the language is more than a passive grant of jurisdictional authority; it mandates that dispositive action be reached in a particular venue. <em>Cf. Dancart, </em>124 N.H. at 602 (clause in question not a mandate to act or refrain from acting; therefore, use of \u201cshall\u201d does not affect nonexclusive nature of clause).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">We are mindful that the modern trend has been to \u201cadopt a more hospitable attitude toward forum-selection clauses.\u201d <em>Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., </em>407 U.S. 1, 9-10 (1971). Such clauses, however, are subject to rigorous rules of interpretation and will not be enforced if deemed unjust or unreasonable. <em>See id. </em>at 10. New Hampshire has, by statute, sanctioned the enforcement of forum selection clauses provided that the parties \u201chave agreed in writing that an action ... shall be brought only in another state ____\u201d RSA 508-A:3. Even in these instances, a forum selection clause that confers exclusive jurisdiction may still be unenforceable if enumerated statutory exceptions apply. <em>See </em>RSA 508-A:3,1-V.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>STI argues that the statute\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cshall be brought <em>only </em>in another state,\u201d RSA 508~A:3 (emphasis added), requires that, in order to be enforceable, a forum selection clause must contain the word \u201conly.\u201d We disagree. The purpose of RSA 5Q8-A:3 is to enforce forum selection clauses that are bargained for by contracting parties, provided that they confer exclusive jurisdiction. Beyond mandating exclusivity, the statute does not dictate the precise wording necessary for forum selection clauses to withstand judicial scrutiny, and we will not read the statute as requiring specific \u201cmagic words.\u201d <em>See Appeal of City of Franklin, </em>137 N.H. 723, 727-28 (1993). The statute mandates that enforceable forum selection clauses identify and make exclusive whatever jurisdiction is selected to resolve disputes. If a reasonable and fair reading of such a clause would not confer exclusive jurisdiction, it will not be enforced. It is the intent of the parties that the statute seeks to exalt, not particular word choices.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">In the trial court, STI argued not only that the parties\u2019 forum selection clause was not sufficiently exclusive, but also that it would be inequitable to enforce it. Because the trial court found the forum selection clause deficient on exclusivity grounds, it never addressed STI\u2019s equitable arguments. <em>See </em>RSA 508-A:3,1-Y. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling that the parties\u2019 forum selection clause did not confer exclusive jurisdiction in the courts of Illinois, and remand to the trial court to consider STI\u2019s equitable arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b213-6\">Brock, C.J., and Nadeau, Dalianis and Duggan, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
