Ct. R. 9, asking whether a non-criminal violation-level offense can trigger the imposition of a suspended sentence conditioned upon only the defendant\u2019s \u201cgood behavior.\u201d We respond in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-11\">\u2018We accept the statement of the case presented in the interlocutory transfer.\u201d <em>Trovato v. Deveau, </em>143 N.H. 523, 524 (1999). In November 1999, the defendant pleaded guilty to one count of possession of a controlled drug and one count of resisting arrest. He was sentenced to sixty days imprisonment and fined $200 on each count, all of which was deferred for six months. On June 5,2000, the defendant\u2019s sentences were suspended for two years conditioned upon his continued good behavior. On July 21, 2000, the defendant was arrested for transporting alcoholic beverages by a minor, a violation-level offense. <em>See </em>RSA 265:81-a (1993). After pleading guilty, he was fined $300 and lost his license for sixty days. Thereafter, the State moved to impose the defendant\u2019s suspended sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-12\"> We have previously held that there is a condition of good behavior implied in both suspended and deferred sentences. <em>See State v. Budgett, </em>146 N.H. 135, 138 (2001) (suspended sentences); <em>State v. Graham, </em>146 N.H. 142, 144 (2001) (deferred sentences). The term \u201cgood behavior\u201d is defined \u201cas conduct conforming to the law\u201d and does not include \u201cnoncriminal behavior for which the defendant must be given actual notice.\u201d <em>Budgett, </em>146 N.H. at 139. To impose a suspended or deferred sentence on the ground that the defendant has violated the implied condition of good behavior, a trial court must find that the defendant engaged in criminal conduct. <em>See id.; see also State v. Palermo, </em>146 N.H. 144, 146 (2001) (trial court could not impose deferred sentence based upon defendant\u2019s prison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>disciplinary violations absent finding that these violations constituted criminal acts).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">A suspended or deferred sentence need not expressly state that committing a crime will trigger its imposition because such a condition is \u201cso basic and fundamental that any reasonable person would be aware of [it].\u201d <em>Budgett, </em>146 N.H. at 138 (quotation omitted). By contrast, a defendant must be given actual notice that engaging in non-criminal conduct could result in imposition of his sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 138-39. To satisfy due process, a suspended or deferred sentence <em>must </em>specify the types of non-criminal conduct that will trigger its imposition. <em>Id. </em>at 139. \u201cTo hold otherwise would effectively modify the terms of the original sentencing order and result in fundamental unfairness.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\"> These principles apply with equal force to express conditions of \u201cgood behavior.\u201d Thus, a suspended or deferred sentence expressly conditioned only upon the defendant\u2019s continued \u201cgood behavior\u201d may not be imposed absent a finding that the defendant engaged in criminal conduct. In this case, the defendant committed a violation-level offense. As \u201c[a] violation does not constitute a crime,\u201d <em>State v. Dery, </em>134 N.H. 370, 377 (1991), the trial court may not impose the defendant\u2019s suspended sentences upon proof that he committed a violation-level offense. <em>See </em>RSA 625:9, 11(b) (Supp. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">\n<em>Remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b790-8\">NADEAU and Dalianis, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
