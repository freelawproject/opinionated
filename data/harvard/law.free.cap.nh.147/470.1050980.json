(Pro Con). We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">In 1993, Oracle Corporation hired Pro Con to manage the construction of its facility in Nashua. Pro Con hired several subcontractors for the project, including Decorative Concepts, an interior painting contractor. During the project, Decorative Concepts carried a commercial general liability policy issued by Acadia that contained an additional insured endorsement. This endorsement provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-9\">WHO IS AN INSURED is amended to include as an insured any person or organization for whom you are performing operations if you and such person or organization have agreed in a contract or agreement that such person or organization be added as an additional insured on your policy. Such person or organization is an additional insured only with respect to liability arising out of your ongoing operations performed for that insured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">In February 1997, a Decorative Concepts employee was allegedly injured when he slipped and fell on an icy sidewalk while on his way from his work area to a coffee truck parked on the site\u2019s lot. The employee and his wife thereafter brought suit against Pro Con, claiming that Pro Con negligently failed to keep the sidewalk clear of snow and ice. Pro Con requested indemnification under the policy issued by Acadia. Acadia denied Pro Con\u2019s request for coverage, asserting that the circumstances giving rise to the employee\u2019s claim do not trigger coverage under the additional insured endorsement. Pro Con then filed this petition for declaratory judgment in superior court seeking a determination of coverage. <em>See </em>RSA 491:22 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Acadia and Pro Con filed cross-motions for summary judgment. After a hearing, the superior court ruled that the language providing coverage for liability arising out of Decorative Concepts\u2019 \u201c'ongoing operations\u2019 reasonably informed Pro Con that the policy would cover a Decorative Concepts employee injured during an on-site break from his assigned task.\u201d Therefore, the superior court granted Pro Con\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied Acadia\u2019s motion for summary judgment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">On appeal, Acadia argues the superior court erred in ruling that the policy provided coverage to Pro Con as an additional insured in this case. Because the parties do not dispute any material facts, we need only determine whether Pro Con was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>N.E. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. City of Rochester, </em>144 N.H. 118, 120 (1999). We review the superior court\u2019s application of law to the facts <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Our analysis begins with an examination of the insurance policy language. The interpretation of insurance policy language, like any contract language, is an issue of law for the court to decide. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Armstrong, </em>144 N.H. 170, 172 (1999). We look to the plain and ordinary meaning of the policy\u2019s words in context, <em>Concord Gen. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Mitchell, </em>138 N.H. 229, 231 (1994), \u201cand we construe the terms of the policy as would a reasonable person in the position of the insured based on more than a casual reading of the policy as a whole,\u201d <em>Deyette v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>142 N.H. 560, 561 (1997) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">The policy language at issue here is the portion of the additional insured endorsement that provides coverage to \u201can additional insured only with respect to liability arising out of your ongoing operations performed for that insured.\u201d The phrase \u201carising out of\u2019 has been interpreted as meaning \u201coriginating from or growing out of or flowing from.\u201d <em>Allstate Ins. Co. v. Crouch, </em>140 N.H. 329, 332 (1995) (quotation omitted). Thus, to warrant coverage arising out of Decorative Concepts\u2019 ongoing operations performed for Pro Con, the ongoing operations need not have been the proximate cause of the injuries but the causal connection between the two must be more than tenuous. <em>See Cannon v. Maine Bonding &amp; Cas. Co., </em>138 N.H. 365, 366 (1994). This means some causal nexus must link Decorative Concepts\u2019 ongoing operations and the injuries before coverage under the additional insured endorsement is triggered. While the causal connection need not be \u201cproximate\u201d as that term is used in the more demanding evidentiary area of tort law, the causal connection must still exist. <em>See Akerley v. Hartford Ins. Group, </em>136 N.H. 433, 439-40 (1992). Acadia contends that in this case the only connection between the injuries and Decorative Concepts\u2019 ongoing operations is the fact that the injured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>person was a Decorative Concepts employee. This connection, Acadia asserts, is too tenuous to warrant coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Decorative Concepts\u2019 ongoing operations consisted of interior painting. The injuries did not occur while the employee was engaged in any task related to Decorative Concepts\u2019 painting operations, <em>cf. Merchants Ins. Co. of New Hampshire, Inc. v. USF&amp;G, </em>143 F.3d 5, 9 (1st Cir. 1998) (concluding coverage warranted when subcontractor\u2019s employee injured while performing task assigned to subcontractor), or near Decorative Concepts\u2019 painting operations. Therefore, no nexus exists between the painting operations and the injuries, and thus the required causal connection between the injuries and Decorative Concepts\u2019 painting operations does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Pro Con contends that the policy language can be reasonably interpreted to include all claims that would not have arisen \u201cbut for\u201d the employee\u2019s presence on the general contractor\u2019s premises. <em>See, e.g., Shell Oil Co. v. AC &amp; S, Inc., </em>649 N.E.2d 946, 951-52 (Ill. App. Ct. 1995) (concluding injuries \u201carose out of\u2019 subcontractor\u2019s work when employee injured while walking from work-site to work-trailer because \u201c[t]he injuries would not have occurred \u2018but for\u2019 [the plaintiffs] employment by [the subcontractor] and [the subcontractor\u2019s] presence on the [general contractor\u2019s] premises\u201d). This interpretation, however, is inconsistent with our longstanding interpretation of the phrase \u201carising out of.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Union Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. King, </em>113 N.H. 39, 41 (1973) (interpreting \u201carising out of\u2019 to require less than proximate cause, but more than a tenuous causal connection); <em>Akerley, </em>136 N.H. at 439 (same). Thus, a reasonable person in Pro Con\u2019s position would not expect coverage for all claims that would not have arisen \u201cbut for\u201d a subcontractor\u2019s employee\u2019s presence on the general contractor\u2019s premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Because no causal connection between the injuries in this case and Decorative Concepts\u2019 painting operations exists, we reverse the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Pro Con.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remand,ed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b509-9\">Brock, C.J., and Broderick, J., sat for oral argument but did not take part in the final vote; \u00dcALIANIS, J., concurred; NADEAU, J., dissented.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b509-10\">Nadeau, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A5y\">dissenting. I agree with the majority that to find coverage in this case, Decorative Concepts\u2019 \u201congoing operations need not have been the proximate cause of the injuries but the causal connection between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>two must be more than tenuous.\u201d I conclude, however, that the facts before us satisfy that test.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Although the majority states that the test requires only \u201csome causal nexus\u201d between the injuries and Decorative Concepts\u2019 operations, in purporting to apply the test, it actually requires a much stronger causal connection. The majority states that \u201c[t]he injuries did not occur while the employee was engaged in any task related to Decorative Concepts\u2019 painting operations, or near Decorative Concepts\u2019 painting operations,\u201d and therefore concludes that the \u201crequired causal connection between the injuries and Decorative Concepts\u2019 painting operations does not exist.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Applying existing case law to the facts here, however, leads me to the opposite conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Citing similar cases from a number of jurisdictions, the court in <em>Admiral Insurance Co. v. Trident NGL, Inc., </em>988 S.W.2d 451, 454 (Tex. App. 1999), summarized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-7\">The majority view of these cases is that for liability to \u201carise out of operations\u201d of a named insured it is not necessary for the named insured\u2019s acts to have \u201ccaused\u201d the accident; rather, it is sufficient that the named insured\u2019s employee was injured while present at the scene in connection with performing the named insured\u2019s business, even if the cause of the injury was the negligence of the additional insured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">Thus, the <em>Admiral </em>court found a sufficient causal connection where \u201cthe accident occurred while [the named insured] was performing its operations, <em>i.e., </em>[the named insured\u2019s] employee was present for the purpose of maintaining and repairing [the additional insured\u2019s] facilities.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">Coverage has been found where, as here, the named insured\u2019s employee becomes injured due to a dangerous condition on the premises. Thus, the court in <em>Saavedra v. Murphy Oil U.S.A., Inc., </em>930 F.2d 1104, 1110, 1106 (5th Cir. 1991), found coverage with respect to \u201coperations performed by or for the named insured,\u201d where an employee of the named insured, while performing work on the additional insured\u2019s premises, \u201callegedly slipped on algae that had formed around a leaking fire hydrant and seriously injured himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">Furthermore, covered injuries have not been restricted to those sustained in the actual performance of the employee\u2019s work as distinguished from preparatory or subsequent activities. For instance, in <em>McCarthy Brothers Co. v. Continental Lloyds Insurance Co., </em>7 S.W. 3d 725 (Tex. App. 1999), the employee fell on a \u201cmuddy, slippery\u201d fifty-five to sixty foot incline that the employees \u201cwere required to traverse ... to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>retrieve electrical equipment necessary for their work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 727 (quotations omitted). Similarly, in <em>Highland Park Shopping Village v. Trinity Universal Insurance Co., </em>36 S.W.3d 916, 917, 917 n.2 (Tex. App. 2001), an employee sued for injuries sustained on an allegedly unsafe \u201cMan Lift,\u201d a conveyor belt-like device used to move parking garage employees between floors. The injured employee was sent by his employer, the named insured, to do plumbing work on the premises of the additional insured, Highland Park Shopping Center. <em>Id. </em>at 917. The employee \u201cborrowed a ladder from Highland Park to use in his work. After completing the job [the employee] returned the ladder to the Highland Park garage basement and used the Man Lift to reach his car, parked outside the garage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court found that the employee\u2019s injuries arose out of the named insured\u2019s work and that Highland Park was therefore covered as an additional insured. <em>Id. </em>at 918.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">In the context of workers\u2019 compensation, and in interpreting a related exclusion from a general liability policy, we have held that an injury arises in the course of employment if \u201cit occurred in the performance of an activity related to employment, which may include a personal activity if reasonably expected and not forbidden.\u201d <em>Gagnon v. N.H. Ins. Co., </em>133 N.H. 70, 75-76 (1990) (quotation omitted). In the instant case, the injured employee alleged in his suit against Pro Con that he was on Oracle\u2019s \u201cpremises while in the course of his employment.\u201d The trial court found it was undisputed that the employee \u201cslipped and fell on a sidewalk at the Oracle facility while on his way to a coffee truck located in the parking lot.\u201d I have little difficulty concluding from the evidence that taking a coffee break on the work premises is an activity reasonably expected and not forbidden. Thus, the injury-producing activity was within the scope of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">By logical extension, the injury-producing activity was also related to the employer\u2019s operations. In short, the employee here \u201cwas injured while present at the scene in connection with performing the named insured\u2019s business.\u201d <em>Admiral, </em>988 S.W.2d at 454. I would conclude, therefore, that Pro Con was covered as an additional insured under Decorative Concepts\u2019 policy. For that reason, respectfully, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
