Douglas, be suspended from the practice of law for a period of two years based on violations of the New Hampshire Rules of Professional Conduct (Rules). The petition was referred to a Judicial Referee <em>(Gray, </em>J.) for hearing and recommendation. The referee found, by clear and convincing evidence, that the respondent violated Rules 1.15(a)(1), 1.15(c) and 8.4(a). The referee rejected all other allegations of professional misconduct and recommended that the respondent\u2019s license be suspended for six months. Neither the committee nor the respondent accepted the referee\u2019s report. We agree with the referee and impose the recommended sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">In November 1994, Walter Foster retained the respondent to represent him in his divorce proceeding. Foster was previously represented by another attorney in this same matter. Prior to the respondent\u2019s involvement in the case, the Superior Court <em>(Mangones, </em>J.) had entered a temporary order requiring that approximately $17,000 be held in escrow until further order of the court. Foster\u2019s prior attorney was the escrow agent for the funds and upon his termination as counsel, he transferred the escrow money to the respondent. The respondent subsequently placed the funds in an escrow account in December 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">In January 1996, the superior court issued a decree of divorce awarding the funds being held in escrow to Foster and his ex-wife in equal shares. Foster was concerned about the escrow funds and had conversations with the respondent concerning their status. Under the divorce decree, Foster\u2019s ex-wife owed him money stemming from her workers\u2019 compensation claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>and he believed the money he owed her from the escrow account was subject to a set-off. The funds remained in escrow until February 22,1996, when the respondent withdrew the funds and used them to pay Foster\u2019s outstanding legal fees at her law firm. The respondent did not inform Foster that she had withdrawn the funds until approximately three weeks later. In fact, a letter written by the respondent dated March 20, 1996, gave the clear impression that the funds were still being held in escrow almost a month after they had been withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Prior to being informed that the funds had already been withdrawn, Foster sent the respondent a series of letters pertaining to the escrow funds. On March 3, 1996, Foster sent a letter stating: \u201cThe Escrow account. Please cash for me. I will pay you balance of what I owe you.\u201d On March 9, 1996, Foster sent another letter stating: \u201cLet\u2019s clean out the escrow account. Please have money available for me on Wednesday. Please have it available in cash.\u201d On March 13,1996, the client sent a third letter stating: \u201cWith regards to the escrow account. You and I already discussed closing it out on a number of occasions. The last occasion being two weeks ago. This has also been delayed for over two months now ...:\u201d In this letter, Foster also included suggestions for distributing the entire $17,000 between himself and the respondent\u2019s firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">On March 20, 1996, after learning that the respondent had already withdrawn the funds, Foster became upset and sent the respondent a letter detailing his concerns. Attorney Joseph Hoppock ultimately replaced the respondent as counsel for Foster and shortly thereafter, he learned of the withdrawals of the escrow account, Because the divorce decree required that the escrow funds be distributed between Foster and his ex-wife in equal shares, the superior court held a hearing on the handling of the escrow account. At the hearing, the respondent explained that she was entitled to withdraw all of the escrow funds because she believed they were subject to a set-off. The respondent also testified that she received a letter from Foster authorizing the withdrawal of funds from the escrow account dated March 13,1996, and that she received this letter \u201capproximately ten days <em>prior </em>to the escrow funds being removed from the account.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This letter, however, was written by Foster approximately three weeks <em>after </em>the funds had been withdrawn by the respondent. The attorneys present at the hearing immediately informed the judge that the respondent had actually received the letter ten days \u2022after withdrawing the escrow funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">In May and June 1998, the committee held .a hearing with regards to charges against the respondent concerning her handling of the escrow account and her testimony at the superior court hearing. The committee found that the respondent had violated Rules 1.15(a)(1) and 1.15(c) by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>withdrawing funds from the Foster account without the express or implied authority to do so, and in direct contradiction to the superior court\u2019s final divorce decree and the terms under which she had been appointed escrow agent. The committee further found that the respondent violated Rule 8.4(c) by making false statements of material fact to the superior court. Finally, the committee found these violations established a violation of Rule 8.4(a), which provides that professional misconduct occurs when a lawyer \u201cviolatefs] or attempt[s] to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct....\u201d N.H. R. PROF. CONDUCT 8.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">After holding a hearing, the referee determined that the respondent violated Rules 1.15(a)(1), 1.15(c) and 8.4(a), but found no violation of 8.4(c). The committee did not accept the referee\u2019s finding that the respondent did not violate Rule 8.4(c) and objected to the recommended sanction of suspension for six months. The respondent did not accept the referee\u2019s finding that she violated Rules 1.15(a)(1), 1.15(c), and 8.4(a) and also objected to the recommended sanction. The respondent further claimed that the referee\u2019s refusal to allow her \u201cto present her own, full testimony in her case\u201d violated her right to due process under the State and Federal Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">We first address the argument that the referee violated the respondent\u2019s due process rights by denying her the opportunity to retake the stand to offer \u201crebuttal\u201d testimony. We analyze her claim under the State Constitution first. <em>See State v. Ball, </em>124 N.H. 226, 231 (1983). \u201cBecause the State Constitution is at least as protective as its federal counterpart, we will not conduct a separate federal analysis but will cite federal law only as an analytical aid.\u201d <em>Chandler v. Bishop, </em>142 N.H. 404, 409 (1997) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">In order to establish a violation of Part I, Article 15 of the State Constitution, the respondent must show that the testimony she was precluded from introducing would have been material and favorable to her defense in ways not merely cumulative of other evidence. <em>State v. King, </em>146 N.H. 717, 720 (2001). After Attorney Charles Douglas testified, the respondent requested to retake the stand in order to rebut the \u201cnumerous flat out misstatements\u201d he made during his examination. Although the referee refused to allow the respondent to testify for the purpose of attacking Attorney Charles Douglas\u2019 credibility, the respondent was allowed t\u00f3 retake the stand in order to rebut his testimony pertaining to the escrow account. Because the respondent was not precluded from introducing evidence that was material and not merely cumulative, we hold that she was not denied due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>We turn next to the alleged error in the judicial referee\u2019s findings of facts. The standard of review for findings made by a judicial referee in attorney discipline hearings is whether a reasonable person could reach the sam\u00e9 decision as the referee based upon the evidence presented at the hearing. <em>Basbanes\u2019 Case, </em>141 N.H. 1, 4 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The committee maintains that the refer\u00e9e\u2019s finding that the respondent did not violate Rule 8.4(c) is not reasonable based on the evidence submitted at the \u25a0 hearing. Rule 8.4(c) provides: \u201cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to ... engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\u201d \u201cAn intentional misrepresentation requires a misstatement of fact for the purpose of inducing another to act or to refrain from action in reliance upon it.\u201d <em>Carpenito\u2019s Case, </em>189 N.H. 168, 174 (1994) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">In ruling that the respondent did not violate Rule 8.4(c), the referee stated that during the superior court hearing on the withdrawal of the escrow funds, the respondent incorrectly represented to the court that she was authorized by her client to withdraw funds from the escrow account. The referee did not find, however, that the respondent\u2019s representations were intentionally designed to mislead the court. As such, the referee concluded that the respondent did not violate Rule 8.4(c) by deliberately attempting to mislead the court or to induce it to act or refrain from acting in reliance oh the misrepresentations.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">We conclude that a reasonable person could have found that the respondent\u2019s conduct did not violate Rule 8.4(c). At the hearing before the judicial referee, the respondent explained that she may have referenced the wrong letter but that nonetheless, she had her client\u2019s authority to withdraw the funds and apply them to legal fees. She claimed that because she was not prepared to testify, she used the letter \u201con the spot\u201d and mistakenly believed that the March 13, 1996 letter authorized her to disburse the escrow funds in the manner in which she did. Although there is no doubt that the respondent incorrectly stated that the March 13,1996 letter authorized her to withdraw funds from the escrow account, the record is sufficient to support the referee\u2019s finding that the respondent\u2019s representations were not intentionally designed to mislead the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">The committee also maintains that regardless of the respondent\u2019s contention that she may have referenced the wrong letter, the respondent improperly represented to the superior court and the referee that she had her client\u2019s authorization to withdraw the escrow funds and apply them in full to legal fees. Thus, the committee contends that the respondent violated Rule 8.4(c) by representing that Foster authorized her to withdraw the escrow funds. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>A reasonable person could determine that the respondent did not testify that she had Foster\u2019s authority to withdraw the escrow funds in an attempt to convince the court that she was justified in taking the funds. The letter dated March 13, 1996, acknowledges that Foster and the respondent discussed closing the escrow account on several occasions. Thus, despite the fact that the referee ultimately determined that Foster did not authorize the withdrawal of the escrow funds, there is sufficient evidence to support a finding that the respondent may have erroneously believed that she was authorized by Foster to withdraw funds from the escrow account and therefore did not testify with the deliberate intent of misleading the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The respondent contends that the referee erred in finding that she violated Rules 1.15(a)(1) and 1.15(c). Rule 1.15(a)(1) provides that: \u201cProperty of clients or third persons which a lawyer is holding in the lawyer\u2019s possession in connection with a representation shall be held separate from the lawyer\u2019s own property. Funds shall be deposited in one or more clearly designated trust accounts____\u201d Rule 1.15(c) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-6\">When in the course of representation a lawyer is in possession of property in which both the lawyer and another person claim interests, the property shall be kept separate by the lawyer until there is an accounting and severance of their interests. If a dispute arises concerning their respective interests, the portion in dispute shall be kept separate by the lawyer until the dispute is resolved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Both of these rules require attorneys to deposit all cash property of clients in clearly designated separate trust accounts. <em>See Doherty\u2019s Case, </em>142 N.H. 446, 449 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">The referee found that the respondent \u201cdoes not deny that she removed the funds from escrow without either Court approval or consent of opposing counsel\u201d and that \u201c[s]he simply finds nothing wrong with her actions____\u201d Because there was a dispute as to whether Foster would be required to pay his ex-wife her portion of the escrow account, the respondent took the position that \u201csince Mr. Foster would have gotten the proceeds anyway, there was no real harm done by her withdrawal of the funds prematurely.\u201d The respondent also testified that because she knew well in advance that the financial matters would turn out as they eventually did, that fact alone should absolve her from fault. The referee disagreed and instead concluded that \u201c[i]t would be difficult to find a more clear violation of Rule 1.15(c).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Pursuant to Rule 1.15(c), whenever there is a dispute pertaining to funds in escrow, the portion in dispute must be kept separate until the dispute is resolved. Here, there was a dispute as to whether Foster should receive the entire amount of the escrow funds. Rather than leaving the funds in the escrow account until the dispute was resolved, the respondent withdrew the entire escrow account and applied them to Foster\u2019s legal fees. Because this conduct violates the express provision of Rule 1.15(c) requiring that attorneys keep the portion of funds in dispute separate until the dispute is resolved, we hold that a reasonable person could find, by clear and convincing evidence, that the respondent violated Rule 1.15(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">With regards to the respondent\u2019s violation of Rule 1.15(a)(1), the referee did not make any separate factual findings supporting his determination that the respondent violated this rule. The referee, however, granted the committee\u2019s request for a ruling of law that clear and convincing evidence existed that the respondent knowingly violated the express terms of the escrow account and therefore violated Rule 1.15(a)(1) because she \u201cwas fully aware of the terms and conditions of the escrow account and because she disbursed the entire amount of the escrow funds on February 23, 1996, prior to authorization by her client, and without providing any portion of said funds to Sally Foster.\u201d We agree with the referee\u2019s conclusion that by withdrawing the escrow funds without her client\u2019s permission and by failing to keep the funds segregated until an accounting occurred, the respondent violated Rule 1.15(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Finding no error in the referee\u2019s factual determinations, we now turn to the question of sanctions. The committee argues that a two-year suspension from the practice of law is appropriate. \u2018We retain the ultimate authority to determine the appropriate sanction for a violation of the rules governing attorney conduct.\u201d <em>Morgan\u2019s Case, </em>143 N.H. 475, 476-77 (1999). In exercising our authority, we are mindful that discipline is not intended as a mode of inflicting punishment for an offense, but rather \u201cthe purpose of the court\u2019s disciplinary power is to protect the public, maintain public confidence in the bar, preserve the integrity of the legal profession, and prevent similar conduct in the future.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 77 (quotations and brackets omitted). \u201cThe sanction we impose must be sufficient to satisfy these goals, and must take into account the severity of the misconduct and any mitigating circumstances disclosed by the record.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">In cases involving an attorney\u2019s misuse of client funds, we often take severe disciplinary action. <em>See Doherty\u2019s Case, </em>142 N.H. at 450. \u201cA lawyer\u2019s obligation to refrain, at the least, from misuse of a client\u2019s property must stand among the most insistent of professional norms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation and ellipses omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>The referee found by clear and convincing evidence that the respondent breached her fiduciary duty owed to her client. In recommending a sanction, the referee noted that the respondent improperly withdrew funds \u201cnot with any malicious intent to do wrong but rather under the Respondent\u2019s startlingly erroneous belief that her actions in doing so were not at all inappropriate.\u201d Consequently, the referee recommended that the respondent be suspended from practicing law for a period of six months or until she completed a course in ethics and in the study of the Rules of Professional Conduct, whichever period was longer.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">In arguing that the respondent should be suspended from practice for two years, the committee compares this case to <em>Nardi\u2019s Case, </em>142 N.H. 602 (1998), in which we disbarred an attorney for violating the terms of an escrow account and misleading a client. The committee maintains that the respondent\u2019s conduct \u201cgoes far beyond that involved in <em>Nardi\u2019s Case,\u201d </em>and that \u201cbased on the record, [the respondent\u2019s] conduct in this matter warrants, at the very least, a two-year suspension from the practice of law.\u201d We disagree that the respondent\u2019s conduct goes \u201cfar beyond that involved in <em>Nardi\u2019s Case.\u201d </em>In <em>Nardi\u2019s Case, </em>the attorney\u2019s ethical lapses were fundamental and stemmed from two completely separate transactions involving a violation of his escrow duties and making an intentional misrepresentation to a client. <em>See id. </em>at 605. In contrast, in this case it was determined that the respondent did not make any intentional misrepresentations and that her violations of the rules stemmed from her erroneous belief that she was authorized to withdraw the escrowed funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The respondent argues that the court does not have an adequate basis for imposing any sanction, and this case should be dismissed. The respondent contends that the committee\u2019s \u201cclaim that money was applied to legal fees without W. Foster\u2019s authorization is frivolous, specious and without merit\u201d and that she should not be subject to sanctions because Attorney Charles Douglas, her legal partner, ordered her to withdraw the funds. Even if the latter is true, the respondent is not freed from her responsibility. <em>See </em>N.H. R. PROF CONDUCT 5.2 (absolving a lawyer of responsibility only if \u201cthat lawyer acts in accordance with a supervisory lawyer\u2019s reasonable resolution of an arguable question of professional duty\u201d). Under the facts of this case, there was no \u201carguable question of professional duty\u201d because Rules 1.15(a)(1) and 1.15(c) clearly articulate that the funds should have been maintained in the escrow account.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">We conclude that the respondent\u2019s inability to comprehend that her conduct violated her ethical obligation to safeguard her client\u2019s funds mandates a sanction. Rule 1.15(a)(1) requires lawyers to safeguard the property of their clients and third persons and Rule 1.15(c) requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>lawyers to keep escrow funds separate until the resolution of a dispute. In this case, the respondent was the escrow agent of funds stemming from her client\u2019s divorce proceeding. Under the divorce decree, the respondent was explicitly required to disperse the funds equally between her client and his ex-wife. In light of the dispute concerning the entitlement of her client\u2019s ex-wife to the escrow funds, the respondent should have maintained the funds in the escrow account until resolution of the dispute. Instead, as the referee aptly stated, \u201c[T]he Respondent put her client\u2019s demands and her own wishes before her professional responsibilities.\u201d We agree with the referee\u2019s recommendation that the respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of six months, or until she can provide this court evidence that she has successfully completed a course in ethics and the understanding of the Rules of Professional Conduct, whichever is longer. Furthermore, the respondent shall have the right to resume the practice of law only upon compliance with all the terms and conditions of this order and pursuant to the procedure set forth in Supreme Court Rule 37(12) regarding reinstatement, which includes the requirement that the respondent produce evidence of satisfactory completion of the Multistate Professional Responsibility Examination. <em>See </em>Sup. Ct. R. 37(12)(e). The respondent shall also reimburse the committee for the costs and expenses of investigating and prosecuting this matter, properly apportioned to reflect that the committee was not successful on all of the violations it alleged. <em>See </em>Sup. Ct. R. 37(16). We remand to the referee to determine the costs awarded. <em>See Bruzga\u2019s Case, </em>145 N.H. 62, 73 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b582-6\">HOLLMAN and FITZGERALD, JJ., superior court justices, specially assigned under RSA 490:3, concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
