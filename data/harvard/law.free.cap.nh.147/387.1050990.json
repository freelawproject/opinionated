We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">In December 1999, the tenants filed a \u201cPetition Under RSA 540-A:4\u201d on a form provided by. the district court. In a section of the form that states: \u201cI complain that I am in immediate threat of irreparable harm because,\u201d the tenants wrote: \u201cMy landlord is in violation of the warranty of habitability pursuant to RSA 48-A:14.\u201d In a section of the form which states: \u201cI respectfully request these additional final orders,\u201d the tenants checked a box next to: \u201cFind that my landlord deprived me of quiet enjoyment of my property.\u201d Next to a checked box which states: \u201cAward damages to me in the amount of,\u201d the tenants wrote in \u201c$4,950.00.\u201d The tenants attached two pages' to the petition entitled \u201cContinuation of Petition under RSA 540-A:4.\u201d There the tenants set forth \u201cspecific facts ... giving rise to a violation of the warranty of habitability and thereby depriving the Tenants of quiet enjoyment of [leased] property.\u201d The tenants alleged in considerable detail rodent infestation, plumbing problems, electrical problems, a residual garbage problem, loose and falling ceiling plaster, leaking roofs and walls, and structural problems. They calculated their damages by estimating a twenty-five percent loss of use of the leased premises and multiplying that by the rent for three years resulting in total damages of $4,950.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The district court denied the landlord\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition and held an evidentiary hearing. The court subsequently issued an order stating that the tenants had made out a <em>prima facie </em>case of a violation of the warranty of habitability. The court also ruled that because \u201cRSA 540-A:4, VII(b) allows for damages for a breach of [the] warranty. of habitability or quiet enjoyment,... the statute could serve as a basis of an action alleging these violations.\u201d The court ruled that \u201cviolations of RSA 48-A:14; are incorporated into [RSA chapter 540-A], and [found] that violations of RSA 48-A:14 sections; I, rodents and insect infestation; II, defective plumbing; III, exposed wires; IV[,] roof leaks; V[,] falling plaster; VII[,] unsound structure; and XI, an improperly installed heating device were proven.\u201d As for damages the court found: \u201cNo actual monetary damages were proven. Thus the Court must rely on the minimum mandatory statutory damages established by RSA 358-A:10.\u201d The court ruled that the violations were willful for only a four-day period and assessed damages \u201cat the minimum statutory amount of $2000 per day for four days.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>On appeal, the landlord asserts the trial court erred because the tenants failed to prove sufficient facts to constitute a violation of RSA 540-A:2, and therefore they were not entitled to statutory damages under RSA 540-A:4, IX. The tenants argue, however, that the facts, asserted in their petition and later proved at the hearing, support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the landlord willfully breached their right to quiet enjoyment and therefore violated RSA 540-A:2.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">The trial court\u2019s interpretation of a statute is a question of law, which we review <em>de novo. Fichtner v. Pittsley, </em>146 N.H. 512, 514 (2001). The starting point in any statutory interpretation case is the language of the statute itself. <em>Kaplan v. Booth Creek Ski Group, </em>147 N.H. 202, 204 (2001). Where the language of a particular statutory provision is at issue, \u201cwe will focus on the statute as a whole, not on isolated words or phrases.\u201d <em>Snow v. American Morgan Horse Assoc., </em>141 N.H. 467, 471 (1996). \u201cWe will not consider what the legislature might have said or add words that the legislature did not include.\u201d <em>Milford Lumber Co. v. RCB Realty, </em>147 N.H. 15, 17 (2001) (quotation and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">RSA 540-A2 provides: \u201cNo landlord shall willfully violate a tenant\u2019s right to quiet enjoyment of his tenancy or attempt to circumvent lawful procedures for eviction pursuant to RSA 540.\u201d The statute does not further define \u201ca tenant\u2019s right to quiet enjoyment.\u201d The right to or covenant of quiet enjoyment is a common law doctrine that \u201cobligates the landlord to refrain from interferences with the tenant\u2019s possession during the tenancy.\u201d <em>Echo Consulting Services v. North Conway Bank, </em>140 N.H. 566, 568 (1995). In <em>Echo Consulting, </em>we held that a \u201cbreach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment occurs when the landlord substantially interferes with the tenant\u2019s beneficial use or enjoyment of the premises.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 571. Based upon this holding, which extends the covenant of quiet enjoyment beyond mere denial of actual possession, the tenants argue that the decrepit and unsanitary condition of the house interfered with their use and enjoyment of the property as their home, and thus their claim comes within the \u201cright to quiet enjoyment\u201d in RSA 540-A:2.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\"><em>Echo Consulting </em>involved a commercial lease. During the plaintiffs tenancy, the landlord undertook a yearlong project to renovate property adjoining the leased premises. <em>Echo Consulting, </em>140 N.H. at 567. The plaintiff, a business tenant, alleged the renovations caused occasional interruption of electrical service, made a parking lot inaccessible and, due in part to the bank\u2019s decision to install new door locks, made the tenant\u2019s access to the leased portion of the building \u201cobstructed and difficult at times.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The tenant argued that the landlord\u2019s actions obstructing access deprived it of beneficial use of the premises for its business, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>therefore constituted a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. We noted our agreement with those courts that \u201chave extended the covenant [of quiet enjoyment] beyond mere denial of actual possession\u201d and remanded the case for a determination of whether the landlord substantially interfered with the tenant\u2019s beneficial use of the premises. <em>Id. </em>at 572-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Here, the tenants asserted numerous violations of the statutory minimum housing standards that resulted in unhealthy and hazardous living conditions. Although the trial court specifically found that the tenants proved each of the violations, it denied the tenants\u2019 claim of twenty-five percent \u201closs of use of leased premises,\u201d a ruling not challenged on appeal. Therefore the tenants failed to prove any loss which interfered with their use of the leased premises. <em>Cf. Doe v. New Bedford Housing Authority, </em>630 N.E.2d 248, 255 (Mass. 1994) (holding loss of use of sidewalks, streets, parking lots and recreational areas constitutes substantial interference with beneficial use of apartment located in public housing project); <em>Reste Realty Corporation v. Cooper, </em>251 A.2d 268, 274-75 (N.J. 1969) (affirming trial court\u2019s finding that regular flooding that made it necessary for business tenant to move meetings to another site constituted breach of covenant of quiet enjoyment). Because the tenants failed to prove that the landlord substantially interfered with their beneficial use of the premises and thereby breached the covenant of quiet enjoyment, they failed to prove a claim under RSA 540-A-.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The trial court construed the right of quiet enjoyment under RSA 540-A:2 to include much, if not all, of what is included in the implied warranty of habitability. To affirm that ruling would be inconsistent with two other sections of RSA chapter 540-A.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">First, RSA 540-A:4, VII(b) expressly authorizes a court to award damages for \u201cviolations of RSA 540-A, [or a] breach of the warranty of habitability.\u201d The inclusion of both the statutory claims and the implied warranty of habitability in this section suggests that the legislature considered them to be different claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">Second, RSA 540-A:2 is entitled \u201cGeneral Prohibition.\u201d The next section, RSA 540-A:3, is entitled \u201cCertain Specific Acts Prohibited.\u201d The specific acts by a landlord prohibited are: (1) willfully interrupting or terminating a tenant\u2019s utility service, RSA 540-A:3, I; (2) willfully denying a tenant access to the leased premises, RSA 540-A:3, II; (3) willfully denying a tenant access to the tenant\u2019s own property, RSA 540-A:3, III; and (4) willfully entering the tenant\u2019s premises without the tenant\u2019s consent, RSA 540-A:3, IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>We ordinarily construe a general term in a statute in light of related, specific terms. <em>See, e.g., In re Justin D., </em>144 N.H. 450, 454 (1999); <em>see also State v. Wilson, </em>140 N.H. 44, 45 (1995) (\"General words in a statute that follow specific words . . . are construed to include only items of a similar character to the specific ones mentioned.\"). In RSA chapter 540-A, the enumeration of certain specific acts prohibited implies that the general prohibition should have a similar scope. The specific acts in RSA 540-A:3 are unlike the allegations in this case and more like the allegations in <em>Echo Consulting. </em>None of the specific acts in RSA 540-A:3 suggest that the right to quiet enjoyment under RSA 540-A:2 should be construed to include the tenants\u2019 claim in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\"> This, of course, does not mean that tenants whose premises are unsafe and unsanitary, and thus unfit for living, do not have a remedy. The implied warranty of habitability protects tenants against structural defects. <em>Walls v. Oxford Management Co., </em>137 N.H. 653, 661 (1993); <em>see also Doe, </em>630 N.E.2d at 253-54. A defect that renders premises unsafe or unsanitary, and thus unfit for living therein, constitutes a breach of the implied warranty of habitability. <em>Kline v. Burns, </em>111 N.H. 87, 93 (1971). Where, as here, a material or substantial breach of the implied warranty of habitability is found, \u201cthe measure of the tenant\u2019s damages is the difference between the agreed rent and the fair rental value of the premises as they were during their occupancy by the tenant in the unsafe, unsanitary or unfit condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 93-94; <em>see also </em>RSA 540-A:4, VII(b). In this case, however, the trial court found that there were no monetary damages. Although not mentioned by the district court in its order, the record shows that the tenants had already negotiated a reduction in their rent because of the condition of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Upon finding no monetary damages, the district court resorted to the liquidated damages provision in RSA 540-A:4, IX. Tenants may only be awarded remedies available under this section of the statute, however, when their landlord violates \u201cRSA 540-A:2 or any provision of RSA 540-A:3.\u201d RSA 540-A:4, IX. As noted above, the tenants\u2019 claim does not constitute a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment under RSA 54Q-A:2, and the tenants did not make a claim under RSA 540-A:3. Therefore, the remedies under RSA 540-A:4, IX are simply not available in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b427-8\">Brock, C.J., and Broderick, Nadeau and Dalianis, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
