We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">The defendant was convicted by a jury of aggravated felonious sexual assault and kidnapping. <em>See </em>RSA 682-A:2,1(a) (1996); RSA 633:1,1 (1996). We affirmed his convictions in <em>State v. Porter, </em>144 N.H. 96 (1999), but remanded to superior court for resentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 97,102.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">On remand, although the defendant was represented by counsel, he sought to vacate his sentence, secure a new trial, dismiss the kidnapping indictments, and set aside the jury verdicts through a series of <em>pro se </em>motions. The trial court declined to address the merits of these <em>pro se </em>motions because the defendant was represented by counsel. The court rejected the motions \u201cwithout prejudice to the defendant\u2019s ability to file such Motions or other posttrial [sic] motions as appropriate through counsel,\u201d stating that if the motions were presented by defense counsel, the court would address their merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">The trial court\u2019s decision not to rule upon the merits of the defendant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motions was a sustainable exercise of its discretion. <em>See State v. Lambert, </em>147 N.H. 295, 296 (2001). \u201cThe New Hampshire and Federal Constitutions guarantee a defendant facing criminal prosecution both the right to counsel and the right to proceed <em>pro se. </em>Yet these entitlements are antithetical, and the exercise of one right nullifies the other.\u201d <em>State v. Panzera, </em>139 N.H. 235, 237-38 (1994) (citations omitted). On remand, the defendant elected to be represented by counsel. Thus, the court\u2019s denial of his <em>pro se </em>motions, without prejudice to their being submitted by his counsel, was sustainable on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">Having concluded that the trial court\u2019s decision was appropriate, we decline to address the merits of the defendant\u2019s various <em>pro se </em>motions for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b534-12\">Broderick, Nadeau and Dalianis, JJ., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
