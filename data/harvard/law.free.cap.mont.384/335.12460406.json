Davis (Tidyman\u2019s I), </em>2014 MT 205, 376 Mont. 80, 330 P.3d 1139, we affirmed the District Court\u2019s finding that National Union Fire Insurance (NUFI) breached its duty to defend its insureds, Davis and Maxwell, but we reversed the District Court\u2019s approval of a stipulated settlement between Davis and Maxwell and Plaintiffs for $29 million. We remanded for a hearing on the reasonableness of the settlement amount. The District Court conducted a reasonableness hearing, and again approved the stipulated settlement. NUFI appeals. We remand for a second reasonableness hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in using a \u201creliable evidence\u201d test to assess the reasonableness of the stipulated judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b363-13\">\u00b64 Did the District Court err by not deducting from the $29 million judgment the amount paid out to ESOP participants following Tidyman\u2019s merger with SuperValu?</p>\n<p id=\"b363-14\">\u00b65 Did the District Court err in awarding prejudgment interest from January 4,2013?</p>\n<p id=\"b363-15\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b363-16\">\u00b66 This is the second time this case has come before us. We set forth the underlying facts in <em>Tidyman\u2019s I, </em>and we will not repeat them here. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>In <em>Tidyman\u2019s I, </em>we affirmed the District Court\u2019s finding that NUFI unjustifiably refused to defend its insured, Davis and Maxwell, and was therefore estopped from denying coverage. <em>Tidyman\u2019s </em>I, \u00b6 33. However, we reversed the District Court\u2019s entry of summary judgment to the extent it approved a stipulated judgment of $29 million, and remanded for the District Court to hold a hearing to assess the reasonableness of the settlement amount. <em>Tidyman\u2019s I, </em>\u00b6 44. On remand, we deferred to the District Court to set the parameters of the reasonableness hearing, and to determine whether and to what extent further discovery was warranted. <em>Tidyman\u2019s I, </em>\u00b6 44. We also instructed that the burden of establishing the unreasonableness of the stipulated judgment would rest with NUFI. <em>Tidyman\u2019s I, </em>\u00b6 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">\u00b67 The District Court determined that additional but limited discovery was necessary prior to a hearing on reasonableness, so it opened discovery for the narrow purpose of obtaining information regarding the reasonableness of the under lying judgment. The District Court then held a reasonableness hearing on January 28-30, 2015. F oil owing the hearing, the District Court concluded that \u201cMaxwell and Davis were justified in settling for the amount of $29 million based [on] their knowledge of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims and their exposure to financial ruin created by NUFI\u2019s failure to defend.\u201d The District Court therefore found that NUFI had not borne its burden to prove the stipulated judgment was unreasonable, and entered judgment against NUFI for $29 million. NUFI appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">\u00b68 This Court reviews de novo issues of law, including a district court\u2019s decision about which legal standard to apply in assessing the reasonableness of a stipulated judgment. <em>Tidyman\u2019s I, </em>\u00b6 13; <em>see e.g. Seltzer v. Morton, </em>2007 MT 62, \u00b6 152, 336 Mont. 225, 154 P.3d 561 (holding that we review de novo a district court\u2019s application of certain \u201cguideposts\u201d in assessing whether a jury\u2019s punitive damages verdict is \u201cgrossly excessive\u201d). The decision to grant or deny prejudgment interest is also reviewed de novo. <em>Tidyman\u2019s I, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">\u00b69 <em>Did the District Court err in using a \u201creliable evidence\u201d test to assess the reasonableness of the stipulated judgment </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">\u00b610 In <em>Tidyman\u2019s I, </em>we concluded that \u201cfurther consideration is necessary to determine whether the 29 million dollar stipulated settlement is reasonable, in light of the questions NUFI has raised.\u201d <em>Tidyman\u2019s I, </em>\u00b6 44. Among the questions raised by NUFI were whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>the $29 million figure was unreasonable \u201cbecause it was based only on unsworn opinions of experts whom plaintiffs retained and paid and who have never been cross-examined by [NUFI\u2019s] counsel\u201d (internal quotations omitted); because \u201cno buyer had been identified at the price TMSI\u2019s financial advisor, Zachary Scott, suggested the corporation might bring if sold to another chain\u2014the figure on which the 29 million dollars is based\u201d; because \u201cthe settlement amount is magnitudes greater than the amount for which the plaintiffs had settled with other directors and the amount the plaintiffs had offered Davis himself in settlement\u201d; and because \u201cthe plaintiffs\u2019 own numbers reveal that Zachary Scott opined that the value of the corporation as a standalone entity was 11 million dollars.\u201d <em>Tidyman\u2019s I, </em>\u00b6 42. With these questions in mind, we reversed the District Court\u2019s entry of summary judgment to the extent it approved of the $29 million sum, and remanded for a hearing focused on the reasonableness of the settlement amount. <em>Tidyman\u2019s I, </em>\u00b6 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">\u00b611 On remand, the District Court articulated its own subjective standard for assessing the reasonableness of the settlement amount:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS9j\">To determine whether the stipulated settlement is within the range of reasonableness, the Court has considered reasonableness from the perspective of the insured at the time of the stipulation, whether the information relied upon possessed sufficient indicia of reliability and whether the damages represented might naturally have been expected to result from the breach of the duty to defend.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Over the course of a three day hearing, the District Court received evidence and testimony from Plaintiffs and NUFI. Although the District Court allowed testimony from NUFI\u2019s expert that the stipulated settlement was not reasonable because it exceeded his assessment of the value of the company prior to the insurer\u2019s breach of the duty to defend, the District Court found that this perspective \u201cfail led I to account for the measure of damages for the breach of the duty to defend.\u201d The District Court, citing <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Freyer, </em>2013 MT 301, \u00b6 35, 372 Mont. 191, 312 P.3d 403, concluded that \u201c[wlhere an insurer has left its insured on its own to challenge liability, the insurer should not be able to reach back and interject itself in a controversy it has sidestepped to void a deal the insured has entered into to eliminate personal liability.\u201d Reasoning that NUFI had lost the right to litigate the merits of the underlying case, the court therefore largely precluded the parties from conducting discovery or introducing evidence on matters related to the merits of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>\u00b612 However, as NUFI argues on appeal, by failing to consider the merits and value of the underlying case in assessing the reasonableness of the settlement amount, the District Court failed to comply with our instructions on remand. Instead of considering the challenges to reasonableness raised by NUFI and highlighted in our opinion in <em>Tidyman\u2019s I, </em>the District Court based its conclusion that the settlement was reasonable on its assessment that \u201c[t]he materials relied up[on] by Plaintiffs and Maxwell and Davis possess sufficient indicia of reliability.\u201d We have previously stated that \u201c[t]he insurer, even when in breach of its obligations to its insured, is entitled to have the district court make a determination of the reasonableness of a settlement entered by the insured.\u201d <em>Abbey /Land LLC v. Interstate Mechanical, Inc., </em>2015 MT 77, \u00b6 12, 378 Mont. 372, 345 P.3d 1032 (citing <em>Tidyman\u2019s I, </em>\u00b6 41). The District Court did not actually assess the reasonableness of the settlement in this case, but rather sought to determine whether the $29 million amount had some grounding in reliable evidence from the perspective of Davis and Maxwell. We therefore remand this case for a second hearing on the reasonableness of the stipulated settlement. On remand, the District Court shall assess reasonableness using the standard set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">\u00b613 NUFI and amicus curiae Montana Defense Trial Lawyers urge this Court to announce a requirement that \u201cthe settlement amount be analyzed from the perspective of the <em>objective </em>merits of the case and not from the <em>subjective </em>perspective of whether the insured was justified in accepting a release of liability in exchange for whatever the plaintiff requested\u201d (emphasis in original). In support of this approach, NUFI cites cases from several of our sister states that analyze the merits of the underlying case, the plaintiff s theory of liability and damages, the strength of available defenses, and the risks and expenses to both parties of continued litigation in order to determine the reasonableness of a stipulated settlement amount. <em>See e.g. Bird v. Best Plumbing Grp., LLC, </em>287 P.3d 551, 556 (Wash. 2012); <em>Great Divide Ins. Co. v. Carpenter, </em>79 P.3d 599, 613 (Alaska 2003); <em>Himes v. Safeway Ins. Co., </em>66 P.3d 74, 85 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2003); <em>Associated Wholesale Grocers v. Americold Corp., </em>934 P.2d 65, 87 (Kan. 1997). However, none of the cases cited by NUFI involved an insurer\u2019s breach of the duty to defend its insured. NUFI is untroubled by this dissimilarity; according to NUFI, the fact that an insurer breached its duty to defend its insured is not relevant to an assessment of the value of the underlying case.</p>\n<p id=\"AdUP\">\u00b614 All parties agree that a reasonableness hearing should be conducted objectively from the point of view of a prudent person in the position of the insured defendant. <em>See e.g. Miller v. Shugart, </em>316 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>N.W.2d 729, 735 (Minn. 1982). But as Plaintiffs and amicus curiae Montana Trial Lawyers Association point out, in a case in which there has been a breach of the duty to defend, such a defendant is no longer an insured defendant and is faced with personal responsibility for a potentially very large sum. We agree with Plaintiffs that a breach of the duty to defend is a factor that a prudent person in the position of the defendant would consider when determining what settlement amount is acceptable to him or her. In other words, an objective standard of reasonableness should account for a prudent assessment of the merits and value of the plaintiffs case, but also for the position in which the defendant has been left following an insurer\u2019s breach of the duty to defend. No prudent defendant would fail to consider the latter circumstance. On the other hand, it should not be the court\u2019s objective to further punish the insurer for its failure to defend its insured. The insurer has already suffered the consequences of its failure to defend by having lost the right to invoke insurance contract defenses as well as the right to assert its policy limits.</p>\n<p id=\"AX5d\">\u00b615  On remand, the District Court shall employ an objective standard for assessing reasonableness. We borrow the Minnesota Supreme Court\u2019s articulation of such a standard\u2014\u201cThe test as to whether the settlement is reasonable and prudent is what a reasonably prudent person in the position of the defendant would have settled for on the merits of plaintiff s claim. This involves a consideration of the facts bearing on the liability and damage aspects of plaintiff s claim, as well as the risks of going to trial.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>316 N.W.2d at 735\u2014but we note that in cases such as the one before us, a \u201creasonably prudent person in the position of the defendant\u201d does not have the benefit of insurance coverage. Therefore, in assessing the reasonableness of a stipulated settlement when there has been a breach of the insurer\u2019s duty to defend, a district court should objectively consider both the merits of the underlying case and the value to a prudent uninsured defendant of confessing judgment in exchange for a covenant not to execute. If after applying this objective standard the District Court finds $29 million to be a reasonable settlement amount, it shall enter findings of fact establishing the reasonableness and judgment in favor of Plaintiffs for $29 million. If the District Court finds $29 million to be an unreasonable amount, it shall enter findings of fact and conclusions of law to that effect and reject the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">\u00b616 On a final note, although the District Court retains discretion to determine what evidence to admit or refuse in a reasonableness hearing, it cannot refuse to consider material and relevant evidence. <em>Cartwright v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc\u2019y of the United States, </em>276 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>Mont. 1, 19, 914 P.2d 976, 987-88 (1996) (citing M. R. Evid. 401, 402). We determined in <em>Tidyman\u2019s I </em>that the questions NUFI raised about the valuation of the corporation are relevant to an assessment of the reasonableness of the stipulated settlement, so the District Court should allow additional discovery on and consider such evidence during the second reasonableness hearing. <em>Tidyman\u2019s I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 42, 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">\u00b617 In his Dissent, Justice Wheat argues that remand for another reasonableness hearing is not necessary because the court listened to extensive testimony on the valuation of the company during the reasonableness hearing. It is true that NUFI presented such testimony, but the court rejected the valuation testimony offered by its witnesses because it \u201cfail[ed] to account for the measure of damages for the breach of duty to defend.\u201d Because we previously found that NUFI was estopped from denying coverage for unjustifiably refusing to defend its insureds, any measure of damages for breach of the duty to defend has no place in an ensuing reasonableness analysis. The court said it would consider reasonableness \u201cfrom the perspective of the insured at the time of the stipulation,\u201d and indeed, it was only such evidence to which the court gave credence. As noted in \u00b6 11 but sidestepped by both Dissents, the District Court concluded that NUFI had lost the right to litigate the merits of the underlying case. What we are directing the court to do on remand is determine value based both on an objective determination of where the stipulated settlement is within a reasonable range of what an arms\u2019-length negotiation would have produced and the value to a prudent uninsured defendant of confessing judgment. The court erred as a matter of law in subjectively considering valuation solely from the perspective of the uninsured defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\u00b618 <em>Did the District Court err by not deducting from the $29 million judgment the amount paid out to ESOP participants following Tidyman\u2019s merger with </em>SuperValu?</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">\u00b619 NUFI argues that the $29 million judgment is \u201cbased on impermissible double counting.\u201d Some retirees who retired after Tidyman\u2019s 1998 merger with SuperValu received payouts from the employee stock ownership plan (ESOP), and some of those retirees are now plaintiffs in this case. NUFI alleges that these retirees are \u201cdouble counting\u201d damages by accepting the ESOP payments and seeking damages in this case. NUFI argues that the $29 million judgment should be reduced by at least $7 million, the minimum amount paid out to ESOP participants after the merger. Plaintiffs counter that NUFI\u2019s argument is based upon a \u201cmischaracterization of the relationships between the parties and the different Tidyman\u2019s entities.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>According to Plaintiffs, $29 million is the amount of damage done by Davis and Maxwell to TMSI (the entity formed in the merger), and whether retirees are entitled to any of that money as employee owners of the company is a wholly separate issue governed by the terms of the ESOP and federal ERISA law. We agree with Plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">\u00b620 By definition, a stipulated or consent judgment is not a court\u2019s or a jury\u2019s calculation of actual damages to which individual plaintiffs are entitled, but rather the amount for which two parties have freely agreed to settle a claim. As we have said before, \u201c[a] consent judgment is \u2018a judgment, the provision and terms of which are settled and agreed to by the parties to the action.\u2019 A judgment by consent or stipulation of the parties is construed as a contract between them embodying the terms of the judgment. It operates to end all controversy between the parties, within the scope of the judgment.\u201dFirst Bank, <em>(N.A.) v. District Court for Fourth Judicial Dist., </em>226 Mont. 515, 523, 737 P.2d 1132, 1137 (1987) (quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th ed.) at 436); <em>see also Linder v. Missoula County, </em>251 Mont. 292, 296, 824 P.2d 1004, 1004 (1992). Indeed, this reality is one of the reasons courts conduct a reasonableness hearing in the case of a stipulated settlement: \u201cin these types of negotiations ... there is no assurance that the settlement represents a proper calculation of actual damages.\u201d <em>Tidyman\u2019s I, </em>\u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"AN-\">\u00b621  The $29 million judgment in this case is a stipulated judgment, freely agreed to by Davis and Maxwell and Plaintiffs, and approved by the District Court. While the stipulated judgment is subject to an overall reasonableness assessment, it was not the result of a precise damages calculation performed by the District Court, so it does not account for deductions, credits, or offsets claimed by the insurer but not stipulated to by both parties. The question is simply \u201cwhether the settlement amount stipulated to is reasonable.\u201d <em>Tidyman\u2019s I, </em>\u00b6 40. On remand, and after considering the valuation evidence presented, the District Court may decide to take into account the ESOP payouts in assessing the reasonableness of the settlement amount. However, because we are addressing a settlement here and not a trial recovery subject to statutory offsets, we conclude that the District Court did not err in declining to engage in the reductions and collateral source offsets urged by NUFI that are typical of post-trial adjustments in tort recovery actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">\u00b622 <em>Did the District Court err in awarding prejudgment interest from January 4, 2013?</em></p>\n<p id=\"AzQ\">\u00b623  We said in <em>Tidyman\u2019s I </em>that \u201cthe District Court correctly determined the plaintiffs were entitled to pre-judgment interest beginning on January 4,2013, when the court approved the stipulated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>settlement agreements and entered judgment in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor.\u201d <em>Tidyman\u2019s I, </em>\u00b6 53. Following our remand and the first reasonableness hearing, the District Court complied with our instructions and granted the Plaintiffs prejudgment interestfrom January 4,2013. However, we reached the conclusion that Plaintiffs were entitled to prejudgment interest from the day the $29 million stipulated settlement was approved even though we reversed the judgment approving the settlement amount and remanded the case for a reasonableness hearing. <em>Tidyman\u2019s I, </em>\u00b6 50. This was in error. Plaintiffs would have been entitled to postjudgment interest, not prejudgment interest, from the day the District Court approved the settlement, but only if we had affirmed the amount of the judgment. Section 25-9-205, MCA; M. R. App. P. 19(4); <em>Tipp v. Skjelset, </em>1998 MT 263, \u00b6\u00b6 16-19, 291 Mont. 288, 967 P.2d 787.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">\u00b624 We take this opportunity to clarify that Plaintiffs are not entitled to prejudgment interest from January 4, 2013, because interest accruing after that date\u2014the date of the court\u2019s judgment\u2014would by definition be postjudgment and not prejudgment interest. Rather, Plaintiffs may be entitled to postjudgment interest according to the instructions below.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">\u00b625 The Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure provide that \u201c[i]f a judgment for money in a civil case is affirmed, whatever interest is allowed by law shall be payable from the date the judgment was rendered or made in the district court,\u201d but if, as is the case here, \u201ca judgment is modified or reversed with a direction that a judgment for money be entered in the district court, the mandate shall contain instructions with respect to allowance of interest.\u201d M. R. App. P. 19(4). We have instructed before that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">In those cases in which a money judgment rendered in the district court is reversed, modified, or vacated on appeal, with the consequence that the district court is directed to enter an entirely new judgment no portion of which is discreetly identifiable from the original verdict or judgment, then interest on the new judgment shall begin to accrue only from the date the new judgment is entered on remand pursuant to this Court\u2019s direction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"asl-dedup-1\"><em>Woods v. Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co., </em>2004 MT 384, \u00b6 10, 325 Mont. 106, 104 P.3d 1045. Therefore, if following our remand and a second reasonableness hearing the District Court approves the stipulated settlement, Plaintiffs will be entitled to postjudgment interest from the day of the new judgment, but not from the days on which the District Court approved the settlement the first and second times. Plaintiffs are not entitled to prejudgment interest, and we and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>the District Court erred in so holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">\u00b626 For the foregoing reasons, we remand the case to the District Court for a second hearing to determine the reasonableness of Davis and Maxwell\u2019s decision to settle with the Plaintiffs for $29 million in exchange for a covenant not to execute.</p>\n<judges id=\"b371-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES McKINNON, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b371-7\">JUSTICE SHEA,</author>\n<p id=\"afs-dedup-0\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">\u00b627 I concur with the Court\u2019s disposition of Issues 2 and 3.1 also agree with the standard the Court establishes for assessing the reasonableness of a stipulated settlement when there has been a breach of the duty to defend. Opinion, \u00b6 15. However, I agree with Justice Wheat\u2019s observation that the standard the Court articulates here is only a slight degree of separation from the standard applied by the District Court in the first reasonableness hearing. I also disagree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that the District Court failed to consider the challenges to reasonableness raised by NUFI and highlighted in our opinion in <em>Tidyman\u2019s I. </em>Therefore, I dissent from the Court\u2019s conclusion on Issue 1 that this case should be remanded for a second reasonableness hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">\u00b628 The Court begins its analysis of Issue 1 by noting that in <em>Tidyman\u2019s I </em>we concluded that \u201cfurther consideration is necessary to determine whether the 29 million dollar stipulated settlement is reasonable, in light of the questions NUFI has raised.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 10 (quoting <em>Tidyman\u2019s I, </em>\u00b6 44). The Court then states that \u201cI i Instead of considering the challenges to reasonableness raised by NUFI and highlighted in our opinion in <em>Tidyman\u2019s I, </em>the District Court based its conclusion that the settlement was reasonable on its assessment that \u2018[t]he materials relied up[on] by Plaintiffs and Maxwell and Davis possess sufficient indicia of reliability.\u2019 \u201d Opinion, \u00b6 12. In fact, the District Court specifically noted its obligation to consider the reasonableness of the stipulated settlement in light of the challenges raised by NUFI and highlighted in <em>Tidyman\u2019s I, </em>4th Judicial Dist. Ct., Or., p. 4 (May 12, 2015) (hereinafter, \u201cOrder\u201d), and addressed those challenges in Findings of Fact 89 through 92, Order, pp. 39-42. I believe the Court\u2019s characterization of the District Court\u2019s reasonableness assessment gives short shrift to the work the District Court did in the first reasonableness hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">\u00b629 To the extent that the Court suggests that the standard applied by the District Court in the first reasonableness hearing was deficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>as compared to the standard the Court articulates in this Opinion, I submit the differences are, at most, semantic. In the first reasonableness hearing, the District Court applied the following standard for assessing the reasonableness of the settlement amount:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ9\">To determine whether the stipulated settlement is within the range of reasonableness, the Court has considered reasonableness from the perspective of the insured at the time of the stipulation, whether the information relied upon possessed sufficient indicia of reliability and whether the damages represented might naturally have been expected to result from the breach of the duty to defend.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Order, p. 7. The Court criticizes this standard as \u201csubjective\u201d and instructs the District Court to employ the following standard when conducting yet another reasonableness hearing on remand:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">[I]n assessing the reasonableness of a stipulated settlement when there has been a breach of the insurer\u2019s duty to defend, a district court should objectively consider both the merits of the underlying case and the value to a prudent uninsured defendant of confessing judgment in exchange for a covenant not to execute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">Opinion, \u00b6 15. A comparison of the two standards, however, evinces little, if any, substantive difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">\u00b630 Broken down to its discrete elements, the reasonableness standard the District Court applied in the first reasonableness hearing has three parts: (1) consider reasonableness from the perspective of the insured at the time of the stipulation; (2) assess whether the information relied upon in arriving at the stipulated settlement amount possessed sufficient indicia of reliability; and (3) determine whether the damages represented might naturally have been expected to result from the breach of the duty to defend. So how do these elements compare to the standard the Court instructs the District Court to apply in the second reasonableness hearing?</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">\u00b631 First, if considering reasonableness from the perspective of the insured at the time of the stipulation is a subjective standard, I fail to see how it is any more subjective than determining reasonableness by considering \u201cthe value to a prudent uninsured defendant of confessing judgment in exchange for a covenant not to execute,\u201d which is what the Court instructs the District Court to do in the second reasonableness hearing. The perspective that the District Court considered in the first reasonableness hearing was Maxwell and Davis\u2019s perspective as defendants who were left without \u201cthe benefit of insurance coverage\u201d due to NUFI\u2019s breach, a factor this Court says is an appropriate consideration, Opinion, \u00b6 15. The District Court considered Maxwell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>and Davis\u2019s perspective \u201cat the time of the stipulation,\u201d because that is the time when, to borrow the language the Court uses in the new standard, Maxwell and Davis \u201cconfessledl judgment in exchange for a covenant not to execute.\u201d I view these elements as substantively the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">\u00b632 Second, the District Court considered whether the information relied upon in arriving at the stipulated settlement possessed \u201csufficient indicia of reliability.\u201d Again, I view this as substantively the same as the Court\u2019s directive that the District Court should \u201cobjectively consider ... the merits of the underlying case.\u201d The information relied upon by the parties in arriving at the stipulated settlement included the merits of the underlying case, at least as those merits had been developed by the time Maxwell and Davis \u201cconfessl ed| judgment in exchange for a covenant not to execute.\u201d In that regard, it should be borne in mind that among the \u201cbenefitfs] of insurance coverage\u201d that Maxwell and Davis were denied because of NUFI\u2019s breach was the provision of defense costs necessary to develop the merits of the underlying case. Since NUFI\u2019s breach deprived Maxwell and Davis of the means and wherewithal to develop the merits of their defense, they had to play the cards they were dealt. Nevertheless, the District Court recognized that it would be unreasonable to allow Maxwell and Davis to just sign off on any amount in exchange for a covenant not to execute. This is why the District Court objectively evaluated the information upon which the settlement was based to confirm that it \u201cpossessed sufficient indicia of reliability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">\u00b633 Finally, the District Court assessed \u201cwhether the damages represented might naturally have been expected to result from the breach of the duty to defend.\u201d By incorporating this element into its reasonableness analysis, the District Court was merely incorporating the well-established principle that when an insurer breaches the duty to defend, it is liable for all damages flowing from the breach, including consequential damages, which we have defined as damages \u201csuch as might naturally be expected to result from\u201d the breach. <em>Freyer, </em>\u00b6 42 (quoting <em>Mont. Petroleum Tank Release Comp. Bd. v. Crumleys, </em>Inc., 2008 MT 2, \u00b6 64, 341 Mont. 33, 174 P.3d 948). This third element does not have a corollary requirement in the standard the Court instructs the District Court to use in the second reasonableness hearing. I would submit, therefore, that the District Court\u2019s incorporation of a consequential damages element if anything made the District Court\u2019s reasonableness standard more demanding than the standard it is now instructed to use in the second reasonableness hearing. Therefore, I cannot see how this provides a basis for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>\u00b634 After this matter was remanded the first time, the District Court followed our instructions and allowed additional discovery, conducted a three day reasonableness hearing, and then issued a thorough Order in which it answered the questions that were set forth in <em>Tidyman\u2019s I. </em>Now, the Court remands for a second reasonableness hearing with instructions to apply a standard I find to be either substantively the same as, or less stringent than, the standard the District Court applied during the first reasonableness hearing. Therefore I dissent as to the Court\u2019s resolution of Issue 1. I concur with the Court\u2019s resolution of Issues 2 and 3.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b374-4\">JUSTICE WHEAT,</author>\n<p id=\"A9P\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"anm-dedup-0\">\u00b635 I concur with the Court\u2019s disposition of Issues 2 and 3. However, I disagree with the Court\u2019s conclusion on Issue 1 that this case should be remanded for a second reasonableness hearing. In my opinion the Court is improperly interjecting its judgment in the place of the District Court by requesting the District Court repeat what has already been accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">\u00b636 In <em>Tidyman\u2019s I </em>we directed the District Court to conduct a \u201chearing focused on the reasonableness of the settlement amount,\u201d with the burden of establishing unreasonableness of the judgment on NUFI. <em>Tidyman\u2019s I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 44, 50. We directed the court to set the parameters of the hearing at its discretion as to the need for the further discovery of pertinent information related to the limited scope of the remand. <em>Tidyman\u2019s I, </em>\u00b6 44. The directive we gave to the District Court was to follow the mandate of \u00a7 27-1-302, MCA, that settlement amounts in civil cases must be reasonable. We were explicit and clear that in this case, where the insurer elected to deny coverage and breached its duty to defend its insureds, no further analysis of whether there was coverage under the policy was necessary or acceptable under the law. <em>Tidyman\u2019s I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 28, 30, 33. (\u201cIf we were to hold the District Court in error for failing to analyze coverage ... we would be providing insurers with an avenue to circumvent the clear requirement imposed by our precedent that where the insurer believes a policy exclusion applies, it should defend under a reservation of rights and seek a determination of coverage through a declaratory judgment action.\u201d <em>Tidyman\u2019s I, </em>\u00b6 28.) We determined that the District Court was obligated under the law to determine <em>only </em>the substantive reasonableness of the stipulated settlement amount <em>without </em>evaluating the underlying policy coverage or any inquiry into potential collusion, as we determined it did not exist in this case. <em>Tidyman\u2019s I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 28, 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\u00b637 The Court now articulates a standard borrowed from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Minnesota Supreme Court to be used in this case to determine whether a settlement amount is reasonable. Opinion, \u00b6 15. This standard includes the consideration of the liability and damage aspects of the Plaintiffs\u2019 case, including the risks of going to trial, and in this case, a consideration of the insurer\u2019s breach of its duty to defend its insureds. Opinion, \u00b6 15. Yet, we have already determined that the settlement should be given the presumption of reasonableness, and the burden is on defendant NUFI to show unreasonableness. <em>Tidyman\u2019s I, </em>\u00b6 41. The Court now asks the District Court to inquire into NUFI\u2019s questions of unreasonableness, which are almost exclusively based on issues involving the valuation of the corporation, under what it calls an objective standard when the court already conducted a three-day hearing and listened to testimony on those very issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">\u00b638 We have often repeated the maxim that district courts have broad discretion to make determinations related to evidence, which we rightfully review only for the abuse of this discretion. <em>Watkins v. Williams, </em>265 Mont. 306, 311, 877 P.2d 19, 21-22 (1994). The abuse of discretion inquiry is \u201cnot whether this Court would have reached the same decision, but, whether the district court acted <em>arbitrarily without conscientious judgment </em>or <em>exceeded the bounds of reason.\u201d Chipman v. Northwest Healthcare Corp., </em>2012 MT 242, \u00b6 17, 366 Mont. 450, 288 P.3d 193 (quoting <em>Newman v. Lichfield, </em>2012 MT 47, \u00b6 22, 364 Mont. 243, 272 P.3d 625) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">\u00b639 Even if an insurer breaches its duty to its insured, it is still entitled to have a district court make a determination of the reasonableness of a settlement; however the settlement is presumed to be reasonable <em>unless </em>the insurer is able to show evidence of the lack of reasonableness. <em>Abbey / Land LLC, </em>\u00b6 17; <em>Tidyman\u2019s I, </em>\u00b6 41. In this case, the District Court conducted a three-day hearing, and heard and evaluated the evidence presented by both sides. The evidence included testimony from various experts offered by both sides regarding the valuation of the company. NUFI has consistently argued that without a buyer the settlement amount in this case is a pie-in-the-sky scenario and therefore unreasonable. However, the court heard testimony that the existence of a buyer is not the determinative factor in the valuation of a company. The Plaintiffs presented evidence, NUFI presented evidence, and the court then evaluated the evidence to determine that NUFI did not meet its burden to overcome the presumption of reasonableness. But this Court is now asking the District Court to go back once again, sift through the same evidence and apply a new standard, which in my opinion in this case, is only a slight degree of separation from what the court has already done pursuant to our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>direction upon initial remand. Because this is a stipulated settlement the court has one of two options: accept or reject the settlement amount. Opinion, \u00b6 15. We have already determined that there is no proof of collusion between the Plaintiffs and Maxwell and Davis, and the record shows that the settlement amount was derived from the conservative end of an independent valuation of the company\u2014the assessment that was available to defendants Maxwell and Davis at the time of the settlement negotiations.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">\u00b640 The Court now requires the District Court to employ a new objective standard\u2014whether a reasonably prudent person in the position of the defendant would have settled, taking into consideration the liability and damage aspects of the claims, the risks of going to trial, and the lack of insurance coverage\u2014but to what end? Not to conduct a trial on the merits of Plaintiffs\u2019 claims and allow NUFI to reach back and interject itself into the litigation it chose to avoid when it left its insureds on their own to challenge the litigation, in direct contravention of our case law. <em>Farmers Union Mut. Ins. Co. v. Staples, </em>2004 MT 108, \u00b6 28, 321 Mont. 99, 90 P.3d 381. Nor to make a determination of fraud or collusion, in direct contravention of our findings in <em>Tidyman\u2019s I. </em>Nor to independently monetize each individual aspect of the considerations included in the objective standard, which would be an absurd and untenable exercise. NUFI was given the opportunity to provide its best evidence of the unreasonableness of the stipulated judgment and it simply failed to meet its burden. In my view the Court is in error by effectively interjecting its judgment into this case and allowing NUFI a second bite at the apple to attempt to substantiate the arguments it has already failed to adequately substantiate. I believe the Court has improperly lost sight of the settlement\u2019s presumption of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">\u00b641 The Court also indicates using the proposed objective standard will avoid further punishing the insurer for its failure to defend its insureds because the \u201cinsurer has already suffered the consequences of its failure to defend by having lost the right to invoke insurance contract defenses as well as the right to assert its policy limits.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 14. While I agree that the District Court should not seek to further punish NUFI, an additional consequence of its failure to defend Maxwell and Davis is the loss of its ability to negotiate the settlement at the time its insureds entered into a settlement agreement with the Plaintiffs. There is little doubt that if NUFI would have chosen differently and opted to defend Maxwell and Davis that the settlement negotiations would have ended with a different result. To that I reiterate the sentiment we <em>noted in Tidyman\u2019s I: so </em>what? Without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>collusive wrongdoing, the result is a consequence of NUFI\u2019s failure to defend its insureds. <em>Tidyman\u2019s I, </em>\u00b6 48.1 believe with this Opinion the Court is now allowing NUFI too great an opportunity to meddle in the settlement negotiations it was excluded from by its own choice. In my opinion, the District Court followed our directive in <em>Tidyman\u2019s I </em>to allow NUFI an opportunity to rebut the presumption of reasonableness of the stipulated judgment, where we explicitly allowed it to set the parameters of the hearing including conducting further discovery, and reached a conclusion that was neither arbitrary, nor exceeded the bounds of reason, and should be affirmed. <em>Tidyman\u2019s I, </em>\u00b6 44. It is the District Court\u2019s duty, not this Court\u2019s, to determine the facts, and weigh the credibility of the evidence presented before it to make reasoned findings and we should not supplant its judgment with our own. If the Court desires to adopt a new objective standard for district courts to apply in cases such as these, <em>at most </em>we should do so in this Opinion and find any error that occurred on remand to be harmless because the court did what we asked of it in <em>Tidyman\u2019s I </em>and the result did not create reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">\u00b642 For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s disposition of Issue 1 regarding the remand of this case for a second reasonableness hearing. I concur with the majority on Issues 2 and 3 of this Opinion. Therefore, I would affirm the District Court\u2019s order as to Issues 1 and 2.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
