Larry Reinlasoder (Reinlasoder) cross-appeals the District Court\u2019s grant of Colstrip\u2019s motion to amend the judgment. We reverse and remand for entry of judgment in favor of Colstrip, and do not reach the cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">\u00b62 Because it is dispositive, we address only the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Avn2\"><em>Did the District Court err by denying Colstrip\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law where Reinlasoder failed to contest that he had sexually harassed an </em>employee?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">\u00b63 \u201cYou ain\u2019t getting s\u2014 for Christmas! I\u2019ve just examined your computer and it\u2019s full of porn, you f--pervert,\u201d read a captioned picture of Santa Claus attached to a December 2007 office email from Reinlasoder, one of many instances of misconduct cited by Colstrip when it discharged Reinlasoder from his position as Colstrip\u2019s Chief of Police on May 22, 2012. Reinlasoder had held the position since May 17, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">\u00b64 Reinlasoder sued Colstrip for wrongful discharge. In defense, Colstrip contended it had fired Reinlasoder for good cause. Colstrip alleged numerous instances of misconduct by Reinlasoder that violated Colstrip\u2019s employment policy manual, including the December 2007 email, a September 2009 email which contained \u201cpornographic pictures of men and women in various stages of sexual intercourse,\u201d lying about his work history on his job application, an accusation of Criminal Mischief by the Rosebud County Sheriffs Office, insubordinate conduct, intimidating a female dispatcher to the point that she \u201cno longer [felt] comfortable in dispatch without someone else being present,\u201d and, finally, sexual harassment of a female dispatcher. Colstrip\u2019s notice and letter of termination given to Reinlasoder stated that he was \u201cin violation of the City\u2019s work environment-discrimination policy, in which the City will not tolerate verbal or physical conduct by any employee which harasses, discriminates, disrupts, or interferes with another employee\u2019s work performance or which creates an intimidating, offensive, or hostile environment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">\u00b65 At trial, Reinlasoder introduced a letter from Mercedes Kroll (Kroll), a Colstrip dispatcher, to Mayor Rose Hanser (Hanser). The letter complained about statements Reinlasoder had made to Kroll. The letter stated that Reinlasoder had asked Kroll, \u201cDo you want to come see my porn in my office?\u201d When Kroll declined the invitation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Reinlasoder responded, \u201cYou look like a freaky kind of girl that would like porn.\u201d When called to testify at trial, Kroll reiterated the incident as stated in the letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">\u00b66 Reinlasoder introduced a second document that corroborated Kroll\u2019s version of this event. The second document was a witness statement written by Officer Cory Hert (Hert). Hert stated he was present during the incident in question, and that Reinlasoder had asked Kroll, \u201cWould you like me to send you some of my internet porn? You look like you would enjoy it; you\u2019re kind of freaky that way, aren\u2019t you?\u201d When called to testify, Hert reiterated the incident as stated in his statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">\u00b67 Officer Michael Hayes\u2019 (Hayes) video deposition was then introduced. Hayes witnessed the incident between Reinlasoder and Kroll. Hayes testified that he \u201coverheard [Reinlasoder] saying that [Kroll] looked like the freaky kind of girl and that she might enjoy watching pornography with him. He had invited her to go back to his office to watch pornography on his computer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">\u00b68 When asked what he thought about the allegations, Reinlasoder believed he \u201cmay have said something,\u201d but couldn\u2019t \u201crecall making that statement\u201d because he \u201c[didn\u2019t] remember.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">\u00b69 On cross-examination, Kroll admitted she had originally stated in her deposition that the incident occurred on February 29, 2012, but that her written statement asserted it occurred on March 6, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"ARp\">\u00b610 Colstrip moved for judgment as a matter of law, pursuant to Montana Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a), at the close of Reinlasoder\u2019s case. Colstrip argued Reinlasoder\u2019s uncontested sexual harassment of Kroll constituted good cause for termination as a matter of law. The District Court denied the motion. The jury returned a verdict for Reinlasoder, awarding him $300,000 in damages. Colstrip made a renewed motion for a judgment as a matter of law, pursuant to Montana Rule of Civil Procedure 50(b), which the District Court also denied. The District Court granted Colstrip\u2019s motion to amend the judgment, offsetting unemployment benefits received by Reinloasoder in the amount of $12,068 from the jury\u2019s award.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">\u00b611 Sometime before trial, Kroll filed a complaint with the Human Rights Bureau against Colstrip for Reinlasoder\u2019s sexual harassment. After the Human Rights Bureau found reasonable cause to move forward with Kroll\u2019s complaint, Kroll and Colstrip settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">\u00b612 We review the denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law de novo. <em>Johnson v. Costco Wholesale, </em>2007 MT 43, \u00b6 18, 336 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>105, 152 P.3d 727. Judgment as a matter of law is properly granted only when there is a complete absence of any evidence which would justify submitting an issue to a jury. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 13. All such evidence and any legitimate inferences that might be drawn from the evidence must be considered in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 13. However, mere denial or speculation does not create an issue of fact. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 28. Judgment as a matter of law is not proper if reasonable persons could differ regarding conclusions that could be drawn from the evidence. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">\u00b613 <em>Did the District Court err by denying Colstrip\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law where Reinlasoder failed to contest that he had sexually harassed an </em>employee?</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">\u00b614 Sections 39-2-901 through -915, MCA, set forth the provisions of the \u201cWrongful Discharge From Employment Act.\u201d A discharge is wrongful if it is not for good cause. Section 39-2-904(l)(b), MCA. \u201cGood cause\u201d is defined as \u201creasonable job-related grounds for dismissal based on a failure to satisfactorily perform job duties, disruption of the employer\u2019s operation, or other legitimate business reason.\u201d Section 39-2-903(5), MCA. We have defined \u201ca legitimate business reason\u201d as a reason that is not false, whimsical, arbitrary, or capricious, and one that must have some logical relationship to the needs of the business. <em>Davis v. State, </em>2015 MT 264, \u00b6 10, 381 Mont. 59, 357 P.3d 320 (citing <em>Buck v. Billings Mont. Chevrolet, </em>248 Mont. 276, 281-82, 811 P.2d 537, 540 (1991)). In applying this definition we have stressed the importance of the \u201cright of an employer to exercise discretion over who it will employ and keep in employment.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 10 (internal quotation and citation omitted). The balance between the employer\u2019s discretion and \u201cthe employee\u2019s equally legitimate right to secure employment... should favor an employee who presents evidence, and not mere speculation or denial, upon which a jury could determine that the reasons given for his termination were false, arbitrary or capricious, and unrelated to the needs of the business.\u201d <em>Kestell v. Heritage Health Care Corp., </em>259 Mont. 518, 526, 858 P.2d 3, 8 (1993). We have explained that an employer\u2019s discretion is at its greatest when the discharged employee is in a management position. <em>Sullivan v. Cont\u2019l Constr. of Mont., LLC, </em>2013 MT 106, \u00b6 18, 370 Mont. 8, 299 P.3d 832. A chief of police is responsible for managing an entire police department. Section 7-32-4105, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">\u00b615 At trial, Reinlasoder factually contested many of Colstrip\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>allegations. However, such factual disputes do not render judgment as a matter of law inappropriate where there are facts not in dispute that provide \u201cgood cause\u201d for discharge from employment. <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 14. Kroll\u2019s testimony, corroborated by two other officers, established she was sexually harassed by Reinlasoder when, in the workplace, he invited her to view pornography with him because he thought she looked like \u201ca freaky kind of girl that would like porn.\u201d When Reinlasoder was given the opportunity to deny that this sexual harassment took place, he repeatedly stated he \u201ccould not recall.\u201d Reinlasoder\u2019s equivocation does not create a material issue of fact. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">\u00b616 In his briefing, Reinlasoder argues that his cross-examination of Kroll created a material issue of fact with regard to the sexual harassment incident. First, Reinlasoder argues Kroll stated in her deposition that the incident occurred on February 29th, but her letter stated it occurred on March 6th. However, Reinlasoder fails to articulate how this inconsistency created an issue of material fact. The crucial material fact was whether Reinlasoder made the comments to Kroll. Reinlasoder\u2019s questions on cross-examination did not dispute that the sexual harassment occurred, but only whether it occurred on February 29th or March 6th.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">\u00b617 Second, Reinlasoder argues that, while Kroll testified the Human Rights Bureau found reasonable cause to proceed with Kroll\u2019s complaint, the complaint had nonetheless been settled before it was adjudicated in a hearing. Again, Reinlasoder fails to articulate how this testimony created an issue of material fact about the harassment incident. That the Human Rights Bureau was precluded by settlement from determining in its process whether Reinlasoder had committed sexual harassment does not contradict the testimony of Kroll, Hert, and Hayes that the incident actually occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"aqu-dedup-0\">\u00b618  The uncontested evidence showed Reinlasoder sexually harassed Kroll. Reinlasoder failed to meet his burden of presenting evidence, \u201cand not mere speculation,\u201d <em>Kestell, </em>259 Mont. at 526, 858 P.2d at 8, contesting the allegation. Sexual harassment is unquestionably a \u201clegitimate business reason\u201d or \u201creasonable job-related grounds for dismissal\u201d that satisfies the \u201cgood cause\u201d standard contained in \u00a7 39-2-903(5), MCA. <em>See Barbara Foster v. Albertson\u2019s, </em>Inc., 254 Mont. 117, 127, 835 P.2d 720, 726 (1992) (\u201cSexual harassment is against public policy.\u201d). Judgment as a matter of law was therefore appropriate because the undisputed facts precluded Reinlasoder from establishing the crucial element of his wrongful discharge claim, an absence of \u201cgood cause.\u201d <em>Davis, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>\u00b619 The amended judgment is reversed and this matter is remanded for entry of judgment in favor of Colstrip.</p>\n<judges id=\"b174-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, McKINNON and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
