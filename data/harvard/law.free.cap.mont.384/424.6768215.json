Weisbarth argues that he is entitled to a new trial based on the State\u2019s failure to disclose T.W.\u2019s medical records. We agree. The State obtained T.W.\u2019s medical records and then failed to disclose those records to the defense. The medical records contained evidence that was clearly favorable to the defense, and the withheld evidence places the trial in such a different light that it undermines our confidence in the jury\u2019s verdict.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether Weisbarth is entitled to a new trial based on the State\u2019s failure to disclose T.W.\u2019s medical records.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">\u00b63 David Weisbarth is the birth father of T.W. Since age three, T.W. has resided with her maternal grandfather Roy, who is her permanent guardian. Sometime between October 23, 2012, and December 13, 2012, when T.W. was five years old, Roy took T.W. to visit Weisbarth at his apartment in Great Falls. Soon after visiting her father, T.W. reported to law enforcement that Weisbarth had sexually abused her in his bathroom. T.W. alleged that Weisbarth took her into the bathroom and \u201call of [a] sudden started touching my private parts with his fingers.\u201d As relevant to the defense\u2019s trial strategy, prior to T.W.\u2019s allegation of sexual abuse, she was diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder. In an attempt to treat her disorder, T.W. has seen a number of medical professionals, including two child specialists: Dr. Thomas Krajacich, a neuropsychologist, who started treating T.W. in early 2010; and Dr. Melinda Pike, a child psychiatrist, who began treating T.W. the following year.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">\u00b64 On February 7,2013, the State charged Weisbarth by Information with one count of felony incest in violation of \u00a7 45-5-507, MCA. On April 1, 2014, Weisbarth provided notice to the State that he intended to call Dr. Donna Veraldi, a child psychologist, as an expert witness to testify about reactive attachment disorder and its possible effects on a child\u2019s behavior \u2014 in particular, its tendency to affect a child\u2019s propensity for truthfulness. The State filed a motion to exclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Veraldi\u2019s testimony, reasoning that Veraldi did not have a basis to testify about T.W.\u2019s disorder because Veraldi had not reviewed T.W.\u2019s medical records. In response, Weisbarth filed a motion to compel the State to produce T.W.\u2019s medical records so Veraldi could form a basis to testify as to T.W.\u2019s specific ailments. The District Court permitted Veraldi to testify and granted Weisbarth\u2019s motion. The court ordered that the State produce the medical records directly to Weisbarth.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\u00b65 On May 15, 2014, four days prior to the start of trial, the State filed a motion for an in camera inspection of T.W.\u2019s medical records.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The prosecutor represented to the court and defense counsel that she had reviewed the records, but expressed concern that T.W.\u2019s \u201cprivacy rights have been implicated, such that the State does not feel comfortable\u201d producing the medical records to the defense without the District Court reviewing the records <em>in camera. </em>The prosecutor did not alert the court or defense counsel that the records contained exculpatory evidence. Instead, the prosecutor stated that the information about T.W. was \u201cintertwined with a multitude of other information, which the State does not believe to be discoverable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">\u00b66 The next day, on May 16,2014, the State filed a motion to seal the medical records. The prosecutor acknowledged that, given the proximity to the start of trial, her request for an <em>in camera </em>inspection was not possible. The State then sent a heavily redacted copy of the medical records to Weisbarth. The State explained that it \u201credacted the medical records, in light of the victim\u2019s privacy interest, so that they are limited to the diagnosis of Reactive Attachment Disorder, the date, and the likely cause.\u201d As a result, the redacted medical records provided to Weisbarth consisted of a single sentence from a three-page report written by Krajacich. The portion of Krajacich\u2019s report provided to the defense stated, in its entirety: \u201cWe will go slowly with differential diagnoses; but at this time, I am convinced this young girl has reactive attachment disorder most likely based on early neglect or even possible abuse.\u201d The District Court granted the State\u2019s motion to seal the medical records, without ever viewing the records in chambers. The State did not inform the defense or the District Court at any subsequent time that exculpatory information existed in the medical records.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">\u00b67 On May 19, 2014, the matter proceeded to trial. The only direct evidence presented by the State against Weisbarth was T.W.\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>testimony. T.W. testified that during a visit to Weisbarth\u2019s apartment, he pulled down her pants and his pants; touched her private parts; and asked her to touch his private parts, but she refused. The State presented little circumstantial evidence in support of T.W.\u2019s testimony. Dr. Nancy Maynard, who examined T.W. after the alleged incident, testified that there were no physical signs of abuse. Dr. Robert Page, a child psychologist, who reviewed a videotaped interview of T.W., testified that some aspects of T.W.\u2019s disclosure were reliable, some aspects were unreliable, and T.W.\u2019s disclosure was probably more consistent with an actual event. Roy testified that Krajacich indicated to him that T.W.\u2019s disorder was relatively mild. Roy further testified that T.W. was \u201cdoing super\u201d prior to the alleged incident and her counselor had indicated that T.W.\u2019s disorder was not having a substantial impact on her behavior. Veraldi testified for the defense. The defense attempted to use Dr. Veraldi\u2019s testimony to attack T.W.\u2019s credibility. Veraldi testified that frequently reactive attachment disorder manifests itself in behavioral issues such as lying. During cross-examination, however, the prosecutor effectively contested Veraldi\u2019s testimony. The prosecutor elicited from Veraldi that not all children diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder lie or fabricate information; that Veraldi had not actually evaluated T.W.; and that Veraldi had, in fact, little basis to conclude that in T.W.\u2019s case her disorder manifests itself through lying or causes her to fabricate information.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">\u00b68 In her closing argument, the prosecutor emphasized that T.W. was in a \u201cstable and loving home\u201d at the time of the alleged incident and T.W.\u2019s disorder was simply a \u201cred herring\u201d manufactured by the defense to distract from Weisbarth\u2019s culpability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">The Defense wants to attack her. She\u2019s an angry child with reactive attachment disorder. Cannottell the truth.... Dr. Veraldi, what assistance did she give you with that? Nothing. She told you that children with reactive attachment disorder can have a propensity to be [un]truthful. She\u2019s never evaluated this victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">And think about this, ladies and gentleman, when you\u2019re evaluating [T.W.], what motive does she have to lie? ... She was safe. [Roy] had permanent guardianship. She was home. She had no reason to fabricate this abuse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">The prosecutor further emphasized throughout her closing argument the lack of evidence that T.W.\u2019s disorder manifests itself through lying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWYh\">I think what\u2019s telling, ladies and gentlemen, is Defense Counsel wants you to think that [T.W.] was lying, that she has reactive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>attachment disorder and was lying. There\u2019s no evidence to suggest that [T.W.] exhibited any symptoms of lying. The only person, in fact, that tells you that she was lying was the Defendant. He has to have you believe she was lying, but there\u2019s no evidence to support that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">\u00b69 The jury found Weisbarth guilty of felony incest. The District Court sentenced Weisbarth to 100 years in the Montana State Prison, with 50 years suspended and no parole eligibility for the first 25 years. \u00b610 After the conclusion of trial, Weisbarth was able to gain access to the sealed medical records. The medical records provided evidence that T.W. suffers from psychosis; that T.W.\u2019s disorder manifests itself through lying; that T.W.\u2019s living situation at the time of the alleged incident was unstable and may have caused her symptoms to worsen; that Roy reduced T.W.\u2019s medication below the recommended therapeutic levels around the time of the alleged incident; and that T.W. may have previously made and then recanted an allegation of sexual abuse against her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">\n<em>Evidence of Psychosis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">\u00b611 The State redacted information in the medical records showing T.W.\u2019s disorder causes her at times to lose contact with reality. The medical records show Krajacich diagnosed T.W. with \u201cpsychotic intrusions\u201d in the spring of 2011. Krajacich noted T.W. suffers from \u201ccommand hallucinations\u201d in which various figures \u2014 including her teddy bear, Sponge Bob, and her step-brother \u2014 tell her to do inappropriate things. Krajacich noted that, while not conclusive, the results of his testing suggest a \u201cbreakdown in reality.\u201d Krajacich believed T.W.\u2019s condition was so severe that he considered whether she should be placed in a children\u2019s hospital for \u201cpsychiatry\u201d services, potentially Intermountain Children\u2019s Hospital in Helena or a similar specialized program or in Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">\u00b612 The medical records also reveal that Pike confirmed Krajacich\u2019s initial diagnosis. The medical records show Pike prescribed 2 milligrams of Intuniv to treat T.W.\u2019s mood disorder in February 2011, and approximately six months before the alleged incident, in March 2011, Pike considered prescribing antipsychotic medication to T.W., noting that the medication may be necessary if T.W. continued to suffer from psychotic symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">\n<em>Evidence of Lying</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">\u00b613 The State redacted information in the medical records showing T.W.\u2019s disorder manifests itself through lying. Krajacich noted that T.W. is very smart but, as a result of her disorder, \u201cstruggle[s] enormously with behavioral issues.\u201d Krajacich reported that her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>grandparents complained of terrible deceptive behavior, that \u201cshe lies about a number of things,\u201d and that she \u201cmake[s] stuff up on the spot.\u201d Pike similarly explained T.W.\u2019s disord\u00e9r manifests itself through lying, noting that T.W. \u201clies a lot of the time\u201d and has \u201cproblems with lying.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">\n<em>T.W.\u2019s Tumultuous Life Circumstances</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AK4\">\u00b614 The State redacted information in the medical records showing T.W.\u2019s living situation was unstable and may have worsened her symptoms. Pike noted that, in September 2011 \u2014 around the time of the alleged incident \u2014 T.W.\u2019s step-grandmother, Gina, was divorcing Roy after seven and one-half years of marriage. Pike noted that Gina had kicked Roy and T.W. out of the family home; Gina was afraid Roy was going to kill her; and Roy and T.W. had been forced to live in a fifth-wheel RV trailer. Dr. Pike further noted that, in the midst of all this, T.W.\u2019s German shepherd had died. The medical records reveal that Pike was seriously concerned T.W.\u2019s tumultuous life circumstances may cause her symptoms to worsen. Pike noted \u201cthe current circumstances could potentially be fairly stressful for [T.W.] and further her fears of abandonment and attachment problems.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\n<em>Medication</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">\u00b615 The State redacted information in the medical records showing Roy began reducing T.W.\u2019s medication below therapeutic levels around the time of the alleged incident without approval from Pike. Pike noted that, sometime before March 2013, Roy started reducing T.W.\u2019s Intuniv dosage. According to the medical records, Roy believed that the medication was making T.W. drowsy so he reduced her Intuniv dosage by half, giving her 1 milligram per day instead of the prescribed 2 milligrams. After learning that Roy was reducing T.W.\u2019s dosage, Pike admonished Roy for doing so and warned him against altering T.W.\u2019s medication again in the future. Pike explained to Roy that \u201ccutting it in half can destroy the long term effects\u201d of the medication. Roy later acknowledged to Dr. Pike that T.W. needs the full 2 milligrams because \u201canything less does not work\u201d and \u201cthere are problems when she is not taking it\u201d as prescribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">\n<em>False Accusation of Sexual Abuse</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">\u00b616 Finally, the State redacted information in the medical records regarding a potential allegation of sexual abuse. Krajacich noted that T.W. had a few overnight visits with her mother and her mother\u2019s boyfriend. Krajacich\u2019s report states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-9\">The first overnight visit seemed to go fairly well, but the second visit seemed to be more difficult for [T.W.]. She claimed that she h\u00e1d seen sexual behavior between mother and [boyfriend], and Roy and Gina are really suspicious about whether that is really a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>real observation versus \u201csomething pretend.\u201d <em>[T.W.] initially said that something happened to her also, but again, she then backed away from that later. </em>Therefore, they are not really sure what has gone on.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">(Italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">\u00b617 After obtaining T.W.\u2019s medical records, Weisbarth appealed his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">\u00b618 <em>Brady </em>claims not contained within the trial record are reviewed under the plain error authority of \u00a7 46-20-701(2)(b), MCA. <em>State v. Ellison, </em>2012 MT 50, \u00b6 12, 364 Mont. 276, 272 P.3d 646. A motion to dismiss charges based on the State\u2019s suppression of exculpatory evidence is a question of law. <em>State v. Duncan, </em>2008 MT 148, \u00b6 17, 343 Mont. 220, 183 P.3d 111. We review conclusions of law for correctness. <em>Valley Bank v. Hughes, </em>2006 MT 285, \u00b6 15, 334 Mont. 335, 147 P.3d 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">\u00b619 <em>Whether Weibarth is entitled to a new trial based on the State\u2019s failure to disclose T.W.\u2019s medical records.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">\u00b620 Weisbarth argues that the State\u2019s suppression of the medical records violated his right to due process. He maintains that the records clearly contained evidence favorable to his defense and prejudice ensued from the State\u2019s failure to disclose the medical records. Under the landmark case of <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, (1963), the prosecution is constitutionally obligated to provide any exculpatory or impeachment evidence in its possession to the defense. We have explained that a party seeking to establish a <em>Brady </em>violation must establish: (1) the State possessed evidence, including impeachment evidence, favorable to the defense; (2) the prosecution suppressed the favorable evidence; and (3) had the evidence been disclosed, a reasonable probability exists that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different. <em>McGarvey v. State, </em>2014 MT 189, \u00b6 16,375 Mont. 495, 329 P.3d 576. We have further explained that even if the foregoing elements are satisfied, there is no <em>Brady </em>violation if the petitioner could have obtained the exculpatory evidence with reasonable diligence. <em>McGarvey, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">\n<em>I. Favorable Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b456-12\">\u00b621 We agree with Weisbarth that the medical records contained evidence favorable to his defense. Athough the evidence differs in kind, it all shares a common feature: it impugns T.W.\u2019s credibility. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Clearly, all of the evidence in the medical records concerning T.W.\u2019s mental health casts doubt on T.W.\u2019s ability to credibly recall the alleged incident. This is \u201cclassic impeachment evidence.\u201d <em>Browning v. Trammell, </em>717 F.3d 1092, 1105 (10th Cir. 2013). \u201cA witness\u2019s credibility may always be attacked by showing that his or her capacity to observe, remember, or narrate is impaired.\u201d <em>Browning, </em>717 F.3d at 1105 (citing 4 Jack B. Weinstein &amp; Margaret A. Berger, Weinstein\u2019s Federal Evidence \u00a7 607.05[1] (Joseph M. McLaughlin ed., 2d ed. 2014)). The evidence of T.W.\u2019s problems with lying was valuable to the defense for impeachment purposes. While under M. R. Evid. 403, a court may exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, needless presentation of cumulative evidence, waste of time, undue delay, or misleading the jury, it is well-settled law that evidence of a witness having previously lied is favorable evidence that the defense may use for impeachment purposes absent a determination of inadmissibility pursuant to Rule 403. <em>See State v. Passmore, </em>2010 MT 34, 355 Mont. 187, 225 P.3d 1229. Thus, the evidence of T.W.\u2019s mental health and the related evidence of T.W.\u2019s problems with lying were favorable evidence for the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">\u00b622 The evidence of the prior accusation of sexual abuse, however, presents a more difficult question because of the potentiality of invoking Montana\u2019s Rape Shield Statute, \u00a745-5-511, MCA, <em>et seq. </em>Krajacich\u2019s report documented the potential prior accusation of sexual abuse. We have recognized that a complaining witness\u2019s prior false accusation of a sexual offense \u201cmay often be probative of the complaining witness\u2019 specific reputation for untruthfulness.\u201d <em>State v. Anderson, </em>211 Mont. 272, 283, 686 P.2d 193, 199 (1984). However, such evidence is admissible only if the accusation has been \u201cproven or admitted to be false.\u201d <em>State v. Ring, </em>2014 MT 49, \u00b6 17, 374 Mont. 109, 321 P.3d 800. In order to establish whether a contention is false, we require the trial court to conduct a separate hearing outside of the jury\u2019s presence. <em>Ring, </em>\u00b6 17. The hearing must address whether it is proper to question the witness regarding a previous accusation, as well as the admissibility of corroborating evidence. <em>Ring, </em>\u00b6 18. Here, because the State failed to disclose to the defense T.W.\u2019s prior accusation, the defense was unaware and thus unable to initiate the process set forth above to obtain a determination of whether the accusation was admissible. The defense, through the State\u2019s actions, was prevented from obtaining a judicial ruling regarding whether the accusation was proven or admitted to be false and whether any corroborating evidence may have been admissible. Further, without the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>benefit of the requisite hearing and further evidence presented, this Court is unable to review on appeal whether Krajacich\u2019s report documenting the prior accusation of sexual abuse was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"AHT\">\u00b623 The State argues that inadmissibility of the evidence is dispositive in determining whether the evidence should have been disclosed under <em>Brady. </em>The State reasons, that for purposes of <em>Brady, </em>inadmissible evidence cannot be considered favorable evidence because it cannot be used by the defense at trial. We have never squarely addressed whether inadmissible evidence can properly be considered <em>Brady </em>evidence. However, the majority of courts that have addressed the issue have concluded that inadmissible evidence can constitute <em>Brady </em>evidence. <em>See Ellsworth v. Warden, </em>333 F.3d 1,5 (1st Cir. 2003); <em>United States v. Gil, </em>297 F.3d 93, 104 (2d Cir. 2002); <em>Maynard v. Gov\u2019t of Virgin Islands, </em>392 F. App\u2019x 105, 115-16 (3d Cir. 2010); <em>United States v. Sipe, </em>388 F.3d 471, 485 (5th Cir. 2004); <em>Sawyer v. Hofbauer, </em>299 F.3d 605, 614 (6th Cir. 2002); <em>United States v. Asher, </em>178 F.3d 486, 496 (7th Cir. 1999); <em>Madsen v. Dormire, </em>137 F.3d 602 (8th Cir. 1998); <em>Wright v. Hopper, </em>169 F.3d 695, 703 (11th Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">\u00b624 We agree with the majority of courts that have addressed the issue. The focus of the inquiry should not be on whether the evidence is admissible or inadmissible, but rather whether the evidence is favorable to the defense and could have affected the outcome of the proceedings. We decline to develop a rule that would foreclose the development of defense strategy and investigation or to presuppose what information the defense may have developed as a result of properly disclosed evidence. In light of the policy underlying <em>Brady, </em>we. believe that even inadmissible evidence could have \u201csubstantial value to the defense that elementary fairness requires it to be disclosed.\u201d <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 110, 96 S. Ct. 2392, 2401 (1976). Here, although Krajacich\u2019s report may have been inadmissible for any number of reasons, at the very least disclosure of the report had substantial value to the defense given its potential to lead directly to admissible exculpatory evidence. We therefore conclude that Krajacich\u2019s report constituted favorable evidence within the meaning of <em>Brady.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">\u00b625  In sum, we agree with Weisbarth that the medical records contained favorable evidence to his defense. After obtaining the medical records, the State should have disclosed the substance of the records to Weisbarth. Thereafter, any concerns of the State regarding privacy rights of the victim, relevancy, and inadmissibility under the Rape Shield Statute, could be subsequently raised and considered by the District Court. We therefore turn to the question of whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>State\u2019s failure to alert Weisbarth of the substance of the records caused him prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">\n<em>II. Prejudice</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">\u00b626 In order to establish prejudice, Weisbarth must show that the undisclosed evidence was material to his defense. Evidence is material for purposes of <em>Brady, </em>if it \u201ccould reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\u201d <em>Kyles v. Whitley, </em>514 U.S. 419, 435, 115 S. Ct. 1555, 1566 (1995). \u201cThe materiality of excluded evidence is considered collectively, not item by item.\u201d <em>McGarvey, </em>\u00b6 17. Further, \u201c[ijmpeachment evidence is especially likely to be material when it impugns the testimony of a witness who is critical to the prosecution\u2019s case.\u201d <em>United States v. Price, </em>566 F.3d 900, 914 (9th Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">\u00b627 T.W. was unquestionably the State\u2019s most important witness. In contrast to the other circumstantial evidence with arguably minimal value, T.W.\u2019s testimony provided direct testimonial evidence of Weisbarth\u2019s guilt. With the significant redactions made by the State in T.W.\u2019s medical records, the defense was unable to seriously challenge her testimony and the jury had little reason to doubt her memory or truthfulness. The prosecutor exploited this throughout her closing argument. The prosecutor emphasized that T.W. was in a safe environment and had no reason to fabricate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">Now, look at the timing of the disclosure, and the sexual abuse that occurred, not until 2012. This isn\u2019t an ongoing custody dispute that she\u2019d like to get out of that situation. She was safe. [Roy] had permanent guardianship. She was home. She had no reason to fabricate this abuse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">The prosecutor further emphasized the lack of evidence demonstrating untruthfulness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-10\">I think what\u2019s telling, ladies and gentlemen, is Defense Counsel wants you to think that [T.W.] was lying, that she has reactive attachment disorder and was lying. There\u2019s no evidence to suggest that [T.W.] exhibited any symptoms of lying. The only person, in fact, that tells you that she was lying was the Defendant. He has to have you believe she was lying, but there\u2019s no evidence to support that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-11\">Weisbarth, of course, did not have any information to rebut the prosecutor\u2019s narrative and to give the jury any evidence to question T.W.\u2019s credibility. That information the prosecutor concealed. The State did not reveal the evidence of T.W.\u2019s psychosis, her history of lying, or the prior allegation of sexual abuse. Nor did the State reveal the evidence in the medical records showing that T.W.\u2019s life was in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>state of upheaval at the time of the allegation and that her grandfather had altered her medication below therapeutic levels around the time of T.W.\u2019s disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">\u00b628  Had Weisbarth been able to discredit T.W.\u2019s testimony with this evidence, there is a reasonable probability that he could have persuaded the jury that T.W. fabricated the allegations against him. By using the lack of any evidence casting doubt on T.W.\u2019s credibility against the defense, the prosecutor further heightened the medical records\u2019 impeachment value and the defense\u2019s need for the suppressed evidence. Absent the concealed evidence, T.W.\u2019s testimony firmly established Weisbarth\u2019s guilt in the eyes of the jury and rendered his ability to undermine the State\u2019s case exceedingly difficult. If the State had provided the evidence to the defense, Weisbarth would have been in a position to seriously challenge T.W.\u2019s credibility through cross-examination and the direct testimony of Veraldi. In short, the undisclosed evidence in question \u201ccould reasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\u201d <em>Kyles, </em>514 U.S. at <em>435, 115 S. Ct. </em>at 1566. We conclude therefore that the State\u2019s suppression of the medical records was prejudicial to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">\n<em>III. Reasonable Diligence.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">\u00b629 The State further argues that the medical records do not establish a <em>Brady </em>violation because it is unclear \u201cwhat information the defense could have obtained with the exercise of reasonable diligence.\u201d Citing the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Amado v. Gonzalez, </em>758 F.3d 1119, 1135 (9th Cir. 2014), Weisbarth counters that a prosecutor\u2019s obligation under <em>Brady </em>is not excused by defense counsel\u2019s failure to exercise diligence with respect to suppressed evidence. Alternatively, Weisbarth argues that he exercised reasonable diligence in attempting to obtain the medical records.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">\u00b630 We have on several previous occasions refused to find a <em>Brady </em>violation where the defense could have obtained the exculpatory evidence through the exercise of reasonable diligence. <em>See, e.g., State v. James, </em>2010 MT 175, \u00b6 34, 357 Mont. 193, 237 P.3d 672; <em>State v. Parrish, </em>2010 MT 212, \u00b6 21, 357 Mont. 477, 241 P.3d 1041; <em>McGaruey, </em>\u00b6 18. We acknowledge that this precedent is now seemingly at odds with that of the Ninth Circuit. <em>Amado, </em>758 F.3d at 1136 (concluding that the requirement of due diligence is contrary to federal law as clearly established by the Supreme Court and unsound public policy). (Internal citation omitted.) However, we nonetheless decline to address the apparent conflict or revisit our previous decisions here. Because we believe that Weisbarth exercised reasonable diligence in this instance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>it is unnecessary to do so. Here, Weisbarth had no way of knowing what evidence the medical records contained and he did the only thing he could do to obtain the records by filing a motion with the District Court requesting their disclosure. The court granted the motion and ordered the State to produce the records. The State then represented, on the eve of trial, that it had produced all discoverable material from the medical records. Weisbarth was entitled to rely on the State\u2019s representation. <em>See Banks v. Dretke, </em>540 U.S. 668, 674, 124 S. Ct. 1256, 1263 (2004). In short, Weisbarth exercised due diligence in attempting to gain the records; the State thwarted those efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">\u00b631 As a final matter, the State argues that pursuant to <em>State v. Johnston, </em>2014 MT 329, 377 Mont. 291, 339 P.3d 829, rather than reversing Weisbarth\u2019s conviction, the proper remedy is to dismiss the appeal without prejudice and remand to the District Court for an <em>in camera </em>inspection of the medical records. We disagree. In <em>Johnston, </em>the district court erred by denying disclosure of confidential state agency records without first reviewing the records for exculpatory evidence, and we remanded the case to the district court to conduct an <em>in camera </em>review of the records. <em>Johnston, </em>\u00b6 10. We did so, however, because the records were still in the agency\u2019s possession and not in the record on appeal. <em>Johnston, </em>\u00b6 4. Here, T.W.\u2019s medical records are part of the record on appeal. Thus, because the medical records are reviewable on appeal, there is no need to remand to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">\u00b632 We realize that child abuse is one of the most difficult crimes to prosecute, in large measure because there are often no witnesses except the victim. We acknowledge as well that there is something innately human about wanting to protect a young child from her abuser and the release of her personal information. In our system of justice, however, prosecutors occupy a unique position of public trust and their obligations extend beyond the protection of the victim. Prosecutors must ensure above all else that justice is done which necessarily requires that they provide a defendant, regardless of the nature of the offense, due process of law. For the foregoing reasons, we are not convinced that this occurred here.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">\u00b633 Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b461-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, BAKER and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b451-8\"> The parties submitted a joint motion to seal their briefs and supporting documents because of confidentiality concerns regarding T.W.\u2019s medical records.
