We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-11\">\n<em>1. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by failing to conduct an adequate inquiry into Cheetham\u2019s request for substitute counsel.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-14\">\n<em>2. Whether Cheetham was denied effective assistance of counsel.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuT\">\u00b62 We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-15\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b28-16\">\u00b63 In January 2014, the State charged Cheetham with the following felony offenses: sexual intercourse without consent in violation of \u00a7 45-5-503, MCA; sexual assault in violation of \u00a7 45-5-502, MCA; and sexual abuse of children in violation of \u00a7 45-5-625, MCA. The offenses were alleged to have occurred in 2004 when Cheetham\u2014who was thirty-two years old at the time<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\u2014and the victim, N.S.\u2014who was approximately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>five years old at the time\u2014were living together with N.S.\u2019s grandmother, J.P., in Whitehall, Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"AA\">\u00b64 At trial, N.S. testified that Cheetham had touched her inappropriately on her chest and her vagina in 2004. She also testified that Cheetham forced her to watch pornographic movies with him that depicted children having sexual intercourse. N.S. also testified that Cheetham had forced intercourse with her on one occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">\u00b65 N.S. was interviewed four times before trial. N.S. had two forensic interviews, one in 2006 and one in 2013. She was interviewed in early 2014 by a detective from the Jefferson County Sheriffs Office, and again before trial by an investigator working with defense counsel. On cross-examination, Cheetham\u2019s counsel, Steven Scott, questioned N.S. about inconsistencies in her statements in the four interviews. N.S. explained that she remembered things during later interviews and at trial that she did not remember during earlier interviews. She testified that she did not remember most of the events until a few years after they occurred\u2014beginning in 2006. She also testified that while she recalled the inappropriate touching earlier, she did not recall the penetration incident until she saw Cheetham in a store and began having flashbacks.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">\u00b66 N.S.\u2019s therapist testified regarding counseling sessions she had with N.S. relating to the sexual abuse. She testified that she often sees instances of delayed disclosures from sexual abuse victims. The State\u2019s child abuse expert confirmed that delayed disclosure is common, as is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Scott called an expert forensic psychologist, who pointed out that N.S. provided different details about the alleged rape that the expert would consider as \u201ccore details of the experience\u201d that N.S. should have been unlikely to have forgotten.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">\u00b67 N.S\u2019s mother, J.L., and J.P. also testified at trial and were questioned about what N.S. told each of them about Cheetham. J.L. and N.S\u2019s therapist testified about the ways in which the events have continued to negatively affect N.S.\u2019s life\u2014including nightmares, trouble in school, depression, and suicidal behavior resulting in three months of inpatient treatment at Shodair Children\u2019s Hospital in 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"AoE\">\u00b68 The jury found Cheetham guilty on all three counts. Prior to sentencing, Scott filed a motion to dismiss for negligent destruction of evidence, arguing that the State failed to provide and preserve an exculpatory medical report of a forensic medical examination performed in 2006 on N.S. by Dr. Salisbury. He did not attach the medical report to the motion or brief but quoted the document as stating, \u201c[N.S.\u2019s] exam was within normal limits with copious amounts of hymen intact. [This] does not negate the possibility of a penetration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>injury. The narrowing noticed in the above exam, could be consistent with patient\u2019s history and suspicious of a previous injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">\u00b69 Scott represented in his brief that he attempted to obtain the medical report from the County Attorney but was told that it could not be obtained through Child Protective Services (CPS). Noting that CPS once referenced the report, Scott concluded that the report must have been negligently destroyed. In response to the motion to dismiss, the State argued that the prosecution tried to obtain, but never possessed, the 2006 medical report in question. In any event, the State argued, the report was not favorable to Cheetham because it did not negate the possibility of penetration injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">\u00b610 Eventually Scott obtained the medical report as a result of a subpoena to Dr. Salisbury. Before the court ruled on the motion, however, Scott filed a notice withdrawing the motion to dismiss for negligent destruction of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">\u00b611 On the day of the sentencing hearing, the District Court received a letter from Cheetham addressed to the court and the chief public defender alleging several instances of ineffective assistance of counsel in relation to the medical report. In the letter Cheetham claimed that the medical report \u201cprovides cause for reasonable doubt that a penetration rape of a 5 year old child by a grown man lasting 5-8 minutes could leave the child\u2019s hymen intact.\u201d Based on Scott\u2019s failure to use the medical report, Cheetham requested that Scott \u201cbe dismissed [and] replaced.\u201d After questioning Cheetham, Scott, and the State\u2019s counsel, the court declined to address the substance of Cheetham\u2019s allegations and determined that there was \u201cno total breakdown of communication\u201d between Cheetham and Scott that would require that the sentencing hearing be continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">\u00b612 The court proceeded with the hearing and sentenced Cheetham to the Montana State Prison for 100 years with 50 years suspended for each of the three counts, to run consecutively. Cheetham appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b30-10\">\u00b613 A request for substitute counsel is within the sound discretion of the district court, reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Edwards, </em>2011 MT 210, \u00b6 14, 361 Mont. 478, 260 P.3d 396. A district court abuses its discretion if it acts arbitrarily without the employment of conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice. <em>State v. Sage, </em>2010 MT 156, \u00b6 21, 357 Mont. 99, 235 P.3d 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-11\">\u00b614 Ineffective assistance of counsel claims present mixed issues of law and fact that we review de novo. <em>State v Clary, </em>2012 MT 26, \u00b6 12, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>364 Mont. 53, 270 P.3d 88. This Court reviews claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal if the claims are based solely on the record. <em>Clary, </em>\u00b6 12. \u201c[I]f the record does not demonstrate \u2018why\u2019 counsel did or did not take an action which is the basis of the claim, the claim is more suitable for a petition for postconviction relief where a record can be more fully developed.\u201d <em>State v. Heavygun, </em>2011 MT 111, \u00b6 8, 360 Mont. 413, 253 P.3d 897 (quoting <em>State v. Sartain, </em>2010 MT 213, \u00b6 30, 357 Mont. 483, 241 P.3d 1032) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">\u00b615 <em>1. Whether the District Court abused its discretion by failing to conduct an adequate inquiry into Cheetham\u2019s request for substitute counsel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">\u00b616 Cheetham argues that the District Court erred by failing to conduct an adequate inquiry into his complaints. Cheetham claims that State <em>v. Schowengerdt, </em>2015 MT 133, 379 Mont. 182, 348 P.3d 664, is an \u201cinstructive similar case\u201d and notes that Scott also served as trial counsel in that case. Cheetham asserts that his complaint regarding Scott\u2019s failure to investigate the medical report and introduce it at trial is an \u201cobvious one presenting a \u2018seemingly substantial\u2019 allegation of [ineffective assistance of counsel].\u201d Accordingly, Cheetham argues, the District Court should have inquired \u201cinto the substance\u201d of his complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">\u00b617 The State argues that the District Court adequately inquired into Cheetham\u2019s complaints about counsel. The State points out that the court asked Cheetham and Scott about the conflict and, based on their responses, concluded that they did not have a breakdown in communication and could communicate civilly. The State contends that Cheetham and Scott\u2019s disagreement about the medical report was simply a \u201cdisagreement about the tactics being taken\u201d and thus \u201cdo[es] not establish a ground for new counsel.\u201d As such, the State asserts that Cheetham\u2019s claims were not \u201cseemingly substantial\u201d and that the court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to hold a hearing or appoint new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"AENY\">\u00b618  The right to effective assistance of counsel under the United States and Montana Constitutions \u201cdoes not grant defendants the right to counsel of their choice.\u201d <em>State v. Dethman, </em>2010 MT 268, \u00b6 15, 358 Mont. 384, 245 P.3d 30 (citing <em>State v. Craig, </em>274 Mont. 140, 149, 906 P.2d 683, 688 (1995)). \u201cSo long as appointed counsel is rendering effective assistance, a defendant may not demand dismissal or substitution of counsel simply because he or she lacks confidence in, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>does not approve of, his or her appointed counsel.\u201d <em>Dethman, </em>\u00b6 15 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">\u00b619 Our case law establishes that for the court to replace a defense attorney, the defendant bears the burden of presenting material facts that establish a \u201ccomplete collapse\u201d of the attorney-client relationship, a total lack of communication, or ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Edwards, </em>\u00b6 32; <em>State v. Kaske, </em>2002 MT 106, \u00b6 30, 309 Mont. 445, 47 P.3d 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">\u00b620 When a defendant raises complaints against his attorney and seeks substitution of counsel, the district court must make an adequate initial inquiry into the nature of those complaints and determine if they are \u201cseemingly substantial.\u201d <em>State v. Gallagher, </em>1998 MT 70, \u00b6 15, 288 Mont. 180, 955 P.2d 1371. \u201cIn reviewing a district court\u2019s inquiry, we do not examine whether counsel was ineffective, but instead, whether the district court\u2019s inquiry into the claim was adequate.\u201d <em>State v. MacGregor, </em>2013 MT 297, \u00b6 25, 372 Mont. 142, 311 P.3d 428. A district court\u2019s inquiry is adequate when the \u201ccourt considers the defendant\u2019s factual complaints together with counsel\u2019s specific explanations addressing the complaints.\u201d <em>Schowengerdt, </em>\u00b6 17 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). <em>Accord., Dethman, </em>\u00b6 16; <em>Gallagher, </em>\u00b6 15; <em>City of Billings v. Smith, </em>281 Mont. 133, 137, 932, P.2d 1058, 1060 (1997). In contrast, a district\u2019s court inquiry is inadequate if it fails to conduct \u201ceven a cursory inquiry\u201d into the defendant\u2019s complaints, in which case remand is justified. <em>Schowengerdt, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">\u00b621 If the district court\u2019s adequate inquiry finds that the defendant\u2019s complaints are seemingly substantial, a hearing must be held to determine their validity. <em>Gallagher, </em>\u00b6 14. Conversely, a hearing is not required if the court finds that the defendant\u2019s complaints are insubstantial. <em>MacGregor, </em>\u00b6 26. If a defendant\u2019s complaint is based on the allegation that counsel is rendering ineffective assistance, the complaint is \u201cseemingly substantial\u201d if it makes \u201csome showing of fact indicating that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defendant. Those facts must make a showing of deficiency to overcome the presumption that a defendant was provided with effective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>MacGregor, </em>\u00b6 26 (internal citations omitted). If the defendant does not meet his burden, he has the choice of continuing with his present counsel or having counsel dismissed and proceeding pro se. <em>State v. Zackuse, </em>250 Mont. 385, 386, 833 P.2d 142, 142 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">\u00b622 In <em>Dethman, </em>the defendant had asserted that his attorney \u201cwas not defending him in the manner he felt he needed to be defended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>because he refused to present witnesses, testimony, and evidence Dethman requested.\u201d <em>Dethman, </em>\u00b6 19. We determined that while Dethman\u2019s assertions indicated that he and his attorney \u201cmay have had a difference in opinion as how to proceed with Dethman\u2019s case, it is a time honored rule ... that courts must accord great deference to defense counsel\u2019s exercise of judgment in determining appropriate defenses and trial strategy.\u201d <em>Dethman, </em>\u00b6 19 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, we concluded that further investigation by the district court was \u201cunnecessary\u201d and the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Dethman\u2019s motion for substitute counsel. <em>Dethman, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">\u00b623 In contrast, in <em>Schowengerdt, </em>we held that the district court failed to conduct an adequate inquiry into Schowengerdt\u2019s complaints because it did not give him the opportunity to explain why he was dissatisfied with his attorney. <em>Schowengerdt, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18-19. We noted that the court interrupted Schowengerdt whenever he tried to give an explanation, ordered Schowengerdt to follow the Office of the Public Defender\u2019s (OPD) process for appointment of new counsel, and failed to conduct further proceedings when OPD administratively denied the request. <em>Schowengerdt, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">\u00b624 Here, the court received Cheetham\u2019s letter requesting substitute counsel on the morning of the sentencing hearing. At the beginning of the hearing, prior to conducting any other business, the court addressed the letter. The court began by questioning the State\u2019s counsel about the letter and then questioned Scott, asking him what his thoughts were \u201cprocedurally or substantively.\u201d Scott responded,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AP\">Your honor, my client does not want me to proceed any further on this case with him as his attorney. He wants me to be removed. He\u2019s made it very clear in the letter. We\u2019ve talked earlier today, civilly, but he\u2019s made it very clear that he does not want me to be any further part of this particular case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAL\">\n<img class=\"blockquote\" height=\"45\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAP0AAAAtAQAAAABNcFB+AAAATUlEQVR4nGP8z4AX/GTCL8/AMKpgVMEwVnACSv93gDJ+oinYA6X/PYAyfjQQZwXDfyg4DqX/2UMZPyAk3AQNKM0IcwMrlD+aeUcVIAEA4BUqoMNh7hwAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"253\"/>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-7\">As for the substance of the letters, I am certainly not going to go into that, as that would violate attorney/client privilege under Rule 1.6, so I\u2019m not going to address any of the allegations that are in the letter against me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">Scott also informed the court that Cheetham had begun taking steps to obtain new counsel through OPD. The court agreed that it was unnecessary to \u201cdeal with the substance\u201d of the allegations at that time but asked Scott for \u201cmore information about [his] thoughts on the potential for a different attorney.\u201d The court noted that Scott had described his and Cheetham\u2019s discussions as \u201ccivil\u201d and thus the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>suggested that Cheetham\u2019s concerns were \u201cmerely a difference of view about how to proceed.\u201d Scott agreed with the court\u2019s suggestion, stating, \u201cI would believe that could be accurate. I\u2019m not sure if Mr. Cheetham believes that there has been an entire attorney/client relationship breakdown at this point or not.\u201d Scott requested that the court continue the sentencing hearing to \u201csee if [Cheetham] can be appointed new Counsel or if he can hire Counsel.\u201d The court also questioned Cheetham. Cheetham agreed that he and Scott could communicate civilly but maintained that they disagreed upon the course of action with respect to the medical report.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">\u00b625 The court decided to proceed with the sentencing hearing. The court noted that Cheetham\u2019s concerns \u201ccan best be dealt with or must be dealt with by way of a petition for postconviction relief following an appeal.\u201d The court also commented that it had reservations about \u201cwhether an attorney should be appointed for Mr. Cheetham different from the able Counsel he has benefited from so far.\u201d The court explained that by \u201cable counsel\u201d it meant \u201cthat everything the Court has encountered is Mr. Scott has effectively, in the courtroom before the Court, fulfilled his duties properly.\u201d Finally, the court expressed reservations about whether it was \u201cpermissible for a Defendant to at this stage of the game create a viable basis for a different attorney unless there is a total breakdown of communication between attorney and client.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">\u00b626 We conclude that the District Court\u2019s initial inquiry into Cheetham\u2019s complaints was adequate. The court questioned both Scott and Cheetham about their attorney-client relationship. Acknowledging that \u201cit would be improper to ask [Scott] to disclose [his] entire defense strategy,\u201d <em>State v. Novak, </em>2005 MT 294, \u00b6 21, 329 Mont. 309, 124 P.3d 182, the court did not question either Scott or Cheetham about the specifics of the complaint. The court did, however, consider the factual complaints in the letter to conclude that Cheetham and Scott had \u201ca difference of view about how to proceed\u201d with respect to the evidentiary matter raised in Cheetham\u2019s letter. Unlike <em>Schowengerdt, </em>where the court did not allow Schowengerdt to explain his reasons for requesting new counsel, here, the court read the specific allegations in Cheetham\u2019s letter and then questioned Cheetham sufficiently to ascertain that his complaints all were based on Scott\u2019s failure to use the medical report. The court considered Cheetham\u2019s \u201cfactual complaints\u201d in the letter together with \u201ccounsel\u2019s explanations\u201d addressing the complaints\u2014to the extent that counsel could provide an appropriate explanation at that time without divulging privileged information. <em>Gallagher, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"Acs_\">\u00b627  We acknowledge that a total breakdown of communication may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>be a separate ground for obtaining new counsel from a claim that counsel is rendering ineffective assistance. The Sixth Amendment right to counsel \u201c \u2018envisions counsel\u2019s playing a role that is critical to the ability of the adversarial system to produce just results.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>2016 MT 102, \u00b6 37, 383 Mont. 281, 371 P.3d. 979 (quoting <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 685, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 2063 (1984)). Thus, a defendant is \u201centitled to be assisted by an attorney, whether retained or appointed, who plays the role necessary to ensure that the trial is fair.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 685, 104 S. Ct. at 2063. The District Court\u2019s suggestion that a total breakdown of communication was required to obtain new counsel was made with the observation that \u201cat this stage of the game,\u201d when all that remained was the sentencing hearing, that was the relevant inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"A5q7\">\u00b628  Considering the basis for Cheetham\u2019s complaints of ineffective assistance, we conclude that the District Court did not err in failing to inquire further. The District Court\u2019s initial inquiry is not designed to determine the merits of the claim, but rather \u201cto establish whether a defendant has a substantial claim.\u201d <em>State v. Gazda, </em>2003 MT 350, \u00b6 32, 318 Mont. 516, 82 P.3d 20. Cheetham did not raise a \u201cseemingly substantial\u201d complaint of ineffective assistance. While Cheetham and Scott \u201chad a difference in opinion as how to proceed with [Cheetham\u2019s] case, it is a time honored rule ... that courts must afford great deference to defense counsel\u2019s exercise of judgment in determining appropriate defenses and trial strategy.\u201d <em>Dethman, </em>\u00b6 19. Because the court\u2019s initial inquiry did not reveal serious questions as to whether Scott performed the role of counsel envisioned by the Sixth Amendment, it was not required to hold a separate hearing to consider the merits of Cheetham\u2019s claims. <em>MacGregor, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"Adg\">\u00b629  A claim of ineffective assistance based on differences between the defendant and his counsel about trial strategy and production of evidence is available in, and better suited for, a postconviction proceeding where counsel may divulge more freely\u2014with appropriate safeguards <em>(In re Gillham, </em>216 Mont. 279, 282, 704 P.2d 1019, 1021 (1985))\u2014his or her communications with the defendant and strategic decisions. By its terms, the procedure we directed in <em>Gillham </em>applies to petitions for postconviction relief when a response from defense counsel is necessary. <em>Gillham, </em>216 Mont. at 282, 704 P.2d at 1021. We have not obligated district courts to compel that procedure prior to entry of final judgment in a criminal case and we decline to impose such a requirement in this case. As such, given the nature of the claims Cheetham raised here, we conclude that further investigation by the District Court was \u201cunnecessary.\u201d <em>Dethman, </em>\u00b6 19. The District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>did not abuse its discretion by denying Cheetham\u2019s request for substitute counsel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">\u00b630 <em>2. Whether Cheetham was denied effective assistance of counsel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A31\">\u00b631 Cheetham argues that he was denied effective assistance of counsel both pretrial and during trial. Cheetham argues that Scott \u201cfailed to [identify], investigate, and introduce at trial\u201d the same allegedly exculpatory medical record about which Cheetham complained to the District Court. Cheetham claims that \u201c[s]uch error was prejudicial as it tended to establish that no penetration or rape took place.\u201d Cheetham contends that if the report had been introduced at trial, it would have \u201cundoubtedly affected the jury\u2019s consideration of [his] guilt and certainly creates a reasonable probability that the jury would have decided the case differently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">\u00b632 Cheetham claims that Scott told him that the medical report likely would be inadmissible under Montana\u2019s rape shield statute and argues, \u201cSuch post-trial justification lacks reasonableness when it is clear Scott was not aware of this information, did not review or investigate further the State\u2019s disclosure regarding this information, and did not reasonably attempt to discover the contents of the medical record.\u201d Cheetham argues further that if Montana\u2019s rape shield statute precluded his use of the medical report, Scott should have challenged its constitutionality.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">\u00b633 The alleged error, according to Cheetham, is \u201cfirmly based on the record.\u201d Cheetham argues that Scott \u201cwas given an opportunity to explain or excuse his actions on the record, but declined to do so based on the attorney-client relationship.\u201d As such, Cheetham contends, the appropriate procedure should have been for the court to issue a <em>Gillham </em>order\u2014which permits a defendant\u2019s attorney to reveal confidential information on a claim of ineffective assistance upon court order. Cheetham requests that this Court reverse his convictions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>order a new trial, or \u201c[a]t a minimum,\u201d that he receive a hearing on his ineffective assistance of counsel allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">\u00b634 The State argues that Cheetham\u2019s claim is not record-based and should not be reviewed on direct appeal. The State contends that \u201cI a llthough the record contains Cheetham\u2019s claims about the medical report, it does not contain other information that is necessary to assess Scott\u2019s performance.\u201d For instance, the State contends that it is \u201cnot clear from the record what information Scott had regarding the medical report,\u201d whether Scott was \u201caware of the reference in the CPS report to the medical record,\u201d whether he \u201cfailed to investigate the reference,\u201d \u201cwhat testimony would have been offered if the medical report had been admitted,\u201d or whether \u201cDr. Salisbury would have testified that the medical findings were inconsistent with N.S.\u2019s allegations against Cheetham.\u201d As such, the State argues that Cheetham\u2019s claim is more appropriate for a postconviction proceeding and should be dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">\u00b635 \u201cA party may raise only record-based ineffective assistance claims on direct <em>appeal.\u201dNovak, </em>\u00b6 18 <em>(citing State v. Earl, </em>2003 MT 158, \u00b6 39, 316 Mont. 263, 71 P.3d 1201). When determining whether an ineffective assistance of counsel claim is appropriate for direct, record-based review, we examine \u201cwhether the record discloses why counsel took, or failed to take, action in providing a defense.\u201d <em>Novak, </em>\u00b6 18. \u201cA record that is silent about the reasons for counsel\u2019s actions or omissions seldom provides sufficient evidence to rebut the \u2018strong presumption\u2019 that counsel\u2019s actions fell \u2018within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Clary, </em>\u00b6 30 (quoting Sartain, \u00b6 30).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">\u00b636 Here, the record does not fully disclose why Scott failed to investigate or introduce the medical report at trial. While Cheetham, in his letter, contends that Scott decided not to use the report because he believed it is inadmissible under the rape shield statute, because \u201cit\u2019s not 100% exculpatory,\u201d and because using it would make Cheetham \u201clook even worse like this exam was done then due to suspicion against [him],\u201d Scott himself never discussed the reasons for his decisions or actions with respect to the report. His notice to withdraw the motion to dismiss based on negligent destruction of evidence does not contain any reasoning or explanation, and Scott permissibly did not address the substance of the allegations against him at the sentencing hearing. Because the record is largely silent about the reasons for Scott\u2019s actions, there is insufficient evidence to \u201crebut the strong presumption that [his] actions fell within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Clary, </em>\u00b6 30. Further, there exists at least a plausible justification for Scott\u2019s decision. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number><em>Sartain, </em>\u00b6 31. As the State recounts, a \u201cmultitude of outside factors\u201d may have led him to decide not to use the medical report. <em>Sartain, </em>\u00b6 31. Without a fully developed record of Scott\u2019s reasons, the issue cannot be resolved and we therefore decline to address it on direct appeal. A postconviction proceeding would allow Scott to explain his tactical decisions. Cheetham\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is therefore dismissed without prejudice to raising it in a postconviction relief proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">\u00b637 For the foregoing reasons, the District Court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b38-7\">JUSTICES SHEA, COTTER and WHEAT concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b28-17\"> The State amended the charge in August 2014 to correct Cheetham\u2019s age at the time of the events in question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b36-8\"> The State urges this Court to adopt the analysis applied by federal courts, which held that a criminal defendant has a right to new counsel only if the defendant demonstrates good cause such as a conflict of interest, a complete breakdown of communication, or an irreconcilable conflict, rather than allowing inquiry prior to judgment into counsel\u2019s effectiveness. In light of our discussion here, we find it unnecessary to adopt a new standard in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b36-9\"> Cheetham refers to <em>\u201cState v. James Morris Colburn </em>(DA 14-0181),\u201d which at the time he filed his Opening Brief was on appeal to this Court. Since that time, however, we decided <em>State v.

It is unclear to me how the Court can conclude that an \u201cadequate inquiry\u201d was conducted by the District Court without any observation of what the substance of the inquiry entails. Regarding Issue 2, I agree that Cheetham\u2019s claim is not record-based and therefore is not reviewable on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">\u00b639 Our precedent informing a trial judge of what standard to employ when presented with a motion for substitution of counsel during trial is confusing, if not impossible to follow. We compound that problem today by continuing to blend an ineffectiveness claim with a substitution claim, despite claiming the two are distinct. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 14, 27, 28. While our precedent consistently emphasizes the need to conduct an adequate initial inquiry when a motion for substitution of counsel has been made, in my opinion, we have been careless in articulating the standard to be applied by a trial judge in resolving such a motion. In some cases the standard we enunciate requires a \u201ctotal lack of communication,\u201d <em>Zackuse, </em>250 Mont. at 385-86; <em>State v. Molder, </em>2007 MT 41, \u00b6 33, 336 Mont. 91, 152 P.3d 722; others a \u201ctotal lack of communication <em>or </em>ineffective assistance of counsel,\u201d <em>Dethman, </em>\u00b6 16 (emphasis added); and still others only an \u201cineffective assistance of counsel\u201d inquiry, <em>Gallagher, </em>\u00b6 26, <em>MacGregor, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 25-26. Today, while claiming to observe a distinction between an ineffective assistance of counsel claim and one grounded in a breakdown of communication between counsel and client, Opinion, \u00b6 27, we nonetheless continue to inject <em>Stickland </em>standards into a motion for substitution. While precedent regarding ineffectiveness claims informs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>our understanding of the right to substitution, a judge should not be required to conduct a collateral proceeding during the pendency of a trial, which is more appropriately handled through a postconviction proceeding. Our decision is therefore flawed in that we continue to incorporate the <em>Strickland </em>ineffective assistance standard, requiring both deficient performance and prejudice to the defendant, without setting forth any analytical distinction from a substitution claim. However, we then fail to apply the two prong test to the facts, choosing instead to find that Cheetham did not raise a \u201c \u2018seemingly substantial\u2019 complaint of ineffective assistance.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 28. Under these circumstances, we would be well advised to accept guidance, as the State urges, from the federal courts and enunciate a standard premised upon correct constitutional principles for resolving substitution claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">\u00b640 A motion for substitution of counsel is concerned, not with the defendant\u2019s freedom of choice or with whether the attorney and client have a \u201cmeaningful relationship,\u201d <em>Morris v. Slappy, </em>461 U.S. 1, 14, 103 S. Ct. 1610, 1617 (1983), but rather with a breakdown of the attorney-client communication sufficient enough to frustrate the original purpose of the appointment\u2014the mounting of an adversarial defense. \u201cThe very premise of our adversary system of criminal justice is that partisan advocacy on both sides of a case will best promote the ultimate objective that the guilty be convicted and the innocent go free.\u201d <em>Herring v. New York, </em>422 U.S. 853, 862, 95 S. Ct. 2550, 2554 (1975). \u201cIt is that \u2018very premise\u2019 that underlies and gives meaning to the Sixth Amendment. It \u2018is meant to assure fairness in the adversary criminal process.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Cronic, </em>466 U.S. 648, 655-56, 104 S. Ct. 2039, 2045 (1984) (quoting <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>449 U.S. 361, 364, 101 S. Ct. 665, 667 (1981)). The defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to substitution of counsel arises because the initial appointment has ceased to constitute Sixth Amendment assistance of counsel. The Sixth Amendment guarantees not simply <em>counsel, </em>but \u201cthe <em>Assistance </em>of Counsel for defense.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI (emphasis added). \u201cThe right to be heard would be, in many cases, of little avail if it did not comprehend the right to be heard by counsel. Even the intelligent and educated layman... requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the proceedings against him.\u201d <em>Powell v. Alabama, </em>287 U.S. 45, 68-69, 53 S. Ct. 55, 64 (1932). Accordingly, where the communication between counsel and defendant has become so compromised that mounting of a defense becomes impossible, the defendant is neither receiving the assistance of counsel nor being heard by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>\u00b641 The United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held that a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel is violated if the defendant is unable to communicate with his or her counsel during key trial preparation times. <em>See Riggins v. Nevada, </em>504 U.S. 127, 144, 112 S. Ct. 1810, 1820 (1992) (Kennedy, J., concurring) (\u201cWe have held that a defendant\u2019s right to the effective assistance of counsel is impaired when he cannot cooperate in an active manner with his lawyer. The defendant must be able to provide needed information to his lawyer and to participate in the making of decisions on his own behalf.\u201d) (citations omitted); <em>Cronic, </em>466 U.S. at 659 n.25, 104 S. Ct. at 2047 (\u201cThe Court has uniformly found constitutional error without any showing ofprejudice when counsel was ... prevented from assisting the accused during a critical stage of the proceeding.\u201d); <em>Geders v. United States, </em>425 U.S. 80, 91, 96 S. Ct. 1330, 1337 (1976) (holding that trial judge\u2019s order that counsel could not communicate with defendant during overnight recess in the middle of trial violated defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right). The Ninth Circuit has similarly recognized that \u201cto compel one charged with grievous crime to undergo a trial with the assistance of an attorney with whom he has become embroiled in irreconcilable conflict is to deprive him of the effective assistance of any counsel whatsoever.\u201d <em>Brown v. Craven, </em>424 F.2d 1166, 1170 (9th Cir. 1970). As the court held in <em>Daniels v. Woodford, </em>428 F.3d 1181, 1198 (9th Cir. 2005):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-5\">Where a criminal defendant has, with legitimate reason, completely lost trust in his attorney, and the trial court refuses to remove the attorney, the defendant is constructively denied counsel. This is true even where the breakdown is a result of the defendant\u2019s refusal to speak to counsel, unless the defendant\u2019s refusal to cooperate demonstrates \u2018unreasonable contumacy.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYr\">(Citation omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">\u00b642 Although the Supreme Court has observed that the Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel is recognized not for its own sake, but for the effect of the challenged conduct on the reliability of the trial process, there are \u201ccircumstances that are so likely to prejudice the accused that the cost of litigating their effect in a particular case is unjustified.\u201d <em>Cronic, </em>466 U.S. at 658, 104 S. Ct. at 2046. The Supreme Court thus recognized that a per se Sixth Amendment violation may arise where, \u201calthough counsel is available to assist the accused during trial, the likelihood that any lawyer, even a fully competent one, could provide effective assistance is so small that a presumption of prejudice is appropriate without inquiry into the actual conduct of the trial.\u201d <em>Cronic, </em>466 U.S. at 659-60, 104 S. Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>2047.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">\u00b643 The test that has emerged within the various federal jurisdictions for substitution motions, which presume prejudice and a per se violation of the Sixth Amendment or \u201cconstructive\u201d denial of counsel, is whether an irreconcilable conflict between counsel and defendant, an actual conflict of interest on the part of counsel, or a complete breakdown in communication between counsel and the defendant has occurred.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cTo warrant substitute counsel, a defendant must show ... \u2018a conflict of interest, an irreconcilable conflict, or a complete breakdown in communication between the attorney and the defendant.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Swinney, </em>970 F.2d 494, 499 (8th Cir. 1992) (citations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 1011, 113 S. Ct. 632 (1992). <em>See also United States v. Allen, </em>789 F.2d 90, 92 (1st Cir. 1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 846, 107 S. Ct. 164 (1986); <em>United States v. Whaley, </em>788 F.2d 581, 583 (9th Cir. 1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 962. 107 S. Ct. 458 (1986). The test is essentially whether the trial judge should have granted a substitution motion because of an irreconcilable conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">\u00b644 In evaluating whether a court has abused its discretion in denying a substitution request for any of these three reasons, the following facts and circumstances should be considered: timeliness of the motion, adequacy of the court\u2019s inquiry into the defendant\u2019s complaint, and whether the attorney-client conflict was so great that it resulted in total lack of communication preventing an adequate defense. <em>Allen, </em>789 F.2d at 92; <em>Whaley, </em>788 F.2d at 583; <em>Daniels, </em>428 F.3d at 1197-98. It is clear that a conflict over defense tactics and trial strategy could serve as the catalyst leading to a total breakdown in communication or irreconcilable conflict. The inquiry accordingly must focus on whether the serious breakdown in communication results in an inadequate defense and not whether the trial court is of the opinion that defense counsel is competent. Within this framework, the court is not required to inquire of counsel or defendant regarding issues of trial strategy or matters protected by the attorney-client privilege, except to the degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>they may have resulted in an irreconcilable breakdown in communication between attorney and client.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">\u00b645 Based on the foregoing, I cannot agree that the Court\u2019s analysis dispenses with the need to adopt a clear standard regarding the substance of the inquiry as the federal courts have. Opinion, \u00b6 29 n.2. In my opinion, it is a mistake to continue to blend an ineffectiveness claim under <em>Strickland </em>with a request for substitution of counsel and, in doing so, we have perpetuated confusing precedent when given the explicit invitation from the State to provide clarity. I would accordingly set forth a standard warranting substitution of counsel when there is an irreconcilable conflict between counsel and defendant, a conflict of interest on the part of counsel, or a complete breakdown in communication between counsel and the defendant. In evaluating whether a court has abused its discretion in denying a substitution motion, the following circumstances are relevant: the timeliness of the motion, the adequacy of the court\u2019s inquiry, and the degree to which the irreconcilable conflict has prevented the mounting of an adequate defense. I believe such a standard is premised upon sound constitutional principles underlying the Sixth Amendment and Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">\u00b646 As the District Court actually determined that there was \u201cno total breakdown of communication\u201d between attorney and client, I believe the court employed the correct analysis and would affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b41-7\"> A conflict of interest warranting substitution requires the defendant to show an actual conflict of interest which adversely affects his lawyer\u2019s performance. <em>See Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 348, 100 S. Ct. 1708, 1718 (1980). If there is only a potential for conflict, prejudice is not presumed and a defendant must meet the performance and prejudice standard of <em>Strickland. </em>Furthermore, defendants need not show prejudice when the breakdown of a relationship between attorney and client from irreconcilable differences results in the complete denial of counsel. <em>See Frazer v. United States, </em>18 F.3d 778, 785 (9th Cir. 1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
