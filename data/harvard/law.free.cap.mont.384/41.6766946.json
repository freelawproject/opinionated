The parties raise the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-4\">\n<em>1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion and violate Mother\u2019s constitutional rights by terminating her parental rights to the children upon a finding that the conduct or condition rendering her unfit to parent was unlikely to change within a reasonable time?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-5\">\n<em>2. Did the District Court lack jurisdiction and abuse its discretion in terminating Father\u2019s parental rights toA.S.?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Au\">\u00b62 A.S. is a girl born in 2011, and A.M. is a boy born in 2008. The Department of Public Health and Human Services, Child and Family Services Division, initially became involved with this family in October 2014 upon receiving separate reports from law enforcement that Father, Mother, and Mother\u2019s boyfriend were involved with illegal drugs, specifically, methamphetamine. Upon a raid of Father\u2019s residence in Great Falls, police found drug residue, drug paraphernalia, and indicators that a small child lived there. However, neither Father nor A.S. was found, and the Department commenced an effort to locate A.S. Two weeks later, on October 23, 2014, the Department located A.S. with Father\u2019s parents, who reported that they had been contacted two days earlier by a woman whose last name they did not know, asking them to pick up A.S., which they did. They had heard nothing from either Father or Mother. The Department placed A.S. into protective custody, and received a report from law enforcement that active cases were pending against Mother and her boyfriend. Because the whereabouts of both parents remained unknown, they were served by publication with the Department\u2019s petition for emergency services and for adjudication of A.S. as a youth in need of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">\u00b63 On December 18,2014, Child Protective Specialist Sarah Peterson received a call from Mother, who stated she was now in Great Falls <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>and wanted to pick up A.S. Peterson told Mother she needed to attend the show cause hearing set for the next day, but neither Mother nor Father appeared. The District Court received testimony from Peterson and police officers, and at the conclusion of the hearing, adjudicated A.S. as a youth in need of care based on her parents\u2019 abandonment and physical neglect, and granted the Department temporary legal custody until a dispositional hearing in January 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">\u00b64 During these proceedings, the Department received a report concerning A.S.\u2019s half-brother, A.M. Peterson learned that A.M. had been living with his father, W.M., on weekends and living with Mother\u2019s mother, K.P., during the week, but that Mother and her boyfriend had begun living with K.P. as well. Mother\u2019s boyfriend had been arrested and, based on concerns about Mother\u2019s avoidance of the Department with regard to A.S., as well as reported concerns over her use of methamphetamine and association with other methamphetamine users, the Department placed A.M. in the care of his father<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and filed a petition for emergency services and adjudication of A.M. as a youth in need of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">\u00b65 Neither Mother nor Father attended the dispositional hearing for A.S. on January 13, 2015. The court received testimony and approved the proposed treatment plans for Mother and Father, subject to either parent entering an objection and requesting a hearing within 15 days. Appointed counsel for both parents were in attendance. Mother\u2019s counsel agreed to the treatment plan but Father\u2019s counsel took no position because he had not had contact with Father. No objections were filed thereafter by either Mother or Father.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">\u00b66 At the January 20, 2015, show cause hearing for A.M., Mother attended and A.M.\u2019s father, W.M., stipulated to the relief sought. The court adjudicated A.M. as a youth in need of care and approved the same treatment plan for Mother as had been approved for her in A.S.\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">\u00b67 Mother had difficulty completing tasks under her treatment plans. She missed numerous appointments scheduled during the period of February-May 2015 for a chemical dependency evaluation, and one was never conducted. Therefore, recommendations from the chemical dependency counselor were not obtained or followed by Mother. She attended one parenting class after missing several appointments, only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>to fall asleep during class interactions. She was unable to repeat back any of the covered material. The District Court found that at this session Mother \u201cwas emotional, blamed others, and denied responsibility.\u201d She did not provide samples for urinalysis or hair testing. She did not obtain employment during this time, stating she could not maintain employment because she suffered from epileptic seizures. Early in the process, Peterson considered a guardianship plan, under which A.S. would enter a guardianship with her paternal grandparents. However, Mother failed to comply with requests for information about her medical condition or sign medical releases, and this plan was abandoned. As of April 2015, Mother was failing her treatment plan. She did not regularly attend her appointments with Peterson or keep in contact with the Department. She did not complete any in-home parenting sessions. The District Court found that Mother had not provided a safe and stable environment for A.S. and A.M. Mother did attend seven of her eleven scheduled visits with the children. A.M. enjoyed these visits but was distraught over the visits that Mother failed to attend, and Peterson testified it did not appear that A.S. knew who Mother was. During a status hearing on April 7, 2015, Mother was admonished by the District Court that her failure to engage her treatment plan may result in termination of her parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">\u00b68 Father was arrested and placed in jail multiple times during the time his treatment plan was in effect, which complicated his ability to work on his plan, including obtaining a chemical dependency evaluation. The District Court found he did not provide a safe and stable home environment for A.S., had not attended parenting classes, provided any samples for urinalysis, provided evidence of employment, or been in regular contact with the Department. Father wrote a letter to the Department from the jail, and attended several supervised visits with A.S. that went well. A.S. was glad to see him. He was not able to articulate to the Department a plan to care for A.S., and the District Court found that, in May 2015, Father \u201cadmitted to Ms. Peterson that he was not in a position to parent [A.S.].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">\u00b69 In July 2015, the Department filed a petition for termination of parental rights as to Mother for both A.S. and A.M., and as to Father for A.S. Both parents had to again be served by publication because neither of them had maintained contact with the Department and their whereabouts were unknown. The District Court conducted a hearing on the petition on September 1-2, 2015. The children\u2019s guardian ad litem supported termination of both Mother and Father\u2019s parental rights, arguing that neither parent had made a \u201csincere attempt\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>satisfy their treatment plans, that Father had demonstrated no real interest in parenting A.S., and that \u201calthough no one is exactly clear where he is right now, it seems that he\u2019s likely not incarcerated.... but he\u2019s not here,\u201d that Mother had continually relied upon a claimed medical condition for failing to comply with her treatment plan, without documentation of the condition, and that \u201cit [] seems to be an all-purpose excuse to be trotted out whenever necessary to explain I didn\u2019t comply....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">\u00b610 The District Court entered orders terminating Mother and Father\u2019s parental rights on October 2,2015. Mother and Father appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">\u00b611 \u201cThis Court reviews a district court\u2019s decision to terminate parental rights for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>In re K.A., </em>2016 MT 27, \u00b6 19, 382 Mont. 165, 365 P.3d 478 (citing <em>In re E.Z.C., </em>2013 MT 123, \u00b6 19, 370 Mont. 116, 300 P.3d 1174) (citation omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-8\">A district court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or in excess of the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice. This Court will not disturb a district court\u2019s decision on appeal unless \u201cthere is a mistake of law or a finding of fact not supported by substantial evidence that would amount to a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous and its conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-9\"><em>In re K.A., </em>\u00b6 19 <em>(citing In re T.S., </em>2013 MT 274, \u00b6 21, 372 Mont. 79, 310 P.3d 538) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b71-11\">\u00b612 <em>1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion and violate Mother\u2019s constitutional rights by terminating her parental rights to the children upon a finding that the conduct or condition rendering her unfit to parent was unlikely to change within a reasonable time1?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-12\">\u00b613 Mother argues the District Court\u2019s determination that her unfitness to parent was unlikely to change within a reasonable time was not supported by sufficient evidence, thus violating the statutory requirements for termination of parental rights and her due process entitlement to \u201cfundamentally fair procedures at all stages of the proceedings,\u201d citing <em>In re C.J., </em>2010 MT 179, \u00b6 26, 357 Mont. 219, 237 P.3d 1282. Conceding that she failed to complete most of her treatment plan tasks, Mother argues this failure is explained by her \u201cmistaken understanding that because an alternative plan was in the works that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>she did not need to work on her treatment plan,\u201d referring to the guardianship plan briefly considered by Peterson early in the treatment plan process. Mother contends that \u201cshe believed her parental rights were not at risk and she did not need to complete the treatment plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">\u00b614 The District Court concluded that \u201c[c]lear and convincing evidence establishes that [Mother\u2019s] Treatment Plan \u2018has not been successful\u2019 in <em>changing </em>the conduct and conditions that render her unfit as a parent.... [Mother\u2019s] <em>ongoing </em>emotional instability and self-absorption manifests itself in conduct that renders her unfit, unable, or unwilling to give [A.S.] and [A.M.] adequate parental care.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The court further concluded that \u201c[c]ontinuation of the parent-child relationship between these children and [Mother] will result in an ongoing risk of abuse or neglect to them.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These conclusions by the District Court demonstrate Mother\u2019s problems were unchanging and continuing, and were fully supported by substantial evidence, detailed above. Mother was clearly going nowhere on her treatment plan or making any progress in addressing the life issues rendering her unfit to parent the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">\u00b615 Mother\u2019s assertion that a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d about a possible guardianship of A.S. led her to believe she did not need to complete her treatment plan is unpersuasive. That idea was considered and abandoned early in the process. There is no evidence that Mother was advised it was no longer necessary to complete her treatment plan; just the opposite, she was urged by the Department and admonished by the Court to complete it. Her attempts to complete some of the treatment plan tasks along the way, albeit feeble, belie her argument about a \u201cmisunderstanding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">\u00b616 Mother argues that the eight-month period \u201cbetween the treatment plan\u2019s approval and the filing of the termination petition was too short to accurately determine [her] ability to become a more successful parent,\u201d and this time was \u201cinsufficient\u201d to assess her \u201clikelihood of change.\u201d The District Court determined in its October 2015 order that \u201c[t]he best interests of [A.S.] and [A.M.] circumscribe the amount of time within which it is \u2018reasonable\u2019 to hope and wait for this conduct and these conditions to change.... [A.S.] has been in state custody since October of 2014. [A.M.] has been in custody since January 2015 and has been moved and replaced four times since then. These children cannot wait any longer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A8uf\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>\u00b6 17  When considering whether the conduct or condition rendering the parents unfit is likely to change for purposes of the termination decision, \u201cthe court shall give primary consideration to the physical, mental, and emotional conditions and needs of the child.\u201d Section 41-3-609(3), MCA. The District Court did so, and determined upon substantial evidence that the best interests of the children were not served by giving Mother more time. While parents dawdle, the clock ticks for children until it is unreasonable to wait any longer. Though warned, Mother avoided the tasks laid before her and instead, as found by the District Court, blamed others and shifted responsibility. The District Court did not err in terminating her parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">\u00b618 <em>2. Did the District Court lack jurisdiction and abuse its discretion in terminating Father\u2019s parental rights toA.S.?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">\u00b619 Father argues that the District Court \u201clacked the jurisdiction to order the termination of Father\u2019s parental rights as it did not make the statutory finding required by Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f)(ii) that the conduct [or] condition rendering Father unfit was unlikely to change within a reasonable amount of time.\u201d Father argues that this failure also violated his constitutional right to fundamentally fair procedures, including that each statutory element be supported by sufficient evidence, citing <em>In re B.N.Y., </em>2003 MT 241, 317 Mont. 291, 77 P.3d 189, and In <em>re Custody of M.W., </em>2001 MT 78, 305 Mont. 80, 23 P.3d 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">\u00b620 To the extent that Father frames his argument as a jurisdictional issue, we have recently clarified that a court\u2019s failure to follow statutory requirements in an abuse and neglect matter does not affect its subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See In re K.B., </em>2016 MT 73, \u00b6 12, 383 Mont. 85, 368 P.3d 722; <em>In re B.W.S., </em>2014 MT 198, \u00b6 13, 376 Mont. 43, 330 P.3d 467. Further, the case authority cited by Father concerned whether the subject children had been properly adjudicated as youths in need of care before custody could be awarded to the State, a threshold issue that is not present here. However, Father correctly notes that the District Court did not enter a finding stating that Father\u2019s conduct or condition rendering him unfit was unlikely to change within a reasonable time, as required by \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(f)(ii), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">\u00b621 The District Court determined that \u201c[cjlear and convincing evidence establishes that [Father\u2019s] Treatment Plan \u2018has not been successful\u2019 in <em>changing </em>the conduct and conditions that render him unfit as a parent.... [H]is <em>ongoing </em>entanglement with the criminal law renders him unfit and unable to give [A.S.] adequate parental care.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The court also determined that continuation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>parent-child relationship between Father and A.S. \u201cwill result in an <em>ongoing </em>risk of abuse or neglect to her.\u201d (Emphasis added.) While it would have been preferable for the District Court to enter an express finding that Father\u2019s condition rendering him an unfit parent was unlikely to change within a reasonable time, the court\u2019s determinations here clearly incorporated the recognition that Father\u2019s condition was continuing and would prevent him from being able to parent A.S. into the reasonable future. This case is appropriate for an implied finding that Father\u2019s conduct or condition rendering him unfit to parent was unlikely to change with a reasonable time, pursuant to the doctrine of implied findings. <em>See In re J.B., </em>2016 MT 68, \u00b6 25, 383 Mont. 48, 368 P.3d 715 (\u201cThis doctrine holds that where \u2018findings are general in terms, any findings not specifically made, but necessary to the determination, are deemed to have been implied, if supported by the evidence.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"Aiq\">\u00b622  Father anticipates our use of an implied finding and argues preemptively that the termination of his parental rights \u201ccannot stand even if the Court applies the doctrine of implied findings .... [T]he evidence presented by the Department does not support a finding that the conduct or condition rendering Father unfit was unlikely to change within a reasonable time.\u201d However, we disagree. Throughout this matter, the most notable fact about Father has been his perpetual absence. In the beginning, he was absent when the Department was looking for A.S., despite the fact she was supposed to be residing with Father. He was absent when A.S. was located at the home of his parents, who had heard nothing from Father, and who had regained A.S. when a woman contacted them. He was absent at the initial hearings in A.S.\u2019s case, and his attorney had no contact with him. His incarceration rendered him absent during periods when his treatment plan was in effect. He was absent during the termination hearing, when A.S.\u2019s guardian ad litem noted, \u201cno one is exactly clear where he is right now[.]\u201d Father had to be served twice by publication. Our previous holding regarding likelihood of change is just as applicable here: \u201cFather cannot benefit from his lack of involvement in this matter. The court may consider Father\u2019s past conduct to determine that Father\u2019s conduct likely would not change.\u201d <em>In re R.M.T., </em>2011 MT 164, \u00b6 38, 361 Mont. 159, 256 P.3d 935 <em>(citingIn re D.A., </em>2008 MT 247, \u00b6 23, 344 Mont. 513, 189 P.3d 631). Here, we can conclude from Father\u2019s past conduct, including his failure to complete his treatment plan, that it is likely that Father will continue to be absent, will be unable to change within the reasonable future, and will be unable to parent A.S. Based on this record, and the substantial evidence before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>the District Court, we conclude further that the court did not abuse its discretion in determining that termination of Father\u2019s rights was in A.S.\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">\u00b623 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b75-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES SHEA, WHEAT and BAKER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b68-8\"> Two cases, one for each child, were handled in parallel proceedings in the District Court, including a simultaneously-conducted termination hearing, and identical original orders were entered in each proceeding.
