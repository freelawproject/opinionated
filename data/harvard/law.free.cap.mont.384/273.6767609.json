We chronicled much of Joseph\u2019s and Lona\u2019s legal dispute, dating back to their 2003 divorce, in <em>In re Marriage of Carter-Scanlon, </em>2014 MT 97, 374 Mont. 434, 322 P.3d 1033, and need not repeat that history here.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">\u00b64 Joseph moved the District Court to modify his child support obligation on April 30,2015. The basis for Joseph\u2019s motion was that he had been determined to be \u201ca person with a most significant disability\u201d by Montana Vocational Rehabilitation (MVR), an agency of Montana\u2019s Department of Public Health and Human Services. Joseph asked the District Court to lower his monthly payments from $814 per month to $21.50 per month per child. The District Court held a hearing on the matter on October 21, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">\u00b65 At the hearing, Morgan Vincent, a vocational rehabilitation counselor with MVR, testified at length about Joseph\u2019s condition. Ms. Vincent works with individuals who have disabilities and assists them in returning to employment and living independently. Ms. Vincent testified Joseph had been designated a person with <em>\u201ca </em>most significant disability,\u201d which means he has a physical or mental impairment that constitutes or results in a substantial impediment to employment. Joseph and Ms. Vincent developed an employment plan for Joseph because, according to Ms. Vincent, Joseph was not able to do the work he had done in the past. The plan contemplated that Joseph would receive training to become an equine dentist. However, Ms. Vincent stated that Joseph needed surgery on his rotator cuffs, as well as neck surgery, and that the plan may need to be adjusted depending on the success of his surgeries. Ms. Vincent added that Joseph is \u201cwilling to pursue other employment if this career is not possible after he has undergone surgery,\u201d and that \u201c[depending on how [ Joseph\u2019s] treatment progresses, a vocational evaluation or training may be needed to either change his [employment plan] or progress towards his goal. These services will assist [Joseph], as his disabilities are currently changing, and help him with stability on his job.\u201d Joseph\u2019s physician did not testify, nor were Joseph\u2019s medical records submitted to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">\u00b66 The District Court heard testimony from forensic CPA Nicholas Bourdeau, who opined that Joseph\u2019s income was significantly higher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>than that reported on his tax returns. Bourdeau imputed Joseph\u2019s income in 2015 to be $73,000. The District Court received testimony that Joseph had recently competed in, and won, the National Finals Ski Joring horse race in Red Lodge. The District Court also received evidence that Joseph had a 25% ownership stake in a 300-lot subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">\u00b67 The District Court entered its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order denying Joseph\u2019s motion to modify child support. The District Court concluded there was a change in Joseph\u2019s circumstances \u201cthat significantly impacts his ability to pay $814 per month in child support,\u201d but went on to conclude that \u201cit does not appear that this condition is so substantial and continuing as to make the eventual payment of child support unconscionable.\u201d The District Court stayed Joseph\u2019s child support obligation for thirteen months, reasoning that \u201cto make [Joseph] currently pay this amount when faced with his impending medical expense and retraining period would make it inequitable ....\u201d After the stay of thirteen months, monthly child support would resume and Joseph would be required to pay off the child support accumulated during the stay over the next twelve months. Joseph appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">\u00b68 A district court\u2019s decision on modification of child support is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>In re Marriage of Wilson, </em>2009 MT 203, \u00b6 12, 351 Mont. 204, 210 P.3d 170. A trial court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or so exceeds the bounds of reason as to work a substantial injustice. <em>In re Kessler, </em>2011 MT 54, \u00b6 15, 359 Mont. 419, 251 P.3d 147. The district court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error, and its conclusions of law are reviewed for correctness. <em>In re Marriage of Damschen, </em>2011 MT 297, \u00b6 22, 363 Mont. 19, 265 P.3d 1245. Clear error exists if substantial credible evidence fails to support the findings of fact; if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence; or if the Supreme Court has a definite and firm conviction that the district court made a mistake. <em>Pastimes, LLC v. Clavin, </em>2012 MT 29, \u00b6 18, 364 Mont. 109, 274 P.3d 714.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">\u00b69 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it denied the motion to modify child support?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">f 10  A district court may modify maintenance or support \u201cupon a showing of changed circumstances so substantial and continuing as to make the terms unconscionable.\u201d Section 40-4-208(2)(b)(i), MCA. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>have interpreted this standard to mean that a finding of changed circumstances is a prerequisite to any inquiry into the unconscionability of a prior support award. <em>In re Marriage of Pearson, </em>1998 MT 236, \u00b6 41, 291 Mont. 101, 965 P.2d 268. If a change in circumstances is established, the District Court must then determine whether the change is circumstances is \u201cso substantial and continuing as to make the terms unconscionable.\u201d <em>Pearson, </em>\u00b6 41. There is no set definition of unconscionability; rather, determinations of unconscionability are made on a case-by-case scrutiny of the underlying facts. <em>Pearson, </em>\u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">\u00b611 Joseph argues that, given the District Court\u2019s determination that he is disabled, with no certainty that future surgeries will resolve his problems, it was \u201cunconscionable for the obligation to continue to accrue,\u201d and that the court\u2019s stay of support \u201cis an implicit finding that Joe\u2019s inability to pay support is continuing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">\u00b612 It should first be noted that the District Court did not enter specific findings of fact, but provided a narrative that summarized the evidence offered by both sides, with little that would be considered definitive findings from the evidence. As the trier of fact, a district court should evaluate the evidence, including its determinations about the evidence it has accepted and rejected after assessing credibility and weight, because an appellate court cannot make such assessments. Although noting Ms. Vincent\u2019s testimony about the impediment to Joseph\u2019s employability, the District Court also stated that \u201cthere are serious questions concerning Joseph\u2019s condition which continue to exist,\u201d citing Joseph\u2019s failure to provide medical evidence and his recent winning of a national finals ski joring competition, and reasoning \u201chis ability to perform such a feat does raise some suspicion as to his current claims.\u201d These expressions of doubt about Joseph\u2019s claims \u2014 which Joseph\u2019s arguments assume were resolved in his favor \u2014 actually fed into the District Court\u2019s numerated Conclusions of Law, wherein the District Court reiterated findings from the previous year\u2019s case that \u201cJoe is capable of earning $52,000 a year.\u201d Although concluding that Joseph had established \u201ca change of circumstances that significantly impacts his ability to pay $814 per month in child support,\u201d the court also concluded that this condition is temporary and not continuing, and therefore not unconscionable. Joseph argues that this conclusion of law was error because the District Court\u2019s determination that Joseph\u2019s change of circumstances was only temporary is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">\u00b613 A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence. <em>Clavin, </em>\u00b6 18. Substantial evidence is evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>even if weak and conflicting. <em>Siebken v. Voderberg, </em>2015 MT 296, \u00b6 12, 381 Mont. 256,359 P.3d 1073. It consists of more than a mere scintilla of evidence but may be less than a preponderance. <em>Marriage of Schmitz, </em>255 Mont. 159, 165, 841 P.2d 496, 500 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">\u00b614 Ms. Vincent testified that in order to be an equine dentist, Joseph would need rotator cuff surgery as well as neck surgery. Crucially, Ms. Vincent went on to testify that Joseph is \u201cwilling to pursue other employment if this career is not possible after he has undergone surgery,\u201d and that \u201c[depending on how [Joseph\u2019s] treatment progresses, a vocational evaluation or training may be needed to either change his [employment plan] or progress towards his goal. These services will assist [Joseph], as his disabilities are currently changing, and help him with stability on his job.\u201d Ms. Vincent\u2019s testimony established that even if Joseph cannot become an equine dentist due to unsuccessful surgery, Joseph will pursue other employment that he is physically capable of performing. Thus, according to Ms. Vincent, the outcome of Joseph\u2019s surgery affected his ability to become an equine dentist, not his ability to pursue employment in other occupations. This evidence is more than \u201ca mere scintilla\u201d that Joseph\u2019s change of circumstance is temporary.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">\u00b6 15  Furthermore, the District Court also noted in its order that the forensic CPA imputed Joseph\u2019s income at higher than stated in his tax returns for 2015, that Joseph had a 25% ownership stake in a 300 lot subdivision, and that he was able to compete in a horse racing competition. These findings support the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Joseph\u2019s change in circumstance did not render the child support \u201cunconscionable,\u201d because, according to the District Court, Joseph has other sources of income and is physically capable of performing certain jobs if he is physically capable of competing in a horse racing competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">\u00b616 The District Court\u2019s denial of Joseph\u2019s motion to modify his child support obligation was not an abuse of discretion. Although the denial of this motion may raise questions about the validity of the District Court\u2019s sua sponte stay of Joseph\u2019s child support obligation, Lona did not cross-appeal the issue. It is therefore not properly before us for review. <em>Gabriel v. Wood, </em>261 Mont. 170, 178, 862 P.2d 42, 47 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"A6SK\">\u00b617 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b303-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES SHEA, McKINNON and BAKER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
