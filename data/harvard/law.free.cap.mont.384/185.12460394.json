Woody and Lorraine Woody, as co-personal representatives of the Estate of Kenneth R. Woody IV, and on behalf of his heirs (the Estate), appeal the order of the Twenty-Second Judicial District Court, Big Horn County, granting Big Horn County\u2019s and Big Horn County Sheriff s Office\u2019s (collectively, the County) motion to dismiss. The Estate raises the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-10\">\n<em>Whether the District Court erred in determining that the Estate\u2019s complaint was barred by the statute of limitations.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-12\">\u00b62 We reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-13\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b212-14\">\u00b63 Kenneth R. Woody IV was killed on December 16, 2011, after the vehicle in which he was a passenger crashed near Hardin, Montana, following a high-speed chase by a Big Horn County Sheriffs deputy.</p>\n<p id=\"AiG\">\u00b64 On September 11,2014, the Estate submitted a claim letter to the County, seeking $750,000 from the County for wrongful death and survivorship damages related to Woody\u2019s death. The claim letter informed the County that it had 120 days from the date of the letter to resolve the claim \u201cwithout the necessity of litigation.\u201d The County Board of Commissioners acknowledged receipt of the letter on September 15, 2014, but never responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-15\">\u00b65 On March 3,2015, the Estate filed a complaint against the County in the District Court asserting negligence, survivorship, wrongful death, and negligent infliction of emotional distress. On March 18, 2015, the County filed a motion to dismiss under M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim, asserting that the Estate\u2019s claims were barred by the applicable three-year statute of limitations. The Estate objected to the motion, averring that its claim letter to the County had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>tolled the statute of limitations in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 2-9-301,2-9-302 and 27-2-209(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">\u00b66 The District Court held a hearing on the County\u2019s motion to dismiss on October 19, 2015. The parties argued opposing interpretations of the effect and applicability of \u00a7\u00a7 2-9-301 and 27-2-209(3), MCA. The Estate relied primarily on <em>Rouse v. Anaconda-Deer Lodge County, </em>250 Mont. 1, 817 P.2d 690 (1991), <em>overruled in part by Stratemeyer v. Lincoln County, </em>276 Mont. 67, 915 P.2d 175 (1996). The County relied primarily on <em>Stratemeyer. </em>On December 10, 2015, the court granted the County\u2019s motion to dismiss, concluding that the Estate\u2019s claims were time barred \u201cin accordance with the <em>Stratemeyer </em>holding.\u201d The Estate appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">\u00b67 We review de novo a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to dismiss under M. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). <em>Cowan v. Cowan, </em>2004 MT 97, \u00b6 10, 321 Mont. 13, 89 P.3d 6. Whether a district court correctly applied the statute of limitations is a question of law, also reviewed for correctness. <em>Momsen v. Momsen, </em>2006 MT 233, \u00b6 7, 333 Mont. 463, 143 P.3d 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">\u00b68 <em>Whether the District Court erred in determining that the Estate\u2019s complaint was barred by the statute of limitations.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">\u00b69 The statute of limitations for claims of negligence, wrongful death, survivorship, and negligent infliction of emotional distress is three years. Section 27-2-204, MCA. Generally, a claim accrues and the limitation period begins to run when all elements of the claim \u201cexist or have occurred.\u201d Section 27-2-102, MCA. The parties do not dispute the three-year limitations period and agree that this action accrued on December 16, 2011. An action commences upon the filing of the complaint. Section 27-2-102(l)(b), MCA. \u201cAll civil actions must be commenced within the periods prescribed in [Title 27, Chapter 2, Part 2, MCA,] except when another statute specifically provides a different limitation.\u201d Section 27-2-105, MCA. Claims against the State or a political subdivision are \u201csubject to the limitation of actions provided by law.\u201d Section 2-9-302, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-11\">\u00b610 Section 2-9-301, MCA, sets forth administrative claim requirements for actions against the State and political subdivisions. The County is a political subdivision as defined under \u00a7 2-9-101(5), MCA. A plaintiff making a claim against the State must first present the claim to the Montana Department of Administration before filing a complaint in a district court. Section 2-9-301(2), MCA. \u201cUpon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>department\u2019s receipt of the claim, the statute of limitations is tolled for 120 days.\u201d Section 2-9-301(2), MCA. Section 2-9-301, MCA, contains no tolling provision for claims against political subdivisions, but still requires that plaintiffs present and file such claims with the clerk or secretary of the political subdivision. Section 2-9-301(3), MCA. \u201cActions for claims against a county that have been rejected by the county commissioners must be commenced within 6 months after the first rejection.\u201d Section 27-2-209(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">\u00b611 The District Court interpreted and analyzed \u00a7\u00a7 2-9-301 and 27-2-209(3), MCA, and our decisions in <em>Rouse </em>and <em>Stratemeyer </em>to conclude that the Estate\u2019s claim letter to the County \u201cdid not toll the limitations period for the claims asserted in the Estate\u2019s [Complaint].\u201d With respect to \u00a7 2-9-301, MCA, the court noted that subsection (3) contains no requirement that a claim against a political subdivision be \u201cfirst presented\u201d to the government or that it be acted upon before a complaint can be filed. \u201cRather, \u00a7 2-9-301(3), MCA, merely requires that a claim be filed.\u201d The court noted further that unlike \u00a7 2-9-301(2), MCA\u2014which tolls the statute of limitations upon timely filing of a claim against the State\u2014subsection (3) of this statute \u201ccontains no such tolling provision related to claims made against political subdivisions.\u201d Similarly, with respect to \u00a7 27-2-209(3), MCA, the court found \u201cno indication in the statute that [the applicable] subsection lengthens the limitations period further than the general limitation period for a claim against a county.\u201d The court concluded further, \u201cRather than lengthening the limitation period, subsection (3) actually shortens the period... under appropriate circumstances.\u201d In any event, the court concluded, \u00a7 27-2-209(3), MCA, is not applicable to the facts of this case because \u201cthe County never denied the Estate\u2019s claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AnC3\">\u00b612 The court noted that the Estate\u2019s theory with respect to \u00a7\u00a7 2-9-301 and 27-2-209(3), MCA, \u201cmirrors\u201d this Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Rouse. </em>The court acknowledged that \u201c[u]nder the <em>Rouse </em>analysis, because the County never denied the Estate\u2019s claim, the Estate\u2019s [Complaint] would be timely filed.\u201d The court concluded, however, that in <em>Stratemeyer, </em>this Court \u201cacknowledged that its statutory interpretation in <em>Rouse </em>was not correct.\u201d According to the District Court, <em>Rouse </em>\u201cwas the product of the Montana Supreme Court\u2019s misinterpretation of \u00a7 2-9-301(3), MCA, which in turn resulted in the court finding an inherent unfairness in the statutory scheme\u2014an unfairness that does not exist under a correct reading of the statute.\u201d The court concluded further that because \u201cthe Estate was free to commence the instant action in district court on the same day it presented its claim to the County, or even prior,\u201d the September 11, 2014 letter \u201cdid not toll the limitations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">\u00b613 The Estate argues that the District Court erred in its interpretation and analysis of the applicable statutes and case law. The Estate contends that the decision in <em>Rouse </em>remains good law insofar as it held that under \u00a7\u00a7 2-9-302 and 27-2-209(3), MCA, \u201cthe initial period for claims against a county is tolled upon timely filing of the claim and the six month period of limitation for filing an action in district court does not begin to run until the claimant received notice of the county board\u2019s first denial of the claim.\u201d <em>Rouse, </em>250 Mont. at 6, 817 P.2d at 693. The Estate argues that \u201c[t]he only inconsistency\u201d between <em>Rouse </em>and <em>Stratemeyer </em>\u201cis that Section 2-9-301(3), MCA, does not require a claim against a county to be \u2018first presented\u2019 or that it be acted upon before a complaint can be filed.\u201d Therefore, according to the Estate, because it \u201ctimely filed its claim with the [County]\u201d and because the County \u201cnever denied the claim,\u201d the limitations period for the Estate\u2019s claims against the County \u201cwas tolled and the six month period of limitation for filing an action in district court did not begin to run because the Estate never received notice of the County\u2019s denial of the claim.\u201d The Estate claims that by first filing its claim with the County before filing a complaint, it acted in accordance with <em>Rouse, </em>the \u201clegislative mandate of Section 2-9-301(3), MCA,\u201d and in \u201cfurtherance of the public policy to prevent needless litigation and to save unnecessary litigation expenses by affording an opportunity to amicably adjust and settle all claims before suit is brought.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">\u00b614 The County argues that the plain language of \u00a7\u00a7 2-9-301(3) and 27-2-209(3), MCA, establish that \u201cno tolling of a statute of limitations exists when a claim is being made against a county.\u201d The County points out that while \u00a7 2-9-301(2), MCA, contains a specific tolling provision for claims against the State, \u00a7 2-9-301(3), MCA, contains no such provision for claims against a political subdivision. The County contends further that \u00a7 27-2-209(3), MCA, \u201cactually shortens the time frame in which to file a lawsuit against a county, if the county denies the claim.\u201d For example, according to the County, where a county receives a negligence claim after \u201cone year of the statute running, and the county immediately denies the claim, instead of having two years left in which to file the lawsuit, the plaintiff would have only 6 months left\u201d to file the complaint in district court. \u201c[T]he biggest difference between <em>Rouse, Stratemeyer, </em>and the case at hand,\u201d according to the County, \u201cis that in both cited cases, the plaintiff filed their lawsuit within the applicable period of limitations.... In the instant case, those facts do not exist.\u201d Finally, the County contends that the Estate\u2019s public policy argument is not enough to reverse the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>because \u201cthere exist\u00ed ] clearly established statutes of limitation that must be adhered to when filing a lawsuit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">\u00b615 In <em>Rouse, </em>we analyzed the application of \u00a7\u00a7 2-9-302 and 27-2-209(3), MCA, with respect to Rouse\u2019s claim against the county for assault and malicious prosecution. <em>Rouse, </em>250 Mont. at 4-6, 817 P.2d at 692-93. Rouse had filed his claim with the county approximately twenty-two months after the incident giving rise to his claims and the county never responded. <em>Rouse, </em>250 Mont. at 4, 817 P.2d at 692. Rouse then filed a complaint in the district court nearly three years after the incident. The district court held that Rouse\u2019s claims were time-barred by a two-year statute of limitations. On appeal Rouse argued that under \u00a7 27-2-209(3), MCA, \u201cbecause the county ha[d] yet to reject his claims, the six month statute ha[d] not begun to run against him.\u201d <em>Rouse, </em>250 Mont. at 3, 817 P.2d at 691. We reversed the district court\u2019s holding, noting that \u201cafter Rouse filed his timely claim with the County, the County had notice of pending claims against it and also controlled the commencement of the six month limitation period.\u201d <em>Rouse, </em>250 Mont. at 6, 817 P.2d at 693. We concluded, \u201cIt would be inherently unfair to require Rouse to file a timely claim against the County before filing an action in District Court and then to penalize him for the County\u2019s failure to act, or stalling on the claim.\u201d <em>Rouse, </em>250 Mont. at 6, 817 P.2d at 693. We held that Rouse\u2019s claims against the county were not barred because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\">under \u00a7\u00a7 2-9-302 and 27-2-209(3), MCA, the initial period of limitation for claims against a county is tolled upon timely filing of the claim and the six month period of limitation for filing an action in district court does not begin to run until the claimant receives notice of the county board\u2019s first denial of the claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ar6\"><em>Rouse, </em>250 Mont. at 6, 817 P.2d at 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">\u00b616 In <em>Stratemeyer, </em>an officer with a county sheriff s department filed a tort claim in a district court against the county for failure to train, counsel, or debrief him after he witnessed the aftermath of a suicide while on the job. <em>Stratemeyer, </em>276 Mont. at 70, 915 P.2d at 176. The district court dismissed the officer\u2019s tort claim, determining that although he had filed the complaint within the three-year statute of limitations, his claim was barred because he failed to first file it with the county \u201cas required by \u00a7 2-9-301, MCA.\u201d <em>Stratemeyer, </em>276 Mont. at 71, 915 P.2d at 177. On appeal, the county relied on <em>Rouse </em>to assert that \u00a7 2-9-301(3), MCA, required a plaintiff to first file a claim against the entity before proceeding in district court. <em>Stratemeyer, </em>276 Mont. at 73, 915 P.2d at 178. We noted that the language in <em>Rouse </em>on which the county relied \u201cis dicta\u201d but also acknowledged that in <em>Rouse </em>we had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>\u201cinexplicably read the \u2018first file\u2019 requirement\u201d into \u00a7 2-9-301(3), MCA, which \u201cviolates ... our rules for statutory construction.\u201d <em>Stratemeyer, </em>276 Mont. at 73, 915 P.2d at 178. Thus, we rejected \u201cour broad statement in <em>Rouse </em>which would require a claimant to \u2018first file\u2019 his claim with the political subdivision before proceeding in district court.\u201d <em>Stratemeyer, </em>276 Mont. at 73, 915 P.2d at 178-79. We concluded instead that \u00a7 2-9-301(3), MCA, \u201cmerely requires that a claim be filed, it does not require that it be \u2018first presented\u2019 or that it be acted upon before a complaint can be filed.\u201d <em>Stratemeyer, </em>276 Mont. at 74, 915 P.2d at 179. Consequently, we reversed the district court and overruled <em>Rouse </em>\u201cto the extent that [it] expresses an opinion inconsistent with our analysis in the instant case.\u201d <em>Stratemeyer, </em>276 Mont. at 74, 915 P.2d at 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">\u00b617 The Estate\u2019s reading of <em>Rouse </em>and <em>Stratemeyer </em>is accurate. <em>Stratemeyer </em>overruled <em>Rouse </em>only with respect to interpretation of \u00a7 2-9-301(3), MCA. <em>Stratemeyer, </em>276 Mont. at 73-74, 915 P.2d at 178-79. Section 27-2-209(3), MCA, which contains the language held in <em>Rouse </em>to toll the limitations period, was not applicable in <em>Stratemeyer </em>and was never analyzed, discussed, or even mentioned in that case. We stated explicitly in <em>Stratemeyer </em>that the overruled statement in <em>Rouse </em>was \u201cdicta\u201d and was \u201cnot related to our holding in <em>Rouse.\u201d Stratemeyer, </em>276 Mont. at 73, 915 P.2d at 178. Accordingly, <em>Stratemeyer </em>overruled <em>Rouse </em>only to the extent that it required a plaintiff to first file a claim with a political subdivision before proceeding in district court under \u00a7 2-9-301(3), MCA. The rest of the <em>Rouse </em>decision, therefore, remained good law after <em>Stratemeyer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Au8\">\u00b618  <em>Rouse </em>establishes that under \u00a7\u00a7 2-9-302 and 27-2-209(3), MCA, when a plaintiff timely files a claim against a county, the period of limitations is tolled and the six month limitation period for filing in district court does not begin to run until the claimant receives notice of the county\u2019s denial of the claim. <em>Rouse, </em>250 Mont. at 6, 817 P.2d at 693. As noted, claims against political subdivisions are subject to the limitation of actions provided by law. Section 2-9-302, MCA. We are reluctant to conclude, absent plain language in the statutes, <em>see Bates v. Neva, </em>2014 MT 336, \u00b6 26, 377 Mont. 350, 339 P.3d 1265, that the six-month period under \u00a7 27-2-209(3), MCA, may shorten the original limitations period but not lengthen it. Among other things, \u201cstatutes of limitation serve the purpose of ensuring \u2018basic fairness\u2019 to parties.\u201d <em>Burley v. Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co., </em>2012 MT 28, \u00b6 16, 364 Mont. 77, 273 P.3d 825. We observed in <em>Rouse </em>that such an application of the six-month provision \u201cdoes not unduly lengthen\u201d the limitation period, particularly because the political subdivision retains control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>against stale claims by responding to a plaintiff s administrative filing. <em>Rouse, </em>250 Mont. at 6, 817 P.2d at 692 (citing <em>Gutter v. Seamandel, </em>308 N.W.2d 403, 414 (Wis. 1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"AA5\">\u00b619  <em>Rouse </em>is squarely on point with the facts in this case and it was reasonable for the Estate to rely on it. The original three-year limitations period for the Estate\u2019s claim would have run on December 16, 2014. On September 11, 2014, the Estate presented its claim with the County pursuant to \u00a7 2-9-301(3), MCA. The County acknowledged that it received the claim; it thus \u201chad notice of pending claims against it and also controlled the commencement of the six month limitation period.\u201d <em>Rouse, </em>250 Mont. at 6, 817 P.2d at 693. Under <em>Rouse, </em>upon the filing of the claim the period of limitations was tolled until the Estate received notice of the County\u2019s denial of the claim, at which point the Estate would have had six months from the date of denial to file a complaint. <em>Rouse, </em>250 Mont. at 6, 817 P.2d at 693. Like in <em>Rouse, </em>the County never denied or responded otherwise to the Estate\u2019s claim. Therefore, the original limitation period was tolled and the six-month limitation period never began. <em>Rouse, </em>250 Mont. at 6, 817 P.2d at 693. The Estate\u2019s complaint was timely filed. Indeed, the Estate commenced its action within six months of the date it presented its claim to the County. The District Court erred in concluding that the Estate failed to file its complaint within the applicable limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">\u00b620 As a final matter, we decline to revisit <em>Rouse </em>in this case. The principal of <em>stare decisis </em>applies strongly when interpreting statutes; once the Court has placed a construction on statutory language, the Court prefers to \u201cleav[e] it to the legislature to amend the law should a change be deemed necessary.\u2019\u2019 <em>Bottomly v. Ford, </em>117 Mont. 160, 168, 157 P.2d 108, 112 (1945). The Legislature has let stand this Court\u2019s initial construction of \u00a7 27-2-209(3), MCA, and it has become the law. <em>Musselshell Ranch Co. v. Seidel-Joukova, </em>2011 MT 217, \u00b6 14, 362 Mont. 1, 261 P.3d 570. As such, we defer to the Legislature to clarify the statute if the Court\u2019s interpretation of its language is not what the Legislature intends. <em>Bottomly, </em>117 Mont. at 168, 157 P.2d at 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">\u00b621 For the foregoing reasons we conclude that the District Court erred in dismissing the Estate\u2019s complaint on the basis that it was time-barred. We reverse the court\u2019s order granting the County\u2019s motion to dismiss and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<judges id=\"b218-9\">JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT, SHEA and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
